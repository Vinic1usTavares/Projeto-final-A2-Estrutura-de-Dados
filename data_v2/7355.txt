emilio gino segre 1 february 1905 22 april 1989 was an italian american physicist and nobel laureate who discovered elements technetium and astatine and antiproton a subatomic antiparticle for which he was awarded nobel prize in physics in 1959 from 1943 to 1946 he worked at los alamos national laboratory as a group leader for manhattan project he found in april 1944 that thin man proposed plutonium gun type nuclear weapon would not work because of presence of plutonium 240 impurities born in tivoli near rome segre studied engineering at university of rome la sapienza before taking up physics in 1927 segre was appointed assistant professor of physics at university of rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936 becoming one of via panisperna boys from 1936 to 1938 he was director of physics laboratory at university of palermo after a visit to ernest o lawrence s berkeley radiation laboratory he was sent a molybdenum strip from laboratory s cyclotron deflector in 1937 which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity after careful chemical and theoretical analysis segre was able to prove that some of radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element named technetium which was first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature in 1938 benito mussolini s fascist government passed anti semitic laws barring jews from university positions as a jew segre was now rendered an indefinite emigre at berkeley radiation lab lawrence offered him a job as a research assistant while at berkeley segre helped discover element astatine and isotope plutonium 239 which was later used to make fat man nuclear bomb dropped on nagasaki in 1944 he became a naturalized citizen of united states on his return to berkeley in 1946 he became a professor of physics and of history of science serving until 1972 segre and owen chamberlain were co heads of a research group at lawrence radiation laboratory that discovered antiproton for which two shared 1959 nobel prize in physics segre was also active as a photographer and took many photographs documenting events and people in history of modern science which were donated to american institute of physics after his death american institute of physics named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor early life emilio gino segre was born into a sephardic jewish family in tivoli near rome on 1 february 1905 son of giuseppe segre a businessman who owned a paper mill and amelia susanna treves he had two older brothers angelo and marco his uncle gino segre was a law professor he was educated at ginnasio in tivoli and after family moved to rome in 1917 ginnasio and liceo in rome he graduated in july 1922 and enrolled in university of rome la sapienza as an engineering student in 1927 segre met franco rasetti who introduced him to enrico fermi two young physics professors were looking for talented students they attended volta conference at como in september 1927 where segre heard lectures from notable physicists including niels bohr werner heisenberg robert millikan wolfgang pauli max planck and ernest rutherford segre then joined fermi and rasetti at their laboratory in rome with help of director of institute of physics orso mario corbino segre was able to transfer to physics and studying under fermi earned his laurea degree in july 1928 with a thesis on anomalous dispersion and magnetic rotation after a stint in italian army from 1928 to 1929 during which he was a commissioned as a second lieutenant in antiaircraft artillery segre returned to laboratory on via panisperna he published his first article which summarised his thesis on anomalous dispersion in mercury and in lithium jointly with edoardo amaldi in 1928 and another article with him following year on raman effect in 1930 segre began studying zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals when his progress stalled because diffraction grating he required to continue was not available in italy he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from pieter zeeman to finish his work at zeeman s laboratory in amsterdam segre was awarded a rockefeller foundation fellowship and on fermi s advice elected to use it to study under otto stern in hamburg working with otto frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with current theory but isidor isaac rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if nuclear spin of potassium was 1 2 physics professor segre was appointed assistant professor of physics at university of rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936 becoming one of via panisperna boys in 1934 he met elfriede spiro a jewish woman whose family had come from in west prussia but had fled to breslau when that part of prussia became part of poland after world war i after nazi party came to power in germany in 1933 she had emigrated to italy where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter at first she did not speak italian well and segre and spiro conversed in german in which he was fluent two were married at great synagogue of rome on 2 february 1936 he agreed with rabbi to spend minimal amount on wedding giving balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to jewish refugees from germany rabbi managed to give them many of trappings of a luxury wedding anyway couple had three children claudio born in 1937 amelia gertrude allegra born in 1937 and fausta irene born in 1945 thumb right via panisperna boys in courtyard of rome university s physics institute in

institute at university of palermo he found equipment there primitive and library bereft of modern physics literature but his colleagues at palermo included mathematicians michele and michele de mineralogist carlo perrier and botanist in 1936 he paid a visit to ernest o lawrence s berkeley radiation laboratory where he met edwin mcmillan donald cooksey franz kurie philip abelson and robert oppenheimer segre was intrigued by radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of laboratory s cyclotron in palermo this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes in february 1937 lawrence sent him a molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity segre enlisted perrier s help to subject strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis and they were able to prove that some of radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element in 1947 they named it technetium as it was first artificially synthesized chemical element radiation laboratory in june 1938 segre paid a summer visit to california to study short lived isotopes of technetium which did not survive being mailed to italy while segre was en route benito mussolini s fascist government passed racial laws barring jews from university positions as a jew segre was now rendered an indefinite emigre czechoslovakian crisis prompted segre to send for elfriede and claudio as he now feared that war in europe was inevitable in november 1938 and february 1939 they made quick trips to mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa both segre and elfriede held grave fears for fate of their parents in italy and germany at berkeley radiation lab lawrence offered segre a job as a research assistant a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element for a month for six months when lawrence learned that segre was legally trapped in california he reduced segre s salary to 116 a month working with glenn seaborg segre isolated metastable isotope technetium 99m its properties made it ideal for use in nuclear medicine and it is now used in about 10 million medical diagnostic procedures annually segre went looking for element 93 but did not find it as he was looking for an element chemically akin to rhenium instead of a rare earth element which is what element 93 was working with alexander jr and chien shiung wu he discovered xenon 135 which later became important as a nuclear poison in nuclear reactors segre then turned his attention to another missing element on periodic table element 85 after he announced how he intended to create it by bombarding bismuth 209 with alpha particles at a monday meeting radiation laboratory meeting two of his colleagues dale r corson and robert a cornog carried out his proposed experiment segre then asked whether he could do chemistry and with kenneth ross mackenzie successfully isolated new element which is today called astatine segre and wu then attempted to find last remaining missing non transuranic element element 61 they had correct technique for making it but lacked chemical methods to separate it he also worked with seaborg mcmillan joseph w kennedy and arthur c wahl to create plutonium 239 in lawrence s cyclotron in december 1940 manhattan project thumb right segre s id badge photo from los alamos japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 and subsequent united states declaration of war upon italy rendered segre an enemy alien and cut him off from communication with his parents physicists began leaving radiation laboratory to do war work and raymond t birge asked him to teach classes to remaining students this provided a useful supplement to segre s income and he established important friendships and professional associations with some of these students who included owen chamberlain and clyde wiegand in late 1942 oppenheimer asked segre to join manhattan project at its los alamos laboratory segre became head of laboratory s p 5 radioactivity group which formed part of robert bacher s p experimental physics division for security reasons he was given cover name of earl seaman he moved to los alamos with his family in june 1943 segre s group set up its equipment in a disused forest service cabin in pajarito canyon near los alamos in august 1943 his group s task was to measure and catalog radioactivity of various fission products an important line of research was determining degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium initially tests using mass spectrometry used by columbia university and neutron assay used by berkeley gave different results segre studied berkeley s results and could find no error while kenneth bainbridge likewise found no fault with new york s however analysis of another sample showed close agreement higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at los alamos which segre s group concluded were due to cosmic rays which were more prevalent at los alamos due to its high altitude group measured activity of thorium uranium 234 uranium 235 and uranium 238 but only had access to microgram quantities of plutonium 239 first sample plutonium produced in nuclear reactor at oak ridge was received in april 1944 within days group observed five times rate of spontaneous fission as with cyclotron produced plutonium this was not news that leaders of project wanted to hear it meant that thin man proposed plutonium gun type nuclear weapon would not work and implied that project s investment in plutonium production facilities at hanford site was wasted segre s group carefully checked their results and concluded that increased activity was due to plutonium 240 isotope in june 1944 segre was summoned into oppenheimer s office and informed that while his father was safe his mother had been rounded up by nazis in october 1943 segre never saw either of his parents again his father died in rome in october 1944 in late 1944 segre and elfriede became naturalized citizens of united states his group now designated r 4 was given responsibility for measuring gamma radiation from trinity nuclear test in july 1945 blast damaged or destroyed most of experiments but enough data was recovered to measure gamma rays later life in august 1945 a few days before surrender of japan and end of world war ii segre received an offer from washington university in st louis of an associate professorship with a salary of following month university of chicago also made him an offer after some prompting birge offered 6 500 and a full professorship which segre decided to accept he left los alamos in january 1946 and returned to berkeley in late 1940s many academics left university of california lured away by higher salary offers and by university s peculiar loyalty oath requirement segre chose to take oath and stay but this did not allay suspicions about his loyalty luis alvarez was incensed that amaldi fermi pontecorvo rasetti and segre had chosen to pursue patent claims against united states for their pre war discoveries and told segre to let him know when pontecorvo wrote from russia he also clashed with lawrence over latter s plan to create a rival nuclear weapons laboratory to los alamos in livermore california in order to develop hydrogen bomb a weapon that segre felt would be of dubious utility unhappy with his deteriorating relationships with his colleagues and with poisonous political atmosphere at berkeley caused by loyalty oath controversy segre accepted a job offer from university of illinois at urbana champaign courts ultimately resolved patent claims in italian scientists favour in 1953 awarding them for patents related to generating neutrons which worked out to about 20 000 after legal costs kennedy seaborg wahl and segre were subsequently awarded same amount for their discovery of plutonium which came to 100 000 after being divided four ways there being no legal fees this time after turning down offers from ibm and brookhaven national laboratory segre returned to berkeley in 1952 he moved his family from berkeley to nearby lafayette california in 1955 working with chamberlain and others he began searching for antiproton a subatomic antiparticle of proton antiparticle of electron positron had been predicted by paul dirac in 1931 and then discovered by carl d anderson in 1932 by analogy it was now expected that there would be an antiparticle corresponding to proton but no one had found one and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that it existed using lawrence s bevatron set to 6 gev they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons chamberlain and segre were awarded 1959 nobel prize in physics for their discovery this was controversial because clyde wiegand and thomas ypsilantis were co authors of same article but did not share prize segre served on university s powerful budget committee from 1961 to 1965 and was chairman of physics department from 1965 to 1966 he supported teller s successful bid to separate lawrence berkeley laboratory from lawrence livermore laboratory in 1970 he was one of trustees of fermilab from 1965 to 1968 he attended its inauguration with laura fermi in 1974 during 1950s segre edited fermi s papers he later published a biography of fermi enrico fermi physicist 1970 he published his own lecture notes as from x rays to quarks modern physicists and their discoveries 1980 and from falling bodies to radio waves classical physicists and their discoveries 1984 he also edited annual review of nuclear and particle science from 1958 to 1977 and wrote an autobiography a mind always in motion 1993 which was published posthumously elfriede died in october 1970 and segre married rosa mines in february 1972 that year he reached university of california s compulsory retirement age he continued teaching history of physics in 1974 he returned to university of rome as a professor but served only a year before reaching mandatory retirement age segre died from a heart attack at age of 84 while out walking near his home in lafayette active as a photographer segre took many photos documenting events and people in history of modern science after his death rosa donated many of his photographs to american institute of physics which named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor collection was bolstered by a subsequent bequest from rosa
