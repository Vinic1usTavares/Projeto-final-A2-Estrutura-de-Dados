merseyrail units may improve business case services summary history in coaching days preston was an important centre for both passenger and postal traffic this importance continued into railway age both as a major junction and as a stopping point about halfway between london and glasgow lawrence p 136 preston s railways first rail lines in preston were those of lancaster canal tramroad a horse drawn line connecting two parts of lancaster canal it opened in 1805 but never carried passengers and never converted to steam it ceased operating in preston in 1862 greville holt 1 pp 97 98 first steam hauled passenger railway in preston was north union railway nur on 31 october 1838 it opened its line from wigan to a station on site of present day preston station greville holt 1 p 95 this immediately linked town to london birmingham liverpool and manchester each subsequent line was built by a different company rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities and so almost every railway line into preston used its own station it was not until 1900 that all lines in preston shared a single station by which time all companies had been taken over by one or both of just two companies second passenger railway into preston was preston and longridge railway which opened as another horse drawn tramway on 1 may 1840 to a terminus in greville holt 2 p 198 it converted to steam in 1848 but did not run its trains into north union station until 1885 greville holt 2 pp 200 201 thumb upright 1 25 railways around preston in 1913 thumb upright memorial tablet to preston pals at preston railway station who departed here for war in 1914 lancaster and preston junction railway l pjr was third line which opened on 25 june 1840 greville holt 1 p 96 initially using north union station however relations between nur and l pjr soured and from 1 january 1842 most l pjr trains used instead maxwell house railway station a short distance to north of north union station a few trains passed through but nur charged a toll of 6d per passenger most passengers refused to pay preferring to alight at maxwell house and walk to north union station but nur refused to hold train to allow passengers to walk and nur advised northbound passengers to travel by lancaster canal rather than l pjr on 1 january 1844 maxwell house station came into possession of nur and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless l pjr passengers had to alight on trackside at nearby dock street off pitt street lancaster trains were able to use north union station from 12 february greville holt 1 p 99 preston s fourth railway was preston and wyre joint railway to fleetwood opening just a few weeks after l pjr on 16 july 1840 to its own terminus at in leighton street after 12 february 1844 regular preston and wyre trains used north union station along with l pjr although station continued to be used for excursions for some decades fifth company to run trains into preston was bolton and preston railway bpr from 22 june 1843 its line joined north union s at euxton south of preston but company used maxwell house station instead of north union s however nur charged 1s per passenger to bpr trains over its tracks and eventually bpr resorted to ferrying its passengers by road between euxton and preston bpr was driven into submission and was taken over by nur from 1 january 1844 sixth line into preston was that of preston and blackburn railway which opened on 1 june 1846 joining north union line immediately south of farrington station farington from october 1857 railway company was absorbed into east lancashire railway elr on 3 august 1846 greville holt 1 pp 99 100 once again nur charged high tolls for use of its line which led elr to build its own line into preston line was initially opposed by preston corporation but was eventually permitted on condition that embankment north of ribble which later became dividing line between avenham and miller parks be ornamentally laid out and that a pedestrian path still in use today be provided on river bridge line ran into new platforms built on east side of north union station which were managed and staffed by elr and which had their own booking hall and entrance in butler street new platforms were effectively a separate station greville holt 1 p p 59 new line and station opened on 2 september 1850 greville holt 2 p 197 seventh line in preston was north union s own victoria quay branch to victoria quay on river ribble later extended to preston docks in 1882 and which now connects to heritage ribble steam railway greville holt 2 p 203 single track goods line opened in october 1846 from a south facing junction immediately south of preston station through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29 emerging north of fishergate hill near riverside greville holt 1 p 100 eighth line to preston was liverpool ormskirk and preston railway owned by elr and connected to its blackburn line into preston it opened on 2 april 1849 from 1891 its trains used a new curve at farington to enter preston via north union line ninth and final line into preston was west lancashire railway wlr from southport railway arrived in preston on 16 september 1882 by which time all town s other lines were owned by london and north western railway lnwr or lancashire and yorkshire railway lyr or jointly by both independent wlr built its own fishergate hill station it also built a connecting line to former elr then lyr line via which majority of southport to preston trains continued to railway was not a success and on 1 july 1897 it was taken over by lyr this resulted in diversion of all passenger services to use east lancashire platforms of preston station from 16 july 1900 greville holt 2 pp 201 202 network of lines south of preston allowed great flexibility in routing of trains a train approaching town on any of lines from south except wlr from southport could be routed to enter station via either north union or east lancashire line it was even possible for trains from north to perform an effective u turn a feat sometimes carried out by trains between scotland and blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse station development thumb layout of station until 1850 when station was first opened in 1838 by north union railway line north of station passed through a tunnel under west end of fishergate then preston s major thoroughfare it was on a slope so steep that sometimes station staff had to push trains out of station by 1846 station was already very busy handling trains from wigan and south bolton fleetwood blackpool lancaster and north and blackburn there were no footbridges passengers had to cross lines escorted by station staff greville holt 3 pp 274 275 north of station was a network of goods lines around end of lancaster canal coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after canal had fallen into commercial disuse station s first expansion came in 1850 when new east lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by east lancashire railway with their own entrance and booking office in butler street from 1863 trains between london and scotland having no dining cars were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at preston for passengers to eat in station s dining room greville holt 3 p 277 pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about same time lawrence p 142 condition of station deteriorated to extent that on 18 august 1866 part of roof on east lancashire side collapsed injuring three people one seriously by then 150 trains a day passed through station eventually station was rebuilt at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds reopening in july 1880 and with seven through platforms and four bay platforms at this time both ribble bridge and line as far as euxton were widened from two tracks to four greville holt 3 p p 337 a striking feature of new station was its long and wide central island platform long and wide it was larger than any of london terminal station platforms longest being kings cross at along centre of platform were refreshment rooms offices and waiting rooms a booking hall at north end of station was accessed from middle of a new bridge carrying fishergate over railway a broad ramp led down to main island platform with footbridges to smaller platforms on either side further south platforms were also linked by a passenger subway and a separate subway for luggage accessed via hoists lawrence p 139 at south end of main platform a footbridge led to nearby park hotel a joint lyr lnwr property opened in 1883 gairns p p 63 on 30 january 1877 a heavy storm blew roof completely away from station but a more serious accident occurred on 13 july 1896 when a to glasgow train passed through station at an estimated despite a speed limit it was derailed on a tight curve at north end of station killing one person lawrence p 140 as a result of this tracks were realigned charles street to west of station was demolished as were more houses northwest of station fishergate bridge was extended on its west side this allowed more tracks and platforms to be built on west side of station with gentler curves ribble bridge was widened again from four to six tracks these enlargements were completed by 1903 lawrence p 141 east side of station was also extended in 1913 rush p 7 thumb upright 1 25 layout of station in 1926 by 1926 lines and platforms were used as follows from west to east southwest of station was christian road goods
