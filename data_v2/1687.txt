town and landscape enclosed garden illusionistic carvings of adam and eve on arms of mary s throne and attributes of st luke are amongst painting s many iconographic symbols van der weyden was strongly influenced by jan van eyck and painting is very similar to earlier madonna of chancellor rolin usually dated to around 1434 with significant differences figure s positioning and colourisation

looking out over river were smaller river itself narrower self portrait luke s face is widely considered to be a van der weyden self portrait he may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint

own depictions of luke brush 1994 19 what biographical details are available place artist as a devout catholic deeply influenced by mystical and devotional texts familiar with 12th and 13th century female theologians such as mechthild of magdeburg and hildegard of bingen apostolos cappadona 1997 8 they believed that contemplating devotional images whilst meditating might lead to a vision or a state of ecstasy it is possible from these teachings that van der weyden developed a set of devotional motifs such as magdalen reading importance of st luke in christian art is underscored in st luke painting virgin while affirming role of art within context of meditation and contemplation apostolos cappadona 1997 9 10 self portraiture achieves a number of purposes it acts as a tribute to his own ability as a measure of his skill against van eyck and as a case for legitimacy of craft of painting by portraying himself as st luke in act of drawing rather than painting de vries believes van der weyden reveals an artistic consciousness by commenting upon artistic traditions and by doing so presents a visual argument for role and function of artist and his art one at that time still predominantly religiously defined smith describes panel as an exposition of art of painting observing that van der weyden records essential skills any successful artist should master while claiming to be an heir to st luke he works in silverpoint and thus is unencumbered with paraphernalia of painting an easel seat or other items which might clutter composition or more importantly place a physical barrier between divine and earthly realms nash 2008 158 iconography 200px thumb van der weyden s small virgin and child enthroned c 1430 1432 museo thyssen bornemisza painting is rich in both actual and implied iconography van der weyden presents mary as maria lactans virgin type a symbol of mother church especially popular at times of plague or famine implication being that she cares for all and no one will go hungry this notion ties in with luke s dual roles of physician and thus healer and artist apostolos cappadona 1997 10 van der weyden had earlier portrayed mary breast feeding in his virgin and child enthroned which depicts equally detailed carvings carrying significance but is reduced in size and in its cast of characters and omits act of apostolos cappadona 1997 11 architecture of enclosed space suggests a church virgin sits beneath a canopy perhaps symbolic of sacred space and spatial separation between celebrant and congregation usually by a rood screen small room to right could symbolize vesting chamber arms of her throne are painted as carved with figures including adam eve and serpent before fall from paradise room faces towards an enclosed garden another emblem of

rather than in van eyck s painting where as blum describes a divinity and a mortal face one another van der weyden omits winged angel holding a crown hovering above virgin figure was included in underdrawings but eventually abandoned landscape is more secular than van eyck s which is dominated by church spires blum 1977 105 in late 13th century many of newly emerging painter s guilds were nominating luke as their patron saint van der weyden panel is among first known depictions of st luke painting virgin in northern renaissance art hornik parsons 2003 16 7 along with a similar work a lost triptych panel by robert campin van der weyden presents a humanised virgin and child as suggested by realistic contemporary surroundings lack of halos and intimate spatial construction yet he infuses panel with extensive religious iconography attribution and dating during 19th century painting was at times associated with quentin and hugo van der goes in early 1930s based on x radiographs art historian alan burroughs attributed boston painting to dieric bouts under supervision of van der weyden macbeth spronk 1997 108 he later revised his opinion to van der weyden but art historians remained unsure as to which of four panel versions was original or prime version and which were copies eisler 1961 73 4 infrared reflectography has revealed underdrawing in boston version which contains heavy redrafting and re working this is absent in other versions strong evidence boston panel is prime spronk 1996 26 approach to underdrawing is very similar to paintings where attribution to van der weyden is established such as descent from cross in madrid and miraflores altarpiece in berlin they are built up with brush and ink with most attention given to outlines of figures and draperies hatching is used to indicate areas of deep shadow in each underdrawing is a working sketch subject to constant revisions which continued even after painting had begun ishikawa 1990 51 drawing of mary is similar to louvre s silverpoint drawing of 1464 attributed to his circle both are of a type van der weyden was preoccupied with showing an ongoing refinement and emphasis on mary s youthfulness which is traceable throughout his work art historians gradually revised their dating from 1450 to currently accepted 1435 40 earlier in artist s career this estimate is based on three factors dating of rolin madonna van der weyden s opportunity of viewing that panel and his ability to produce his own work after such a viewing he is known to have visited brussels where van eyck kept his studio in 1432 and again 1435 erwin panofsky suggested c 1434 as earliest possible date and that rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434 julius held was sceptical of this early dating noting that if true we are forced to assume that within one year of jan s work rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt jan s compositional pattern while subjecting it at same time to a very thorough and highly personal transformation and all this in bruges under jan s very eyes held 1955 225 held as a lone voice and writing in 1955 argues for a date between 1440 and 1443 seeing work as more advanced than other paintings by artist from mid 1430s and believes it contains considerable differences when compared to other early works especially annunciation triptych of c 1434 he further observes that although painting became highly influential copies did not appear until mid century held 1955 226 dendrochronological examination of growth rings in panel s wood suggests that timber was felled around 1410 in 15th century wood was typically stored for around 20 years before use in panel painting giving an earliest date in mid to late 1430s analysis of munich version places it in 1480s around 20 years after van der weyden s death ishikawa 1990 58 panel in bruges is in best condition and of exceptional quality but dates from c 1491 1510 van anne after rogier van der

paintings philip henry described painting as an original van der weyden but gave opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of attribution on this basis it was sent to germany in 1932 to undergo conservation effort was led by restorer helmut ruhemann who described panel as structurally sound and removed layers of discoloured varnish and crude overpainting while filling in some areas of paint loss ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th century restorations one of which was probably that carried out in boston in 1893 ruhemann s cleaning and restoration was widely praised and contributed to acceptance of panel as original by van der weyden macbeth spronk 1997 105 6 mfa undertook a third restoration in 1943 when some yellowing of glaze was repaired macbeth spronk 1997 107 8 most recently painting was cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed some losses were filled in and a light coat of varnish was applied influence thumb 160px master of legend of st ursula virgin and child late 15th century if painting was in guild of saint luke s chapel in brussels then many near contemporary artists would have been able to

valladolid and barcelona hand et al 2006 265 this reflects its quality and fact that he presents an ideal image of an artist as a self portrait legitimising and elevating trade also influential was his madonna type which he used again for c 1450 diptych of jean de gros that painting features a virgin and child wing directly modelled on his st luke panel extending devotional aspect to include a
