regards writing sweet dreams with knowles as experience of a lifetime when knowles went to south beat studios in miami beach florida she was not prepared to record and had to attend opening concert of

after it was recorded in march 2008 eight months before album s release it was first time that a single by knowles was leaked before its inclusion on an upcoming album she responded to leak on her official website thanking her fans for positive response towards song before clarifying that it was just a work in progress and that she did not intend to release new material in near future about leak love told mtv news i was more concerned that beyonce would feel that we did it a lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if you put song out there it would go on to become a hit usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from final track list it was frustrating i felt like you work hard to get in studio to work with beyonce but i was blessed that song turned out to have nine lives under song s original title beautiful nightmare sweet dreams gained some attention in united states where it amassed enough airplay to chart at number forty five on hot dance club songs chart and at number fifty seven on pop 100 airplay chart broken hearted girl was initially intended as sixth us and fourth international single alongside stateside only single ego 2009 however its release was scrapped at last minute and replaced by sweet dreams which knowles selected for a summer single release because

critics noted that several components of sweet dreams are reminiscent of songs on michael jackson s 1982 album thriller james montgomery of mtv news said that gnarly low end sounds like jackson s song beat it 1983 nick levine of digital spy noted that electronic bassline is similar to those used in jackson s songs thriller 1983 and bad 1987 arielle castillo of miami new times noted that jackson could use beat of sweet dreams to bring up to date his thriller era style lyrics of sweet dreams are about a female protagonist who has some insecurities about her new romantic relationship she is confused about whether her relationship with her partner is a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare song starts with a bassline which is occasionally interrupted by spare snare kicks drum fills and

critics some of whom praised its dark tone and electropop sound that is different from knowles previous work james montgomery of mtv news wrote that knowles vocals which he called icy and cool slippery like mercury and nothing to at either help make song an undeniable smash that is unique compared to work of other artists jennifer vineyard of same publication argued that rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to knowles fierce alter ego who dares listener to dream of her warning that it might be a beautiful nightmare arielle castillo of miami new times noted that sweet dreams is another one of jim jonsin s productions with a keyboard propelled arrangement but unlike material jonsin crafted for soulja boy song is swirling and darker joey guerra of houston chronicle and gary

parody of a good girl voice while singing chorus ryan dombal of pitchfork media wrote that sweet dreams sounds like a song rihanna would sing echoing dombal s sentiments nick levine of digital spy wrote that best song on sasha fierce disc is a dark ish electropop track called sweet dreams which actually sounds like cousin of rihanna s disturbia on a separate review for single levine awarded sweet dreams a rating of four stars out of five and commented that song seduces listeners with its catchy chorus hook and thereafter keeps them intrigued by placing a hint of darkness just beneath shiny synthy surface spence d of ign music wrote that though sweet dreams is not a stellar track it is superior to other album tracks including diva and radio similarly vicki lutas of bbc music wrote that even though sweet dreams appears to lack something it is undeniably a good song overall she added that sweet dreams may not be knowles finest or most memorable work but it remains her best offering since her 2003 song crazy in love lutas also commended knowles vocal delivery which he described as beautiful and soft yet strong and powerful talia kraines of same publication wrote that

of her intelligence and beautiful visual references after knowles learned choreography in los angeles video was shot in a studio in brooklyn new york city it was seventh video released from i am sasha fierce and second to have complete color throughout halo was first knowles described it as more graphic when compared to previous six videos its motive was to take sasha fierce to next level in video knowles alter ego is symbolized by golden robot suit she wears it was designed by french fashion designer thierry mugler a green screen and computer generated effects were used for video to create a minimal and performance based clip computer generated imagery cgi was employed to create a context less void cgi effects were used to delete background and setting before creating a void like digital canvas for dance routine that is executed by knowles and her dancers nairobi and ashley everett who all sport numerous flashy and symmetrical costumes throughout video accordingly there were no concerns of cutting images were easily merged into one another using computers a high number of camera lens glare effects was used in video part of which was inspired by british designer gareth pugh s autumn winter 2009 video presentation knowles further explained that fashion and choreography were main elements of music video fashion was extremely important in this video because everything was so minimal with choreography we really focused on hitting all of accents in drum beat what makes this choreography so interesting is that in one instance it is very staccato and hard and next instance movement is very smooth and there are lots of melts with inter kit movement in fingers and hands on june 12 2009 a behind scenes video which knowles dance rehearsal was released knowles was dressed in golden costumes and was performing some robotic movements music video of sweet dreams was not included on remixes and video album above and beyonce video collection dance mixes as it was not finished

dancers in a virtual desert following day full video was leaked online but was soon deleted after knowles label issued warnings to infringing websites video for sweet dreams premiered on mtv later same day synopsis and analysis video opens with knowles tossing and turning in her bed her idea was to make opening shot look like a dark fairy tale as she tries to sleep brahms s lullaby plays softly in background she then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move top half of her body knowles said that levitation shot was hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight she added that scene represents nightmare and white bird flying above her takes her into her dream which unfolds after screech of an electric guitar knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in background she wears a black roberto cavalli dress and boots as music begins her two backup dancers wearing gareth pugh pieces appear scene changes into a computer generated sci fi landscape where knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to leonardo da vinci s vitruvian man first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass breaking sound effect as sci fi special effects disappear and knowles appears in a silver one shouldered mini dress on a white background accompanied by her backup dancers she performs sophisticated street and hip busting dance moves second chorus shows knowles wearing a silver lined body suit while smashing mirrors during bridge video fades to black and white and knowles appears wearing gold robot suit and gold and diamond nail rings valued at 36 000 and designed by designer jules kim she executes some robotic movements as chorus begins to play for third and final time digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images knowles arching her back gold outfit is then reused this time in color knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers then says turn lights out and video ends reception james montgomery of mtv news wrote that video is an eye popping herky jerky high fashion one he praised way knowles pops her pelvis in ways never imagined and wardrobe changes in clip before concluding she expands on her burgeoning robot fetish flashes crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways all of which is to say that sweet dreams is just like every amazingly crazy beyonce video from past three years which to extend point also means that it s pretty great olivia smith of daily news noted that in video knowles references jane fonda in movie barbarella 1968 tin woodman and pamela anderson through different costumes she wears smith further compared video with one for single ladies writing that knowles reprises some of moves as she can only swivel those hips in so many ways brandon soderberg of slant magazine described introductory part of video as a david lynch like mixture of eroticism and symbolism he wrote that video was one part victoria s secret commercial another part dream logic anti narrative and a cgi assisted freakout all around soderberg commended video for being an excess of body and action not filmic techniques adding that dancing in video blow s our minds anew rolling stone found similarities between video for sweet dreams kanye west s video for paranoid 2009 and cover artworks of english rock band yes canadian magazine dose also compared video with paranoid due to their similar dream sequences nadia mendoza of sun further compared knowles look in video with lady gaga s vicki lutas of bbc did not appreciate first 30 seconds of video writing that dark horror type music pumping heartbeat equally spooky lullaby screech of an electric guitar gave her impression that she was watching some 19 80s magician with a knowles soundtrack however she complimented rest of video writing that things thankfully move away from hallowe en cheese and into familiar beyonce territory right from fact it s proper 19 80s pop through to video essentially being single ladies with beyonce and 2 dancers lutas concluded that video might not be remembered for long or hailed as beyonce s finest and more memorable work but it remains one of best music videos from knowles she has seen since crazy in love nick levine of digital spy compared dancing moves in video with those in single ladies video stayed at number one for several weeks on uk tv airplay chart in august and september 2009 it was ranked at number 13 on bet s notarized top 100 videos of 2009 countdown tamar anitai of mtv placed video at number three on his list of best five videos of 2009 wrote that it isn t just another high fashion look at beyonce and continued it s dark yin to brighter lighter fare of

mail reporter wrote that live performance was triumphant and much to delight of audience charly wilder of spin magazine commented that knowles overshadowed american singer katy perry s tweaked out pinup shtick with her mesmerizing sexed up rendition of sweet dreams gordon smart of sun commented that knowles stole show with iconic performance of song and eye popping look sweet dreams was not regularly performed on i am world tour a 2009 10 world tour in support of i am sasha fierce but a video interlude featuring song was included knowles sang an acoustic and downtempo rendition of song

performed song live on at 2010 isle of wight festival on june 13 2010 cover later became a b side to their 2010 single tonight jon caramanica of new york times commented that big pink s version of sweet dreams had a disarmingly flat affect delivering it as ramble of a neurotic when compared to original recording sung by knowles likewise pitchfork media s ryan dombal felt that their cover obliterates original s hi nrg pulse turning it into something a lot moodier and creepier british soul and r b singer lemar covered sweet dreams in his biz session in january 2011 on november 1 2010 american professional basketball player shaquille o neal dressed as his female alter ego for halloween and gave a lip synching performance of knowles sweet dreams in september 2011 jade collins

day jessica sanchez cover on march 28 2012 jessica sanchez a contestant of eleventh season of american idol covered sweet dreams performing a slow tempo ballad version of song accompanied at beginning by harps her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from judges of show jennifer lopez commented you did a beautiful job on it if i was beyonce and i was home and i heard that i d be like i got to do that in my next concert slow that one down steven tyler described sanchez s performance as great while randy jackson noted that it was unbelievable sensational james montgomery of mtv news graded her performance with a b and called cover a bit of an odd choice and yet also a supremely confident one he added for once she pulled things back and maybe suffered a bit for doing so but there were still plenty of subtly great moments particularly in verses might not have been her best it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks and really it was good enough mellisa locker of rolling stone praised sanchez s performance calling it a brilliant job and adding that it s risky but beyonce has done it and if anyone can pull off a dazzling repeat performance it s jessica she further compared performance with dream sequence from 1945 film spellbound but noted that it was slightly weirder jim farber of daily news commented that her take on a song by her clear role model beyonce showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing making sanchez s voice seem redundant despite fact she switched up arrangement of bootylicious song she chose sweet dreams laura of daily mail described sanchez performance as pared down show stopping a floaty dreamy confection that wows judges amy reiter of los angeles times wrote sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with beyonce s sweet dreams balancing restraint and power everything from her voice to her dress to red door she walked through seemed polished and tour ready arizona republics randy cordova praised performance saying that slow tempo version allowed sanchez to really delve into song s emotional core hollywood reporters erin carlson praised down theatrical stage during performance
