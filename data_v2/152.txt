tourist attraction and barn was stripped by souvenir hunters plays and ballads remained popular throughout next century and continue to be performed today murder thumb upright maria marten her sister ann who was said to be very similar to maria was model for this sketch which appeared in curtis account of case maria marten born 24 july 1801 was daughter of thomas marten a from polstead suffolk in march 1826 when she was 24 she formed a relationship with 22 year old william corder marten was an attractive woman and relationships with men from neighbourhood had already resulted in two children one died as an infant child of william s older brother thomas but other thomas henry was still alive at time when corder met her thomas henry s father peter matthews did not marry marten but regularly sent money to provide for child william corder born 1803 was son of a local farmer and had a reputation as something of a fraudster and a ladies man he was known as foxey at school because of his sly manner he had fraudulently sold his father s pigs although his father had settled matter without involving law but corder had not changed his behaviour he later obtained money by passing a forged cheque for and he had helped local thief samuel beauty smith steal a pig from a neighbouring village when smith was questioned by local constable over theft he made a prophetic statement concerning corder i ll be damned if he will not be hung some of these days corder had been sent to london in disgrace after his fraudulent sale of pigs but he was recalled to polstead when his brother thomas drowned attempting to cross a frozen pond brewers pp 168 69 his father and three brothers all died within 18 months of each other and only william remained to run farm with his mother corder wished to keep his relationship with marten a secret but she gave birth to their child in 1827 at age of 25 and was apparently keen that she and corder should marry child died later reports suggested that it may have been murdered but corder apparently still intended to marry marten that summer in presence of her stepmother ann marten he suggested that she meet him at red barn from where he proposed that they elope to ipswich corder claimed that he had heard rumours that parish officers were going to prosecute maria for having bastard children he initially suggested that they elope on wednesday evening but later decided to delay until thursday evening on thursday he was again delayed his brother falling ill is mentioned as reason in some sources although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time on friday 18 may 1827 he appeared at martens cottage during day and according to ann he told maria that they must leave at once as he had heard that local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her no warrant had been obtained but it is not known if corder was lying or was mistaken maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight but corder told her that she should dress in men s clothing so as to avert suspicion and he would carry her things to barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to ipswich right thumb maria s ghost points to her grave ann marten s claim that she dreamed about location of maria s grave added to appeal of case for public and press shortly after corder left house maria set out to meet him at red barn which was situated on barnfield hill about half a mile from martens cottage this was last time that she was seen alive corder also disappeared but later turned up and claimed that marten was in ipswich or some other place nearby and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking anger of his friends and relatives pressure on corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave area he wrote letters to marten s family claiming that they were married and living on isle of wight and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication she was unwell she had hurt her hand or letter must have been lost suspicion continued to grow and maria s stepmother began talking of dreams that maria had been murdered and buried in red barn on 19 april 1828 she persuaded her husband to go to red barn and dig in one of grain storage bins he quickly uncovered remains of his daughter buried in a sack she was badly decomposed but still identifiable an inquest was carried out at cock inn at polstead which still stands today where maria was formally identified by her sister ann from some physical characteristics her hair and some clothing were recognisable

he wished to board his daughter there and he surprised corder in parlour thomas hardy noted dorset county chronicles report of his capture lea took him to one side and informed him of charges but corder denied all knowledge of both maria and crime a search of house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought on day of murder some letters from a mr gardener which may have contained warnings about discovery of crime and a passport from french ambassador evidence which suggested that corder may have been preparing to flee trial thumb upright william corder awaiting trial corder was taken back to suffolk where he was tried at shire hall bury st edmunds trial started on 7 august 1828 having been put back several days because of interest which case had generated hotels in bury st edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 july and admittance to court was by ticket only because of large numbers who wanted to view trial despite this judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through crowds that had gathered around door judge was chief baron of exchequer william alexander who was unhappy with coverage given to case by press to manifest detriment of prisoner at bar times 9 august 1828 p 3 quoted in wiener p 138 times nevertheless congratulated public for showing good sense in aligning themselves against corder times 12 august 1828 p 3 quoted in wiener p 138 corder entered a plea of not guilty marten s exact cause of death could not be established it was thought that a sharp instrument had been plunged into her eye socket possibly corder s short sword but this wound could also have been caused by her father s spade when he was exhuming body strangulation could not be ruled out as corder s handkerchief had been discovered around her neck to add to confusion wounds to her body suggested that she had been shot indictment charged corder with murdering maria marten by feloniously and wilfully shooting her with a pistol through body and likewise stabbing her with a dagger to avoid any chance of a mistrial he was indicted on nine charges including one of forgery ann marten was called to give evidence of events of day of maria s disappearance and her later dreams thomas marten then told court how he had dug up his daughter and maria s 10 year old brother george revealed that he had seen corder with a loaded pistol before alleged murder and later had seen him walking from barn with a pickaxe lea gave evidence concerning corder s arrest and objects found during search of his house prosecution suggested that corder had never wanted to marry maria but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him and that his theft of money sent by her child s father had been a source of tension between them cairns p 40 corder then gave his own version of events he admitted to being in barn with maria but said that he had left after they argued he claimed that he heard a pistol shot while he was walking away and that he ran back to barn to find her dead with one of his pistols beside her he pleaded with jury to give him benefit of doubt but after they retired it took them only 35 minutes to return with a guilty verdict baron alexander sentenced him to hang and afterwards be dissected corder spent next three days in prison agonising over whether to confess to crime and make a clean breast of his sins before god he finally confessed after several meetings with prison chaplain entreaties from his wife and pleas from both his warder and john orridge governor of prison langbein p 270 he strongly denied stabbing maria claiming that he had accidentally shot her in eye after they argued while she was changing out of her disguise execution and dissection thumb left hangman adjusts rope around corder s neck thumb execution of william corder on 11 august 1828 corder was taken to gallows in bury st edmunds apparently too weak to stand without support gatrell p 13 he was hanged shortly before noon in front of a large crowd one newspaper claimed that there were 7 000 spectators another as many as 20 000 gatrell p 32 at prompting of prison governor just before hood was drawn over his head he said his body was cut down after an hour by hangman john foxton who claimed corder s trousers and stockings according to his rights body was taken back to courtroom at shire hall where it was slit open along abdomen to expose muscles crowds were allowed to file past until six o clock when doors were shut according to norwich and bury post over 5 000 people queued to see body curtis p 210 following day dissection and post mortem were carried out in front of an audience of students from cambridge university and physicians reports circulated around bury st edmunds that a galvanic battery had been brought from cambridge and it is likely that group experimented with galvanism on body mccorristine p 31 a battery was attached to corder s limbs to demonstrate contraction of muscles sternum was opened and internal organs examined there was some discussion as to whether cause of death was suffocation it was reported that corder s chest was seen to rise and fall for several minutes after he had dropped and it was thought probable that pressure on spinal cord had killed him skeleton was to be reassembled after dissection and it was not possible to examine brain so surgeons contented themselves with a phrenological examination of corder s skull skull was asserted to be profoundly developed in areas of secretiveness acquisitiveness destructiveness and with little evidence of benevolence or veneration gatrell pp 256 57 bust of corder held by moyse s hall museum in bury st edmunds is an original made by child of bungay as a tool for study of corder s phrenology several

death mask is kept in dungeons of norwich castle corder s skin was tanned by surgeon george creed and used to bind an account of murder corder s skeleton was reassembled exhibited and used as a teaching aid in west suffolk hospital skeleton was put on display in hunterian museum in royal college of surgeons of england where it hung beside that of jonathan wild in 2004 corder s bones were removed and cremated rumours after trial doubts were raised about both story of ann s dreams and fate of corder and marten s child ann was only a year older than maria and it was suggested that she and corder had been having an affair and that two had planned murder to dispose of maria so that it could continue without hindrance ann s dreams had started only a few days after corder married moore and it was suggested that jealousy was motive for revealing body s resting place and that dreams were a simple subterfuge further rumours circulated about death of corder and marten s child both claimed that they had taken their dead child to be buried in sudbury but no records of this could be discovered and no trace was found of child s burial site in his written confession corder admitted that he and marten had argued on day of murder over possibility of burial site being discovered in 1967 donald mccormick wrote red barn mystery which brought out a connection between corder and forger and serial killer thomas griffiths when former was in london according to mccormick caroline palmer an actress who was appearing frequently in a melodrama based on red barn case and had been researching murder concluded that corder may have not killed maria but that a local gypsy woman might have been killer however mccormick s research has been brought into question on other police and crime related stories and this information has not been generally accepted mccorristine p 17 popular interest case had all elements to ignite a fervent popular interest wicked squire and poor girl

and murderers for penny gaffs cheap plays performed in back rooms of public houses picard p 198 james catnach sold more than a million p 159 sensationalist single sheet newspapers which gave details of corder s confession and execution and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by corder himself though more likely to have been work of catnach or somebody in his employ neuberg p p 79 it was one of at least five ballads about crime that appeared directly following execution many different versions of events were set down and distributed due to excitement around trial and public demand for entertainments based on murder making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment good official records exist from trial and best record of events surrounding case is generally considered to be that of james curtis a journalist who spent time with corder and two weeks in polstead interviewing those concerned he was apparently so connected with case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of accused man drew a likeness of curtis instead of corder caulfield p 55 thumb memorial to maria marten in churchyard of st mary s polstead thumb

were sold and songs were composed including one quoted in vaughan williams opera hugh drover and five variants of dives and lazarus corder s skeleton was put on display in a glass case in west suffolk hospital and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to collection box when approached eventually skull was removed by dr john kilner who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of red barn memorabilia after a series of unfortunate events he became convinced that skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named hopkins further disasters plagued both men and they finally paid for skull to be given a christian burial in an attempt to lift supposed curse storey p 118 interest in case did not quickly fade play maria marten or murder in red barn existed in various
