severe tropical storm domoina in 1984 caused 100 year floods in south africa and record rainfall in swaziland fourth named storm of season domoina developed on january 16 off northeast coast of madagascar with a ridge to north storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward on january 21 domoina struck eastern madagascar third storm in six weeks to affect nation collectively storms caused 42 deaths and 25 million in damage 1984 usd after crossing country domoina strengthened in mozambique channel to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 95 km h 60 mph on january 28 storm made landfall in southern mozambique and slowly weakened over land domoina crossed into swaziland and later eastern south africa before dissipating on february 2 in mozambique domoina dropped heavy rainfall in capital maputo that accounted for 40 of annual total floods in country destroyed over 50 small dams and left widespread crop damage just before summer harvest later rains caused worst flooding in over 20 years in swaziland which damaged or destroyed more than 100 bridges disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days in south africa rainfall peaked at 950 mm 37 in which flooded 29 river basins notably pongola river which altered its course after storm flooding caused pongolapoort dam to reach 87 of its capacity when waters were released to maintain structural integrity additional flooding occurred in mozambique forcing thousands to evacuate throughout region domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses roads and crops leaving about 199 million in damage there were 242 deaths in southeastern africa meteorological history in january and february 1984 conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis in southwest indian ocean including warmer than normal sea surface temperatures and an active monsoon trough on january 16 a spiral area of convection persisted off northeast coast of madagascar associated with intertropical convergence zone that day it organized enough to warrant a satellite based dvorak rating of t2 5 prompting reunion meteorological service to name it domoina around that time meteo france mfr estimated winds of about 65 km h 40 mph domoina initially tracked to west northwest passing near tromelin island on january 18 around that time storm had begun moving to southwest and mfr estimated that it weakened to tropical depression status on january 19 joint typhoon warning center jtwc began warning on domoina designating it tropical cyclone 14s same day mfr again upgraded domoina into a moderate tropical storm on january 21 storm made landfall just south of tamatave in southeastern madagascar while crossing madagascar on a westward trajectory domonia weakened jtwc estimated winds decreased to 55 km h 35 mph after earlier estimating winds of 95 km h 60 mph before landfall on january 23 storm emerged into mozambique channel near belo and due to a ridge to north it resumed its southwest motion domoina executed two small loops off western coast of madagascar while progressing generally southwestward on january 25 mfr estimated that domonia attained peak 10 minute sustained winds of 95 km h 60 mph near europa island this made it a severe tropical storm two days later jtwc estimated peak 10 minute winds of 100 km h 65 mph early on january 28 domonia made a second landfall on southeastern mozambique near peak intensity it slowly weakened over land while moving across southern mozambique jtwc discontinued advisories on january 29 when storm was near border of mozambique and swaziland next day domonia crossed into swaziland and subsequently into eastern south africa weakening into a tropical depression while passing near durban at around that time system was dissipating although mfr continued tracking domonia until february 2 when it dissipated just offshore east coast of south africa impact thumb left domoina weakening over madagascar throughout its path domoina left thousands of people homeless and caused widespread flooding due to drawing moisture from indian ocean and mozambique channel rains led to rivers bursting their banks which isolated tens of thousands of people in months before domoina struck dry conditions persisted across southeastern africa crossing madagascar as a moderate tropical storm domoina dropped rainfall along its path reaching in mahanoro on east coast and in maintirano along west coast both over a period of 24 hours in latter city a station recorded winds of storm caused heavy damage in marovoay which was later affected by cyclone kamisy domoina was third storm to strike country in a six week period after cyclones andry and three storms collectively caused 42 deaths and 25 million in damage much of it from crop damage as domoina made its final landfall in mozambique it dropped heavy rainfall reaching in town of goba over a five day period rainfall in capital maputo reaching over two days was about 40 of annual total after flooding occurred further south in south africa waters were released from pongolapoort dam without warning this caused many farmers to drown in southern mozambique officials later advised residents along maputo river to evacuate to higher grounds and thousands had to leave their houses storm flooded maputo river basins causing widespread power outages storm left capital maputo without clean water for several days after a pumping station was damaged and main harbor in city was closed also in city storm downed hundreds of trees wrecked roofs and damaged houses about 10 000 people were left homeless nationwide storm damaged 28 pumping stations nationwide and destroyed over 50 small dams floods affected railroad connecting maputo to south africa disrupted construction of a dam and damaged portions of a bridge near transport was disrupted in northern and southern portion of country there was widespread crop damage in mozambique affecting 350 000 farmers and flooding about of fields after an extended drought many farmers had moved closer to river beds making their fields more vulnerable about 119 000 tons of fruits vegetables and other crops were wrecked consisting of much of summer crop and about 5 000 cattle died about 49 000 people lost everything they owned in country storm caused 109 fatalities and damage was estimated at 75 million later storm dropped heavy rainfall in swaziland reaching at peak there rainfall reached in a one day period described as worst flooding in over 20 years precipitation increased levels along most rivers in country some of which rose in a few hours floods washed out or damaged over 100 bridges and two railways had cuts in their lines floods closed at least 20 major roads and country s primary airport most schools nationwide were also closed during storm there were initial difficulties in determining extent of damage due to cut communications and disrupted transportation for several days southeastern swaziland was only accessible by air travel while rural parts of country lost access to fresh water thousands of livestock died during storm and thousands of acres of croplands were flooded about 10 000 citrus trees were destroyed and crop damage was estimated at 2 5 million about 500 people were left homeless in small nation after many homes were damaged or destroyed schools and health clinics were also damaged storm s high winds knocked down trees and power lines leaving power outages overall damage was estimated at 54 million of which 47 5 million from infrastructure damage and domoina killed 73 people in country south africa thumb right domoina over south africa while domoina was moving through south africa it drew an area of moisture from northeast which produced heavy rainfall that peaked at between richards bay and bay totals of over were reported along upper umfolozi pongola and middle and rivers and along upper and lower river precipitation spread as far south as durban but did not penetrate far into center of country an area of about received of rainfall along umfolozi river a discharge rate of 16 000 m3 s 565 000 ft3 s was recorded which was three times rate of a 100 year flood river or changed its course near where it met with river high rains in mountains caused largest flood to date along pongola river floodplain downstream of pongolapoort dam was inundated to where pongola met river which filled many pans dry lakes in region along 29 river locations in eastern south africa river heights were estimated to have been 1 in 50 year events river flooding moved sediment along many banks and in one location sediment reached in length due to widespread flooding and remoteness of worst affected areas there were minimal measurements on river flow along pongola although above pongolapoort dam levels reached 13 000 m3 s 460 000 ft3 s which were 18 times higher than previous record highest there had been a planned release of water from pongolapoort dam in march 1984 to provide adequate water to floodplain but domoina prevented this from occurring dam had its highest hydrology on january 31 and reached 87 of its capacity waters from dam were released on february 2 to prevent dam from exceeding capacity with future threat of cyclone dam levels continued to drop until returning to normal by february 16 despite requests to hold water to prevent further crop damage near south africa border with swaziland flooding stranded about 80 000 people on tribal lands one road in country was converted into a makeshift landing strip to allow helicopters and planes to drop off emergency supplies a period of heavy rain flooded umfolozi river which destroyed a rail bridge near and a bridge crossing highway n2 floods were so strong that they washed a boat from lake st lucia to a point away at lake floods washed away a dredge and severely damaged a nearly finished canal from lake to umfolozi river widespread crop damage occurred along umfolozi river plains after being covered by up to of sediment south african weather bureau considered domoina as first tropical cyclone in recent history to have caused flooding and extensive damage nationwide storm caused 60 deaths and damaged properties of 500 000 people causing r100 million 1984 zar 70 million 1984 usd aftermath in mozambique workers assisted people in moving to higher grounds following flooding members of mozambique red cross helped distribute food and clothing to affected residents and planes helped drop off supplies to residents in isolated areas on january 31 government of swaziland declared a state of emergency and requested assistance from international community south africa provided two helicopters to country to survey affected areas various countries and united nations agencies provided about 1 01 million in cash and supplies to swaziland united nations department of humanitarian affairs provided 20 000 european economic community donated about 80 000 to purchase tents and blankets lutheran world federation donated 20 000 in cash along with generators and blankets while world vision international sent 10 000 in cash within a week workers reopened most major roads to travel and by february 24 most roads were reopened workers also quickly restored downed power lines relief items were distributed by both air and road in weeks following storm coordinated by swaziland red cross and assisted by volunteer organizations in part due to domoina as well as previously occurring drought economy of swaziland stagnated through 1985 following storm in south africa workers restored original course of umfolozi river after it had moved officials later purchased a new dredge to remove sediment from lake st lucia and canal connecting lake to umfolozi river was later finished local governments coordinated relief efforts in country including delivering food and providing shelter for those who lost their homes south african red cross provided food to storm victims many of whom were beneficiaries of food program during extended drought south african government declared natal a disaster area country s military provided 25 helicopters to rescue flood victims and donated 3 000 tents government later authorized 85 million to fund repairing damaged rails and roads american government donated 100 000 to country mostly to purchase supplies west germany also donated about 231 000 mostly for feeding program see also subtropical depression dando made landfall in southern mozambique in 2012 notes references category 1983 84 south west indian ocean cyclone
