john archibald wheeler july 9 1911 april 13 2008 was an american theoretical physicist he was largely responsible for reviving interest in general relativity in united states after world war ii wheeler also worked with niels bohr in explaining basic principles behind nuclear fission together with gregory breit wheeler developed concept of breit wheeler process he is best known for linking term black hole to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in 20th century for coining terms quantum foam neutron moderator wormhole and it from bit and for hypothesizing one electron universe wheeler earned his doctorate at johns hopkins university under supervision of karl herzfeld and studied under breit and bohr on a national research council fellowship in 1939 he collaborated with bohr to write a series of papers using liquid drop model to explain mechanism of fission during world war ii he worked with manhattan project s metallurgical laboratory in chicago where he helped design nuclear reactors and then at hanford site in richland washington where he helped dupont build them he returned to princeton after war ended but returned to government service to help design and build hydrogen bomb in early 1950s for most of his career wheeler was a professor of physics at princeton university which he joined in 1938 remaining until his retirement in 1976 at princeton he supervised 46 phds more than any other professor in princeton physics department early life and education wheeler was born in jacksonville florida on july 9 1911 to librarians joseph lewis wheeler and mabel archibald archie wheeler he was oldest of four children having two younger brothers joseph and robert and a younger sister mary joseph earned a ph d from brown university and a master of library science from columbia university robert earned a ph d in geology from harvard university and worked as a geologist for oil companies and at colleges mary studied library science at university of denver and became a librarian they grew up in youngstown ohio but spent a year in 1921 to 1922 on a farm in benson vermont where wheeler attended a one room school after they returned to youngstown he attended rayen high school after graduating from baltimore city college high school in 1926 wheeler entered johns hopkins university with a scholarship from state of maryland he published his first scientific paper in 1930 as part of a summer job at national bureau of standards he earned his doctorate in 1933 his dissertation research work carried out under supervision of karl herzfeld was on theory of dispersion and absorption of helium he received a national research council fellowship which he used to study under gregory breit at new york university in 1933 and 1934 and then in copenhagen under niels bohr in 1934 and 1935 in a 1934 paper breit and wheeler introduced breit wheeler process a mechanism by which photons can be potentially transformed into matter in form of electron positron pairs early career university of north carolina at chapel hill made wheeler an associate professor in 1937 but he wanted to be able work more closely with experts in particle physics he turned down an offer in 1938 of an associate professorship at johns hopkins university in favor of an assistant professorship at princeton university although it was a lesser position he felt that princeton which was building up its physics department was a better career choice he remained a member of faculty there until 1976 in a 1937 paper on mathematical description of light nuclei by method of resonating group structure wheeler introduced s matrix short for scattering matrix a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary particular solution of integral equations with that of solutions of a standard form werner heisenberg subsequently developed idea of s matrix in 1940s due to problematic divergences present in quantum field theory at that time heisenberg was motivated to isolate essential features of theory that would not be affected by future changes as theory developed in doing so he was led to introduce a unitary characteristic s matrix which became an important tool in particle physics wheeler did not develop s matrix but joined edward teller in examining bohr s liquid drop model of atomic nucleus they presented their results at a meeting of american physical society in new york in 1938 wheeler s chapel hill graduate student katharine way also presented a paper which she followed up in a subsequent article detailing how liquid drop model was unstable under certain conditions due to a limitation of liquid drop model they all missed opportunity to predict nuclear fission news of lise meitner and otto frisch s discovery of fission was brought to america by bohr in 1939 bohr told leon rosenfeld who informed wheeler bohr and wheeler set to work applying liquid drop model to explain mechanism of nuclear fission as experimental physicists studied fission they uncovered puzzling results george placzek asked bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons walking to a meeting with wheeler bohr had an insight that fission at low energies was due to uranium 235 isotope while at high energies it was mainly due to far more abundant uranium 238 isotope they co wrote two more papers on fission their first paper appeared in physical review on september 1 1939 day germany invaded poland starting world war ii in europe considering notion that positrons were electrons that were traveling backwards in time he came up in 1940 with his one electron universe postulate that there was in fact only one electron bouncing back and forth in time his graduate student richard feynman found this hard to believe but idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and feynman incorporated notion of reversibility of time into his feynman diagrams nuclear weapons manhattan project soon after japanese bombing of pearl harbor brought united states into world war ii wheeler accepted a request from arthur compton to join manhattan project s metallurgical laboratory at university of chicago he moved there in january 1942 joining eugene wigner s group which was studying nuclear reactor design he co wrote a paper with robert f christy on chain reaction of pure fissionable materials in solution which was important in plutonium purification process it would not be declassified until december 1955 he gave neutron moderator its name replacing term slower downer used by enrico fermi thumb right loading tubes of hanford b reactor after united states army corps of engineers took over manhattan project it gave responsibility for detailed design and construction of reactors to dupont wheeler became part of dupont design staff he worked closely with its engineers commuting between chicago and wilmington delaware where dupont had its headquarters he moved his family to wilmington in march 1943 dupont s task was not just to build nuclear reactors but an entire plutonium production complex at hanford site in washington as work progressed wheeler relocated his family again in july 1944 this time to richland washington where he worked in scientific buildings known as 300 area even before hanford site started up b reactor first of its three reactors on september 15 1944 wheeler had been concerned that some nuclear fission products might turn out to be nuclear poisons accumulation of which would impede ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction in an april 1942 report he predicted that this would reduce reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100 000 barns after reactor unexpectedly shut down and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later he suspected iodine 135 with a half life of 6 6 hours and its daughter product xenon 135 which has a half life of 9 2 hours xenon 135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross section of well over 2 million barns problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out poison wheeler had a personal reason for working on manhattan project his brother joe fighting in italy sent him a postcard with a simple message hurry up it was already too late joe was killed in october 1944 here we were wheeler later wrote so close to creating a nuclear weapon to end war i couldn t stop thinking then and haven t stopped thinking since that war could have been over in october 1944 joe left a widow and baby daughter mary jo who later married physicist james hartle hydrogen bomb in august 1945 wheeler and his family returned to princeton where he resumed his academic career working with feynman he explored possibility of physics with particles but not fields and carried out theoretical studies of muon with jayme tiomno resulting in a series of papers on topic including a 1949 paper in which tiomno and wheeler introduced tiomno triangle which related different forms of radioactive decay he also suggested use of muons as a nuclear probe this paper written and privately circulated in 1949 but not published until 1953 resulted in a series of measurements of chang radiation emitted by muons muons are a component of cosmic rays and wheeler became founder and first director of princeton s cosmic rays laboratory which received a substantial grant of 375 000 from office of naval research in 1948 he received a guggenheim fellowship in 1946 which allowed him to spend 1949 50 academic year in paris thumb left sausage device of ivy mike nuclear test on enewetak atoll sausage was first true hydrogen bomb ever tested 1949 detonation of joe 1 by soviet union prompted an all out effort by united states led by teller to develop more powerful hydrogen bomb in response henry d smyth wheeler s department head at princeton asked him to join effort most physicists were like wheeler trying to re establish careers interrupted by war and were reluctant to face more disruption others had moral objections those who agreed to participate included emil konopinski marshall rosenbluth lothar nordheim and charles critchfield but there was also now a body of experienced weapons physicists at los alamos laboratory led by norris bradbury wheeler agreed to go to los alamos after a conversation with bohr two of his graduate students from princeton ken ford and john toll joined him there at los alamos wheeler and his family moved into house on bathtub row that had been occupied by robert oppenheimer and his family during war in 1950 there was no practical design for a hydrogen bomb calculations by stan ulam and others showed that teller s classical super would not work teller and wheeler created a new design known as alarm clock but it was not a true thermonuclear weapon not until january 1951 did ulam come up with a workable design in 1951 wheeler obtained permission from bradbury to set up a branch office of los alamos laboratory at princeton known as project matterhorn which had two parts matterhorn s for stellarator another name coined by wheeler under lyman spitzer investigated nuclear fusion as a power source matterhorn b for bomb under wheeler engaged in nuclear weapons research senior scientists remained uninterested and aloof from project so he staffed it with young graduate and post doctoral students in january 1953 he was involved in a security breach when he lost a highly classified paper on lithium 6 and hydrogen bomb design during an overnight train trip this resulted in wheeler being given an official reprimand matterhorn b s efforts were crowned by success of ivy mike nuclear test at enewetak atoll in pacific on november 1 1953 which wheeler witnessed yield of ivy mike sausage device was reckoned at about 30 percent higher than matterhorn b had estimated matterhorn b was discontinued but matterhorn s endures as princeton plasma physics laboratory later career in academia after concluding his matterhorn project work wheeler resumed his academic career in a 1955 paper he theoretically investigated geon an electromagnetic or gravitational wave that is held together in a confined region by attraction of its own field he coined name as a contraction of gravitational electromagnetic entity he found that smallest geon was a toroid size of sun but millions of times heavier geometrodynamics during 1950s wheeler formulated geometrodynamics a program of physical and ontological reduction of every physical phenomenon such as gravitation and electromagnetism to geometrical properties of a curved space time his research on subject was published in 1957 and 1961 wheeler envisaged fabric of universe as a chaotic sub atomic realm of quantum fluctuations which he called quantum foam general relativity general relativity had been considered a less respectable field of physics being detached from experiment wheeler was a key figure in revival of subject leading school at princeton university while dennis william and yakov borisovich zel developed subject at cambridge university and university of moscow respectively wheeler and his students made substantial contributions to field during golden age of general relativity while working on mathematical extensions to einstein s general relativity in 1957 wheeler introduced concept and word wormhole to describe hypothetical tunnels in space time bohr asked if they were stable and further research by wheeler determined that they are not his work in general relativity included theory of gravitational collapse he used term black hole in 1967 during a talk he gave at nasa goddard institute of space studies wheeler said term was suggested to him during a lecture when a member of audience was tired of hearing wheeler say gravitationally completely collapsed object however term black hole had been used four years earlier at an astrophysics conference in dallas texas as science writer marcia reported in a talk at 50th anniversary of texas symposium on relativistic astrophysics american astrophysicist and publisher hong yee chiu said he remembered a seminar in princeton university perhaps as early as 1960 when physicist robert h dicke spoke about gravitationally collapsed objects as like black hole of calcutta wheeler was also a pioneer in field of quantum gravity due to his development with bryce dewitt of wheeler dewitt equation in 1967 stephen hawking later described wheeler and dewitt s work as equation governing wave function of universe quantum information wheeler left princeton university in 1976 at age of 65 he was appointed as director of center for theoretical physics at university of texas at austin in 1976 and remained in position until 1986 when he retired and became a professor emeritus misner thorne and wojciech zurek all former students of wheeler wrote that wheeler s delayed choice experiment is actually several thought experiments in quantum physics that he proposed with most prominent among them appearing in 1978 and 1984 these experiments are attempts to decide whether light somehow senses experimental apparatus in double slit experiment it will travel through and adjusts its behavior to fit by assuming appropriate determinate state for it or whether light remains in an indeterminate state neither wave nor particle and responds to questions asked of it by responding in either a wave consistent manner or a particle consistent manner depending on experimental arrangements that ask these questions wheeler s graduate students included katharine way richard feynman david hill bei lok hu kip thorne jacob bekenstein john r william unruh robert m wald arthur wightman charles misner max and hugh everett wheeler gave a high priority to teaching and continued to teach freshman and sophomore physics saying that young minds were most important with kent harrison kip thorne and masami wheeler wrote gravitation theory and gravitational collapse 1965 this led to voluminous general relativity textbook gravitation 1973 co written with misner and thorne its timely appearance during golden age of general relativity and its comprehensiveness made it an influential relativity textbook for a generation wheeler teamed up with edwin f taylor to write spacetime physics 1966 and scouting black holes 1996 at princeton he supervised 46 phds more than any other professor in princeton physics department teaching alluding to wheeler s mass without mass festschrift honoring his 60th birthday was titled magic without magic john archibald wheeler a collection of essays in honor of his sixtieth birthday 1972 his writing style could also attract parodies including one by john archibald wyler that was affectionately published by a relativity journal participatory anthropic principle wheeler speculated that reality is created by observers in universe how does something arise from nothing he asked about existence of space and time he also coined term participatory anthropic principle pap a version of a strong anthropic principle in 1990 wheeler suggested that information is fundamental to physics of universe according to this it from bit doctrine all things physical are information theoretic in origin in developing participatory anthropic principle pap an interpretation of quantum mechanics wheeler used a variant on twenty questions called negative twenty questions to show how questions we choose to ask about universe may dictate answers we get in this variant respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand but only on a pattern of yes or no answers this variant requires respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all previous answers in this way successive questions narrow options until questioner settles upon a definite object wheeler s theory was that in an analogous manner consciousness may play some role in bringing universe into existence from a transcript of a radio interview on anthropic universe opposition to parapsychology in 1979 wheeler spoke to american association for advancement of science aaas asking it to expel parapsychology which had been admitted ten years earlier at request of margaret mead he called it a pseudoscience saying he did not oppose earnest research into questions but he thought air of legitimacy of being an aaas affiliate should be reserved until convincing tests of at least a few so called psi effects could be demonstrated in question and answer period following his presentation not consciousness but distinction between probe and probed as central to elemental quantum act of observation wheeler incorrectly stated that j b rhine had committed fraud as a student for which he apologized in a subsequent letter to journal science his request was turned down and parapsychological association remained a member of aaas personal life for 72 years wheeler was married to janette hegner a teacher and social worker they became engaged on their third date but agreed to defer marriage until after he returned from europe they were married on june 10 1935 five days after his return employment was difficult to obtain during great depression arthur ruark offered wheeler a position as an assistant professor at university of north carolina at chapel hill at an annual salary of 2 300 which was less than 2 400 janette was offered to teach at rye country day school they had three children letitia james english and alison wheeler wheeler and hegner were founding members of unitarian church of princeton and she initiated friends of princeton public library in their later years hegner accompanied him on sabbaticals in france los alamos new mexico netherlands and japan hegner died in october 2007 at age of 99 death and legacy wheeler won numerous prizes and awards including enrico fermi award in 1968 franklin medal in 1969 einstein prize in 1969 national medal of science in 1971 niels bohr international gold medal in 1982 oersted medal in 1983 j robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1984 and wolf foundation prize in 1997 he was a member of american philosophical society royal academy accademia nazionale dei lincei and century association he received honorary degrees from 18 different institutions in 2001 princeton used a 3 million gift to establish john archibald wheeler battelle professorship in physics after his death university of texas named john a wheeler lecture hall in his honor on april 13 2008 wheeler died of pneumonia at age of 96 in hightstown new
