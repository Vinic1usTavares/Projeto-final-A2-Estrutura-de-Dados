pennsylvania s over elaborate and sometimes unintelligible method of ordering and purchasing supplies equipment and furnishings commonly called per foot rule because methods of measuring under per foot rule were not rigorously enforced furnishing could be intentionally overpriced by supplier for example a flagpole installed on capitol roof was priced at 850 berry estimated value of pole to have been only 150 other expenses included 1 619 for a 125 stand and 3 257 for a 325 mahogany case in senate barber shop pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with capitol were reasonable
