john hancock october 8 1793 was an american merchant statesman and prominent patriot of american revolution he served as president of second continental congress and was first and third governor of commonwealth of massachusetts he is remembered for his large and stylish signature on united states declaration of independence so much so that term john hancock has become a synonym in united states for one s signature before american revolution hancock was one of wealthiest men in thirteen colonies having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle he began his political career in boston as a protege of samuel adams an influential local politician though two men later became estranged hancock used his wealth to support colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and great britain in 1760s he became very popular in massachusetts especially after british officials seized his sloop liberty in 1768 and charged him with smuggling those charges were eventually dropped he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts but accuracy of this characterization has been questioned hancock was one of boston s leaders during crisis that led to outbreak of american revolutionary war in 1775 he served more than two years in continental congress in philadelphia and he was first to sign declaration of independence in his position as president of congress he returned to massachusetts and was elected governor of commonwealth serving in that role for most of his remaining years he used his influence to ensure that massachusetts ratified united states constitution in 1788 early life 175px thumb left coat of arms of john hancock john hancock was born on january 23 1737 in braintree massachusetts in a part of town that eventually became separate city of quincy he was son of col john hancock jr of braintree and mary hawke thaxter widow of samuel thaxter junior who was from nearby hingham as a child hancock became a casual acquaintance of young john adams whom reverend hancock had baptized in 1735 hancocks lived a comfortable life and owned one slave to help with household work after hancock s father died in 1744 john was sent to live with his uncle and aunt thomas hancock and lydia henchman hancock thomas hancock was proprietor of a firm known as house of hancock which imported manufactured goods from britain and exported rum whale oil and fish thomas hancock s highly successful business made him one of boston s richest and best known residents he and lydia along with several servants and slaves lived in hancock manor on beacon hill couple who did not have any children of their own became dominant influence on john s life after graduating from boston latin school in 1750 hancock enrolled in harvard college and received a bachelor s degree in 1754 upon graduation he began to work for his uncle just as french and indian war 1754 1763 had begun thomas hancock had close relations with royal governors of massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during war john hancock learned much about his uncle s business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in firm hancock worked hard but he also enjoyed playing role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes from 1760 to 1761 hancock lived in england while building relationships with customers and suppliers upon returning to boston hancock gradually took over house of hancock as his uncle s health failed becoming a full partner in january 1763 he became a member of masonic lodge of st andrew in october 1762 which connected him with many of boston s most influential citizens when thomas hancock died in august 1764 john inherited business hancock manor two or three household slaves and thousands of acres of land becoming one of wealthiest men in colonies household slaves continued to work for john and his aunt but were eventually freed through terms of thomas hancock s will there is no evidence that john hancock ever bought or sold slaves growing imperial tensions after its victory in seven years war 1756 1763 british empire was deeply in debt looking for new sources of revenue british parliament sought for first time to directly tax colonies beginning with sugar act of 1764 earlier molasses act of 1733 a tax on shipments from west indies had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling which was seen as a victimless crime not only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in colonies but in port cities where trade was primary generator of wealth smuggling enjoyed considerable community support and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal origin nationality routes and content of their illicit cargoes this included frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make cargo appear legal and authorized and much to frustration of british authorities when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed for instance edward randolph appointed head of customs in new england brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to end of 1682 and all but two of these were acquitted alternatively merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded smuggler nation page 15 sugar act provoked outrage in boston where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights men such as james otis and samuel adams argued that because colonists were not represented in parliament they could not be taxed by that body only colonial assemblies where colonists were represented could levy taxes upon colonies hancock was not yet a political activist however he criticized tax for economic rather than constitutional reasons thumb around 1772 hancock commissioned john singleton copley to paint this portrait of samuel adams hancock s early political mentor alt a stern middle aged man with gray hair and wearing a dark red suit he is standing behind a table holding a rolled up document in one hand and pointing with other hand to a large document on table hancock emerged as a leading political figure in boston just as tensions with great britain were increasing in march 1765 he was elected as one of boston s five selectmen an office previously held by his uncle for many years soon after parliament passed 1765 stamp act a tax on legal documents such as wills that had been levied in britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in colonies producing riots and organized resistance hancock initially took a moderate position as a loyal british subject he thought that colonists should submit to act even though he believed that parliament was misguided within a few months hancock had changed his mind although he continued to disapprove of violence and intimidation of royal officials by mobs hancock joined resistance to stamp act by participating in a boycott of british goods which made him popular in boston after bostonians learned of impending repeal of stamp act hancock was elected to massachusetts house of representatives in may 1766 hancock s political success benefited from support of samuel adams clerk of house of representatives and a leader of boston s popular party also known as whigs and later as patriots two men made an unlikely pair fifteen years older than hancock adams had a somber puritan outlook that stood in marked contrast to hancock s taste for luxury and extravagance apocryphal stories later portrayed adams as masterminding hancock s political rise so that merchant s wealth could be used to further whig agenda historian james truslow adams portrayed hancock as shallow and vain easily manipulated by adams historian william m fowler who wrote biographies of both men argued that this characterization was an exaggeration and that relationship between two was symbiotic with adams as mentor and hancock protege townshend acts crisis after repeal of stamp act parliament took a different approach to raising revenue passing 1767 townshend acts which established new duties on various imports and strengthened customs agency by creating american customs board british government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial american merchants had been smuggling smugglers violated navigation acts by trading with ports outside of british empire and avoiding import taxes parliament hoped that new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for government colonial merchants even those not involved in smuggling found new regulations oppressive other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by parliament to tax colonies without their consent hancock joined other bostonians in calling for a boycott of british imports until townshend duties were repealed in their enforcement of customs regulations customs board targeted hancock boston s wealthiest whig they may have suspected that he was a smuggler or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics especially after hancock snubbed governor francis bernard by refusing to attend public functions when customs officials were present on april 9 1768 two customs employees called tidesmen boarded hancock s brig lydia in boston harbor hancock was summoned and finding that agents lacked a writ of assistance a general search warrant he did not allow them to go below deck when one of them later managed to get into hold hancock s men forced back on deck exact details and sequence of events in lydia affair varies slightly in these accounts customs officials wanted to file charges but case was dropped when massachusetts attorney general jonathan sewall ruled that hancock had broken no laws later some of hancock s most ardent admirers would call this incident first act of physical resistance to british authority in colonies and credit hancock with initiating american revolution liberty affair next incident proved to be a major event in coming of american revolution on evening of may 9 1768 hancock s sloop liberty arrived in boston harbor carrying a shipment of madeira wine when custom officers inspected ship next morning they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine just one fourth of ship s carrying capacity hancock paid duties on 25 pipes of wine but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during night to avoid paying duties for entire cargo they did not have any evidence to prove this however since two tidesmen who had stayed on ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded thumb left portrait of hancock by

gentleman he holds a quill pen in his right hand and is turning pages of a large book with other hand one month later while british warship hms romney was in port one of tidesmen changed his story he now claimed that he had been forcibly held on liberty while it had been illegally unloaded on june 10 customs officials seized liberty bostonians were already angry because captain of romney had been impressing colonists and not just deserters from royal navy an arguably illegal activity a riot broke out when officials began to tow liberty out to romney which was also arguably illegal confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize liberty were mistaken for a press gang after riot customs officials relocated to romney and then to castle william an island fort in harbor claiming that they were unsafe in town whigs insisted that customs officials were exaggerating danger so that london would send troops to boston british officials filed two lawsuits stemming from liberty incident an in rem suit against ship and an in suit against hancock royal officials as well as hancock s accuser stood to gain financially since as was custom any penalties assessed by court would be awarded to governor informer and crown each getting a third first suit filed on june 22 1768 resulted in confiscation of liberty in august customs officials then used ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in rhode island following year second trial began in october 1768 when charges were filed against hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from liberty without paying duties if convicted defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple value of wine which came to ps9 000 with john adams serving as his lawyer hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice admiralty court which had no jury and did not always allow defense to cross examine witnesses after dragging out for nearly five months proceedings against hancock were dropped without explanation although charges against hancock were dropped many writers later described him as a smuggler accuracy of this characterization has been questioned hancock s guilt or innocence and exact charges against him wrote historian john w tyler in 1986 are still fiercely debated historian oliver dickerson argued that hancock was victim of an essentially criminal racketeering scheme perpetrated by governor bernard and customs officials dickerson believed that there is no reliable evidence that hancock was guilty in liberty case and that purpose of trials was to punish hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property opposed to dickerson s interpretation were wroth and hiller zobel editors of john adams s legal papers who argued that hancock s innocence is open to question and that british officials acted legally if unwisely lawyer and historian bernard concluded that customs officials had right to seize hancock s ship but towing it out to romney had been illegal legal historian john phillip reid argued that testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct incident aside from liberty affair degree to which hancock was engaged in smuggling which may have been widespread in colonies has been questioned given clandestine nature of smuggling records are scarce if hancock was a smuggler no documentation of this has been found john w tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary boston but found no written evidence that hancock was one of them biographer william fowler concluded that while hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling most of his business was legitimate and his later reputation as king of colonial smugglers is a myth without foundation massacre to tea party thumb paul revere s 1768 engraving of british troops arriving in boston was reprinted throughout colonies alt a wide view of a

decision to suppress unrest in boston with a show of military might decision had been prompted by samuel adams s 1768 circular letter which was sent to other british american colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to townshend acts lord hillsborough secretary of state for colonies sent four regiments of british army to boston to support embattled royal officials and instructed governor bernard to order massachusetts legislature to revoke circular letter hancock and massachusetts house voted against rescinding letter and instead drew up a petition demanding governor bernard s recall when bernard returned to england in 1769 bostonians celebrated british troops remained however and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in killing of five civilians in boston massacre of march 1770 hancock was not involved in incident but afterwards he led a committee to demand removal of troops meeting with bernard s successor governor thomas hutchinson and british officer in command colonel william dalrymple hancock claimed that there were 10 000 armed colonists ready to march into boston if troops did not leave hutchinson knew that hancock was bluffing but soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within town and so dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to castle william hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting troops withdrawn his reelection to massachusetts house in may was nearly unanimous thumb left this portrait of hancock was published in england in 1775 after parliament partially repealed townshend duties in 1770 boston s boycott of british goods ended politics became quieter in massachusetts although tensions remained hancock tried to improve his relationship with governor hutchinson who in turn sought to woo hancock away from adams s influence in april 1772 hutchinson approved hancock s election as colonel of boston cadets a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for governor and general court in may hutchinson even approved hancock s election to council upper chamber of general court whose members were elected by house but subject to veto by governor hancock s previous elections to council had been vetoed but now hutchinson allowed election to stand hancock declined office however not wanting to appear to have been co opted by governor nevertheless hancock used improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute to avoid hostile crowds in boston hutchinson had been convening legislature outside of town now he agreed to allow general court to sit in boston once again to relief of legislators hutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over hancock and discredit adams to some it seemed that adams and hancock were indeed at odds when adams formed boston committee of correspondence in november 1772 to advocate colonial rights hancock declined to join creating impression that there was a split in whig ranks but whatever their differences hancock and adams came together again in 1773 with renewal of major political turmoil they cooperated in revelation of private letters of thomas hutchinson in which governor seemed to recommend an abridgement of what are called english liberties to bring order to colony massachusetts house blaming hutchinson for military occupation of boston called for his removal as governor even more trouble followed parliament s passage of 1773 tea act on november 5 hancock was elected as moderator at a boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported tea act was an enemy to america hancock and others tried to force resignation of agents who had been appointed to receive tea shipments unsuccessful in this they attempted to prevent tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in boston harbor hancock was at fateful meeting on december 16 where he reportedly told crowd let every man do what is right in his own eyes hancock did not take part in boston tea party that night but he approved of action although he was careful not to publicly praise destruction of private property over next few months hancock was disabled by gout which would trouble him with increasing frequency in coming years by march 5 1774 he had recovered enough to deliver fourth annual massacre day oration a commemoration of boston massacre hancock s speech denounced presence of british troops in boston who he said had been sent there to enforce obedience to acts of parliament which neither god nor man ever empowered them to make speech probably written by hancock in collaboration with adams joseph warren and others was published and widely reprinted enhancing hancock s stature as a leading patriot revolution begins parliament responded to tea party with boston port act one of so called coercive acts intended to strengthen british control of colonies hutchinson was replaced as governor by general thomas gage who arrived in may 1774 on june 17 massachusetts house elected five delegates to send to first continental congress in philadelphia which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to coercive acts hancock did not serve in first congress possibly for health reasons or possibly to remain in charge while other patriot leaders were away gage soon dismissed hancock from his post as colonel of boston cadets in october 1774 gage canceled scheduled meeting of general court in response house resolved itself into massachusetts provincial congress a body independent of british control hancock was elected as president of provincial congress and was a key member of committee of safety provincial congress created first minutemen companies consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment s notice thumb wary of returning to boston

illness before hancock reported to continental congress in philadelphia provincial congress unanimously reelected him as their president in february 1775 hancock s multiple roles gave him enormous influence in massachusetts and as early as january 1774 british officials had considered arresting him after attending provincial congress in concord in april 1775 hancock and samuel adams decided that it was not safe to return to boston before leaving for philadelphia they stayed instead at hancock s childhood home in lexington gage received a letter from lord dartmouth on april 14 1775 advising him to arrest principal actors and abettors in provincial congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion on night of april 18 gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on fateful mission that would spark american revolutionary war purpose of british expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that colonists had stored in concord according to many historical accounts gage also instructed his men to arrest hancock and adams if so written orders issued by gage made no mention of arresting patriot leaders gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting hancock and adams since other leaders would simply take their place and british would be portrayed as aggressors although gage had evidently decided against seizing hancock and adams patriots initially believed otherwise from boston joseph warren dispatched messenger paul revere to warn hancock and adams that british troops were on move and might attempt to arrest them revere reached lexington around midnight and gave warning hancock still considering himself a militia colonel wanted to take field with patriot militia at lexington but adams and others convinced him to avoid battle arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier as hancock and adams made their escape first shots of war were fired at lexington and concord soon after battle gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would lay down their arms and return to duties of peaceable subjects with exceptions of hancock and samuel adams singling out hancock and adams in this manner only added to their renown among patriots president of congress thumb dorothy quincy by john singleton copley c 1772 with war underway hancock made his way to continental congress in philadelphia with other massachusetts delegates on may 24 1775 he was unanimously elected president of continental congress succeeding peyton randolph after henry middleton declined nomination hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons he was experienced having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in massachusetts his wealth and social standing inspired confidence of moderate delegates while his association with boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals his position was somewhat ambiguous because role of president was not fully defined and it was not clear if randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence like other presidents of congress hancock s authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer he also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with paperwork in congress on june 15 1775 massachusetts delegate john adams nominated george washington as commander in chief of army then gathered around boston years later adams wrote that hancock had shown great disappointment at not getting command for himself this brief comment from 1801 is only source for oft cited claim that hancock sought to become commander in chief in early 20th century historian james truslow adams wrote that incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between hancock and washington but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that incident or estrangement ever occurred according to historian donald proctor there is no contemporary evidence that hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander in chief quite contrary hancock and washington maintained a good relationship after alleged incident and in 1778 hancock named his only son john george washington hancock hancock admired and supported general washington even though washington politely declined hancock s request for a military appointment when congress recessed on august 1 1775 hancock took opportunity to wed his fiancee dorothy dolly quincy couple was married on august 28 in fairfield connecticut john and dorothy would have two children neither of whom survived to adulthood their daughter lydia henchman hancock was born in 1776 and died ten months later their son john was born in 1778 and died in 1787 after suffering a head injury while ice skating while president of congress hancock became involved in a long running controversy with harvard as treasurer of college since 1773 he had been entrusted with school s financial records and about ps15 000 in cash and securities in rush of events at onset of revolutionary war hancock had been unable to return money and accounts to harvard before leaving for congress in 1777 a harvard committee headed by james bowdoin hancock s chief political and social rival in boston sent a messenger to philadelphia to retrieve money and records hancock was offended but he turned over more than ps16 000 though not all of records to college when harvard replaced hancock as treasurer his ego was bruised and for years he declined to settle account or pay interest on money he had held despite pressure put on him by bowdoin and other political opponents issue dragged on until after hancock s death when his estate finally paid college more than ps1 000 to resolve matter hancock served in congress through some of darkest days of revolutionary war british drove washington from new york and new jersey in 1776 which prompted congress to flee to baltimore maryland hancock and congress returned to philadelphia in march 1777 but were compelled to flee six months later when british occupied philadelphia hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials raising money supplies and troops for washington s army he chaired marine committee and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of american frigates including uss hancock which was named in his honor signing declaration hancock was president of congress when declaration of independence was adopted and signed he is primarily remembered by americans for his large flamboyant signature on declaration so much so that john hancock became in united states an informal synonym for signature according to legend hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that king george could read it

this is uncertain because that document is lost perhaps destroyed in printing process dunlap produced first published version of declaration widely distributed dunlap broadside hancock as president of congress was only delegate whose name appeared on broadside although name of charles thomson secretary of continental congress but not a delegate was also on it as attested by implying that hancock had signed fair copy this meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of signers listed hancock was only delegate whose name was publicly attached to treasonous document hancock sent a copy of dunlap broadside to george washington instructing him to have it read to troops in way you shall think most proper hancock s name was printed not signed on dunlap broadside his

escort for his return to boston although washington was short on manpower he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany hancock on his journey home by this time hancock had become estranged from samuel adams who disapproved of what he viewed as hancock s vanity and extravagance which adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader when congress voted to thank hancock for his service adams and other massachusetts delegates voted against resolution as did a few delegates from other states back in boston hancock was reelected to house of representatives as in previous years his philanthropy made him popular although his finances had suffered greatly because of war he gave to poor helped support widows and orphans and loaned money to friends according to biographer william fowler john hancock was a generous man and people loved him for it he was their idol in december 1777 he was reelected as a delegate to continental congress and as moderator of boston town meeting thumb left hancock house a replica of hancock manor in boston was built in ticonderoga new york by ticonderoga historical society and is open as a museum hancock rejoined continental congress in pennsylvania in june 1778 but his brief time there was unhappy in his absence congress had elected henry laurens as its new president which was a disappointment to hancock who had hoped to reclaim his chair hancock got along poorly with samuel adams and missed his wife and newborn son on july 9 1778 hancock and other massachusetts delegates joined representatives from seven other states in signing articles of confederation remaining states were not yet prepared to sign and articles would not be ratified until 1781 hancock returned to boston in july 1778 motivated by opportunity to finally lead men in combat back in 1776 he had been appointed as senior major general of massachusetts militia now that french fleet had come to aid of americans general washington instructed general john sullivan of continental army to lead an attack on british garrison at newport rhode island in august 1778 hancock nominally commanded 6 000 militiamen in campaign although he let professional soldiers do planning and issue orders it was a fiasco french admiral d estaing abandoned operation after which hancock s militia mostly deserted sullivan s continentals hancock suffered some criticism for debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact he was a charter member of american academy of arts and sciences in 1780 after much delay new massachusetts constitution finally went into effect in october 1780 to no one s surprise hancock was elected governor of massachusetts in a landslide garnering over 90 of vote in absence of formal party politics contest was one of personality popularity and patriotism hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of second continental congress james bowdoin his principal opponent was cast by hancock s supporters as unpatriotic citing among other things his refusal which was due to poor health to serve in first continental congress bowdoin s supporters who were principally well off commercial interests from massachusetts coastal communities cast hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to populace hancock governed massachusetts through end of revolutionary war and into an economically troubled postwar period repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins hancock took a hands off approach to governing avoiding controversial issues as much as possible according to william fowler hancock never really led and never used his strength to deal with critical issues confronting commonwealth hancock governed until his surprise resignation on january 29 1785 hancock cited his failing health as reason but he may have become aware of growing unrest in countryside and wanted to get out of office before trouble came hancock s critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations historian james truslow adams wrote that hancock s two chief resources were his money and his gout first always used to gain popularity and second to prevent his losing it turmoil that hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as shays s rebellion which hancock s successor james bowdoin had to deal with after uprising hancock was reelected in 1787 and he promptly pardoned all rebels hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for remainder of his life final years thumb hancock s memorial in boston s granary burying ground dedicated in 1896 when he had resigned as governor in 1785 hancock was again elected as a delegate to congress known as confederation congress after ratification of articles of confederation in 1781 congress had declined in importance after revolutionary war and was frequently ignored by states hancock was elected to serve as its president on november 23 1785 but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was disinterested he sent congress a letter of resignation in june 1786 in an effort to remedy perceived defects of articles of confederation delegates were first sent to annapolis convention in 1786 and then to philadelphia convention in 1787 where they drafted united states constitution which was then sent to states for ratification or rejection hancock who was not present at philadelphia convention had misgivings about new constitution s lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government in january 1788 hancock was elected president of massachusetts ratifying convention although he was ill and not present when convention began hancock mostly remained silent during contentious debates but as convention was drawing to close he gave a speech in favor of ratification for first time in years samuel adams supported hancock s position even with support of hancock and adams massachusetts convention narrowly ratified constitution by a vote of 187 to 168 hancock s support was probably a deciding factor in ratification hancock was put forth as a candidate in 1789 u s presidential election as was custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in office he instead made his wishes known indirectly like everyone else hancock knew that george washington was going to be elected as first president but hancock may have been interested in being vice president despite his poor health hancock received only four electoral votes in election however none of them from his home state massachusetts electors all voted for another massachusetts native john adams who received second highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president although hancock was disappointed with his performance in election he continued to be popular in massachusetts his health failing hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor with his wife at his side he died in bed on october 8 1793 at 56 years of age by order of acting governor samuel adams day of hancock s burial was a state holiday lavish funeral was perhaps grandest given to an american up to that time legacy thumb 275px hancock s famous signature on stern of destroyer uss john hancock despite his grand funeral hancock faded from popular memory after his death according to historian alfred f young boston celebrated only one hero in half century after revolution george washington as early as 1809 john adams lamented that hancock and samuel adams were almost buried in oblivion in boston little effort was made to preserve hancock s historical legacy his house on beacon hill was torn down in 1863 after both city of boston and massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it according to young conservative new elite of massachusetts was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to cause of revolution in 1876 with centennial of american independence renewing popular interest in revolution plaques honoring hancock were put up in boston in 1896 a memorial column was finally erected over hancock s essentially unmarked grave in granary burying ground no full length biography of hancock appeared until 20th century a challenge facing hancock biographers is that compared to prominent founding fathers like jefferson and john adams hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life as a result most depictions of hancock have relied on voluminous writings of his political opponents who were often scathingly critical of him according to historian charles akers chief victim of massachusetts historiography has been john hancock most gifted and popular politician in bay state s long history he suffered misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through judgments of his detractors tory and whig hancock s most influential 20th century detractor was historian james truslow adams who wrote negative portraits of hancock in harper s magazine and dictionary of american biography in 1930s adams argued that hancock was a fair presiding officer but had no great ability and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth decades later historian donald proctor argued that adams had uncritically repeated negative views of hancock s political opponents without doing any serious research adams presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes sometimes partially documented sometimes not documented at all which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of hancock according to proctor adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto hancock and ended up misrepresenting several key events in hancock s career writing in 1970s proctor and akers called for scholars to evaluate hancock based on his merits rather than on views of his critics since that time historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of hancock while acknowledging that he was not an important writer political theorist or military leader many places and things in united states have been named in honor of john hancock u s navy has named vessels uss hancock and uss john hancock a world war ii liberty ship was also named in his honor ten states have a hancock county named for him
