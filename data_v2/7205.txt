landing at kip s bay was a british amphibious landing during new york campaign in american revolutionary war on september 15 1776 occurring on eastern shore of present day manhattan heavy advance fire from british naval forces in east river caused inexperienced militia guarding landing area to flee making it possible for british to land unopposed at kip s bay skirmishes in aftermath of landing resulted in british capture of some of those militia british maneuvers following landing very nearly cut off escape route of some continental army forces stationed further southeast on island flight of american troops was so rapid that george washington who was attempting to rally them was left exposed dangerously close to british lines operation was a british success it forced continental army to withdraw to harlem heights ceding control of new york city on lower half of island however general washington established strong positions on harlem heights which he defended in a fierce skirmish between two armies following day general howe unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack did not attempt to advance further up island for another two months background american revolutionary war had not gone well for british military in 1775 and early 1776 at besieged boston arrival of heavy guns for continental army camp prompted general william howe to withdraw from boston to halifax nova scotia in march 1776 he regrouped there acquired supplies and reinforcements and embarked in june on a campaign to gain control of new york city schecter battle for new york pp 85 97 anticipating that british would next attack new york general george washington moved his army there to assist general putnam in defensive preparations a task complicated by large number of potential landing sites for a british force howe s troops began an unopposed landing on staten island in early july and made another unopposed landing on long island where washington s continental army had organized significant defenses on august 22 schecter battle for new york pp 100 118 127 on august 27 howe successfully flanked washington s defenses in battle of long island leaving washington in a precarious position on

lee mccullough 1776 pp 201 202 washington sent a missive to second continental congress in philadelphia asking for some direction specifically if new york city which then occupied only southern tip of manhattan island should be abandoned and burned to ground they would derive great conveniences from it on one hand and much property would be destroyed on other washington wrote mccullough 1776 p 203 geography york island was occupied principally on southern tip now lower manhattan by new york city on western tip by greenwich village and in north by village of harlem sparsely populated center of island featured a few low hills principally and crown heights ferry services connected island to surrounding lands with primary ferry to mainland of westchester county now bronx crossing harlem river at king s bridge near northern tip of island island was bordered by two rivers on west by hudson river and on east by east river which separated island from long island see accompanying map kip s bay was a cove on eastern shore of island extending roughly from present day 32nd to 38th streets and as far west as second avenue bay no longer exists as such having been filled in but in 1776 it provided an excellent place for an amphibious landing deep water close to shore and a large meadow for mustering landed troops schecter p 181 opposite bay on long island wide mouth of newtown creek also surrounded by meadowlands offered an equally excellent staging area schecter p 182 planning washington uncertain of general howe s next step spread his troops thinly along shores of york island and westchester shore and actively sought intelligence that would yield clues to howe s plans he also ordered an attempt against flagship of general howe s brother and commander of royal navy at new

urging an immediate withdrawal from new york without possession of long island greene argued new york city could not be held with army scattered in encampments on york island americans would not be able to stop a british attack another decisive defeat he argued would be catastrophic with regard to loss of men and damage to morale he also recommended burning city once british had control it could never be recovered without a comparable or superior naval force there was no american benefit to preserving new york city greene summarized and recommended that washington convene a war council mccullough 1776 pp 205 206 by time council was gathered on september 7 however a letter had arrived from john hancock stating congress s resolution that although new york should not be destroyed

military exertion scouts reported movement in british army camps but washington was still uncertain where british would strike late that afternoon most of american army had moved north to king s bridge and harlem heights and washington followed that night mccullough 1776 pp 208 209 general howe had originally planned a landing for september 13 recalling date of james wolfe s key landing before battle of plains of abraham in 1759 he and general clinton disagreed on point of attack with clinton arguing that a landing at king s bridge would have cut washington off once and for all howe originally wanted to make two landings one at kip s bay and another at horn s hook further north near modern 90th street on eastern shore he struck latter option when ship s pilots warned of dangerous

militia under command of colonel william douglas had erected a crude breastwork on american line at kip s bay but many of these farmers and shopkeepers were inexperienced and had no muskets they carried instead homemade pikes constructed of scythe blades attached to poles after having been awake all night and having had little or nothing to eat in previous twenty four hours at dawn they looked over their meager redoubt to see five british warships in east river near their position mccullough 1776 pp 210 211 as militia at kip s bay lay in their ditches british ships anchored offshore also lay quiet day was oppressively hot at about 10 am general sir henry clinton to whom howe had given task of making landing ordered crossing to begin a first wave of more than eighty flatboats carried 4 000 british and hessian soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder left newtown cove and entered waters of east river heading towards kip s bay around eleven five warships began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened flimsy american breastworks and panicked connecticut militia so terrible and so incessant a roar of guns few even in army and navy had ever heard before wrote ambrose private secretary to lord howe nearly eighty guns fired at shore for a full hour americans were half buried under dirt and sand and were unable to return fire due to smoke and dust after guns ceased british flatboats appeared out of smoke and headed for shore by then americans were in a panicked retreat and british began their amphibious landing although washington and his aides arrived from command post at harlem heights soon after landing began they were unable to rally retreating militia about a mile 1 6 km inland from kip s bay washington rode his horse among men trying to turn them around and impose some order on them cursing furiously and violently by some accounts he lost control of his temper he brandished a cocked pistol and drew his sword threatening to run men through and shouted take walls take cornfield when no one obeyed he threw his hat to ground exclaiming in disgust are these men with which i am to defend america mccullough 1776 p 212 when some fleeing men refused to turn and engage a party of advancing hessians washington reportedly struck some of their officers with his riding crop middlekauff glorious cause p 355 hessians shot or bayoneted a number of american troops who were trying to surrender two thousand continental army troops under command of generals samuel parsons and john fellows arrived from north but at sight of chaotic militia retreat they also turned and fled washington still in a rage rode within a hundred yards of enemy stupefied immobilized by his seething fury was heedless one of his men grabbed reins of his horse and hurried washington to a safer place more and more british soldiers came ashore including light infantry grenadiers and hessian jagers they spread out advancing in several directions by late afternoon another 9 000 british troops had landed at kip s bay and howe had sent a brigade toward new york city officially taking possession while most of americans managed to escape to north not all got away i saw a hessian sever a rebel s head from his body and clap it on a pole in entrenchments recorded a british officer mccullough 1776 pp 211 213 southern advance pushed for a half mile 0 8 km to watts farm near present day 23rd street before meeting stiff american resistance northern advance stopped at now murray hill a rise west of kip s bay just west of present lexington avenue under orders from general howe to wait for rest of invading force this was extremely fortunate for thousands of american troops south of invasion point had clinton continued west to hudson he would have cut off general putnam s troops nearly one third of washington s forces from main army trapping them in lower manhattan mccullough 1776 p 213 thumb left upright general israel putnam general putnam had come north with some of his troops when landing began after briefly conferring with washington about risk of entrapment to his forces in city he rode south to lead their retreat abandoning supplies and equipment that would slow them down his column under guidance of his aide aaron burr marched north along hudson schecter battle for new york pp 184 188 forced march of putnam s men was so quick and british advance sufficiently slow that only last companies in putnam s column skirmished with advancing british schecter p 191 when putnam and his men marched into main camp at harlem after dark they were greeted by cheers having been given up for lost henry knox arrived later after a narrow escape made possible by seizing a boat on hudson and he too received an excited and enthusiastic greeting and was even embraced by washington mccullough 1776 pp 213 214 aftermath british were welcomed by remaining new york city population pulling down continental army flag and raising union flag howe who had wanted to capture new york quickly and with minimal bloodshed considered invasion a complete success not wanting to continue battling with americans that day howe stopped his troops short of harlem mccullough 1776 pp 212 american military history p 65 washington was extremely angry with his troops conduct calling their actions shameful and scandalous connecticut militia who already had a poor reputation were labeled cowards and held to blame for rout however others were more circumspect such as general william heath who said wounds received on long island were yet bleeding and officers if not men knew that city was not to be defended if connecticut men would have stayed to defend york island under withering cannon fire and in face of overwhelming force they would have been annihilated mccullough 1776 pp 214 215 next day september 16 there was further fighting when a clash of outposts escalated into a running battle below washington s lines on harlem heights mccullough 1776 p 216 after several hours exchange of musketry forces engaged returned to their start lines and position of two armies on manhattan remained relatively unchanged for next two months having held their own against picked british troops american army received a much needed boost to their morale after debacle of previous day while british acquired a renewed respect for american ability to stand and fight
