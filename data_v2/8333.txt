hungarian actors janos derzsi and istvan lenart plot follows maloin a nondescript railway worker who recovers a briefcase containing a significant amount of money from scene of a murder to which he is only witness wracked by guilt and fear of being discovered maloin sinks into despondence and frustration which leads to acrimony in his household meanwhile an english police detective investigates disappearance of money and unscrupulous characters connected to crime french german and hungarian co production of film was fraught with difficulty and obstacles first of these was suicide of film s french producer humbert balsan in february 2005 days before shooting was due to begin as original financing of film collapsed remaining producers managed to secure stop gap funding which allowed them to shoot nine days of footage on expensive corsican sets until they were shut down through legal action by local subcontractor after many expressions of support from european film organisations production companies and government bodies a new co production contract was signed in july 2005 with a revised budget and shooting schedule it then emerged that all rights to film had been ceded to a french bank under original production agreement and only after further changes in film s backers was a deal struck with bank to allow shooting to resume in march 2006 over a year later than had been originally envisaged man from london was first of tarr s films to premiere in competition at cannes film festival but despite being highly anticipated it won no prize french distributor blamed this on poor dubbing and a late showing though press were put off by film s extended shots and leaden pace after being re dubbed it was shown on international film festival circuit critical reception to man from london was generally positive though less adamant than that of director s previous two works while reviewers spoke in glowing terms of formidable cinematography and meticulous composition they felt film lacked compelling characters variety reviewer derek elley commented that film was unlikely to reconcile division between viewers of tarr s films who find director to be either a visionary genius or a crashing bore plot film concerns a middle aged railway pointsman maloin miroslav krobot who lives in a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly strung wife camelia tilda swinton and his daughter henriette erika bok one night while in his viewing tower at port s rail terminus maloin witnesses a fight on dockside one of shady combatants is knocked into water along with briefcase he carries when other flees dark quayside maloin makes a clandestine descent from tower and retrieves briefcase which he finds full of sodden english banknotes maloin conceals money and tells no one of what he has seen next morning he visits a tavern where he plays chess with barkeep gyula pauer on his way home he stops by butcher s where his daughter works and finds to his indignation that they have her washing floor later from window of his apartment he notices brown janos derzsi watching him from below at dinner maloin is increasingly irascible addressing henriette brusquely and arguing with camelia meanwhile brown searches water at dock s edge without success before noticing watchtower overlooking quayside and maloin within later at tavern a police inspector from london named morrison istvan lenart discusses with brown matter of stolen money morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named mitchell a theatre owner from whose office safe ps55 000 was stolen morrison proposes that brown being intimately familiar with mitchell s office is only man he knows who was capable of making away with money without raising alarm morrison indicates that mitchell cares only that money is returned swiftly and is even prepared to offer a two nights theater takings in exchange when morrison mentions having visited brown s wife and asks what he should tell mitchell brown leaves room under a pretense and slips out a side door nearby playing chess with barkeep maloin has overheard conversation maloin calls to butcher s and drags henriette from store against her will and over protestations of butcher s wife kati lazar he brings her to tavern for a drink where he overhears barkeep telling another patron story of brown s meeting with inspector revealing that morrison had called local police when brown absconded though henriette refuses her drink maloin buys her an expensive mink stole they return home to consternation of camelia who cannot comprehend why maloin has ruined henriette s chances of a job and spent what little savings family had on extravagant stole during maloin s shift next night he is visited by morrison who questions him as to previous night s events as body of drowned man is retrieved from quayside below next day at tavern morrison meets brown s wife agi szirtes and tells her that brown is under suspicion for theft and for murder at quayside he asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her mitchell s offer to brown but she remains silent at home henriette tells maloin she found a man in their hut at seaside and in fear locked door and ran home an agitated maloin tells her not to tell anyone and leaves for hut he unlocks door and receiving no response to his calling brown s name steps inside closing door behind minutes later he re emerges breathing heavily after pausing to compose himself he locks door and leaves in next scene maloin presents briefcase to morrison in tavern and asks him to arrest him confessing to having killed brown an hour ago morrison leaves with maloin for hut dismissing frenzied inquiries of brown s wife about her husband and handing briefcase to barkeep on way out brown s wife follows men to hut and emerges weeping with morrison moments later back at tavern morrison prepares two envelopes with a small portion of recovered money in each one he leaves with grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well while other he gives to maloin telling him that his case was one of self defense as he is preparing to leave morrison advises maloin to go home and forget whole affair camera focuses on expressionless face of brown s wife momentarily before fading to white cast miroslav krobot as maloin tilda swinton as maloin erika bok as henriette janos derzsi as brown analysis according to critic martha p film is an exploration of place of anonymous breakdowns of social order in personal life for most part questions of justice operate in background of man from london which foregrounds perceptions and point of view of an accidental witness to murder who like viewer has no connection with anyone involved film principally concerns texture of world of protagonist maloin as he experiences it first hand fog light shadow skin walls floors windows sounds these are much closer to maloin than any broken laws involving strangers as in killing at dock as distinct from trope of crime functioning as a break from boredom of mundane for hitchcockian ordinary man excitingly caught up in it interjection of crime in lives of characters of man from london is a phantom occurrence for those burrowed into center of mundane details of their lives in other words tarr s film suggests possibility that it is only on an abstract plane that murder committed by and on strangers causes a stir and demands an investigation in this context it is fitting that investigation must be undertaken by a stranger man from london since abstraction entails distancing from an enveloping context only appearance of man from london brown impels maloin to struggle with his de facto alienation as an ordinary man from moral principle an alienation linked counterintuitively to absence of desire in his daily grind background director bela tarr and novelist screenwriter laszlo krasznahorkai had been collaborators since making acclaimed epic satantango in 1985 with man from london they sought to adapt 1934 french language novel l homme de londres by belgian writer georges simenon novel had been twice adapted for film previously as london man by henri in 1943 and as temptation harbour by lance comfort in 1947 with william hartnell robert newton and simone simon in lead roles man from london was something of a departure from social realism of collaborators preceding films as characters exemplify no social classes and film focuses on their internal and dynamics rather than their environment tarr explained that he had been drawn to adapt novel because it deals with eternal and everyday at one and same time it deals with cosmic and realistic divine and human and to my mind contains totality of nature and man just as it contains their pettiness it was first of director s films not to feature hungarian language or an eastern european setting ensemble cast of film included czech miroslav krobot briton tilda swinton and hungarians janos derzsi and istvan lenart tarr shared directorial credit with agnes hranitzky film s editor and his long time collaborator production history development of film was problematic with threats to shut down production lack of financing and ultimately a return to work project first faltered in february 2005 when film s producer humbert balsan committed suicide tarr reported receiving word of his producer s death two days before shooting was scheduled to begin in bastia corsica balsan s death led to significant financial difficulties for production film had been established as a co production with french german and hungarian financing tarr s budapest based production company t t filmmuhely were to provide hungarian funding for project while balsan had secured french and german financing for film by warranting a loan from french bank coficine upon learning of his death bank withdrew its support for production which was then postponed after securing additional financing from eurimages and arte tarr used these and hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets he had built at a cost of eur2 million french funding was cross financed for shoot by t t filmmuhely as funds were frozen however corsican subcontractor tanit films controlled by film s then executive producer jean patrick costantini terminated their contract with balsan and through legal action compelled production to dismantle sets and leave shooting location at that point ognon pictures shut production down and disassociated themselves from film and tarr withdrew to hungary to regroup expressions of sympathy and solidarity from european film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued support from production s german partners arte and french national film centre whose support was conditional on film having 51 of its dialogue in french new french financing was secured from production company mezzanine film and in hungary hungarian motion picture foundation and minister of culture pledged to back production if a guarantee could be made that film would be finished safely a compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby a quarter of shoot would take place in eastern europe rather than corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted this allowed original eur5 million budget to be reduced by eur700 000 to amount available with funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule film s producers forged a new co production contract in july 2005 while production s lawyers worked to clarify its legal standing in summer of 2005 it emerged that humbert balsan s deeply indebted production company ognon pictures had pledged all rights to production to coficine in exchange for loans with production in legal stasis and faced with a lengthy court battle to recover rights producers agreed to a settlement with ognon s bankruptcy officer in meantime french partners mezzanine film declared their discomfort with scale of production and after mutual agreement with producers left project on september 5 2005 after meeting with producers and their new french partner paul of 13 production coficine consented to completing film on february 6 2006 tarr and producer gabor issued a press release which documented at length developments with troubled production to that date and expressed their hope and intent to persevere in completing film tarr duly restarted shooting in march 2006 after a year of inactivity filmmakers dedicated man from london to their late colleague humbert balsan release thumb right alt an unshaven middle aged white man with

black microphone director bela tarr at sarajevo film festival showing of film man from london premiered in competition at 2007 cannes film festival tarr s first film to do so although its showing was highly anticipated slow pace and prolonged shots of film had press fleeing like panicked slaughterhouse cattle as new york times put it and it won no prize this failure was attributed by film s french distributor shellac to its late showing and poor quality of dubbing a proposal for film to open hungarian film week out of competition had previously been rejected by festival s board following its cannes appearance film was screened at film festivals of toronto melbourne edinburgh split vancouver and new york it proved controversial in new york where elements of audience reacted favourably when film appeared to end prematurely due to a technical fault others greeted actual conclusion with fervent applause and calls of bravo global sales rights to film were bought by fortissimo films and it was re dubbed in french and english new version had its north american premiere at museum of modern art in new york city in september 2008 in united kingdom distributor artificial eye released film theatrically in december 2008 18 months following its cannes premiere they later released a dvd box set of tarr s films which collected man from london with damnation 1988 and werckmeister harmonies 2000 in united states film was given a limited release in may 2009 by ifc films who later made it available through video on demand critical reception critical reaction to man from london generally praised its formalist aesthetic and painstakingly composed scenes while criticizing its slow pace and lack of a compelling plot most argued film fell short of tarr s previous efforts varietys derek elley rated film on a par with his damnation 1988 but as inferior to satantango 1994 and werckmeister harmonies 2000 remarking it was improbable that man from london would put an end to polarization of tarr s audiences into those who hail him as a director of visionary genius and those for whom he is a crashing bore martin tsai of new york sun allowed that tarr makes it easy for viewers to get lost in his beautifully bleak world and lose track of time but complained that in comparison with its predecessors film s central theme of guilt seemed insubstantial and film itself felt slight and incomplete new york times reviewer nathan lee described man from london as bloated formalist art and an outrageously stylized conceptually demanding film that and alienates its audience conversely jeff reichert of reverse shot a long time tarr enthusiast commended film for its technical dexterity and authoritative camera movement comparing tarr to taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien for his cinematic rigor he did however consider source material sub par and musical score by mihaly vig to be whirring and grat ing in hollywood reporter kirk honeycutt complimented intricacy of cinematography and monochrome photography but judged film to be tedious repetitive and nearly unwatchable in a review of cannes offerings for time out dave calhoun too drew attention to meticulous cinematography and signature shot lengths of tarr s austere and mesmeric film and declared swinton s dubbing into hungarian one of festival s strangest instances of cultural displacement reporting from cannes guardians peter bradshaw described film as bizarre and lugubrious but mesmeric and praised muted performance of agi szirtes in role of brown s wife as strangely compelling reviewing film following its theatrical release he found dubbed dialogue affected and odd score doom laden occasional humour mordant and cinematography mesmerising remarking that net effect was unsettling sometimes absurd sometimes stunning ed gonzalez of village voice concluded that film stands as an example of style for sake of pure and intense but dispassionate style references external links man from london
