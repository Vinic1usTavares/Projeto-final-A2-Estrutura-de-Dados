achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas especially astronomy mathematics and medicine other subjects of scientific inquiry included alchemy and chemistry botany and agronomy geography and cartography ophthalmology pharmacology physics and zoology medieval islamic science had practical purposes as well as goal of understanding for example astronomy was useful for determining qibla direction in which to pray botany had practical application in agriculture as in works of ibn bassal and ibn al awwam and geography enabled abu zayd al balkhi to make accurate maps islamic mathematicians such as al khwarizmi avicenna and jamshid al kashi made advances in algebra trigonometry geometry and arabic numerals islamic doctors described diseases like smallpox and measles and challenged classical greek medical theory al biruni avicenna and others described preparation of hundreds of drugs made from medicinal plants and chemical compounds islamic physicists such as ibn al haytham al biruni and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy criticised aristotle s view of motion significance of medieval islamic science has been debated by historians

alchemy already well established before rise of islam stemmed from belief that substances comprised mixtures of four aristotelian elements fire earth air and water in different proportions alchemists regarded gold as noblest metal and held that other metals formed a series down to basest such as lead they believed too that a fifth element elixir could transform a base metal into gold jabir ibn hayyan 8th 9th centuries wrote on alchemy based on his own experiments he described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue in use when alchemy had transformed into chemistry ibn hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids he described processes such as sublimation reduction and distillation he made use of equipment such as alembic and

practical applications at that time geometry was studied at different levels some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics and it required years of concentrated work early in abbasid caliphate founded 750 soon after foundation of baghdad in 762 some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by al mansur s group of scientists from pre islamic persian tradition in astronomy astronomers from india were invited to court of caliph in late eighth century they explained rudimentary trigonometrical techniques used in indian astronomy ancient greek works such as ptolemy s almagest and euclid s elements were translated into arabic by second half of ninth

which held that eye emitted a ray al haytham proposed in his book of optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex at center of eye he suggested that light was

dynamics kinematics and motion in sixth century john philoponus 490 570 rejected aristotelian view of motion he argued instead that an object acquires an inclination to move when it has a motive power impressed on it in eleventh century ibn sina adopted roughly same idea namely that a moving object has force which is dissipated by external agents like air resistance ibn sina distinguished between force and inclination mayl he claimed that an object gained mayl when object is in opposition to its natural motion he concluded that continuation of motion depends on inclination that is transferred to object and that object remains in motion until mayl is spent he also claimed that a projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon that view accords with newton s first law of motion on inertia as a non aristotelian suggestion it was essentially abandoned until it was described as impetus by jean buridan 1295 1363 who was influenced by ibn sina s book of healing in shadows abu rayhan al biruni 973 1048 describes non uniform motion as result of acceleration ibn sina s theory of mayl tried to relate velocity and weight of a moving object a precursor of concept of momentum aristotle s theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion abu l barakat al baghdadi 1080 1164 5 disagreed arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things and that force is proportional to acceleration not to velocity ibn bajjah avempace 1085 1138 proposed that for every force there is a reaction force while he did not specify that these forces be equal
