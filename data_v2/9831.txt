admiral class battlecruisers were to have been a class of four british royal navy battlecruisers designed near end of world war i their design began as an improved version of s but it was recast as a battlecruiser after admiral john jellicoe commander of grand fleet pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships but that a number of german battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to bulk of grand fleet s battlecruisers and design was revised to counter these class was to have consisted of anson howe and rodney all names of famous admirals but latter three ships were suspended as material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher priority merchantmen and escort vessels their designs were updated to incorporate lessons from battle of jutland but admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean slate design so they were cancelled in 1919 no more battlecruisers would be built due to arms limitations agreements of interbellum hood however was sufficiently advanced in construction that she was completed in 1920 and immediately became flagship of battlecruiser squadron of atlantic fleet she served as flagship of special service squadron during its round world cruise in 1923 24 hood was transferred to mediterranean fleet in 1936 and spent much of next few years on non intervention patrols during spanish civil war returning to united kingdom before beginning of world war ii and battlecruiser squadron of home fleet hood spent most of early part of war patrolling against german commerce raiders and escorting convoys flagship of force h based at gibraltar she bombarded french ships during attack on mers el kebir in may 1941 hood and battleship were ordered to intercept and heavy cruiser as they attempted to break out into north atlantic in subsequent battle of denmark strait aft magazines of hood exploded sinking her within five minutes of opening fire design and description in 1915 admiralty was considering next generation of warship to follow queen elizabeth class battleships director of naval construction dnc sir eustace tennyson d eyncourt was given instructions to prepare designs for a new battleship design should take armament armour and engine power of queen elizabeth as standard and build around them a hull which should draw as little water as was considered practicable and safe and which should embody all latest protection and improvements against underwater attack raven and roberts 1976 p 60 design a was submitted to admiralty on 30 november for consideration dnc had been able to reduce draught in comparison to queen elizabeth by 22 by widening ship to and lengthening it to this had consequence of restricting ships to use only one dock in rosyth and two in portsmouth large anti torpedo bulges were fitted and secondary armament of twelve guns of a new design was mounted on forecastle deck resulting high freeboard gave design a greater ratio of reserve buoyancy to displacement than in any previous british dreadnought design s stretched hull form also gave her an estimated speed of about faster than queen elizabeth had been able to reach in service first sea lord admiral sir henry jackson responded on 6 december that such a large ship might start a new arms race with americans that britain could ill afford and that better deck protection was necessary to defeat plunging shells during long range engagements admiralty asked for design to be reworked b with a maximum beam of but this was deemed unsatisfactory as it compromised ship s underwater protection a pair of revised designs was requested with speed reduced to to allow hull to be shortened to better fit in existing floating docks and minimum possible draught first of two c1 was to have full bulge protection and second c2 to have best bulge protection possible without exceeding queen elizabeths length c1 was shortened by in comparison with b and c2 was only in length but draught increased by in both proposals it had been necessary to reduce number of guns in secondary armament and reduce thickness of armour admiralty was not pleased with either design and asked for a revised version of a of same draught beam armour and armament but shortened and with same speed as queen elizabeth in addition new five inch gun was rejected in favour of existing gun raven and roberts 1976 p 61 at least some of designs were passed to admiral john jellicoe commander of grand fleet who pointed out that there was no need for new battleships as british superiority in numbers over germans was substantial but that was not true for battlecruisers germany was known to be building three new s with an estimated speed approaching and a reported armament of guns these reports were incorrect german ships were designed for and guns in addition there were four not three ships in class see campbell pp 58 59 these ships would be superior to all existing british battlecruisers and those then under construction two and three large light cruisers were equally fast but too thinly armoured to compete with them he also remarked that his experience with queen elizabeth class had persuaded him that an intermediate speed between battleships and battlecruisers was of little use he suggested that design should be for either a battleship or a 30 knot battlecruiser preferably latter raven and roberts 1976 pp 61 62 dnc prepared two new designs in response to admiral jellicoe s comments on 1 february 1916 each for a battlecruiser capable of thirty knots or better and armed with eight guns design 1 displaced with two inches less belt armour and a speed of thirty knots it used bulky large tube boilers traditional in british capital ships which explains why design was larger than any of previous battleship designs design 2 was essentially a repeat of first design except that small tube boilers were substituted these were considerably smaller than older type and saved over design 1 and had one foot less draught roberts 1997 p 58 these savings were substantial enough to overcome engineer in chief s objections that they required more frequent and expensive repairs raven and roberts 1976 p 70 dnc was asked to submit four more designs using small tube boilers which were submitted on 17 february design 3 was design 2 with machinery power increased to to boost maximum speed to while other designs had either four six or eight guns design 3 was selected as admiral jellicoe has specified that minimum number of guns should be no less than eight as fewer caused problems in accurate fire control and two alternatives were to be provided one with a dozen 5 5 inch guns and other with sixteen such guns latter proposal was selected on 7 april and orders were placed on 19 april for three ships hood howe and rodney order for fourth ship anson was placed on 13 june roberts 1997 pp 56 58 was laid down on 31 may 1916 same day as battle of jutland loss of three british battlecruisers during that battle caused work on all three ships to be suspended pending an investigation into possible design flaws admiral jellicoe s investigation blamed loss of ships on faulty cordite handling procedures that allowed fires in turrets or hoists to reach ships magazines it recommended anti flash equipment be installed in magazines and handling rooms and improvement of deck armour over magazines to prevent plunging shells or fragments from reaching magazines dnc and third sea lord opposed latter believing that there was no direct evidence that magazines had been directly penetrated raven and roberts 1976 p 63 on 5 july dnc submitted two revised designs for admiral class ships first was a modification of previous design with slight increases to deck turret barbette and funnel uptake armour one inch protection for 5 5 inch ammunition hatches and hoists and number of electrical generators increased from four to eight these changes increased displacement by and draught by second design drastically improved protection and converted ships into fast battleships vertical armour was generally increased by 50 and deck protection was slightly thickened as in first design these changes would have added another to original design and increased draught by but would have cost half a knot in speed this design would have been equal to queen elizabeths but faster and with much improved torpedo protection although it was some larger than older ships after dnc submitted above designs he was asked to consider variations with triple fifteen inch turrets and these were submitted on 20 july admiralty chose fast battleship design and hood was laid down again on 1 september roberts 1997 pp 58 60 later that month hoods armour scheme was slightly revised in light of further analysis of results of jutland and deck armour was modestly increased in order to ensure that a minimum thickness of nine inches of armour would have to be penetrated by shells striking at angles of descent up to 30deg from horizontal further alterations were made in 1917 during her construction that increased thickness of her turret faces and roofs these changes plus numerous others increased her displacement by and her draught by and reduced her speed to changes continued during 1918 when thickness of her magazine crowns was increased from one inch to two armour for funnel uptakes above forecastle deck was omitted in compensation in may 1919 her main deck armour at side abreast magazines was increased to three inches 76 mm and four 5 5 inch guns and their ammunition were deleted in consequence next month plans were approved to increase thickness of main deck over forward magazines to and to over rear magazines her four above water torpedo tubes and their protection were to be omitted and wall of torpedo control tower were to be reduced to a thickness of to offset armour s weight however additional deck armour was never fitted and torpedo tubes less their protection were retained roberts 1997 pp 60 62 earlier in 1917 however construction of hoods three sisters had been suspended as amount of labour and material they required would be better employed in construction and repair of merchant ships and escorts needed to keep open britain s lines of communication in face of u boat blockade design work continued however although hood was too far advanced to incorporate these changes and ultimately would have been extensive enough for other three ships to constitute their own class campbell 1978 p 72 at end of 1917 suspended ships design was modified to increase thickness of turret roofs to six inches 152 mm and unspecified alterations were made to armoured bulkheads these cost a total of in displacement other changes were a redesigned bridge structure and moving funnels closer together and exchange in position between fifteen inch and magazines this latter change would have caused hull s form to be filled out somewhat to accommodate handling room of rearmost turret at cost of a slight loss in speed and ammunition storage roberts 1997 pp 60 61 hood was closest to completion and her construction was continued in case germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers admiral beatty continually pressed to have hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted but war cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in shipbuilding programme to this end after end of war three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate lessons of war roberts 1997 p 61 general characteristics admiral class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors of they had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load this was longer and wider than smaller ships they displaced at load and at deep load over more than older ships they had a metacentric height of at deep load as well as a complete double bottom roberts 1997 pp 64 65 propulsion ships had four brown curtis single reduction geared steam turbine sets each of which drove one propeller shaft they were arranged in three engine rooms forward engine room held two turbines for wing shafts middle compartment housed turbines for port inner shaft and aft engine room contained turbines for starboard inner shaft a cruising turbine was built into casing of each wing turbine turbines were powered by twenty four yarrow small tube boilers equally divided between four boiler rooms raven and roberts p 69 they were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of but achieved more than during hoods trials when she slightly exceeded her designed speed of roberts 1997 p 81 they were designed to normally carry of fuel oil but had a maximum capacity of roberts 1997 p 60 at full capacity hood could steam at a speed of for an estimated they had eight dynamos two diesel two turbo driven and four reciprocating raven and roberts p 70 armament thumb close up of hoods aft 15 inch mark i guns in 1926 admiral class ships mounted eight bl 15 inch mk i guns in four twin hydraulically powered mark ii turrets designated a b x and y from front to rear guns could be depressed to 3deg and elevated to 30deg they could be loaded at any angle up to 20deg although loading at high angles tended to slow gun s return to battery ships carried 120 shells per gun they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of with armour piercing ap shells their secondary armament consisted of sixteen bl 5 5 inch mk i guns which were mounted on pivot mounts on forecastle deck protected by gun shields they were provided with 200 rounds per gun raven and roberts 1976 p 67 guns on their mounts had a maximum elevation of 30deg they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of their maximum range was at 30deg elevation their rate of fire was twelve rounds per minute admiral class ships were designed with four qf four inch mark v anti aircraft guns they had a maximum depression of 5deg and a maximum elevation of 80deg they fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of ten to fifteen rounds per minute guns had a maximum ceiling of but an effective range of much less two submerged side loading torpedo tubes were fitted forward of a turret and eight above water side loading mark v tubes were intended to be mounted abreast rear funnel on upper deck although only four of latter were carried by hood they were loaded and traversed by hydraulic power submerged tubes were fired by compressed air while above water tubes used cordite charges thirty two warheads could be accommodated in two magazines in hold forward of a turret s hood carried mark iv and iv torpedoes each which had a warhead of of tnt roberts 2001 pp 17 18 they had three speed settings which governed their range from at at and at fire control main guns of admiral class ships were controlled from either of two fire control directors primary director was mounted above conning tower in an armoured hood and other was in fore top on foremast raven and roberts 1976 p 68 b turret could also control all main gun turrets while x turret could control rear guns roberts 2001 p 18 data from a rangefinder in armoured hood were input into a mk v dreyer fire control table located in transmitting station ts brooks 2005 p 273 on platform 2001 p 45 where they were converted into range and deflection data for use by guns target s data were also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist gunnery officer in predicting movement of target fore top was equipped with a rangefinder each turret was provided with a thirty foot rangefinder in an armoured housing on turret roof and a dumaresq analogue computer for local fire control roberts 2001 pp 100 102 secondary armament was primarily controlled by 5 5 inch directors mounted on each side of bridge they were supplemented by two additional control positions in fore top which were provided with rangefinders each of these positions was equipped with a dumaresq calculator for local control but spotting data were normally sent to 5 5 inch ts on lower deck much like procedure for fifteen inch guns except that firing data were calculated by two type f fire control clocks analog computers anti aircraft guns were controlled by a simple rangefinder mounted on aft superstructure torpedoes initially had a similar system where various rangefinders especially fifteen foot rangefinder above aft torpedo control tower and deflection sights provided data to a dreyer table in torpedo ts adjacent to 5 5 inch ts on lower deck however dreyer table was removed during hoods 1929 1931 refit and calculations were made in torpedo control position in bridge armour waterline belt of admiral class ships was thick angled 12deg outwards partly to keep belt inside bulge structure and allow torpedo hits to vent to atmosphere this angle also increased armor s relative thickness to horizontal close range fire albeit at cost of reducing its relative height which increased chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it this sloped belt made their armor comparable to found in latest british dreadnoughts it ran some from forward edge of a barbette to middle of y barbette forward of this belt thinned to six inches before further reducing to and ending in a five inch 127 mm bulkhead well short of bow aft of midships section belt reduced to six inches 152 mm it did not reach stern but terminated at a five inch bulkhead this belt had a height of which was below designed waterline above it was seven inch middle belt high and five inch upper belt which was high middle belt stretched between a and y barbettes ending in four inch transverse bulkheads at each end upper belt only ran from a barbette to end of machinery spaces and ended in another four inch transverse bulkhead five of hoods decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from with greatest thicknesses over magazines and steering gear raven and roberts 1976 pp 67 69 immediately adjacent to a and y barbettes main deck was five inches thick to protect magazines turret faces were fifteen inches thick while their sides ranged from in thickness and roof was five inches thick barbettes had a maximum of twelve inches of armour but were reduced in thickness in stages below decks although outer faces of a and y barbettes were considerably thicker below decks than other barbettes conning tower armour was nine to eleven inches thick and it was largest yet fitted to a british capital ship as it weighed primary fire control director atop conning tower was protected by an armoured hood face of hood was six inches thick its sides were two inches thick and its roof was protected by three inches of armour a communications tube with six inch sides ran from conning tower down to lower conning position on main deck three torpedo bulkheads were and thick anti torpedo bulges of admiral class battlecruisers were first fitted on a british capital ship to fully incorporate lessons learned from a series of experiments begun before world war i they consisted of an outer air space an inner buoyancy space and 1 5 inch protective bulkhead buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible roberts 2001 p 12 however tests conducted after hood was completed showed that filling buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably

commissioning on 15 may 1920 hood became flagship of battlecruiser squadron of atlantic fleet under command of rear admiral sir roger keyes she made a cruise to scandinavian waters that year she visited mediterranean in 1921 and 1922 to show flag and to train with mediterranean fleet before sailing on a cruise to brazil and west indies in company with battlecruiser squadron taylor 2004 p 235 in november 1923 hood accompanied by battlecruiser and a number of s of 1st light cruiser squadron set out on a world cruise from west to east via panama canal they returned home ten months later in september 1924 battlecruiser squadron visited lisbon in january 1925 to participate in vasco da gama celebrations before continuing on mediterranean for exercises hood would continue this pattern of a winter training visit to mediterranean for rest of decade taylor 2004 pp 236 238 hood was given a major refit from 1 may 1929 to 10 march 1931 and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of battlecruiser squadron later that year her crew participated in invergordon mutiny over pay cuts for sailors it ended peacefully and hood returned to her home port afterwards battlecruiser squadron made a caribbean cruise in early 1932 next year she resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in mediterranean while en route to gibraltar for one of these cruises she collided with battlecruiser on 23 january 1935 but was only lightly damaged hood participated in king george v s silver fleet review at spithead following august she was transferred to mediterranean fleet shortly afterward and stationed at gibraltar at outbreak of second italo abyssinian war and spanish civil war on 23 april 1937 she escorted three british merchantmen into bilbao harbour despite presence of nationalist cruiser that attempted to blockade port taylor 2004 pp 172 3 238 40 she returned to portsmouth in january 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 august taylor 2004 p 240 world war ii in june 1939 hood was assigned to home fleet s battlecruiser squadron while still refitting when war broke out later that year she was employed principally in patrolling vicinity of iceland and faroe islands to protect convoys and intercept german raiders attempting to break out into atlantic in september 1939 she was hit by a 250 kg 550 lb aircraft bomb with minor damage by early 1940 hood s machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to she was refitted between 4 april and 12 june taylor 2004 pp 192 240 and aircraft carrier were ordered to gibraltar to join force h on 18 june where hood would become flagship as such she took part in destruction of french fleet at mers el kebir in july 1940 just eight days after french surrender british admiralty had issued an ultimatum to french fleet at oran to ensure they would not fall into german or italian hands terms were rejected and royal navy opened fire on french ships berthed there results of hoods fire are not known exactly but she damaged which was hit by four fifteen inch shells and was forced to beach herself hood was straddled during engagement by dunkerque shell splinters wounded two men dunkerques sister ship managed to escape from harbour and hood with several light cruisers gave chase but gave up after two hours after hood had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from a french sloop and she had stripped a turbine reaching taylor 2004 pp 202 was relieved as flagship of force h by renown on 10 august after returning to scapa flow after a short refit she resumed her previous role in patrolling against german commerce raiders and convoy escort this lasted until january 1941 when she began a refit that lasted until march upon its completion she was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept german battleships and unsuccessful she was ordered to patrol bay of biscay against any breakout attempt by german ships from brest hood was ordered to norwegian sea on 19 april when admiralty received a false report that had sailed from germany afterwards she patrolled north atlantic before putting into scapa flow on 6 may taylor 2004 pp 241 42 battle of denmark strait on evening of 21 may 1941 hood and newly completed battleship sailed from scapa flow to join heavy cruisers and patrolling denmark strait between greenland and iceland on news that bismarck and heavy cruiser had sortied into north atlantic they had not yet reached strait when suffolk spotted german ships north of iceland in early evening on 23 may hood and prince of wales altered course and increased their speed to intercept british squadron spotted germans at 5 37 a m but germans were already aware of their presence british opened fire at 05 52 with hood engaging prinz eugen lead ship in german formation and germans returned fire 05 55 both ships concentrating on hood prinz eugen probably was first ship to score when a shell hit hoods boat deck between her funnels and started a large fire among ready use
