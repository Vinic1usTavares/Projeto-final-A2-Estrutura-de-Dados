it kind of shocked everyone who knows me that i wound up doing this movie because i had always been so careful about nudity it was very much a part of this character and i couldn t be coy or guarded or self conscious otherwise it wouldn t work it was sort of a challenge i wanted to take on i guess she began to appear in small budget films which did well with critics such as 1997 s drama inventing abbotts set in late 1950s in which she played part of eleanor one of three daughters of town millionaire lloyd abbott about her performance co producer ron howard who would later direct connelly in a

are morally questionable because life is often like that producer michael london said about connelly s portrayal i think she understood kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character
