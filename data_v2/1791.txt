format and questioned need for these kind of matches archie thompson who scored a record setting 13 goals was delighted with his record but he also agreed with farina s comments fifa spokesman keith cooper agreed with both comments and suggested a change in qualification format with smaller teams entering a preliminary round however oceania football confederation chairman basil opposed both comments and claimed that smaller teams have right to face australia and new zealand similar to australia having rights to face stronger opponents such as brazil and france this match and other lopsided victories in qualification partially contributed towards reintroduction of a preliminary round for smaller teams in qualification for 2006 fifa world cup in order to avoid these one sided matches significant gap between two top teams australia and new zealand and rest of teams in oceanian zone was one of reasons behind australia leaving oceania football confederation at end of 2006 to join asian football confederation in order to increase competitiveness starting with 2010 world cup qualification australia participated in asian zone qualification rounds american samoan team was not feeling downhearted after game and even embraced and sang to audience as game finished salapu declared that he enjoyed game i wasn t embarrassed because we all learned something from it if we had all our players maybe it would have been only five or six goals because i was without my best defenders and there was nothing i could do tony langkilde also defended goalkeeper saying that he kept score down with a magnificent display he also added that now we are recognised by fifa it has really helped spark an interest in football on islands samoan manager tunoa lui commented that football was
