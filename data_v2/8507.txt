hollywood monsters in favor of a more straightforward and adult oriented approach that blended humor with drama runaway initially featured hand drawn 2d graphics production problems necessitated a switch one year into development to pre rendered 3d characters with toon shading change caused major delays exacerbated by a shortage of qualified character animators in spain country s recovering

awards and positive reviews upon its july 2001 release early domestic sales were strong but runaways distribution and international debut were scuttled when dinamic multimedia closed that september forced to downsize in response pendulo fought for roughly one year to buy back runaways rights developer finally secured global publishing deals during 2002 and 2003 dtp entertainment and focus home interactive had significant success with runaway in germany and france respectively and game sold 600 000 units across europe by 2006 runaway was well received by german publications such as pc games

games using a mouse player navigates player character through game world and interacts with hotspots such as items and non player characters interaction with hotspots is context sensitive for example if cursor transforms into a magnifying glass while hovering over a hotspot player may click to learn more about object highlighted when cursor transforms into a hand or speech balloon it indicates that a hotspot may be manipulated or spoken to respectively to progress in runaway player gathers items solves puzzles and converses with non player characters game contains no action based or time limited sequences most puzzles involve use of items which are stored in an inventory subscreen items are often hidden in game world and sometimes require pixel hunting to locate and certain items may only be found by examining same hotspot multiple times player must occasionally combine items in inventory to solve puzzles conversations handled by picking dialogue options from a menu provide puzzle hints and other assistance runaways player character is unable to die and progression is linear game follows a system in which player character refuses to collect certain items before their use is made clear in plot as a result player must solve many puzzles in a specific order when player progresses enough a cutscene will play to provide information and to further plot story in new york city

murdered by sandretti family while brian and gina successfully withdraw money from bank brian initially resolves to return to school leaving gina and money behind but he changes his mind at last minute and runs away with her to tropics development concept and design following pendulo studios release of hollywood monsters in december 1997 developer started to create a sequel to game first installment had been a commercial hit in spain pendulo s home country however kai fiebig of hollywood monsters publisher dinamic multimedia explained that pendulo soon revamped its project at a meeting to assess sequel one of pendulo s leads suggested a change in direction because of a thriller film he had recently seen and core concept for runaway was born art director rafael latiegui later said that first sketches of what would end up becoming runaway were created in summer 1998 team devised a story based on road movie genre early influence was derived from films pulp fiction and raising arizona pendulo s desire to create a more tightly structured game than hollywood monsters inspired runaways chase themed plot for setting team picked united states over spain for recognizability of its locations to a global audience and for its greater to road movie format latiegui s recent trip to new mexico and arizona influenced team he had taken several hundred photographs which guided runaways color palette and served as basis for many in game locations thumb right in creating design for gina pendulo studios was influenced in part by actress jennifer connelly according to latiegui runaways story was intended to be more adult and less zany than that of hollywood monsters while pendulo s previous game had been a parodical comedy team sought to give runaway a balance of humor and drama gerard masnou of gamelive pc noted pendulo s addition of violence strong language including and sexual themes to game s spanish script which contributed to its rating of 18 in spain latiegui said that runaways transgressive elements such as appearance of drug use stripping and drag queens were not for purpose of controversy but that they nevertheless alienated certain publishers in designing protagonists team conceived brian as a nerd whose look and personality would evolve because of his adventures in runaway while gina was intended to drive plot her design was particularly inspired by actresses natalia estrada and jennifer connelly latiegui explained that team s goal was to make gina really sexy and especially exuberant her character design proved to be a greater challenge than brian s and she underwent several redesigns before her model sheet was finalized in 2000 latiegui cited films as a greater inspiration than competing adventure games for runaway pendulo s staff self described as a group of movie fanatics and project manager ramon hernaez said that he had initially wanted to become a filmmaker rather than a game developer team purposely included references to films throughout runaway such as borrowed names and pastiches of famous scenes hernaez who was responsible for outlining much of runaways script and scenario added majority of these references among them are nods to close encounters of third kind great escape and durango adventures of priscilla queen of desert was another prominent influence despite impact of pulp fiction and raising arizona on script hernaez noted that two films were not among his personal favorites he compensated by including allusions to apartment quiet man and work of woody allen particularly manhattan murder mystery which supplied conceit for game s ending according to hernaez team added few personal references to runaway beyond names of two hackers mentioned by sushi who were named after hernaez s nieces runaway was co designed by latiegui hernaez and lead programmer felipe gomez pinilla pendulo s co founders they hoped to mimic design of classical adventure games particularly secret of monkey island and monkey island 2 lechuck s revenge both lucasarts adventure games and early work of sierra on line influenced game from start pendulo tried to move away from nonlinear design style used in hollywood monsters in favor of what latiegui called a more straightforward and less scattered linear format pendulo later opined that hollywood monsters openness had often led to stagnation for players instead team divided runaway into discrete chapters and sought to give game a clear difficulty curve that inclined gradually according to latiegui pendulo s primary goal with puzzles was simply to avoid players feel ing frustrated or stuck at any time for interface designers chose a traditional point and click setup as they found style more intuitive than direct character control reflex based action scenes were planned but pendulo rejected idea after testers judged them disruptive to overall experience team also sought to limit game s use of dialogue trees as pendulo believed them to be unpopular with players production runaway was pendulo s largest project to date and gerard masnou wrote that it was most ambitious graphic adventure ever developed in spain at time game s funding was derived entirely from spanish investments during production pendulo stated that spain s game industry had improved since its low point in 1990s although it was very far from living a golden age according to joan font of gamelive pc industry still suffered from a dearth of professional talent while runaway was in development spain s education system lacked courses for game development and country s existing industry professionals often migrated to foreign companies for better working conditions and pay as a result most of pendulo s staff on runaway consisted of who learned in part on job felipe gomez pinilla said that company asked prospective collaborators to have a classic drawing or animation foundation and to master programs they will be using game s team was small rafael latiegui said that runaway had nine core members during most of its creation assisted by a series of part timers on elements such as music programming was almost exclusively a solo effort by pinilla company also relied on external contractors for certain key tasks despite industry s limited workforce ramon hernaez said that pendulo had a relatively easy time finding talent soundtrack for runaway was composed by freelancer david garcia morales who had previously worked for pyro studios on music to commandos behind enemy lines he sought to give each of runaways areas a unique theme suited to its environments while ensuring that tracks had some connection to each other whether of harmony melody or rhythmic drums garcia morales later said that this balance of unity and difference was difficult pendulo s proprietary adaptive music engine mip music system was used to alter soundtrack based on in game events in addition to game s background music pendulo decided from very outset to give runaway a signature theme song according to latiegui goal was to increase game s similarity to films via inclusion of music with lyrics pendulo picked a stylistic direction for sung tracks and began to explore demo tapes from interested bands latiegui said that team by chance encountered a tape from musical act liquor sent in by garcia morales singer vera dominguez caught pendulo s attention which led to liquor s selection writing for micromania j a pascual compared band s resultant work for runaway to output of cranberries garcia morales hoped to raise liquor s profile with opportunity as he was personally invested in band s success like hollywood monsters and pendulo s earlier igor objective uikokahonia runaway began development with completely 2d graphics game maintained this style for a full year and to a very advanced stage of production according to spanish press most of 2d artwork was created by outside contractors under pendulo s supervision publisher dinamic multimedia publicly revealed runaway in 2d form during mid 1999 micromania reported that game looked like an authentic animated film one of that magazine s columnists called game s 2d visuals ready to compete side by side with greatest successes of lucasarts although pendulo completed entire first chapter of runaway in 2d animation proved to be a major challenge for team especially when it came to game s characters it was expensive and slow to produce latiegui later recalled that you wanted to have a cel in three days and instead it took three weeks to achieve intended quality animators struggled to keep their art on model latiegui said in 2007 when i see those drawings i still laugh because they are very curious as a result team deemed runaways 2d graphics unworkable hoping to find a solution pendulo began to experiment with modeling characters in polygonal 3d as team disliked realistic 3d art styles it was initially a struggle to find a suitable look and to match 3d characters to existing 2d backgrounds pendulo sought to make runaway s visuals reminiscent of comic books latiegui noted that he had grown up with spanish comics such as el vibora totem and company also used artists adam hughes and richard corben as reference points these considerations led pendulo to choose a non photorealistic rendering style never previously used by an adventure game despite its appearance in strategy title shadow watch pendulo pre rendered 3d character models to create sprites and then added more effects on top such as real time lighting and hand drawn tweaks to integrate items into world team created versions of background visuals both with and without items game switches between these images when an item is placed or removed latiegui later said that team was surprised that yes it could do something decent in 3d dinamic s alberto hernandez wrote that publisher was won over by first tests contractors responsible for 2d visuals were subsequently let go instead pendulo staffed up with a new group of full time artists pendulo proceeded to scrap all of 2d animated character art and to recreate game s cast in 3d based on existing character designs finished first chapter was then remade in new style to achieve runaways final look team used a combination of proprietary and third party software pascual wrote that pendulo used same procedure employed by then recent animated properties such as iron giant and futurama that similarly blended 2d and 3d artwork runaways graphical overhaul did not require a rewrite of existing game engine which was an upgraded version of hollywood monsters engine designed to feature full scene anti aliasing and a 1024 x 768 display resolution latiegui called support for this higher resolution logical given team s heavy focus on visuals element of runaway with which pendulo was happiest new style was nevertheless both challenging and time consuming to create and latiegui noted that team was trapped by limitations of 2d and those of 3d all at once pendulo struggled to find enough qualified 3d character animators in spain according to micromanias francisco delgado and hernaez wrote that quality of facial animation ultimately fell below his hopes runaways visual overhaul resulted in major delays originally due in early 2000 game entered a protracted development cycle and was for a time without an official release date which led to rumors throughout 2000 about game s status although it was projected by that august for a late 2000 release and was reportedly 90 complete by october game proceeded to miss its planned december 2000 launch adventure gamers eivind hagerup wrote that pendulo didn t want to rush game before christmas because this would lower quality of game while dinamic subsequently rescheduled runaway for mid january 2001 game encountered another string of delays through first half of 2001 which dinamic attributed to technical problems and discovery of major software bugs in his column for gamelive pc masnou wrote at time that runaways lengthy development and numerous delays were worrying signs and warned creators to release this game before we get tired of waiting and we just forget about it hernaez noted that team was unhappy with slow pace of development as it increased costs and devalued final product pre release praise for runaway was nevertheless high growing as development time extended in early 2001 alexander garcia of meristation reported that runaway had become one of spain s most anticipated graphic adventures as runaways production progressed through 2001 dinamic fell into financial turmoil publisher s ventures related to dot com bubble such as massively multiplayer online role playing game la prision had proven unsuccessful and dinamic was caught in global dot com collapse by early march rumors had spread that dinamic was in danger of closing company responded that only its online division was being shuttered and that runaway and its other traditional games were not in jeopardy however key faculty secretly departed dinamic to join pyro studios during period and dinamic entered receivership and cut 39 jobs in late march dinamic owed a significant debt of 1 5 billion pesetas to multiple creditors by this time in response to these issues dinamic pushed pendulo to rush runaways release because it needed money to stay afloat according to pinilla he noted that last months of game s development were difficult and he complained that dinamic did not provide necessary funds for a sufficient number of people to complete project while runaway ultimately went gold on june 25 2001 its final version contained serious bugs that required several patches pendulo reported that most of these bugs occurred for users with 15 bit video cards and took steps to address this issue distribution and sales debut and turmoil dinamic multimedia published runaway in spain on july 6 2001 shipped on three cd roms and at dinamic s standard list price of 3 995 pesetas game proceeded to sell well in spain during its initial months it was country s fourth best selling computer game in august gamespot spain reported that title had accrued healthy sales by that time it claimed 22nd on charts following month however game soon encountered problems on september 24 dinamic announced its liquidation following its financial upheaval earlier in year although certain commentators had speculated that runaways sales would save publisher it was ultimately dinamic s last published title at time reported dinamic s closure as bad news for battered spanish game software industry a writer for marcaplayer later called it probably most traumatic event that spanish video game industry has experienced in history this situation hurt runaways distribution and commercial performance in spain in retrospect rafael latiegui said that it had effect of blocking domestic sales and gerard masnou remarked that game went almost unnoticed because of dinamic s closure by gfk s measurements dinamic s release of runaway totaled 8 980 units sold domestically according to felipe gomez pinilla spanish adventure game developers relied on international sales to reach profitability as domestic market was too small to cover their costs none of pendulo s earlier titles had achieved international success and masnou called it a rarity for any spanish adventure game but team felt that runaway might break trend an english localization of runaway was initially announced for a simultaneous launch with spanish edition while italian and german releases were inked for fall 2001 however dinamic s downfall cast doubt on future of runaway outside spain latiegui remarked after dinamic s closure that unless a deal to repurchase game s rights emerged very quickly pendulo could follow its publisher into bankruptcy by mid october 2001 all international versions of runaway were placed on hold dubbing had not yet begun for german edition by that time pendulo proceeded to undertake lawsuits and engage publisher in a legal battle for rights a process that lasted roughly one year adventure gamers marek bronstring wrote that game was caught in limbo during this time pendulo struggled to stay solvent latiegui later called period an extreme challenge and company had to lay off majority of its staff to make payroll by november 2001 negotiations to release game in germany were ongoing and a fan petition to save runaway had begun international breakthrough pendulo studios finally secured rights to runaway in july 2002 game appeared in russia published by m in early august later that month pendulo announced that german language edition of runaway had been revived its publisher was revealed as dtp entertainment in early september by which time game was set for a november launch across german market germany switzerland and austria german translation had been completed and its dubbing work started by mid september retailer pre orders in german market quickly surpassed dtp s forecasts for czech edition pendulo signed with top distributor publisher that dinamic multimedia had originally contracted to bring runaway to czech republic pendulo and top began their translation effort before rights issue was resolved via an under table agreement and publisher received its first czech language beta edition in june 2002 czech translation took four months dubbing was completed in october runaways german and czech versions both went gold in november and releases followed on november 18 and in early december respectively thumb right dtp entertainment and focus home interactive characterized runaway as a revival of traditional graphic adventure games like earlier flight of amazon queen pictured that were seen at time as a declining genre in countries such as france and germany dtp entertainment supported runaway in germany with a heavy marketing campaign that characterized game as return of classic adventure according to publisher s chris kellner at time adventure games were perceived in countries such as germany and france as a declining genre runaway debuted at 9 on gfk s weekly computer game sales charts for german market and spent five consecutive months in media control s top 30 game s sales in german market surpassed 50 000 units within a year ultimately climbing to 60 000 kellner declared it a huge success for publisher following runaways debut in germany pendulo landed deals in december 2002 to release game in three more countries france with focus home interactive poland with interactive and united kingdom with gmx media all three were slated for spring 2003 like dtp focus home publicly labeled runaway return of traditional graphic adventure games

included french voice actors for cameron diaz tom cruise and will smith words of magic finished localization within two months in process adding jokes and references specific to france alongside new hints for certain puzzles runaway appeared in france on march 21 initial sales were strong game reached 3 on gfk s french charts and it remained in top 20 through july runaway ultimately maintained a six month streak on gfk s list similarly fnac reported runaway as its third best selling game across all platforms during april s first half and it continued to chart in store s top 30 through end of may in august lagarrigue called runaway a major hit for his company while securing these international deals pendulo worked in late 2002 and early 2003 on a remastered spanish version of runaway this time published by fx interactive in early 2002 two companies had collaborated on a re release of hollywood monsters changes to remastered runaway included a new box cover by luis royo increased video quality added hints for difficult puzzles a new voice over for gina redubbed by actress who voiced angelina jolie in spain and other updates pendulo and fx announced remastered version in january 2003

los mejores videojuegos del mundo mvm collection games that newspaper included with its sunday edition as optional purchases for eur5 each hollywood monsters had been included in successful 2002

in year focus home announced a french relaunch of runaway in a collector s edition bundle supported by a renewed marketing campaign this new edition appeared in early october despite runaways popularity in continental europe title s english edition struggled to reach shelves evan dickens of adventure gamers wrote that game stubbornly refused to find its way to an english translation gmx media s localization in united kingdom was beset by delays as 2003 progressed and it ultimately failed to materialize tri synergy s north american version remained without a scheduled release date by middle of that year it finally launched in united states on august 20 by january 2004 runaway had become an international commercial hit at time frank wrote that its sales totaled 400 000 units at full price and in europe alone ramon hernaez noted that game s sales are not explosive but they add up over time runaways largest markets were france and germany according to latiegui he added that it had not done badly at all in united states by february 2004 where its lifetime sales at brick and mortar retailers reached 12 928 units by end of month conversely richard moss of ars technica later wrote that runaway was one of many adventure games that barely made a mark in us but sold well in europe during late 1990s and 2000s runaway accrued roughly 500 000 global sales by march 2004 and remained dtp s best selling adventure game by that september in may 2006 gamesradar reported that runaway had totaled 600 000 sales in europe game and its sequel runaway 2 dream of turtle together had sold one million copies by april 2009 of these sales france accounted for 250 000 units reception spanish garnered positive reviews from spanish outlets such as micromania meristation and gamelive pc while pc actual declared it game of month it came in third place for gamelive pcs 2000 2001 best adventure game prize editors called runaway an adult game intelligent very well structured and rich in kinds of details that separate good craftsmanship from rest in meristations 2001 eme awards runaway received 14 1 of reader vote in best adventure game category which placed it third behind silent hill 2 and shenmue 2 micromanias j a pascual called runaway excellent arguing that it recaptured spirit of lucasarts style adventure games and disproved prevailing wisdom that traditional adventure games were dying gerard masnou of gamelive pc and reviewer for pc actual similarly described runaway as a bright spot for its genre masnou wrote that adventure game players have a new classic to hold on to following a few years of drifting pc actuals writer went further and hailed game as evidence alongside releases like commandos 2 men of courage and severance blade of darkness that high quality spanish game development in general was alberto de vega luna of meristation continued praise for runaway he found it to be a rare highlight for 2d adventure games a genre that unfortunately is disappearing from market however he felt that game was held back from essential status by severe bugs at launch which he cited as without any doubt runaways greatest flaw pascual found puzzles in runaway to be well balanced and perfectly logical luna and masnou concurred on puzzles quality although they declared them somewhat too easy all three writers lauded runaways visual presentation and pc actuals critic joined in complimenting graphics both technically and artistically while pc mania echoed praise for spectacular presentation magazine s reviewer argued that runaways principal character designs were overly similar to those of broken sword series masnou likewise criticized this aspect of pendulo s game he wrote that it looks too much like broken sword a problem that touched its premise and its style of gameplay in his view it was among runaways primary downsides alongside a general lack of innovation pascual cited broken sword similarities as a positive since he felt that runaways design melt s essence of its influences together and generates its own personality with result despite these comparisons to broken sword reviewers for micromania gamelive pc and pc mania all enjoyed runaways story third magazine s critic ultimately summarized runaway as a good title for everyone addicted to graphic adventures and of course for those who are just starting international reviews in france runaway was named one of four best computer games of 2003 at digital awards part of euro cyber games judging was handled by a panel that included representatives from sell and association des d oeuvres multimedia alongside journalists such as daniel and le figaros sebastien lubrano french websites jeuxvideo com and clubic praised runaways story characters music visuals puzzles and french localization writer also noted game s humor as a high point critics from both outlets dubbed runaway a savior of traditional adventure games although they faulted its pixelated and sometimes stiffly animated cutscenes despite echoing clubic and jeuxvideo com on classy visuals and excellent score writer for france s joystick summarized runaway as a failure breaking with others he found script middling and lambasted game design as execrable for him puzzles amounted to boring stupidity with numerous illogical leaps among german players runaway claimed a 97 recommendation rate in pc games reader polls according to magazine graphics and story were widely lauded by public although game was criticized for its brevity german critic georg valtin of gamestar offered runaway a positive review while pc games david bergmann and pc actions tanja bunke declared it superior to grim fandango all three writers praised runaways story humor and visuals and cited game as a return to form for its genre three similarly enjoyed game s puzzle design despite bergmann s dislike for its frustrating pixel hunts and valtin s criticism that certain puzzles require guessing joining jeuxvideo com and clubic bergmann also docked runaway points for its pixelated blurry cutscene sequences nevertheless discussing german localization effort both bergmann and valtin offered strong praise summarizing game bunke hailed it as current non plus ultra of adventure games and bergmann wrote that it was undoubtedly best adventure of year 2002 runaway met with a love it or hate it reaction upon its english release according to jack allin of adventure gamers game s reception was mixed or average among outlets surveyed by metacritic it was panned by computer gaming world whose dana jongewaard dismissed runaway as bimbo of graphic adventure games both pretty and stupid despite praising its visuals and finding its voice acting and storyline adequate she condemned maddening frustration and repetition of its puzzles chuck osborn of pc gamer us followed jongewaard on runaways graphics and puzzle logic but broke with her on plot and voice acting latter of which he called one of game s worst elements declaring runaway a who s who of point and click adventure game pitfalls osborn denounced its use of stereotypes such as a japanese caricature right out of a wwii era bugs bunny cartoon both writers warned all but biggest adventure game fans to run away from runaway by contrast game informer and gamespot characterized runaway as a solid if flawed entry in its genre gamespots brad shoemaker liked story and called visuals a treat but deemed puzzles voice acting and humor uneven game informers lisa mason similarly highlighted stylish clean and fresh visuals and found characters to be great however with shoemaker she disliked unevenness of puzzles and voice acting jeremy zoss of game informer summarized it s no day of tentacle but it ll do a sentiment echoed by shoemaker legacy while pendulo studios stopped creating games after dinamic multimedia s closure rafael latiegui said in early 2003 that developer could recover if runaway sold well enough he noted that pendulo never stopped having development ideas so everything depends on sales of runaway game s hit status in europe ultimately revived company and felipe gomez pinilla dubbed runaway a turning point for pendulo it was pendulo s global breakthrough a writer for meristation called it one of most discussed and beloved graphic adventures by adventurers around world in 2018 meristation reported that runaway series remained one of most famous spanish game products in european union runaways success enabled pendulo to rehire most of its layoffs from dinamic turmoil and pendulo proceeded to become spain s longest running game developer by 2019 it has been named a major force in spanish games particularly in adventure genre in 2015 researchers victor manuel martinez and manuel garin cited runaway as start of pendulo s own brand of adventure games pendulo s josue monchan similarly said that company found its voice with project its later games reused runaways cartoonish aesthetic which marcaplayer deemed a pendulo hallmark by 2011 runaways popularity during a period of decline for traditional adventure games became evidence in game industry that genre could still succeed jack allin of adventure gamers wrote in 2012 that runaway was cited as one of games that helped catapult genre back into an era of relative prominence martin of house of tales called it practically impossible to interest publishers in adventure games during early 2000s but he argued that charming titles like runaway recaptured many hearts and minds in france nicolas magnier of gaming side offered a similar account hamburg chamber of commerce s hamburger wirtschaft magazine reported that runaway revived its genre overnight while a writer for jeuxvideo com stated that it marked rebirth of genre other
