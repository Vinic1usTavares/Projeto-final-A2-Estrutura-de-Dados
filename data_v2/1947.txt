wilson s disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up in body symptoms are typically related to brain and liver liver related symptoms include vomiting weakness fluid build up in abdomen swelling of legs yellowish skin and itchiness brain related symptoms include tremors muscle stiffness trouble speaking personality changes anxiety and seeing or hearing things that others do not wilson s disease is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in wilson disease protein atp7b gene for a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of gene from each parent diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests urine tests and a liver biopsy genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected wilson s disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d penicillamine and zinc supplements complications of wilson s disease can include liver failure liver cancer and kidney problems a liver transplant may be helpful in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs wilson s disease occurs in about 1 in 30 000 people symptoms usually begin between ages of 5 and 35 years and males and females are equally affected it was first described in 1854 by friedrich theodor von and is named after samuel wilson signs and symptoms main sites of copper accumulation are liver and brain and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are main features that lead to diagnosis people with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier generally as children or teenagers than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms who tend to be in their twenties or older some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with wilson s disease many of these when tested turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of condition but have not received a diagnosis liver disease liver disease may present itself as tiredness increased bleeding tendency or confusion due to hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension latter a condition in which pressure in portal vein is markedly increased leads to esophageal blood vessels in esophagus that may bleed in a life threatening fashion as well as enlargement of spleen and accumulation of fluid in abdominal cavity ascites on examination signs of chronic liver disease such as spider small distended blood vessels usually on chest may be observed chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of liver in most by time they develop symptoms while most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma liver cancer this risk is relatively very low in wilson s disease about 5 of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure often in context of a hemolytic anemia anemia due to destruction of red blood cells this leads to abnormalities in protein production identified by deranged coagulation and metabolism by liver deranged protein metabolism leads to accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in bloodstream when these irritate brain person develops hepatic encephalopathy confusion coma seizures and finally life threatening swelling of brain neuropsychiatric symptoms about half people with wilson s disease have neurological or psychiatric symptoms most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness as well as changes in behavior specific neurological symptoms usually then follow often in form of parkinsonism cogwheel rigidity or slowed movements and a lack of balance are most common features with or without a typical hand tremor masked facial expressions slurred speech ataxia lack of coordination or dystonia twisting and repetitive movements of part of body seizures and migraine appear to be more common in wilson s disease a characteristic tremor described as wing beating tremor is encountered in many people with wilson s this is absent at rest but can be provoked by extending arms cognition can also be affected in wilson s disease this comes in two not mutually exclusive categories frontal lobe disorder may present as impulsivity impaired judgement promiscuity apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making and subcortical dementia may present as slow thinking memory loss and executive dysfunction without signs of aphasia apraxia or agnosia it is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of disease psychiatric problems due to wilson s disease may include behavioral changes depression anxiety disorders and psychosis psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own these symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes because of this diagnosis of wilson s disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present other organ systems thumb sunflower cataract and thick kf ring of a 40 years old male with wilson s disease and thumb right diffuse illumination of cornea thumb right copper disposition on corneal descemet s membrane medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in wilson s disease eyes kayser fleischer rings kf rings a pathognomonic sign may be visible in cornea of eyes either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around cornea they are due to copper deposition in descemet s membrane they do not occur in all people with wilson s disease wilson s disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of anterior and posterior lens capsule neither cause significant visual loss kf rings occur in approximately 66 of diagnosed cases more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems kidneys renal tubular acidosis type 2 a disorder of bicarbonate handling by proximal tubules leads to calcium accumulation in kidneys a weakening of bones due to calcium and phosphate loss and occasionally aminoaciduria loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis heart cardiomyopathy weakness of heart muscle is a rare but recognized problem in wilson s disease it may lead to heart failure fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function and cardiac arrhythmias episodes of irregular and or abnormally fast or slow heart beat hormones failure of parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels infertility and recurrent miscarriage genetics thumb wilson s disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance wilson s disease gene atp7b has been mapped to chromosome 13 3 and is expressed primarily in liver kidney and placenta gene codes for a p type cation transport enzyme atpase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin mutations can be detected in 90 of cases most 60 are homozygous for atp7b mutations two abnormal copies and 30 have only one abnormal copy ten percent have no detectable mutation although 300 mutations of atp7b have been described in most populations cases of wilson s disease are due to a small number of mutations specific for that population for instance in western populations h1069q mutation replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in protein is present in 37 63 of cases while in china this mutation is very uncommon and arginine to leucine at 778 is found more often relatively little is known about relative impact of various mutations although h1069q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems according to some studies a normal variation in gene can modify course of disease by delaying age of onset and affecting type of symptoms that develop this gene produces prion protein which is active in brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper a role for gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern in order to inherit it both of parents of an individual must carry an affected gene most have no family history of condition people with only one abnormal gene are called carriers heterozygotes and may have mild but medically insignificant abnormalities of copper metabolism wilson s disease is most common from a group of hereditary diseases that cause copper overload in liver all can cause cirrhosis at a young age other members of group are indian childhood cirrhosis icc endemic tyrolean infantile cirrhosis and idiopathic copper toxicosis these are not related to atp7b mutations for example icc has been linked to mutations in and gene pathophysiology thumb normal absorption and distribution of copper cu copper cp ceruloplasmin green atp7b carrying copper copper is needed by body for a number of functions predominantly as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin cytochrome c oxidase dopamine b hydroxylase superoxide dismutase and tyrosinase copper enters body through digestive tract a transporter protein on cells of small bowel copper membrane transporter 1 carries copper inside cells where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by atox1 to an organelle known as trans golgi network here in response to rising concentrations of copper an enzyme called releases copper into portal vein to liver liver cells also carry protein and metallothionein and atox1 bind it inside cell but here it is atp7b that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into bloodstream as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile both functions of atp7b are impaired in wilson s disease copper accumulates in liver tissue ceruloplasmin is still secreted but in a form that lacks copper termed and is rapidly degraded in bloodstream when amount of copper in liver overwhelms proteins that normally bind it it causes oxidative damage through a process known as fenton chemistry this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis fibrosis deposition of connective tissue and cirrhosis liver also releases copper into bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin this free copper precipitates throughout body but particularly in kidneys eyes and brain in brain most copper is deposited in basal ganglia particularly in putamen and globus pallidus together called lenticular nucleus these areas normally participate in coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as processing of stimuli and mood regulation damage to these areas again by fenton chemistry produces neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in wilson s disease it is not clear why wilson s disease causes hemolysis but various lines of evidence suggest that a high level of free non ceruloplasmin bound copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of hemoglobin inhibition of energy supplying enzymes in red blood cell or direct damage to cell membrane diagnosis thumb location of basal ganglia part of brain affected by wilson s disease wilson s disease may be suspected on basis of any of symptoms mentioned above or when a close relative has been found to have wilson s most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase and bilirubin level if liver damage is significant albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein likewise prothrombin time a test of coagulation may be prolonged as liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with wilson s related acute liver failure if there are neurological symptoms magnetic resonance imaging mri of brain is usually performed this shows in part of brain called basal ganglia in t2 setting mri may also demonstrate characteristic face of giant panda pattern there is no totally reliable test for wilson s disease but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in blood as well of amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24 hour period are together used to form an impression of amount of copper in body gold standard or most ideal test is a liver biopsy ceruloplasmin thumb ceruloplasmin levels of ceruloplasmin are abnormally low 0 2 g l in 80 95 of cases it can however be present at normal levels in people with ongoing inflammation as it is an acute phase protein low ceruloplasmin is also found in menkes disease and which are related to but much rarer than wilson s disease combination of neurological symptoms kayser fleischer rings and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for diagnosis of wilson s disease in many cases however further tests are needed serum and urine copper serum copper is low which may seem paradoxical given that wilson s disease is a disease of copper excess however 95 of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in wilson s disease urine copper is elevated in wilson s disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper free liner levels above 100 mg 24h 1 6 mmol 24h confirm wilson s disease and levels above 40 mg 24h 0 6 mmol 24h are strongly indicative high urine copper levels are not unique to wilson s disease they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in any disease obstructing flow of bile from liver to small bowel in children penicillamine test may be used a 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered and urine collected for 24 hours if this contains more than 1600 mg 25 mmol it is a reliable indicator of wilson s disease this test has not been validated in adults liver biopsy once other investigations have indicated wilson s disease ideal test is removal of a small amount of liver tissue through a liver biopsy this is assessed microscopically for degree of steatosis and cirrhosis and and quantification of copper are used to measure severity of copper accumulation a level of 250 mg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms wilson s disease occasionally lower levels of copper are found in that case combination of biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of wilson s in earlier stages of disease biopsy typically shows steatosis deposition of fatty material increased glycogen in nucleus and areas of necrosis cell death in more advanced disease changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis such as infiltration by inflammatory cells piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis scar tissue in advanced disease finally cirrhosis is main finding in acute liver failure degeneration of liver cells and collapse of liver tissue architecture is seen typically on a background of changes methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis genetic testing mutation analysis of atp7b gene as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in liver may be performed once a mutation is confirmed it is possible to screen family members for disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling regional distributions of genes associated with wilson s disease are important to follow as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies since mutations of wd gene vary between populations research and genetic testing done in countries like usa or united kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations treatment diet in general a diet low in copper containing foods is recommended with avoidance of mushrooms nuts chocolate dried fruit liver sesame seeds and sesame oil and shellfish medication medical treatments are available for wilson s disease some increase removal of copper from body while others prevent absorption of copper from diet generally penicillamine is first treatment used this binds copper chelation and leads to excretion of copper in urine hence monitoring of amount of copper in urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken penicillamine is not without problems about 20 experience a side effect or complication of penicillamine treatment such as drug induced lupus causing joint pains and a skin rash or myasthenia a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness in those who presented with neurological symptoms almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms while this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for wilson s it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second line treatment those intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride which also has chelating properties some recommend trientine as first line treatment but experience with penicillamine is more extensive a further agent under clinical investigation by wilson therapeutics with known activity in wilson s disease is tetrathiomolybdate this is regarded as experimental though some studies have shown a beneficial effect once all results have returned to normal zinc usually in form of a zinc acetate prescription called may be used instead of to maintain stable copper levels in body zinc stimulates metallothionein a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents their absorption and transport to liver zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if urinary excretion of copper increases in rare cases where none of oral treatments are effective especially in severe neurological disease dimercaprol british anti lewisite is occasionally necessary this treatment is injected intramuscularly into a muscle every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain people who are asymptomatic for instance those diagnosed through family screening or only as a result of abnormal test results are generally treated as copper accumulation may cause long term damage in future it is unclear whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate physical and occupational therapies physiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial for patients with neurologic form of disease copper chelating treatment may take up to six months to start working and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia dystonia and tremors as well as preventing development of contractures that can result from dystonia transplantation liver transplantation is an effective cure for wilson s disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of risks and complications associated with procedure it is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness in which its benefit has not been demonstrated prognosis left untreated wilson s disease tends to become progressively worse and is eventually fatal with early detection and treatment most of those affected can live relatively normal lives liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve but it is often permanent history disease bears name of british physician samuel alexander wilson 1878 1937 a neurologist who described condition including pathological changes in brain and liver in 1912 wilson s work had been predated by and drew on reports from german neurologist carl westphal in 1883 who termed it by british neurologist william gowers in 1888 by finnish neuropathologist ernst alexander in 1889 1892 who noted hereditary nature of disease and by adolph in 1898 who noted hepatic cirrhosis neuropathologist john nathaniel cumings made link with copper accumulation in both liver and brain in 1948 occurrence of hemolysis was noted in 1967 cumings and simultaneously new zealand neurologist derek denny brown working in united states first reported effective treatment with metal chelator british anti lewisite in 1951 this treatment had to be injected but was one of first therapies available in field of neurology a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer first effective oral chelation agent penicillamine was discovered in 1956 by british neurologist john walshe in 1982 walshe also introduced trientine and was first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in netherlands where physicians and used it in 1961 and in 1970s respectively but it was further developed later by brewer and colleagues at university of michigan genetic basis of wilson s disease and linkage to atp7b mutations was elucidated in 1980s and 1990s by several research groups other animals hereditary copper accumulation has been described in bedlington terriers where it generally only affects liver it is due to mutations in commd1 or gene despite this
