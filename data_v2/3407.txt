crossroads corn street and its later extension clare street runs downhill approximately south westwards to centre corn street contains many historic buildings for centuries it was at centre of bristol s commerce and administration but in recent years has increasingly turned to market shopping leisure and accommodation history thumb robert ricart s map of bristol in 1479 corn street is shown running south west from high cross alta crux corn street together with broad street wine street and high street formed earliest nucleus of bristol ricart s plan of 1479 one of first english town plans shows corn street with high cross at one end and st leonard s gate at other other three cross streets are also shown each ending at their own gate in city wall origins of name corn street are uncertain but simplest explanation that corn was traded here appears to be most likely a corn market was held in exchange from 1813 but as street was known as old corn street at beginning of 13th century it seems that corn was bought and sold here from street s earliest history commerce and banking corn street was a centre of trade from 13th century and at heart of bristol s banking business from 18th century a merchants tolzey or a meeting place or exchange where commercial business was done was built alongside all saints church soon after 1550 between columns of this colonnade were sited nine brass tables known as nails mostly dated between 1625 and 1631 four of these were moved to their current location in front of exchange when merchants tolzey was taken down in 1782 and a wing of exchange built on site popular belief that phrase to pay on nail or cash on nail derives from bristol merchants settling deals on these tables is untrue origin of phrase predates bristol nails by centuries nonetheless tourist guides continue to keep story alive exchange was a business centre incorporating a coffee house a tavern a number of business houses and even a barber s shop in 1813 alterations were made to john wood elder s original designs when it became corn exchange and in 1872 central courtyard was covered over this roof was replaced at a lower level in 1949 commercial rooms founded in 1810 at no 43 corn street was a gentlemen s club for mercantile interests its first president was john loudon mcadam a weather vane indicator still in place advised on arrival of shipping in early 18th century bristol corporation s banking business was looked after as was common at time by a goldsmith john vaughan father of bristol banking did business in dutch house which stood on corner of high street and wine street opposite old council house in 1750 bristol bank first full banking partnership in bristol opened at 42 broad street this became known as old bank when miles bank opened in 1752 in 1776 it moved to clare street and then in 1798 it moved to what became 35 corn street other banks followed harford bank started in small street in 1769 but moved to corn street in 1799 bristol city bank was established in exchange buildings all saints passage in 1794 national provincial bank later to become part of rbs group moved to 31 corn street in 1863 stuckey s bank started on broad quay moved to john vaughan s old premises at dutch house and finally succumbed to lure of corn street by moving there in 1854 in 1857 west of england and south wales district bank built its headquarters based on st mark s library in venice at 55 corn street this was site of bush coaching inn where meeting at which bank was instituted had been held 23 years earlier this bank collapsed in 1878 and its premises were eventually taken by lloyds in 20th century further banks set up branches or city offices on corn street martins bank opened at 47 corn street in 1938 whilst coutts bank came to 38 corn street in 1977 administration first council house was built in 1552 on site of chapel of st john part of st ewen s church near corner of corn street and broad street this consisted of tolzey or mayor s tolzey a portico supported by 5 pillars with a council chamber behind here or in merchants tolzey opposite bristol corporation held its deliberations sometimes assisted by leading merchants corporation s business outgrew both council house and tolzey and in 1657 a private house at corner of broad street was acquired to provide more office space in 1704 tolzey was demolished and a new enlarged council house was built this in turn gave way to current old council house building in 1823 robert smirke s original design for this was for a much larger building incorporating site of guildhall but these plans were scaled down because street needed widening which left insufficient room old council house acted as a focus for protest much as does college green where its present day equivalent stands today in 1752 corn street was descended on by a riotous and formidable mob of colliers and country people from kingswood and adjacent parts angry at scarcity of corn they smashed windows of council house and exchange plundered a corn ship and brought trade to a halt citizens rallied behind mayor but it took a week to quell riot and lives were lost old council house was target of another attack in 1831 during riots sparked by arrival in bristol of anti reform recorder sir charles wetherell after mob had smashed around 100 panes of glass captain gage of 14th dragoons rode up with orders to do what he thought necessary to defend council house he sabre charged rioters through high street broad street and wine street eight of them were badly hurt and one person possibly an innocent ostler returning from his stable was shot and killed in february 1932 4000 demonstrators processed to old council house where councillors were discussing a reduction in unemployment benefit their deputation was refused admittance and ultimately mounted police and batons were used reportedly injuring 30 demonstrators and some police later that year a deputation stormed council chamber following their decision to cut relief a baton charge by police allowed councillors to escape from crowd this building was extended in 1827 and again in 1899 in 1883 council house rearrangement committee suggested building grand new offices on a site made by roofing over river frome between stonebridge and drawbridge where present day magpie park was made but council settled for rearranging furniture instead by mid 20th century it was finally determined to move to a new site and in 1952 council relocated to what is now city hall on college green this building it may be noted has a moat worship there were once three churches in corn street st leonard s which stood over st leonard s gate or westgate at end of corn street st werburgh s on corner of small street and all saints near corner of high street of these only all saints survives in its original location in 1770 two years after completion of new bristol bridge st leonard s church was taken down with tower and blind gate under it this cleared way to extend corn street down to quayside at what is now centre work began on construction of this new street clare street in 1771 st werburgh s church is unusual in that it has been made redundant twice in two different locations in 1877 it was decided that church would far better serve its purpose in such a district as baptist mills removing church would also allow for road widening at junction of corn street and small street last service was held on 12 august of that year church was taken down and parts of it most notably tower were re erected in mina road in area now known as st werburghs church became redundant again in 1988 but has found new use as an indoor climbing centre all saints church with its distinctive cupola was once home to this brotherhood of clergy and laity assembled a library to which public had free access at certain times so possibly earliest public library in england library contained some 800 books mostly relating to anglo saxon antiquity and law but was lost to a fire in 1466 robert ricart from whose work maire of bristowe is kalendar ricart s plan is taken was a member of this brotherhood all saints contains ornate tomb of prominent
