operation camargue was one of largest operations by french far east expeditionary corps and vietnamese national army in first indochina war it took place from 28 july until 10 august 1953 french armored platoons airborne units and troops delivered by landing craft to coast of central annam modern day vietnam attempted to sweep forces of communist viet minh from critical route one first landings took place in early morning on 28 july and reached first objectives an inland canal without major incident a secondary phase of mopping up operations began in a labyrinth of tiny villages where french armored forces suffered a series of ambushes fall 151 reinforced by paratroopers french and their vietnamese allies tightened a net around defending viet minh but delays in movement of french forces left gaps through which most of viet minh guerillas and many of arms caches operation was expected to seize escaped for french this validated claim that it was impossible to operate tight ensnaring operations in vietnam s jungle due to slow movement of their troops and a foreknowledge by enemy which was difficult to prevent from then on french focused on creating strong fortified positions against which viet minh general giap could pit his forces culminating in operation castor and battle of dien bien phu fall 171 173 with french forces withdrawn from operation by late summer of 1953 viet minh regiment 95 re infiltrated route one and resumed ambushes of french convoys retrieving weapons caches missed by french forces regiment 95 occupied area for remainder of first indochina war and were still operating there as late as 1962 against south vietnamese army during second indochina or vietnam war background first indochina war had raged as guerrilla warfare since 19 december 1946 from 1949 it evolved into conventional warfare due largely to aid from communists of people s republic of china prc to north chen jian 85 87 subsequently french strategy of occupying small poorly defended outposts throughout indochina particularly along vietnamese chinese border started failing giap 119 thanks to terrain popular support for august revolution and support for decolonization from bordering china and u s s r viet minh had succeeded in turning a clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army windrow 2004 41 42 following asymmetric warfare theory laid by mao tse tung something which previously had never been encountered by western colonial powers fall 17 in october 1952 fighting around red river delta spread into thai highlands resulting in battle of na san at which viet minh were defeated french used lessons learned at na san strong ground bases versatile air support and a model based on british burma campaign as basis for their new strategy viet minh however remained unbeatable in highland regions of vietnam windrow 2004 121 and french could not offset fundamental disadvantages of a army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests windrow 2004 129 in may 1953 general henri navarre arrived to take command of french forces replacing general raoul navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in indochina based on strong fast moving forces and media quickly took operation camargue to be practical realization of that chinese and american backing following communist victory in chinese civil war in 1949 viet minh established close ties with china it enabled chinese to expand their area of influence into indochina and viet minh to receive much needed chinese equipment and strategic planning support from mid 1950 prc military advisers were seconded to viet minh at battalion regimental and divisional levels chen jian 91 common border meant that china became a sanctuary where viet minh could be trained and refitted when korean war broke out indochina became an important pawn in cold war strategy in december 1950 united states concerned about growing chinese communist influence started providing military aid to french with a first payment of us 15 million cogan 61 62 in spring of 1953 viet minh launched campaigns in laos and succeeded in linking up laotian territorial gains with their bases in north western vietnam chen jian 98 99 meanwhile winding down of korean war meant that china was able to give much more attention to its southern neighbour similarly us released from its heavy burden in korean conflict dramatically increased its military and financial support to french by june 1953 us had sent 1 224 tanks and combat vehicles 120 792 rifles and machine guns more than 200 million rifle and machine gun cartridges more than five million artillery projectiles 302 boats and 304 aircraft by end of war total us aid amounted to nearly four billion dollars prelude to battle thumb left a model of a typical viet minh ambush using information from bernard fall s street without joy 1961 route one also known as route coloniale one or rc1 had been main north south artery along coastline of vietnam since outbreak of violence in 1949 communications and convoys along these lines suffered from regular attacks by viet minh irregulars windrow 2004 102 despite efforts by french during 1952 in operation dunstan 9 viet minh paramilitary forces around route one originated mainly from a region of fortified villages dispersed along sand dunes and salt marshes between hue to south and quang tri to north fall 144 french forces had suffered from viet minh ambushes an attack that latter had become very proficient at throughout war most notably in annihilation of group mobile 42 in 1950 and of gm 100 in 1954 fall 242 roads in vietnam were almost all closed during night and abandoned to enemy between 1952 and 1954 398 armored vehicles were destroyed 84 of them from mines and booby traps fall 354 typically viet minh ambushed convoys by obstructing road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders and then destroying first and last vehicles of halted convoy with remote mines dunstan 15 caltrops mines and steep cliff faces naturally found at road side aided in funneling target convoy into a small area where machine guns mortars and recoilless rifles were trained fall 54 viet minh regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics inflicting severe losses on french forces passing along route one which led to its french nickname of la rue sans joie street without joy regiment 95 was along with regiments 18 and 101 part of viet minh division 325 commanded by general tran quy ha division was formed in 1951 from pre existing units in thua thien just north of route one and became operational in summer of 1952 by early summer 1953 thanks in part to wind down of hostilities in korean war french command had sufficient reserves at hand to begin clearing viet minh back from route one they assembled 30 battalions two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of largest operations of conflict called operation camargue it was named for sandy marshland to west of marseille france difficult terrain was to prove decisive factor and gave a major advantage to one viet minh regiment tasked with defending route one thumb left french soldiers fight off a viet minh ambush in 1952 ambushes cost french nearly 400 armoured vehicles between 1952 and 1954 from a deep beach of hard sand french landing forces were to advance through a series of dunes dunes were up to high and interspersed with precipices ditches and a handful of small villages beyond this was an belt of pagodas and temples which war correspondent bernard fall described as having excellent defensive potential beyond these temples was route one itself with a series of closely packed and fortified villages including tan an my thuy van trinh and lai ha fall 146 this network of villages and hedgerows made both ground and air surveillance difficult across from route one villages continued amid an area of quicksand swamps and bogs which would stop all but a few of vehicles at disposal of french although there were roads most were mined or damaged throughout area civilian population remained and provided a further complication for french high command fall 147 french order of battle french divided their forces into four mobiles mobile groups a through d group a consisted of mobile group 14 which contained 3rd amphibious group 2nd marine commando 2nd battalion 1st colonial parachute regiment and 3rd vietnamese parachute battalion operation camargue was to be one of final proving grounds for use of french armour during war dunstan 23 it was to land on beach in line with center of route one meanwhile group b was to advance over land from west of north east facing beach this group consisted of mobile group central vietnam s 6th moroccan spahis 2nd amphibious group a tank platoon from 1st foreign cavalry regiment and two infantry companies from quang tri military base group c was to advance from south west into back of van trinh through swamps and consisted of 9th moroccan tabor 27th vietnamese infantry battalion 2nd battalion of 4th moroccan rifle regiment 1 commando a tank platoon of moroccan colonials an armoured patrol boat platoon and an lcm platoon group d consisted of 3rd battalion of 3rd algerian rifles 7th amphibious group and a commando group and was to land at south east end of beach below group a fall 144 146 these forces in total formed two amphibious forces three land borne and one airborne force all of which was commanded by general leblanc securing route one french landing thumb lvt 4s like these ferried french troops during operation camargue here lvt 4s are pictured carrying american marines to beaches of iwo jima on 27 july 1953 french landing craft departed from their assembly points and by 04 00 on following had begun disembarking 160 amphibious landing craft belonging to group a s 3rd amphibious opposite coastline by 06 00 these vehicles had landed on beach and proceeded to occupy sand ridges overlooking dunes beyond proceeding into dunes vehicles of 3rd amphibious became stuck in sand in meantime other regular infantry elements of group a were experiencing more difficulties in sea taking two extra hours to reach beach thus unsupported elements of 3rd amphibious that either disembarked floundering vehicles or were pushed managed to escape dunes and advance between tan an and my thuy fall 149 french amphibious vehicles were world war ii era 29 c cargo carriers nicknamed crab or and lvt 4 or 4as known as alligators latter were armed with two and two browning machine guns and an m20 recoilless rifle dunstan 21 while alligators were sufficiently armoured and well suited to water they struggled on land in contrast crab had difficulty in water and its large size presented too great a target on land however it was lighter and more maneuverable fall 148 except in paddy fields where its suspension became clogged with vegetation dunstan 20 while group a s forward elements were breaching dune barrier unopposed two of group b s battalions crossed van trinh canal by 07 45 when they made visual contact with crabs and alligators of group a they had succeeded in sealing off northern escape route of by 08 30 6th moroccan spahis also reached canal having had difficulty crossing swamps on landward side with their m24 chaffee tanks no french units as yet had made any major contact with viet minh a minor fire fight had taken place on southern edge of advance when an algerian company exchanged fire with 20 30 viet minh and suffered first french fatalities fall 150 simultaneously had advanced into center of area of operation and executed most complicated maneuver of operation this involved crossing route one and sealing off land side of operational area and was completed by 08 30 group d finally was tasked with advancing south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between sea and an inland lagoon towards city of hue landing at 04 30 group made quick progress through beach and dunes secured small city of chi dong and hit north coast of lagoon by 05 30 thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact final act of sealing noose was to move some of french navy vessels north to vietnamese villages of ba lang and an hoi where any attempt by regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place tightening loop thumb pro french vietnamese soldiers like these shown here treating a viet minh prisoner formed part of french landing forces in operation camargue with landings and encirclement of regiment 95 complete and net deemed secure french forces began second phase of operation and began to sweep through area for encircled viet minh each french group began to move through villages around route one in an attempt to locate viet minh forces group b which was lined up along canal jump off point for second phase of operation moved to sweep northern villages while group c did same further south method of searching each village was to seal it off entirely with encircling troops and then inspect it with a heavily armed unit of minesweepers and k 9 teams men of military age were arrested and screened by intelligence officers this process was time consuming and by 11 00 group b had traveled through network of villages with no results or resistance at this time 6th moroccan spahis entered village of dong que with their m 24 tanks and support of 1st battalion of moroccan rifles and artillery of colonel piroth later commander of artillery at battle of dien bien phu and his 69th african artillery regiment windrow 2004 309 thumb left m24 chaffee tanks accompanied french in operation camargue though they have a top speed of 25 mph 40 km h off road french found progress particularly slow in boggy landscape inland of route one moroccan infantry took lead and french commanders sealed themselves in their tank turrets and advanced behind viet minh forces which were waiting in ambush fired almost same instant as lead moroccan units who noticed their presence moroccan forces spread out into surrounding rice paddies and bazookas of viet minh missed french tanks french commander called in piroth s artillery and dong que disintegrated under impact of their high angle fire particularly when a french shell found viet minh ammunition depot fall 162 as french tanks approached viet minh drove civilians out to clog up entrance to village however as viet minh retreated they were spotted through civilians by moroccan infantry and killed by 13 00 during this battle however most of regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards southern end of french encirclement leblanc had realized intentions of regiment 95 s commander and had requested one of two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at border between network of temples and dune filled area in front of where group d had originally landed this paratroop unit 2nd battalion of 1st colonial parachute regiment began to advance towards canal at 10 45 15 minutes before group b entered dong que group c s 9th tabor had also like m 24s of group b struggled through marshes during first phase of operation and were late in arriving at jumping off point for phase two canal at 08 45 moroccan units of group c were investigating village of phu an on opposite side of lagoon from group d s landing area when they came under heavy fire despite being nearer to group d engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in group c who were by now some distance away further inland this delay coupled with failure of many of units radios meant that these advance elements of group c failed to get through until 09 10 at 09 40 commander of group c called up various reinforcements from hue including two companies of vietnamese trainee ncos and five infantry companies two of which came via landing craft and did not reach beleaguered elements of group c until 18 00 half an hour after moroccans had finally counter attacked and occupied phu an fall 164 2nd battalion of parachute chasseurs 2004 236 windrow 1998 44 had been requested to drop at 14 00 to support advanced elements of group c but did not jump until 16 50 and thus failed to assemble before moroccans themselves occupied phu an fall 165 with final capture of phu an extreme southern tip of encirclement pincer movement was complete fall 166 escape of regiment 95 thumb french troops sweeping paddy fields similar to those through which regiment 95 escaped by 17 30 with phu an captured all french reserves now committed and one half of pocket fully swept by groups b and a at northern end of battlefield french appeared to have gained upper hand by now expected windfall of arms caches and prisoners should have taken place however unexpected time taken to capture phu an and delayed arrival of paratroop reinforcements who had been scattered by winds had left a gap between phu an and southern edge of lagoon this gap was eventually covered by only four french battalions leaving gaps through which viet minh could escape crabs and alligators were stationed on or in some cases in canal network and french infantry were scattered across edge of pocket throughout that night in order to detect escaping viet minh however despite occasional shot flare and searchlight no viet minh were detected fall 167 on morning of 29 july 1953 french forces continued to advance into remaining pocket encountering neither viet minh nor civilian times 1953a 5 groups a b and d reached edge of canal opposite group c by 13 00 having retrieved a small number of suspected viet minh and a few weapons fall 168 at this time however a morane aircraft detected movement of elements of regiment 95 towards an hoi on extreme northern corner of operational area outside of pocket french carried out a raid on an hoi by commando groups and elements of group a which took place at 15 00 and returned with suspected viet minh by 18 00 french then undertook a methodical house to house search of entire area sweeping each village and surrounding paddy fields and jungle risking encounter with viet minh caltrops meanwhile 2nd and 3rd amphibious used their crabs and alligators to herd prisoners towards trung an for interrogation by end of 29 july with resistance to french forces having ceased a general withdrawal of paratroopers amphibious groups and marines began times 1953b 7 fall 169 aftermath rebuilding and reaction after departure of all but regular french infantry efforts to make area suitable for permanent occupation by french forces and french friendly civilians began this involved rebuilding of road and rail links vietnam s north south railway ran alongside route one repairing of infrastructure demining installation of new vietnamese government administrators and provision of everything from rice to anti malaria tablets fall 170 over 24 villages were placed under authority of vietnamese government and regiment 95 had been driven from area chaliand 132 in comparison to fall south vietnamese general lam quang thi states in his memoirs that operation camargue was one of most successful french military operations during indochina war in area of route one thi 337 newspapers stated that operation had been a total success demonstrating once more new aggressiveness and mobility of french forces however in days following end of fighting press reports on french failure to capture anticipated large numbers of viet minh began to appear though british newspaper times did publish claimed casualty figures of 1 550 for viet minh 200 of which were killed this estimate was altered by french next day to 600 killed or wounded and 900 captured and it was suggested that operation did not appear to have been successful times 1953c 5 in contrast to these figures bernard fall records 182 viet minh casualties and 387 prisoners he also notes that 51 rifles eight sub machine guns two mortars and five bars were captured of prisoners however it is not recorded how many were confirmed to be members of regiment 95 both fall and newspapers published in days following official termination of operation on 10 august 1953 give french casualties as 17 dead and 100 wounded giap wrote it was announced we suffered heavy losses although in fact our losses were insignificant their troops had to withdraw with heavy losses giap 121 fall goes on to record that major defect of operation camargue was that french had nothing like numerical superiority to encircle a force in terrain around road one 15 1 as opposed to 20 1 or 25 1 that he believed required he states that slow french progress around 1 500 yards an hour and large distances each unit had to guard from viet minh infiltration meant that viet minh could easily escape net he also states that viet minh intelligence were always aware of french movements as size of french units and complex technology involved in operation gave its presence and intentions away almost immediately whereas in contrast simpler viet minh operations were far more difficult to detect fall 172 route one and regiment 95 regiment 95 survived operation camargue and resumed ambushes in 1954 as well as assaulting a vietnamese garrison near hue regiment remained in area taking part in general giap s 1954 campaign season
