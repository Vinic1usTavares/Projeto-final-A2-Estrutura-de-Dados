tropical storm fay was sixth named storm of 2002 atlantic hurricane season it was a moderate tropical storm which caused flooding in parts of texas and mexico in early september a trough of low pressure moved south into gulf of mexico and became stationary a low pressure center developed along this trough and on september 5 a hurricane hunter airplane reported that system had gained sufficient organization to be a tropical depression southeast of galveston depression drifted south southwest while strengthening reaching its peak strength of on morning of september 6 system then made an abrupt turn to west northwest and remained steady in strength and course until landfall next day near matagorda system weakened at a fast rate after landfall but its circulation would not totally dissipate for three more days storm caused extremely heavy rainfall in inland areas damage totalled 4 5 million 2002 usd 5 2 million usd in 2007 no deaths occurred as a result of fay meteorological history in first few days of september 2002 an upper level trough emerged in gulf of mexico and stalled thunderstorms developed along trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system gradually trough and associated low pressure drifted south into warm waters of gulf of mexico a low pressure area in northwest gulf of mexico became dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near center on september 5 a reconnaissance aircraft investigated system during flight a low level center became evident and some deep convection persisted as a result it was classified as a tropical depression wind shear within gulf of mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation a reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill defined circulation which led to low confidence of location of center of circulation however enough convection persisted for depression to be upgraded into tropical storm fay that evening stationary in movement associated convection became removed from center of circulation despite this system gradually intensified on september 6 storm reached its peak intensity of 60 mph 100 km h light wind shear prevented fay from intensifying further and gradual movement was dictated by a weak mid level ridge to north a low pressure system to south of fay produced wind shear and resulted in decreased convection on southern half of circulation with majority of convective activity located on northern half fay soon became disorganized which prompted national hurricane center forecaster avila to state fay rather resembles a subtropical storm fay moved little and intensified slightly late on september 6 on september 7 fay began to drift northwest towards texas coast as rainbands reached northwest portion of texas coastline fay accelerated towards texas coast and made landfall early on september 7 storm meandered throughout inland texas and as system moved inland forward speed decreased and fay weakened to a tropical depression last advisory was issued on fay on september 7 although depression persisted for several days just inland of texas coast preparations coinciding with development of tropical depression forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for parts of texas coast when depression was upgraded into tropical storm fay warnings were extended from matagorda texas to coastal
