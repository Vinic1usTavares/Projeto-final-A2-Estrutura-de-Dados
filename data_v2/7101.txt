middleton hall warwickshire only son of an affluent country family he was a student at trinity college cambridge where he was tutored by mathematician and naturalist john ray who became a lifetime friend and colleague and lived with willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign act of uniformity willughby was elected as a fellow of royal society in 1661 then aged 27 willughby ray and others such as john wilkins were advocates of a new way of studying science relying on observation and classification rather than received authority of aristotle and bible to this end willughby ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens initially in england and wales but culminating in an extensive tour of continental europe visiting museums libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants after their continental tour he and ray lived and worked mainly at middleton hall willughby married emma barnard in 1668 and couple had three children willughby had suffered bouts of illness over years and eventually died of pleurisy in july 1672 aged 36 his premature death meant that it fell to ray to complete works on animals they had jointly planned in due course ray published books on birds fish and invertebrates ornithologiae libri tres historia piscium and historia insectorum ornithology was also published in an expanded form in english books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals and all three were influential in history of life science including their effect on subsequent natural history writers and their importance in development of linnaeus s binomial nomenclature early life thumb willughby family home at middleton hall alt a half timbered medieval house

aristotle and church birkhead 2018 pp 11 12 royal society and its members such as ray wilkins and willughby sought to put empirical method into practice including travelling to collect specimens and information willughby helped ray in collecting plants for his botanical work catalogus plantarum circa cambridge catalogue which was published anonymously in february 1660 later that year ray and

pp 229 239 it was during this trip that ray and willughby decided to attempt to classify all living things with ray mainly working on plants and willughby on animals jardine 1999 pp 301 302 tables of species they produced were used by wilkins as part of a unifying scheme later published in 1668 as an essay towards a real character and a philosophical language wilkins intention was to create a universal terminology to describe natural world and study of languages and writing systems was meant to create a logical linguistic framework for his classification cram 1992 p 193 willughby and his companions parted company when he fell ill at gloucester while they continued through west country to land s end when willughby had recovered he spent part of summer birdwatching in lincolnshire

with requisite passports and letters of introduction to notable personages greengrass et al 2016 pp 166 167 with willughby s wealth making trip financially viable they intended to visit museums

a translation of german text into english later added to willughby s copy after his death ray claimed in his preface to ornithology for my part i must needs acknowledge that i have received much light and information from work of this poor man and have been thereby to clear many difficulties and some mistakes in gesner although in practice few of baldner s insights were incorporated into text

researches birkhead 2018 pp 149 150 in 1661 he had sent royal society first paper to describe life cycle of insects and he and ray also verified parasitoidism of caterpillars by ichneumon wasps willughby also bred and studied leaf cutter bees his chosen research species later being named after him as willughby s leaf cutter bee megachile willughbiella birkhead 2018 pp 154 157 willughby was first person to unambiguously distinguish honey buzzard from common buzzard birkhead 2018 pp 164 166 and in 2018 it was suggested that former species should be renamed willughby s buzzard to

ray as tertian ague malaria and additional physical and financial demands occasioned by having to defend a bitterly disputed inheritance put him under more strain on 3 june 1672 he became seriously ill again and signed his will on 24 june any catholic descendants from inheriting he died on 3 july immediate cause of death was pleurisy probably related to pneumonia he was buried at st john baptist

worldwide birkhead 2018 p 218 its innovative features were an effective classification system based on anatomical features such bird s beak feet and overall size and a dichotomous key which helped readers to identify birds by guiding them to page describing that group birkhead 2018 pp 219 221 authors also placed an asterisk against species of which they had no first hand knowledge and were therefore unable to verify birkhead et al 2016 p 292 willughby had been keen to add details of characteristic marks to help with identification birkhead et al 2016 p 273 authors also largely avoided practice of previous writers such as german naturalist conrad gessner by not including extraneous material relating to species such as proverbs references in history and literature or use as an emblem kusukawa 2016 p 306 book was published in latin as ornithologiae libri tres three books of ornithology in 1676 birkhead 2018 p 225 first of three sections included an introduction to bird biology an

p 239 fish next book on fish was many years in making willughby s widow had remarried and her new husband josiah child had barred ray from accessing his friend s papers furthermore there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe and ray was working on his own history of plants jardine 1999 pp 303 306 historia piscium was finally published in latin in 1686 with a dedication to samuel pepys president of royal society who had made a generous financial contribution to project book had four sections an introduction to fish biology cetaceans cartilaginous fish

megachile willughbiella alt a bee on a flower in seventeenth century term insect had a much wider meaning than it does today so third major book historia insectorum included many other invertebrates such as worms spiders and millipedes it excluded molluscs perhaps because martin lister another fellow of royal society was writing his own historia animalium that covered that group ray s problems with completing this publication were much same as with fish book although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by sir thomas willoughby and scholar thomas man sir thomas having moved into wollaton hall in 1687 and regained access to middleton and his father s papers and possessions birkhead 2018 pp 246 251 ray died in january 1705 and little happened with historia insectorum until william and royal society finally published it in 1710 in latin incomplete and under ray s name only ray however makes it clear that willughby did bulk of insect research kusukawa 2016 pp 336 337 including for example 20 pages of beetle descriptions ogilvie 2016 p 352 book had four sections starting with an innovative classification system based on metamorphosis second section

by ray means that relative contributions of two men has subsequently been disputed willughby s work was initially well regarded but ray s reputation grew as time passed birkhead 2018 pp 260 265 and in 1788 english botanist james edward smith wrote that willughby s contribution had been overstated by his friend who gave himself too little credit opposite view was given by william swainson who felt

raven was unaware of willughby family archive at university of nottingham when he wrote his book birkhead 2018 pp vii viii and access to that and other new material have led to modern appraisals giving a more balanced picture with two men seen to have made significant individual contributions each demonstrating his own strengths birkhead 2018 pp 267 268 willughby and ray discovered several
