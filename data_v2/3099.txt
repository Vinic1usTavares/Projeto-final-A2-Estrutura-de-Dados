with an oh so relevant jackass storyline most of jackass stuff was way too stale peter jackknifing quagmire into crate of bees notwithstanding but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline introduction of a younger new brian robin pierson of tv critic was more critical about episode and gave it 32 100 and said as usual problem with this episode is that there is no point to it episode had some needless jokes but others which were bearable and a logical enough story even though it addressed nothing references external links category family guy season 7 episodes category 2008
