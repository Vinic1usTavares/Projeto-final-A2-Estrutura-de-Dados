louis alexander slotin 1 december 1910 30 may 1946 was a canadian physicist and chemist who took part in manhattan project he was born and raised in north end of winnipeg manitoba after earning both his bachelor of science and master of science degrees from university of manitoba slotin attended king s college london where he obtained his doctorate in physical chemistry in 1936 afterwards he joined university of chicago as a research associate to help design a cyclotron in 1942 he was invited to participate in manhattan project as part of manhattan project slotin performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values after world war ii slotin continued his research at los alamos national laboratory on 21 may 1946 slotin accidentally began a fission reaction which released a burst of hard radiation slotin was rushed to hospital and died nine days later on 30 may victim of second criticality accident in history following death of harry daghlian who had been exposed to radiation by same core that killed slotin slotin was hailed as a hero by united states government for reacting quickly enough to prevent deaths of his colleagues some physicists argue that this was a preventable accident accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non fiction accounts early life slotin was first of three children born to israel and sonia slotin yiddish speaking jewish refugees who had fled pogroms of russia to winnipeg manitoba he grew up in north end neighborhood of winnipeg an area with a large concentration of eastern european immigrants from his early days at elementary school through his teenage years at st john s high school slotin was academically exceptional his younger brother sam later remarked that his brother had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours at age 16 slotin entered university of manitoba to pursue a degree in science during his undergraduate years he received a university gold medal in both physics and chemistry slotin received a b sc degree in geology from university in 1932 and a m sc degree in 1933 with assistance of one of his mentors he obtained a fellowship to study at king s college london under supervision of arthur john allmand chair of chemistry department who specialized in field of applied electrochemistry and photochemistry king s college london while at king s college london slotin distinguished himself as an amateur boxer by winning college s amateur bantamweight boxing championship later he gave impression that he had fought for spanish republic and trained to fly a fighter with royal air force author robert jungk recounted in his book brighter than a thousand suns a personal history of atomic scientists first published account of manhattan project that slotin had volunteered for service in spanish civil war more for sake of thrill of it than on political grounds he had often been in extreme danger as an anti aircraft gunner during an interview years later sam stated that his brother had gone on a walking tour in spain and he did not take part in war as previously thought slotin earned a ph d degree in physical chemistry from university in 1936 he won a prize for his thesis entitled an investigation into intermediate formation of unstable molecules during some chemical reactions afterwards he spent six months working as a special investigator for dublin s great southern railways testing drumm nickel zinc rechargeable batteries used on dublin bray line career university of chicago in 1937 after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with canada s national research council university of chicago accepted him as a research associate there slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry helping to build first cyclotron in midwestern united states job paid poorly and slotin s father had to support him for two years from 1939 to 1940 slotin collaborated with earl evans head of university s biochemistry department to produce radiocarbon carbon 14 and carbon 11 from cyclotron while working together two men also used carbon 11 to demonstrate that plant cells had capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis through carbon fixation slotin might have been present at start up of enrico fermi s chicago pile 1 first nuclear reactor on 2 december 1942 accounts of event do not agree on this point a 1962 university of chicago document says that slotin was present on 2 december 1942 when group of met lab metallurgical laboratory scientists working under late enrico fermi achieved man s first self sustaining nuclear chain reaction in a pile of graphite and uranium under west stands of stagg field slotin s colleague henry w newson recollected that he and slotin were not present during scientists experimentation during this time slotin also contributed to several papers in field of radiobiology his expertise on subject garnered attention of united states government and as a result he was invited to join manhattan project united states effort to develop a nuclear bomb slotin worked on production of plutonium under future nobel laureate eugene wigner at university and later at oak ridge national laboratory in oak ridge tennessee he moved to los alamos national laboratory in new mexico in december 1944 to work in bomb physics group of robert bacher work at los alamos at los alamos slotin s duties consisted of dangerous criticality testing first with uranium in otto robert frisch s experiments and later with plutonium cores criticality testing involved bringing masses of fissile materials to near critical levels to establish their critical mass values scientists referred to this flirting with possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as tickling dragon s tail based on a remark by physicist richard feynman who compared experiments to tickling tail of a sleeping dragon on 16 july 1945 slotin assembled core for trinity first detonated atomic device and became known as chief armorer of united states for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on project thumb louis slotin with gadget bomb during trinity test in winter of 1945 1946 slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold action he repaired an instrument six feet under water inside clinton pile while it was operating rather than wait an extra day for reactor to be shut down he did not wear his dosimetry badge but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen a dose of 1 gy 100 roentgen can cause nausea and vomiting in 10 of cases but is generally survivable harry daghlian s death on 21 august 1945 laboratory assistant harry daghlian one of slotin s close colleagues was performing a critical mass experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy tungsten carbide brick onto a plutonium gallium alloy bomb core 24 year old daghlian was irradiated with a large dose of neutron radiation later estimates suggested that this dose might not have been fatal on its own but he then received additional delayed gamma radiation and beta burns while disassembling his experiment he quickly collapsed with acute radiation poisoning and died 25 days later in los alamos base hospital planned return to teaching after war slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in project he remarked i have become involved in navy tests much to my disgust unfortunately for slotin his participation at los alamos was still required because as he said i am one of few people left here who are experienced bomb putter he looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at university of chicago he began training a replacement alvin c graves to take over his los alamos work criticality accident thumb a re creation of slotin incident inside hemisphere with thumb hole next to demonstrator s hand is beryllium replacing uranium tamper of same size in a fat man bomb there is an external larger metal sphere of aluminium under it replacing pusher sphere in this bomb s design plutonium demon core was inside spheres at time of accident and is not visible but its dimensions are comparable with two small half spheres shown resting nearby on 21 may 1946 with seven colleagues watching slotin performed an experiment that involved creation of one of first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half spheres of beryllium a neutron reflector around a plutonium core experiment used same plutonium core that had irradiated harry daghlian later called demon core for its role in two accidents slotin grasped upper 228 6 mm 9 inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at top while he maintained separation of half spheres using blade of a screwdriver with his right hand having removed shims normally used using a screwdriver was not a normal part of experimental protocol at 3 20 p m screwdriver slipped and upper beryllium hemisphere fell causing a prompt critical reaction and a burst of hard radiation at time scientists in room observed blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand he jerked his left hand upward lifting upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to floor ending reaction he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation at time of accident dosimetry badges were in a locked box about from accident realizing that no one in room had their film badges on immediately after accident dr slotin asked to have badges taken from lead box and placed on critical assembly this peculiar response was attributed to vertigo and was of no value for determining actual doses received by men in room others in room at time included raemer e schreiber alvin cushman graves stanley allan kline marion edward cieslicki dwight smith young theodore p perlman and pvt patrick j cleary there have been five studies done of amount of radiation each person involved received in accident these are latest dated 1978 from a table in this reference as soon as slotin left building he vomited a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation slotin s colleagues rushed him to hospital but radiation damage was irreversible by 25 may 1946 four of eight men exposed during incident had been discharged from hospital army doctor responsible for hospital captain paul hageman said that slotin s graves kline s and young s immediate condition is satisfactory slotin s death despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate blood for transfusions slotin s condition rapidly deteriorated slotin called his parents and they were flown at army expense from winnipeg to be with him they arrived on fourth day after incident and by fifth day slotin s condition started to rapidly deteriorate over next four days slotin suffered an agonizing sequence of radiation induced traumas including severe diarrhea reduced urine output swollen hands erythema massive blisters on his hands and forearms intestinal paralysis and gangrene he had internal radiation burns throughout his body which one medical expert described as a three dimensional sunburn by seventh day he was experiencing periods of mental confusion his lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent he ultimately experienced a total disintegration of bodily functions and slipped into a coma slotin died at 11 a m on 30 may in presence of his parents he was buried in zedek cemetery winnipeg on 2 june 1946 other injuries and deaths graves kline and young remained hospitalized after slotin s death graves who was standing closest to slotin also developed acute radiation sickness and was hospitalized for several weeks he survived although he lived with chronic neurological and vision problems young also suffered from acute radiation syndrome but recovered by 28 january 1948 graves kline and perlman sought compensation for damages suffered during incident graves settled his claim for 3 500 three of observers eventually died of conditions that are known to be promoted by radiation graves of a heart attack 20 years later at age 55 cieslicki of acute myeloid leukemia 19 years later at age 42 and young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of heart lining 27 years later at age 83 some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic random effects of accident it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set disposition of core core involved was intended to be used in able detonation during crossroads series of nuclear weapon testing slotin s experiment was said to be last conducted before core s detonation and was intended to be final demonstration of its ability to go critical after criticality accident it needed time to cool it was therefore rescheduled for third test of series provisionally named charlie but this was cancelled due to unexpected level of radioactivity after underwater baker test and inability to decontaminate target warships it was later melted down and reused in a later core radiation dosage thumb right 300px a sketch used by doctors to determine amount of radiation to which each person in room had been exposed during excursion thumb right 300px a drawing based on above sketch radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any accuracy a large part of dose was due to neutron radiation which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of day available film badges were not worn by personnel during accident and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found disaster badges hung on walls provided some useful data about gamma radiation a tentative estimate of doses involved was made in 1948 based on dozens of assumptions some of which are now known to be incorrect in absence of personal dosimetry badges study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in victims blood and urine samples as their primary source of data this activation would have been caused by neutron radiation but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or x ray radiation they concluded that daghlian and slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem respectively of gamma rays minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50 to 200 of these values authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 kev x rays and gamma rays which they believed gave a more realistic picture of exposure than gamma equivalent in this model equivalent x ray doses were much higher but would be concentrated in tissues facing source whereas gamma component penetrated whole body slotin s equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930 r roentgen of x ray with 114 r of gamma while daghlian s equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 r of x ray with 110 r of gamma five hundred rem is usually a fatal dose for humans in modern times dosimetry is done very differently equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen they would be calculated with different weighting factors and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed doses recent documents have made various interpretations of slotin s dose ranging from 287 rad to 21 sievert based on citations and supporting reasoning most reliable estimate may be a 1978 los alamos memo which suggested 10 gy n 1 14 gy g for slotin and 2 gy n 1 1 gy g for daghlian these doses are consistent with symptoms they experienced legacy after accident los alamos ended all hands on critical assembly work subsequent criticality testing of fissile cores was done with remotely controlled machines such as godiva series with operator located a safe distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents on 14 june 1946 associate editor of los alamos times thomas p penned a poem entitled slotin a tribute official story released at time was that slotin by quickly removing upper hemisphere was a hero for ending critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in room dr slotin s quick reaction at immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of experiment which would certainly have resulted in death of seven men working with him as well as serious injury to others in general vicinity this interpretation of events was endorsed at time by alvin graves who stood closest to slotin when accident occurred graves like slotin had previously displayed a low concern for nuclear safety and later alleged that fallout risks were concocted in minds of weak malingerers another witness to accident raemer e schreiber spoke out publicly decades later arguing that slotin was using improper and unsafe procedures endangering others in lab along with himself robert b brode had reported hearsay to that effect back in 1946 event was recounted in dexter masters 1955 novel accident a fictional account of last few days of life of a nuclear scientist suffering from radiation poisoning depictions of criticality incident include 1989

bruce a scientist s tragic hubris attains critical mass onstage theatre review new york times 10 april 2001 in 1948 slotin s colleagues at los alamos and university of chicago initiated louis a slotin memorial fund for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as robert oppenheimer and nobel laureates luis walter alvarez and hans bethe memorial fund lasted until 1962 in 2002 an asteroid discovered in 1995 was named slotin in his honour dollar unit of reactivity according to weinberg and wigner alvin m weinberg and eugene p wigner physical theory of neutron chain reactors chicago university of chicago press 1958 page 595 slotin was first to propose name dollar for interval of reactivity between delayed and prompt criticality 0 is point of self sustaining chain reaction a dollar is point at which slowly released delayed neutrons are no longer required to support chain reaction and enters domain called prompt critical stable nuclear reactors operate between 0 and a dollar excursions and nuclear explosives operate above a dollar hundredth part of a dollar is called a cent hugh c paxton a history of critical experiments at pajarito site los alamos document la h
