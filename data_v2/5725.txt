white stork ciconia ciconia is a large bird in stork family ciconiidae its plumage is mainly white with black on its wings adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks and measure on average from beak tip to end of tail with a wingspan two subspecies which differ slightly in size breed in europe north to finland northwestern africa southwestern asia east to southern kazakhstan and southern africa white stork is a long distance migrant wintering in africa from tropical sub saharan africa to as far south as south africa or on indian subcontinent when migrating between europe and africa it avoids crossing mediterranean sea and detours via levant in east or strait of gibraltar in west because air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water a carnivore white stork eats a wide range of animal prey including insects fish amphibians reptiles small mammals and small birds it takes most of its food from ground among low vegetation and from shallow water it is a monogamous breeder but does not pair for life both members of pair build a large stick nest which may be used for several years each year female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs which hatch asynchronously 33 34 days after being laid both parents take turns incubating eggs and both feed young young leave nest 58 64 days after hatching and continue to be fed by parents for a further 7 20 days white stork has been rated as least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn it benefited from human activities during middle ages as woodland was cleared but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of europe in 19th and early 20th centuries conservation and reintroduction programs across europe have resulted in white stork resuming breeding in netherlands belgium switzerland and sweden it has few natural predators but may harbour several types of parasite plumage is home to chewing lice and feather mites while large nests maintain a diverse range of mesostigmatic mites this conspicuous species has given rise to many legends across its range of which best known is story of babies being brought by storks taxonomy and evolution english naturalist francis willughby wrote about white stork in 17th century having seen a drawing sent to him by his friend and natural history enthusiast sir thomas brown of norwich he named it ciconia alba they noted they were occasional vagrants to england blown there by storms it was one of many bird species originally described by linnaeus in landmark 1758 10th edition of his systema naturae where it was given binomial name of ardea ciconia it was reclassified to and was designated type species of new genus ciconia by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 both genus and specific epithet ciconia are latin word for stork originally recorded in works of horace and ovid latin word survives in most romance languages and like word stork is derived from old english word and appeared in 10th century works erfurt glossary where word is equated with ciconia and aelfric s homilies word is related to old high german stork and similar words in many other european languages all of which are descended from germanic z thumb left upright skeleton there are two subspecies c c ciconia nominate subspecies described by linnaeus in 1758 breeds from europe to northwest africa and westernmost asia and in southern africa and winters mainly in africa south of sahara desert though some birds winter in india c c asiatica described by russian naturalist nikolai in 1873 breeds in turkestan and winters from iran to india it is slightly larger than nominate subspecies stork family contains six genera in three broad groups open billed and wood storks mycteria and anastomus giant storks jabiru and and typical storks ciconia typical storks include white stork and six other extant species which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage its closest relatives are larger black billed oriental stork ciconia of east asia which was formerly classified as a subspecies of white stork and maguari stork c maguari of south america close evolutionary relationships within ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and dna dna hybridization a ciconia fossil representing distal end of a right humerus has been recovered from miocene beds of island lake victoria kenya 24 6 million year old fossil could have originated from either a white stork or a black stork c nigra which are species of about same size with very similar bone structures middle miocene beds of island have yielded further remains description thumb a juvenile feeding on an insect white stork is a large bird it has a length of and a standing height of wingspan is and its weight is like all storks it has long legs a long neck and a long straight pointed beak sexes are identical in appearance except that males are larger than females on average plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts black is caused by pigment melanin breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays irises are dull brown or grey and peri orbital skin is black adult has a bright red beak and red legs colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in diet in parts of spain studies have shown that pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish and bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings in contrast to duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere thumb left in flight white storks fly with their necks outstretched left as with other storks wings are long and broad enabling bird to soar in flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular it flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond end of its short tail it walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched in contrast it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting moulting has not been extensively studied but appears to take place throughout year with primary flight feathers replaced over breeding season thumb right upright alt head neck and upper body of a white stork with a long beak with is reddish at base fading to black at tip an older juvenile at avifauna netherlands beaks turn red starting at base upon hatching young white stork is partly covered with short sparse whitish down feathers this early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down by three weeks young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers on hatching chick has pinkish legs which turn to greyish black as it ages its beak is black with a brownish tip by time it fledges juvenile bird s plumage is similar to that of adult though its black feathers are often tinged with brown and its beak and legs are a duller brownish red or orange beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip bills gain adults red colour following summer although black tips persist in some individuals young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer similar species within its range white stork is distinctive when seen on ground winter range of c c asiatica overlaps that of asian openbill which has similar plumage but a different bill shape when seen at a distance in flight white stork can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns such as yellow billed stork great white pelican and egyptian vulture yellow billed stork is identified by its black tail and a longer slightly curved yellow beak white stork also tends to be larger than yellow billed stork great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail and it flies with its neck retracted keeping its head near to its stocky body giving it a different flight profile pelicans also behave differently soaring in orderly synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as white stork does egyptian vulture is much smaller with a long wedge shaped tail shorter legs and a small yellow tinged head on a short neck common crane which can also look black and white in strong light shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight distribution and habitat left thumb a flock foraging in turkey white storks avoid areas overgrown with tall grass and shrub alt several black and white birds with long red legs and long red beaks walk in a green grassy area nominate race of white stork has a wide although disjunct summer range across europe clustered in iberian peninsula and north africa in west and much of eastern and central europe with 25 of world s population concentrated in poland as well as parts of western asia asiatica population of about 1450 birds is restricted to a region in central asia between aral sea and xinjiang in western china xinjiang population is believed to have become extinct around 1980 migration routes extend range of this species into many parts of africa and india some populations adhere to eastern migration route which passes across israel into eastern and central africa a few records of breeding from south africa have been known since 1933 at and about 10 birds have been known to breed since 1990s around a small population of white storks winters in india and is thought to derive principally from c c asiatica population as flocks of up to 200 birds have been observed on spring migration in early 1900s through valley however birds ringed in germany have been recovered in western bikaner and southern tirunelveli india an atypical specimen with red orbital skin a feature of oriental white stork has been recorded and further study of indian population is required north of breeding range it is a passage migrant or vagrant in finland great britain iceland ireland norway and sweden and west to azores and madeira in recent years range has expanded into western russia white stork s preferred feeding grounds are grassy meadows farmland and shallow wetlands it avoids areas overgrown with tall grass and shrubs in chernobyl area of northern ukraine white stork populations declined after 1986 nuclear accident there as farmland was succeeded by tall grass shrubs in parts of poland poor natural foraging grounds have forced birds to seek food at rubbish dumps since 1999 white storks have also been reported foraging in rubbish dumps in middle east north africa and south africa white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland they make use of grasslands wetlands and farmland on wintering grounds in africa white storks were probably aided by human activities during middle ages as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created and they were found across much of europe breeding as far north as sweden population in sweden is thought to have established in 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture about 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in 18th century which declined subsequently first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and last pair failed to breed around 1955 white stork is a rare visitor to british isles as about 20 birds are seen in britain every year but there are no records of nesting since a pair nested atop st giles high kirk in edinburgh scotland in 1416 a decline in population began in 19th century due to industrialisation and changes in agricultural methods white storks no longer nest in many countries and current strongholds of western population are in portugal spain ukraine and poland in iberian peninsula populations are concentrated in southwest and have also declined due to agricultural practices a study published in 2005 found that podhale region in uplands of southern poland had seen an influx of white storks which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since reaching 890 m 3000 ft in 1999 authors proposed that this was related to climate warming and influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes white storks arriving in poznan province greater poland voivodeship in western poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in last twenty years of 20th century than at end of 19th century migration thumb in 1822 provided early evidence of long distance stork migration thumb a flock in migration over israel migrating white storks use uplift of air thermals to reduce effort of long distance flying alt a blue sky with many tiny silhouettes of distant flying birds systematic research into migration of white stork began with german ornithologist johannes who commenced bird ringing studies in 1906 at rossitten bird observatory on curonian spit in what was then east prussia although not many storks passed through rossitten itself observatory coordinated large scale ringing of species throughout germany and elsewhere in europe between 1906 and second world war about 100 000 mainly juvenile white storks were ringed with over 2 000 long distance recoveries of birds wearing rossitten rings reported between 1908 and 1954 routes white storks fly south from their summer breeding grounds in europe in august and september heading for africa there they spend winter in savannah from kenya and uganda south to cape province of south africa in these areas they congregate in large flocks which may exceed a thousand individuals some diverge westwards into western sudan and chad and may reach nigeria in spring birds return north they are recorded from sudan and egypt from february to april they arrive back in europe around late march and april after an average journey of 49 days by comparison autumn journey is completed in about 26 days and scarcity of food and water en route birds fly faster over regions lacking resources increase average speed thumb eastern route storks resting in spring 2017 to avoid a long sea crossing over mediterranean birds from central europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing bosphorus to turkey traversing levant then bypassing sahara desert by following nile valley southwards or follow a western route over strait of gibraltar these migration corridors maximise help from thermals and thus save energy eastern route is by far more important with 530 000 white storks using it annually making species second commonest migrant there after european honey buzzard flocks of migrating raptors white storks and great white pelicans can stretch for 200 km 125 mi eastern route is twice as long as western but storks take same time to reach wintering grounds by either juvenile white storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions they are unable to compensate and may end up in a new wintering location adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites because they are familiar with location for same reason all spring migrants even those from displaced wintering locations can find their way back to traditional breeding sites an experiment with young birds raised in captivity in kaliningrad and released in absence of wild storks to show them way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south although scatter in direction was large energetics thumb otto lilienthal studied flight of storks in 1889 while designing his glider white storks rely on uplift of air thermals to soar and glide long distances of their annual migrations between europe and sub saharan africa for many shortest route would take them over mediterranean sea however since air thermals do not form over water they generally detour over land to avoid trans mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping it has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled thus flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at top up to above ground though one record from western sudan observed an altitude of long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken a young white stork ringed at nest in denmark subsequently appeared in england where it spent some days before moving on it was later seen flying over st mary s isles of scilly and arrived in a poor condition in madeira three days later that island is 500 km 320 mi from africa and twice as far from european mainland migration through middle east may be hampered by khamsin winds bringing gusty overcast days unsuitable for flying in these situations flocks of white storks sit out adverse weather on ground standing and facing into wind behaviour upright right thumb an adult in tsavo east national park kenya lower parts of its legs are a whitish colour due to being covered with its droppings an example of thermoregulation by urohidrosis white stork is a gregarious bird flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in africa non breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during breeding season smaller dark plumaged s stork is often encountered with white stork flocks in southern africa breeding pairs of white stork may gather in small groups to hunt and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas however groups among white stork colonies vary widely in size and social structure is loosely defined young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying better quality nests toward centres of breeding colonies social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening white storks exhibit this behaviour exclusively at nest site standing birds preen heads of sitting birds sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles and sometimes juveniles preen each other unlike most storks it never adopts a spread winged posture though it is known to droop its wings holding them away from its body with primary feathers pointing downwards when its plumage is wet a white stork s droppings containing faeces and uric acid are sometimes directed onto its own legs making them appear white resulting evaporation provides cooling and is termed urohidrosis birds that have been ringed can sometimes be affected by accumulation of droppings around ring leading to constriction and leg trauma white stork has also been noted for tool use by squeezing moss in beak to drip water into mouths of its chicks communication adult white stork s main sound is noisy bill clattering which has been likened to distant machine gun fire bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes clattering is amplified by its throat pouch which acts as a resonator used in a variety of social interactions bill clattering generally grows louder longer it lasts and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on situation for example slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss however young birds can generate a harsh hiss various sounds and a cat like mew they use to beg for food like adults young also clatter their beaks up down display is used for a number of interactions with other members of species here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again and this is repeated several times display is used as a greeting between birds post coitus and also as a threat display breeding pairs are territorial over summer and use this display as well as crouching forward with tails cocked and wings extended breeding and lifespan left thumb nests on a belfry in spain white storks often form small nesting colonies alt at least eight tall black and white birds in three nests on roof of a building white stork breeds in open farmland areas with access to marshy wetlands building a large stick nest in trees on buildings or on purpose built man made platforms each nest is in depth in diameter and in weight nests are built in loose colonies not persecuted as it is viewed as a good omen it often nests close to human habitation in southern europe nests can be seen on churches and other buildings nest is typically used year after year especially by older males males arrive earlier in season and choose nests larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged and appear to be sought after nest change is often related to a change in pairing and failure to raise young previous year and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites although a pair may be found to occupy a nest partners may change several times during early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved thumb mating several bird species often nest within large nests of white stork regular occupants are house sparrows tree sparrows and common starlings less common residents include eurasian kestrels little owls european rollers white wagtails black redstarts eurasian jackdaws and spanish sparrows paired birds greet by engaging in up down and head shaking crouch displays and clattering beak while throwing back head pairs copulate frequently throughout month before eggs are laid high frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra pair copulation however extra pair copulation is infrequent in white storks a white stork pair raises a single brood a year female typically lays four eggs though clutches of one to seven have been recorded eggs are white but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering they typically measure and weigh of which about is shell incubation begins as soon as first egg is laid so brood hatches asynchronously beginning 33 to 34 days later first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over others while stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings as is case in some species weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents this behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase chance of survival of remaining nestlings white stork nestlings do not attack each other and their parents method of feeding them large amounts of food at once means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size despite this this behaviour has not commonly been observed upright left thumb egg temperature and weather around time of hatching in spring is important cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates somewhat unexpectedly studies have found that later hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier hatching nestmates body weight of chicks increases rapidly in first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about in 45 days length of beak increases linearly for about 50 days young birds are fed with earthworms and insects which are regurgitated by parents onto floor of nest older chicks reach into mouths of parents to obtain food chicks fledge 58 to 64 days after hatching white storks generally begin breeding when about four years old although age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in switzerland while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years feeding white storks consume a wide variety of animal prey they prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5 km 3 mi of their nest and sites where vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible their diet varies according to season locality and prey availability common food items include insects primarily beetles grasshoppers locusts and crickets earthworms reptiles amphibians particularly frog species such as edible frog pelophylax kl esculentus and common frog rana temporaria and small mammals such as voles moles and shrews less commonly they also eat bird eggs and young birds fish molluscs crustaceans and scorpions they hunt mainly during day swallowing small prey whole but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of digestive tract thumbnail white stork picking a dead young rabbit birds returning to latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey moor frogs rana arvalis by homing in on mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs diet of non breeding birds is similar to that of breeding birds but food items are more often taken from dry areas white storks wintering in western india have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them wintering white storks in india sometimes forage along with woolly necked stork ciconia food piracy has been recorded in india with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork while montagu s harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of poland white storks can exploit landfill sites for food during breeding season migration period and winter parasites and diseases white stork nests are habitats for an array of small arthropods particularly over warmer months after birds arrive to breed nesting over successive years storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within nest but excrement food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free living mesostigmatic mites a survey of twelve nests found 13 352 individuals of 34 species most common being m and which together represented almost 85 of all specimens collected these feed on eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes which are abundant in nest litter these mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles often of family or on dung brought by storks during nest construction parasitic mites do not occur perhaps being controlled by predatory species overall effect of mite population is unclear mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms and hence be beneficial or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings birds themselves host species belonging to more than four genera of feather mites these mites including and live on fungi growing on feathers fungi found on plumage may feed on keratin of outer feathers or on feather oil chewing lice such as zebra tend to be found on wings and elsewhere on body white stork also carries several types of internal parasites including toxoplasma gondii and intestinal parasites of genus giardia a study of 120 white stork carcasses from saxony anhalt and brandenburg in germany yielded eight species of trematode fluke four cestode tapeworm species and at least three species of nematode one species of fluke chaunocephalus ferox caused lesions in wall of small intestine in a number of birds admitted to two rehabilitation centres in central spain and was associated with reduced weight it is a recognised pathogen and cause of morbidity in asian openbill anastomus more recently thorough study performed by j and p in czech republic in 1962 2013 suggested that central european white storks host 11 helminth species chaunocephalus ferox and dictymetra discoidea were reported to be dominant ones other species found included echinostoma echinostoma cornu capillaria sp and dictymetra discoidea juvenile white storks were shown to host less species but intensity of infection was higher in juveniles than in adult storks west nile virus wnv is mainly a bird infection that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos migrating birds appear to be important in spread of virus ecology of which remains poorly known on 26 august 1998 a flock of about 1 200 migrating white storks that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in eilat in southern israel flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route and a number of birds died a virulent strain of west nile virus was isolated from brains of eleven dead juveniles other white storks subsequently tested in israel have shown anti wnv antibodies in 2008 three juvenile white storks from a polish wildlife refuge yielded results indicating exposure to virus but context or existence of virus in poland is unclear conservation thumb right results

african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa applies parties to agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation management of human activities research education and implementation threats include continued loss of wetlands collisions with overhead

century roman writer aelian citing authority of alexander of noted in his de natura animalium book 3 chapter 23 that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents bird is featured in at least three of aesop s fables fox and stork farmer and stork and frogs who desired a king storks were also thought to care for their aged parents feeding them and even transporting them and children s books depicted them as a model of filial values a greek law called from ancient greek word for stork required citizens to take care of their aged parents greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death storks were allegedly protected in ancient thessaly as they hunted snakes and widely held to be virgil s white bird roman writers noted white stork s arrival in spring which alerted farmers to plant their vines followers of islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage to mecca on their migration some of earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in white storks arrow storks were found in europe with african arrows embedded in their bodies a well known example of such a stork found in summer of 1822 in german town of klutz in mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen complete with ornate african arrow that is now in university of rostock thumb upright left supposed filial virtues of stork storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed and often nest on buildings in europe in germany presence of a nest on a house was believed to protect against fires they were also protected because of belief that their souls were human german and dutch households would encourage storks to nest on houses sometimes by constructing purpose built high platforms to bring good luck poles lithuanians ukrainians and belarusians believe that storks bring harmony to a family on whose property they nest white stork is a popular motif on postage stamps and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp issuing entities it is national bird of lithuania and belarus and it was a polish mascot at expo 2000 fair in hanover storks nesting in polish villages such as have made them tourist attractions drawing 2000 5000 visitors a year in 2014 in 19th century storks were also thought to only live in countries having a republican form of government polish poet cyprian kamil norwid mentioned storks in his poem moja ii my song ii in 1942 heinrich himmler sought to use storks to carry nazi propaganda leaflets so as to win support from boers in south africa idea for this propaganda plan was a secret that was transmitted by walter schellenberg to be examined by german ornithologist ernst at bird observatory who pointed out that probability of finding marked storks in africa was less than one percent requiring a 1000 birds to transmit 10 leaflets successfully plan was then dropped storks and childbirth thumb 120px der stork a painting by carl 1808 1885 according to european folklore stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents legend is very ancient but was popularised by a 19th century hans christian andersen story called storks german folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks these caves contained or stork stones babies would then be given to mother or dropped down chimney households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for stork on window sill from there folklore

slavic mythology and religion storks were thought to carry unborn souls from to earth in spring and summer this belief still persists in modern folk culture of many slavic countries in simplified child story that storks bring children into world storks were seen by early slavs as bringing luck and killing one would bring misfortune a long term study that showed a spurious correlation between numbers of stork nests and human births is widely used in teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation child bringing myth has appeared in different forms in history children of african american slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks while black babies were born from buzzard eggs psychoanalyst marvin margolis suggests enduring nature of stork fable of newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need in that it allays discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children birds have long been associated with maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as juno to holy ghost and stork may have been chosen for its white plumage depicting purity size in that it is big enough to carry an infant and flight at high altitude likened to flying between earth and heaven fable and its relation to internal world of child have been discussed by sigmund freud and carl jung in fact jung recalled being told story himself upon birth of his own sister traditional link with newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as and birth announcements there were negative aspects to stork folklore as well a polish folk tale relates how god made stork s plumage white while devil gave it black wings imbuing it with both good and evil impulses they were also associated
