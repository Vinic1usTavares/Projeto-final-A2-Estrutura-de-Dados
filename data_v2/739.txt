tropical storm odile was a late season tropical storm that formed during 2008 pacific hurricane season and affected parts of southern mexico a tropical depression formed on october 8 and became tropical storm odile 18 hours later storm paralleled south coast of mexico with center located only several miles offshore after peaking in intensity increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear induced a trend of rapid weakening on storm correspondingly odile was downgraded to a tropical depression early on 12 october subsequently degenerating into a remnant low about 55 mi 85 km south of manzanillo colima from thereon low proceeded slowly south southwestward before dissipating on october 13 since odile stayed at sea its effects along coastlines were limited most notable damages were caused by flooding along southern coast of mexico mostly in chiapas oaxaca guerrero and michoacan exact amount of damage however remains unknown and no fatalities were reported as a result of storm meteorological history a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa on september 23 and merged with southern end of a decaying frontal system over caribbean sea combined disturbance gradually split with northernmost section eventually becoming tropical storm marco southernmost end moved into eastern pacific which then immediately showed signs of organization system stalled just south of el salvador throughout october 5 where it came under influence of strong vertical wind shear circulation slowly drifted east northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave with broad resultant low re curving to west northwest in response to relaxing shear aloft convection redeveloped around newly formed center of circulation it subsequently acquired a sufficiently organized structure and post analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200 utc on october 8 upon developing depression was designated as sixteen e about 120 mi 195 km south southwest of san salvador el salvador and operationally advisories were initiated at 2100 utc 9 hours after post analytic estimates of formation despite being in an area with favorable conditions lack of inner core organization proved difficult for rapid deepening to occur and initially model guidance did not forecast any significant strengthening contrary to expectations satellite imagery showed a gradual increase in organization later that evening bands of convection deepened in southern quadrant indicating that storm was steadily strengthening located just to south of a large mid level ridge over mexico system was steered toward west northwest proceeding within a favorable environment based on improved appearance on satellite imagery it is estimated depression intensified into tropical storm odile at 0600 utc on october 9 about 330 mi 530 km southeast of puerto angel mexico shortly after attaining tropical storm status odile began to develop a small area of central dense overcast and upper level cirrus outflow became well defined within western semicircle of storm convective banding organized to south and southwest of circulation leading dvorak t numbers to estimate an intensity of at least based on this estimate nhc noted a high chance of further intensification into a minimal hurricane odile maintained its intensity as upper level outflow of circulation was reduced to northeast although wind shear initially dislocated circulation from main convection a large burst of convection allowed odile to intensify slightly further to peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h at around 0600 utc on october 10 thumb right tropical storm odile at peak intensity on october 10 odile closely paralleled mexican coastline intensification did not last long in fact convection associated with odile diminished in afternoon and its rainbands became rather distorted another cluster of convection sprung up that evening this time with cloud tops colder than circulation center was well embedded within convection as a consequence of slightly improved organization odile had a stronger interaction with easterlies aloft therefore increasing forward movement speed later that day a reconnaissance aircraft passed through odile and observed a rather weak and disorganized tropical cyclone resulting in meteorologists at nhc to change its forecasts early on october 12 odile made its closest approach to coastline of mexico only about 50 mi 80 km offshore of guerrero mexico increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear took toll on system furthermore around 0600 utc nhc confirmed that odile weakened into a tropical depression last advisory regarding odile was issued later that day stating that it has subsequently degenerated into a remnant low pressure area a swirl of low level clouds remnants of odile meandered slowly south southwestward before completely dissipating on october 13 preparations and impact left thumb tropical storm odile shortly before losing its intensity throughout odile s existence national weather service of mexico declared several tropical storm watches and warnings for pacific coast of mexico spanning from jalisco to oaxaca they were extended and discontinued as odile progressed westward on october 11 at around 2 am pdt a hurricane watch was declared for pacific coast of mexico from tecpan de galeana to punta san telmo six hours later hurricane watch was adjusted and in effect for coast from zihuatanejo to manzanillo they were all discontinued later that day as chance of odile becoming a hurricane diminished on october 8 blue alerts were declared for 118 municipalities in chiapas following minimal threat of tropical storm force impact civil defense system in state of chiapas warned that storm could leave up to of rainfall were closed in port of chiapas leaving over 3 000 boats stranded ashore on october 9 flooding in acapulco forced officials to close schools on october 10 meanwhile state government reported that 232 police were ready to provide assistance to citizens in advance of odile civil defense officials in state of guerrero ordered about 10 000 people to evacuate their homes on october 11 a yellow alert were declared for state of michoacan where civil defense committee also announced that shelters were opened for schools in municipality of lazaro cardenas and towns of playa azul and guacamayas ports in lazaro cardenas were also closed later that day on october 10 about of rainfall were accumulated in city of acapulco torrential rainfall caused flooding which damaged more than 100 houses with two of them completely destroyed excess floodwater collapsed walls and covered roads with mud that reached as much as nearly 150 homes were inundated with of water flooding is also responsible for causing strong current that had swept away parked vehicles downing of at least 16 trees and carrying debris to main streets of port odile also managed to cause damage toward plumbing and sewage supplies of acapulco resulting no clean water access in about fifty communities of suburban areas of acapulco for several days water levels of river reached its maximum capacity damaging electrical supplies in michoacan strong winds resulted 30 downed trees and collapse of 5 power poles leaving 10 minutes without electricity for a large part of city see also 2008 pacific hurricane season timeline of 2008
