extinction event also known as cretaceous tertiary k t extinction was a sudden mass extinction of some three quarters of plant and animal species on earth approximately 66 million years ago with exception of some ectothermic species such as leatherback sea turtle and crocodiles no tetrapods weighing more than survived it marked end of cretaceous period and with it entire mesozoic era opening cenozoic era that continues today in geologic record k pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called k pg boundary which can be found throughout world in marine and terrestrial rocks boundary clay shows high levels of metal iridium which is rare in earth s crust but abundant in asteroids as originally proposed in 1980 by a team of scientists led by luis alvarez and his son walter alvarez it is now generally thought that k pg extinction was caused by impact of a massive comet or asteroid wide 66 million years ago which devastated global environment mainly through a lingering impact winter which halted photosynthesis in plants and plankton impact hypothesis also known as alvarez hypothesis was bolstered by discovery of chicxulub crater in gulf of mexico s yucatan peninsula in early 1990s which provided conclusive evidence that k pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact fact that extinctions occurred simultaneously provides strong evidence that they were caused by asteroid a 2016 drilling project into chicxulub peak ring confirmed that peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in earth but contained hardly any gypsum usual sulfate containing sea floor rock in region gypsum would have vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into atmosphere causing longer term effects on climate and food chain other causal or contributing factors to extinction may have been deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions bianca nastiest feud in science a princeton geologist has endured decades of ridicule for arguing that fifth extinction was caused not by an asteroid but by a series of colossal volcanic eruptions but she s reopened that debate atlantic monthly september 2018 https www com magazine archive 2018 09 dinosaur extinction debate climate change and sea level change a wide range of species perished in k pg extinction best known being non avian dinosaurs it also destroyed a plethora of other terrestrial organisms including some mammals pterosaurs birds lizards insects and plants in oceans k pg extinction killed off plesiosaurs and giant marine lizards and devastated fish sharks mollusks especially ammonites which became extinct and many species of plankton it is estimated that 75 or more of all species on earth vanished yet extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities in its wake many groups underwent remarkable adaptive radiation sudden and prolific divergence into new forms and species within disrupted and emptied ecological niches mammals in particular diversified in paleogene evolving new forms such as horses whales bats and primates birds fish and perhaps lizards also radiated extinction patterns k pg extinction event was severe global rapid and selective eliminating a vast number of species based on marine fossils it is estimated that 75 or more of all species were made extinct event appears to have affected all continents at same time non avian dinosaurs for example are known from maastrichtian of north america europe asia africa south america and antarctica but are unknown from cenozoic anywhere in world similarly fossil pollen shows devastation of plant communities in areas as far apart as new mexico alaska china and new zealand despite event s severity there was significant variability in rate of extinction between and within different clades species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced solar energy reaching ground this plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of dominant plant groups omnivores insectivores and carrion eaters survived extinction event perhaps because of increased availability of their food sources no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived rather surviving mammals and birds fed on insects worms and snails which in turn fed on detritus dead plant and animal matter in stream communities few animal groups became extinct because such communities rely less directly on food from living plants and more on detritus washed in from land protecting them from extinction similar but more complex patterns have been found in oceans extinction was more severe among animals living in water column than among animals living on or in sea floor animals in water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton while animals on ocean floor always or sometimes feed on detritus coccolithophorids and mollusks including ammonites rudists freshwater snails and mussels and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders became extinct or suffered heavy losses for example it is thought that ammonites were principal food of mosasaurs a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at boundary largest air breathing survivors of event crocodyliforms and were semi aquatic and had access to detritus modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and survive for months without food and their young are small grow slowly and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms for their first few years these characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at end of cretaceous after k pg extinction event biodiversity required substantial time to recover despite existence of abundant vacant ecological niches microbiota k pg boundary represents one of most dramatic turnovers in fossil record for various calcareous that formed calcium deposits for which cretaceous is named turnover in this group is clearly marked at species level statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in speciation k pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst forming stages which likely causes diversity to be underestimated recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through boundary layer radiolaria have left a geological record since at least ordovician times and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across k pg boundary there is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in early paleocene approximately 46 of diatom species survived transition from cretaceous to upper paleocene a significant turnover in species but not a catastrophic extinction occurrence of planktonic foraminifera across k pg boundary has been studied since 1930s research spurred by possibility of an impact event at k pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at boundary however there is ongoing debate between groups that think evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at k pg boundary and those who think evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through boundary numerous species of benthic foraminifera became extinct during event presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients while biomass in ocean is thought to have decreased as marine microbiota recovered however it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from increase in food sources phytoplankton recovery in early paleocene provided food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages which are mainly detritus feeding ultimate recovery of benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into early paleocene marine invertebrates thumb alt spiral shell with embedded rock two centimeters across iris ammonite from owl creek formation upper cretaceous owl creek ripley mississippi there is significant variation in fossil record as to extinction rate of marine invertebrates across k pg boundary apparent rate is influenced by a lack of fossil records rather than extinctions ostracods a class of small crustaceans that were prevalent in upper maastrichtian left fossil deposits in a variety of locations a review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in paleocene than any other time in cenozoic current research cannot ascertain however whether extinctions occurred prior to or during boundary interval approximately 60 of late cretaceous scleractinia coral genera failed to cross k pg boundary into paleocene further analysis of coral extinctions shows that approximately 98 of colonial species ones that inhabit warm shallow tropical waters became extinct solitary corals which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper below photic zone areas of ocean were less impacted by k pg boundary colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae which collapsed due to events surrounding k pg boundary however use of data from coral fossils to support k pg extinction and subsequent paleocene recovery must be weighed against changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through k pg boundary numbers of cephalopod echinoderm and bivalve genera exhibited significant diminution after k pg boundary most species of brachiopods a small phylum of marine invertebrates survived k pg extinction event and diversified during early paleocene thumb left alt bivalve shells seven centimeters across bivalves from late cretaceous of omani mountains united arab emirates scale bar is 10 mm except for nautiloids represented by modern order and which had already diverged into modern squids and cuttlefish all other species of molluscan class cephalopoda became extinct at k pg boundary these included ecologically significant as well as ammonoids a group of highly diverse numerous and widely distributed shelled cephalopods researchers have pointed out that reproductive strategy of surviving nautiloids which rely upon few and larger eggs played a role in their counterparts through extinction event ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction numerous eggs and planktonic larvae which would have been devastated by k pg extinction event additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from global biota nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids approximately 35 of echinoderm genera became extinct at k pg boundary although taxa that thrived in low latitude shallow water environments during late cretaceous had highest extinction rate mid latitude deep water echinoderms were much less affected at k pg boundary pattern of extinction points to habitat loss specifically drowning of carbonate platforms shallow water reefs in existence at that time by extinction event other invertebrate groups including rudists reef building clams and giant relatives of modern scallops also became extinct at k pg boundary fish there are substantial fossil records of jawed fishes across k pg boundary which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates while deep sea realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected there was an equal loss between open marine apex predators and demersal feeders on continental shelf within cartilaginous fish approximately 7 out of 41 families of modern sharks skates and rays disappeared after this event and batoids skates and rays lost nearly all identifiable species while more than 90 of teleost fish bony fish families survived in maastrichtian age 28 shark families and 13 families thrived of which 25 and 9 respectively survived k t boundary event forty seven of all genera cross k t boundary with 85 being sharks batoids display with 15 a comparably low survival rate there is evidence of a mass extinction of bony fishes at a fossil site immediately above k pg boundary layer on seymour island near antarctica apparently precipitated by k pg extinction event however marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of extinction event terrestrial invertebrates insect damage to fossilized leaves of flowering plants from fourteen sites in north america was used as a proxy for insect diversity across k pg boundary and analyzed to determine rate of extinction researchers found that cretaceous sites prior to extinction event had rich plant and insect feeding diversity during early paleocene however flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects even 1 7 million years after extinction event terrestrial plants there is overwhelming evidence of global disruption of plant communities at k pg boundary extinctions are seen both in studies of fossil pollen and fossil leaves in north america data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at k pg boundary sections although there were substantial changes before boundary in north america approximately 57 of plant species became extinct in high southern hemisphere latitudes such as new zealand and antarctica mass die off of flora caused no significant turnover in species but dramatic and short term changes in relative abundance of plant groups in some regions paleocene recovery of plants began with by fern species represented as a fern spike in geologic record this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after 1980 mount st helens eruption due to wholesale destruction of plants at k pg boundary there was a proliferation of saprotrophic organisms such as fungi that do not require photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present once atmosphere cleared photosynthetic organisms initially ferns and other ground level plants returned just two species of fern appear to have dominated landscape for centuries after event polyploidy appears to have enhanced ability of flowering plants to survive extinction probably because additional copies of genome such plants possessed allowed them to more readily adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed impact amphibians there is limited evidence for extinction of amphibians at k pg boundary a study of fossil vertebrates across k pg boundary in montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct yet there are several species of maastrichtian amphibian not included as part of this study which are unknown from paleocene these include frog and therefore some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at boundary relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals non archosaurs thumb right alt drawing of big plesiosaurus biting into kronosaurus kronosaurus hunt a rendering by dmitry bogdanov in 2008 large marine reptiles including such as these became extinct at end of cretaceous semi aquatic archosauromorphs survived across k pg boundary but would die out in early miocene studies on champsosaurus palatal teeth suggest that there were dietary changes among various species across kt event turtles more than 80 of cretaceous turtle species passed through k pg boundary additionally all six turtle families in existence at end of cretaceous survived into paleogene and are represented by living species lepidosauria living non archosaurian reptile taxa lepidosaurians snakes lizards and tuataras survived across k pg boundary living include tuataras only living rhynchocephalians and squamates rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during early mesozoic but began to decline by mid cretaceous although they were very successful in late cretaceous of south america they are represented today by a single genus located exclusively in new zealand order squamata which is represented today by lizards snakes and worm lizards radiated into various ecological niches during jurassic and was successful throughout cretaceous they survived through k pg boundary and are currently most successful and diverse group of living reptiles with more than 6 000 extant species many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at boundary such as and and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in k t event only recovering 10 million years after it giant non archosaurian aquatic reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs which were top marine predators of their time became extinct by end of cretaceous ichthyosaurs had disappeared from fossil records before mass extinction occurred archosaurs archosaur clade includes two surviving groups crocodilians and birds along with various extinct groups of non avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs crocodyliforms ten families of crocodilians or their close relatives are represented in maastrichtian fossil records of which five died out prior to k pg boundary five families have both maastrichtian and paleocene fossil representatives all of surviving families of crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments except for which lived in freshwater and marine locations approximately 50 of crocodyliform representatives survived across k pg boundary only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived crocodyliform survivability across boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at boundary and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by k pg extinction event as marine environments were pterosaurs one family of pterosaurs azhdarchidae was definitely present in maastrichtian and it likely became extinct at k pg boundary these large pterosaurs were last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during mid cretaceous several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during maastrichtian such as pteranodontids as well as a possible though they are represented by fragmentary remains that are difficult to assign to any given group while this was occurring modern birds were undergoing diversification traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups possibly due to direct competition or they simply filled empty niches but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis and small pterosaurs were present in late cretaceous in fact at least some niches previously held by birds were reclaimed by pterosaurs prior to k pg event birds most paleontologists regard birds as only surviving dinosaurs see origin of birds it is thought that all non avian theropods became extinct including then flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to k pg boundary and that duck chicken and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non avian dinosaurs large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for persistence of archaic birds to within 300 000 years of k pg boundary absence of these birds in paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there a small fraction of cretaceous bird species survived impact giving rise to today s birds only bird group known for certain to have survived k pg boundary is aves avians may have been able to survive extinction as a result of their abilities to dive swim or seek shelter in water and marshlands many species of avians can build burrows or nest in tree holes or termite nests all of which provided shelter from environmental effects at k pg boundary long term survival past boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non avian dinosaurs non avian dinosaurs thumb alt tyrannosaurus skeleton in museum display tyrannosaurus was among dinosaurs living on earth before extinction excluding a few controversial claims scientists agree that all non avian dinosaurs became extinct at k pg boundary dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during last few million years of cretaceous and it may be that quality of dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between options there is no evidence that late maastrichtian non avian dinosaurs could burrow swim or dive which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at k pg boundary it is possible that small dinosaurs other than birds did survive but they would have been deprived of food as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply growing consensus about endothermy of dinosaurs see dinosaur physiology helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives crocodilians ectothermic cold blooded crocodiles have very limited needs for food they can survive several months without eating while endothermic warm blooded animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism thus under circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned non avian dinosaurs died while some crocodiles survived in this context survival of other endothermic animals such as some birds and mammals could be due among other reasons to their smaller needs for food related to their small size at extinction epoch whether extinction occurred gradually or suddenly has been debated as both views have support from fossil record a study of 29 fossil sites in catalan pyrenees of europe in 2010 supports view that dinosaurs there had great diversity until asteroid impact with more than 100 living species more recent research indicates that this figure is obscured by taphonomic biases and sparsity of continental fossil record results of this study which were based on estimated real global biodiversity showed that between 628 and 1 078 non avian dinosaur species were alive at end of cretaceous and underwent sudden extinction after cretaceous paleogene extinction event alternatively interpretation based on fossil bearing rocks along red deer river in alberta canada supports gradual extinction of non avian dinosaurs during last 10 million years of cretaceous layers there number of dinosaur species seems to have decreased from about 45 to approximately 12 other scientists have made same assessment following their research several researchers support existence of paleocene non avian dinosaurs evidence of this existence is based on discovery of dinosaur remains in hell creek formation up to above and 40 000 years later than k pg boundary pollen samples recovered near a fossilized hadrosaur femur recovered in ojo alamo sandstone at san juan river in colorado indicate that animal lived during cenozoic approximately about 1 million years after k pg extinction event if their existence past k pg boundary can be confirmed these hadrosaurids would be considered a dead clade walking scientific consensus however is that these fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re buried in much later sediments also known as reworked fossils mammals all major cretaceous mammalian lineages including monotremes egg laying mammals multituberculates metatherians eutherians and gondwanatheres survived k pg extinction event although they suffered losses in particular metatherians largely disappeared from north america and asian became extinct aside from lineage leading to in hell creek beds of north america at least half of ten known multituberculate species and all eleven metatherians species are not found above boundary multituberculates in europe and north america survived relatively unscathed and quickly bounced back in but asian forms were decimated never again to represent a significant component on mammalian faunas a recent study indicates that metatherians suffered heaviest losses at k t event followed by multituberculates while eutherians recovered quickest mathias m pires brian d rankin daniele silvestro tiago b 2018 diversification dynamics of mammalian clades during k pg mass extinction biology letters 14 9 pmc mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30 million years prior to k pg boundary diversification of mammals stalled across boundary current research indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across k pg boundary despite environment niches made available by extinction of dinosaurs several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after k pg boundary including chiroptera bats and cetartiodactyla a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even toed ungulates although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after k pg boundary k pg boundary mammalian species were generally small comparable in size to rats this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments in addition it is postulated that some early monotremes marsupials and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from k pg boundary environmental stresses evidence north american fossils thumb alt aerial view of canyon with mesas and creek in background hell creek formation in north american terrestrial sequences extinction event is best represented by marked discrepancy between rich and relatively abundant late maastrichtian record and post boundary fern spike at present most informative sequence of dinosaur bearing rocks in world from k pg boundary is found in western north america particularly late maastrichtian age hell creek formation of montana comparison with older judith river formation montana and dinosaur park formation alberta which both date from approximately 75 ma provides information on changes in dinosaur populations over last 10 million years of cretaceous however these fossil beds are geographically limited covering only part of one continent middle late campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks late maastrichtian rocks contain largest members of several major clades tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus pachycephalosaurus triceratops and torosaurus which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to extinction in addition to rich dinosaur fossils there are also plant fossils that illustrate reduction in plant species across k pg boundary in sediments below k pg boundary dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains but boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores more usual pollen levels gradually resume above boundary layer this is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions where recovery is led by ferns which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants marine fossils mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at k pg boundary ammonite genera became extinct at or near k pg boundary however there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to boundary that was associated with a late cretaceous marine regression gradual extinction of most bivalves began well before k pg boundary and a small gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout very late cretaceous further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in late cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time then ended with abrupt mass extinction diversity of marine life decreased when climate near k pg boundary increased in temperature temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65 4 and 65 2 million years ago which is very near time of extinction event not only did climate temperature increase but water temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity megatsunamis scientific consensus is that asteroid impact at k pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments around area of caribbean sea and gulf of mexico from colossal waves created by impact these deposits have been identified in la popa basin in northeastern mexico platform carbonates in northeastern brazil in atlantic deep sea sediments and in form of thickest known layer of graded sand deposits around in chicxulub crater itself directly above shocked granite ejecta megatsunami has been estimated at more than tall as asteroid fell into relatively shallow seas in deep seas it would have been tall fossils in sedimentary rocks deposited

because some theories about extinction s causes imply a rapid extinction over a relatively short period from a few years to a few thousand years while others imply longer periods issue is difficult to resolve because of signor lipps effect that is fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after most recent fossil that has been found scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before k pg extinction to a few million years after it sedimentation rate and thickness of k pg clay from three sites suggest rapid extinction perhaps less than ten thousand years at one site in denver basin of colorado fern spike lasted about one thousand years no more than 71 thousand years earliest cenozoic mammals appeared about 185 000 years no more than 570 000 years after k pg boundary layer was deposited chicxulub impact evidence for impact in 1980 a team of researchers consisting of nobel prize winning physicist luis alvarez his son geologist walter alvarez and chemists frank asaro and helen michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over world at cretaceous paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal 30 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied iridium is extremely rare in earth s crust because it is a siderophile element which mostly sank along with iron into earth s core during planetary differentiation as iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets alvarez team suggested that an

minerals have their internal structure deformed and are created by intense pressures as in nuclear blasts and meteorite impacts and other minerals were also identified in k pg boundary identification

oval with an average diameter of roughly about size calculated by alvarez team discovery of crater a prediction of impact hypothesis provided conclusive evidence for a k pg impact and strengthened hypothesis that it caused extinction in a 2013 paper paul of berkeley geochronology center dated impact at million years ago based on argon argon dating he further posits that mass extinction occurred within 32 000 years of this date in 2007 it was proposed that impactor belonged to baptistina family of asteroids this link has been doubted though not disproved in part because of a lack of observations of asteroid and its family however it was reported in 2009 that 298 baptistina does not share chemical signature of k pg impactor further a 2011 wide field infrared survey explorer wise study of reflected light from asteroids of family estimated their break up at 80 ma giving them insufficient time to shift orbits and impact earth by 66 ma effects of impact in an international panel of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and endorsed asteroid hypothesis specifically chicxulub impact as cause of extinction ruling out other theories such as massive volcanism they had determined that a asteroid hurtled into earth at chicxulub on mexico s yucatan peninsula collision would have released same energy as more than a billion times energy of atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki chicxulub impact caused a global catastrophe some of phenomena were brief occurrences immediately following impact but there were also long term geochemical and climatic disruptions that devastated ecology re entry of ejecta into earth s atmosphere would include a brief hours long but intense pulse of infrared radiation cooking exposed organisms this is debated however with opponents arguing that local ferocious fires probably limited to north america fall short of global this is cretaceous palaeogene firestorm debate a paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of nuclear winter suggested that based on amount of soot in global debris layer entire terrestrial biosphere might have burned implying a global soot cloud blocking out sun and creating an impact winter effect aside from hypothesized fire and or impact winter effects impact would have created a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for up to a year inhibiting photosynthesis asteroid hit an area of carbonate rock containing a large amount of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur much of which was vaporized thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into stratosphere which might have reduced sunlight reaching earth s surface by more than 50 and would have caused acid rain resulting acidification of oceans would kill many organisms that grow shells of calcium carbonate at brazos section sea surface temperature dropped as much as for decades after impact it would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate and would account for extinction of plants and phytoplankton and subsequently herbivores and their predators creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival however freezing temperatures probably lasted for at least three years if widespread fires occurred they would have increased content of atmosphere and caused a temporary greenhouse effect once dust clouds and aerosol settled and this would have exterminated most vulnerable organisms that survived period immediately after impact although most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit earth at approximately end of cretaceous there is an ongoing dispute whether impact was sole cause of extinctions thumb river bed at moody creek mine 7 mile creek dunollie new zealand contains evidence of a devastating event on terrestrial plant communities at cretaceous paleogene boundary confirming severity and global nature of event 2016 chicxulub crater drilling project in 2016 a scientific drilling project obtained deep rock core samples from peak ring around chicxulub impact crater discoveries confirmed that rock comprising peak ring had been shocked by immense pressure and melted in just minutes from its usual state into its present form unlike sea floor deposits peak ring was made of granite originating much deeper in earth which had been ejected to surface by impact gypsum is a sulfate containing rock usually present in shallow seabed of region it had been almost entirely removed vaporized into atmosphere further event was immediately followed by a megatsunami is a massive movement of sea waters which can reach inland tens or hundreds of kilometers sufficient to lay down largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above peak ring these findings strongly support impact s role in extinction event impactor was large enough to create a peak ring to melt shock and eject deep granite to create colossal water movements and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into atmosphere where they would have persisted for several years this worldwide dispersal of dust and sulfates would have affected climate catastrophically led to large temperature drops and devastated food chain alternative hypotheses although concurrence of end cretaceous extinctions with chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports impact hypothesis some scientists continue to support other contributing causes volcanic eruptions climate change sea level change and other impact events end cretaceous event is only mass extinction known to be associated with an impact and other large impacts such as manicouagan reservoir impact do not coincide with any noticeable extinction events deccan traps before 2000 arguments that deccan traps flood basalts caused extinction were usually linked to view that extinction was gradual as flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted more than 2 million years most recent evidence shows that traps erupted over a period of only 800 000 years spanning k pg boundary and therefore may be responsible for extinction and delayed biotic recovery thereafter deccan traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms including release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants in addition deccan trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased greenhouse effect when dust and aerosols cleared from atmosphere in years when deccan traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction luis alvarez d 1988 replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data while his assertion was not initially well received later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim eventually most paleontologists began to accept idea that mass extinctions at end of cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive earth impact even walter alvarez acknowledged that other major changes may have contributed to extinctions combining these theories some geophysical models suggest that impact contributed to deccan traps these models combined with high precision radiometric dating suggest that chicxulub impact could have triggered some of largest deccan eruptions as well as eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on earth multiple impact event other crater like topographic features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with cretaceous paleogene extinction this suggests possibility of near simultaneous multiple impacts perhaps from a fragmented object similar to shoemaker levy 9 impact with jupiter in addition to chicxulub crater there is crater in ukraine crater in north sea possibly formed by bolide impact and controversial and much larger shiva crater any other craters that might have formed in tethys ocean would have been obscured by northward tectonic drift of africa and india maastrichtian sea level regression there is clear evidence that sea levels fell in final stage of cretaceous by more than at any other time in mesozoic era in some maastrichtian stage rock layers from various parts of world later layers are terrestrial earlier layers represent shorelines and earliest layers represent seabeds these layers do not show tilting and distortion associated with mountain building therefore likeliest explanation is a regression a drop in sea level there is no direct evidence for cause of regression but currently accepted explanation is that mid ocean ridges became less active and sank under their own weight a severe regression would have greatly reduced continental shelf area most species rich part of sea and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction however this change would not have sufficed to cause extinction of ammonites regression would also have caused climate changes partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing earth s albedo and increasing global temperatures marine regression also resulted in loss of seas such as western interior seaway of north america loss of these seas greatly altered habitats removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of dinosaur park formation another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans while this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates those that prefer marine environments such as sharks suffered multiple causes proponents of multiple causation view suggested single causes as either too small to produce vast scale of extinction or not likely to produce its observed taxonomic pattern in a review article j david archibald and david e fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes volcanism marine regression and extraterrestrial impact in this scenario terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by changes in and loss of habitats dinosaurs as largest vertebrates were first affected by environmental changes and their diversity declined at same time particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of globe then an impact event occurred causing collapses in photosynthesis based food chains both in already stressed terrestrial food chains and in marine food chains recent work led by sierra peterson at seymour island antarctica showed two separate extinction events near cretaceous paleogene boundary with one correlating to deccan trap volcanism and one correlated with chicxulub impact team analyzed combined extinction patterns using a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus free expanded k pg boundary section they documented a 7 8 3 3 degc warming synchronous with onset of deccan traps volcanism and a second smaller warming at time of meteorite impact they suggest local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice intra shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after deccan eruptions began continuing through meteorite event species extinction at seymour island occurred in two pulses that coincide with two observed warming events directly linking end cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change recovery and radiation thumb right an artist s rendering of thescelosaurus shortly after k pg mass extinction it survived by burrowing but would soon die of starvation k pg extinction had a profound effect on evolution of life on earth elimination of dominant cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in paleogene most striking example is replacement of dinosaurs by mammals after k pg extinction mammals evolved rapidly to fill niches left vacant by dinosaurs also significant within mammalian genera new species were approximately 9 1 larger after k pg boundary other groups also underwent major radiations based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating neoaves appeared to radiate after k pg boundary they even produced giant flightless forms such as herbivorous gastornis and and predatory extinction of cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to radiation of modern groups such as iguanas monitor lizards and boas on land giant boid and enormous snakes appeared and in seas giant sea snakes radiated teleost fish diversified explosively filling niches left vacant by extinction groups appearing in paleocene and eocene include tunas eels and flatfish major changes are also seen in paleogene insect communities many groups of ants were present in cretaceous but in eocene ants became dominant and diverse with larger colonies butterflies diversified as well perhaps to take place of leaf eating insects wiped out by extinction advanced mound building termites termitidae also appear to have risen in importance see also climate across cretaceous paleogene boundary late
