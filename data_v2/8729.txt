battle of chelsea creek was second military engagement of boston campaign of american revolutionary war it is also known as battle of noddle s island battle of hog island and battle of chelsea estuary this battle was fought on may 27 and 28 1775 on chelsea creek and on salt marshes mudflats and islands of boston harbor northeast of boston peninsula in 1775 unlike today boston was a peninsula much land was filled around boston peninsula primarily in 19th century see history of boston for details most of these areas have since been united with mainland by land reclamation and are now part of east boston chelsea winthrop and revere american colonists met their goal of strengthening siege of boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from reach of british regulars british armed schooner diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by colonial side this was first naval capture of war and it was a significant boost to morale of colonial forces background battle of lexington and concord on april 19 1775 drew thousands of militia forces from throughout new england to towns surrounding boston these men remained in area and their numbers grew placing british forces in boston under siege when they blocked all land access to peninsula british were still able to sail in supplies from nova scotia providence and other places because harbor side of city remained under british naval control mckay colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to naval supremacy of british fleet and complete absence of a continental navy in spring of 1775 callo pp 22 23 formal naval organization did not begin until washington took command in june 1775 however there was one remaining local area that continued to supply british forces in boston after war began farmers to east of city in coastal areas and on boston harbor islands found themselves vulnerable once siege began because they were exposed to british influence from sea if they continued to sell livestock to regulars they would be viewed as loyalists in eyes of patriots but if they refused to sell then british would consider them rebels and raiding parties would simply take what they wanted on may 14 massachusetts committee of safety under joseph warren issued following order a few days before battle warren and general artemas ward commander of besieging forces inspected noddle s island and hog island which lay to northeast of boston and east of charlestown they found no british troops there but plenty of livestock animals in other coastal areas had been moved inland by their owners on may 21 british had sailed troops to grape island in outer harbor near weymouth to get hay and livestock and had been driven off by militia mustered from nearby towns which then removed livestock and burned hay on island frothingham p 108 british navy around occupied boston was under command of vice admiral samuel graves royal marines were under command of major john pitcairn british forces as a whole were led by governor general thomas gage beatson p 61 graves had in addition to hay and livestock hired storage on noddle s island for a variety of important naval supplies which he felt were important to preserve owing to almost impossibility of replacing them at this juncture nelson p 18 prelude to battle left thumb colonel john stark led colonial expedition vice admiral graves apparently acting on intelligence that colonials might make attempts on islands posted guard boats near noddle s island these were longboats that included detachments of marines sources disagree as to whether or not any regulars or marines were stationed on noddle s island to protect naval supplies nelson p 18 claims that no troops were stationed on noddle s ketchum p 69 implies as much a documentary history of chelsea states in testimony from british general charles sumner that marines were present on island regiment now at medford mentioned by committee of safety was colonel john stark s 1st new hampshire regiment of about 300 men stationed near winter hill with its headquarters in medford a documentary history of chelsea pp 442 443 taking his instructions from general ward stark and his regiment crossed bridge over mystic river just after midnight on may 27 their route took them far to north of chelsea creek through malden and parts of what are now cities of everett and revere additional local men most likely joined them during their march hog island was accessible at low tide from east by fording belle isle creek near current location of belle isle marsh reservation this crossing was effected without graves guard boats taking notice stark began to move his force to hog island at about 10 am and directed most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded crooked creek to noddle s island with a group of thirty men stark s small contingent on noddle s island scattered into small groups killed animals they could find and set fire to haystacks and barns battle islands british first took notice when they spotted smoke from burning hay vice admiral graves on his flagship saw smoke from burning hay at about 2 pm and signaled for guard marines to land on noddle s island which they did engaging stark s scattered forces graves also ordered schooner diana under command of his nephew lieutenant thomas graves to sail up chelsea creek to support operation and cut off colonists escape eventually a combined force of roughly 400 marines was landed formed ranks and began to systematically drive stark s men back to east colonists fled without fighting until they reached crooked creek there they dropped into marshy ditches and fired on their pursuers from strong defensive positions a pitched battle followed in which colonists squat t ed down in a ditch on ma r sh and engaged in a hot until regulars retreated ketchum p 69 spelling in original marines withdrew from their positions to interior of noddle s island and stark s men left crooked creek to join main body of his forces on hog island diana and other vessels continued northeast up chelsea creek in pursuit by sunset hundreds of cattle sheep and horses had been driven from hog island to mainland also around sunset diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped in shallows of creek however lieutenant graves realized he would require assistance and raised a signal vice admiral graves ordered barges manned by marines into creek to tow diana out along with sloop britannia tender of under command of another of graves nephews lieutenant john graves to assist and provide additional firepower sources disagree on timing of dispatching of various vessels a number of sources frothingham and a documentary history of chelsea among them claim that diana britannia and barges were all dispatched together frothingham p 109a documentary history of chelsea p 443 nelson and ketchum possibly on basis of more recent research claim account as told above nelson p 19 thumb right thomas graves who commanded diana went on to become an admiral in royal navy mainland coast some of stark s men were engaged in driving livestock further up coast others noticed that diana was in trouble and called for reinforcements general putnam and as many as 1000 troops including joseph warren came up on shore near diana a place at mouth of chelsea creek in modern chelsea neighborhood by mcardle bridge to east boston p 88 putnam waded out into harbor up to his waist and offered quarter to sailors of diana if they would surrender but its cannon continued to fire and attempts to tow her into deeper water continued colonial forces continued firing on ship supported by two field pieces positioned on shore britannia and field pieces british had landed on noddle s island also joined cannonade ketchum p 72 at about 10 pm british rowers were forced to abandon rescue of diana due to heavy fire diana drifted and ran aground again on mystic river side of chelsea coast tipping onto one side lieutenant graves abandoned diana and transferred his men to britannia which was successfully towed to deeper water american forces boarded diana and rapidly removed everything of value including guns rigging sails clothing and money they laid hay under stern to serve as kindling and vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to prevent it from falling back into british hands a documentary history of chelsea p 438 guns recovered were probably used in american positions during battle of bunker hill ketchum p 91 aftermath this skirmish was apparently first use of field pieces by colonists in american revolution they suffered no fatalities with only a small number of wounded and their morale was greatly boosted by successful capture and destruction of diana action was also a boost to israel putnam whose appointment by second continental congress as a general in continental army was unanimously approved in part due to reports of this skirmish a documentary history of chelsea p 437 general gage was understated in his casualty report to london two men were killed and a few wounded others however apparently exaggerated reporting large casualties pennsylvania journal reported on june 21 1775 that general gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources said more than three hundred from another source regulars were said to have suffered very much not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded loss was probably greatly exaggerated that however had a good effect on provincials affair was a matter of no small triumph to them and they felt upon occasion more courageous than ever gage ordered cannon mounted on copp s hill in boston and vice admiral graves moved somerset which had been stationed in shallow waters between boston and charlestown into deeper waters to east of boston where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land he also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure noddle s island colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on island morrissey p 50 thumb right a satellite image of east boston narrow neck visible in upper left is chelsea creek boundary between chelsea and
