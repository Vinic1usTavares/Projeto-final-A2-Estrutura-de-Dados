smyth report officially atomic energy for military purposes is common name of an administrative history written by american physicist henry dewolf smyth about manhattan project allied effort to develop atomic bombs during world war ii subtitle of report is a general account of development of methods of using atomic energy for military purposes it was released to public on august 12 1945 just days after atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki on august 6 and 9 smyth was commissioned to write report by major general leslie r groves jr director of manhattan project smyth report was first official account of development of atomic bombs and basic physical processes behind them it also served as an indication as to what information was declassified anything in smyth report could be discussed openly for this reason smyth report focused heavily on information such as basic nuclear physics which was either already widely known in scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist and omitted details about chemistry metallurgy and ordnance this would ultimately give a false impression that manhattan project was all about physics smyth report sold almost 127 000 copies in its first eight printings and was on new york times best seller list from mid october 1945 until late january 1946 it has been translated into over 40 languages background henry d smyth was a professor of physics and chairman of physics department of princeton university from 1935 to 1949 during world war ii he was involved in manhattan project from early 1941 initially as a member of national defense research committee s committee on uranium and later as an associate director of metallurgical laboratory in chicago in late 1943 president of princeton university harold w dodds began insisting that smyth work part time at princeton where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel and he needed physicists like smyth to meet those commitments smyth therefore became a consultant at chicago where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator and commuted from princeton working in chicago on alternate weeks in early 1944 smyth raised possibility of producing an unclassified report for general public on achievements of manhattan project director of metallurgical laboratory arthur compton supported idea he arranged a meeting with james b conant president of harvard university and one of senior administrators of manhattan project who had similar thoughts conant took up matter with manhattan project s director major general leslie r groves jr in april smyth received a formal letter from groves asking him to write such a report both report and choice of smyth as its author were approved by manhattan project s governing body military policy committee in may 1944 report was to serve two functions first it was to be public and official u s government account of development of atomic bombs outlining development of then secret laboratories and production sites at los alamos new mexico oak ridge tennessee and hanford washington and basic physical processes responsible for functioning of nuclear weapons in particular nuclear fission and nuclear chain reaction second it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was declassified anything said in smyth report could be said freely in open literature for this reason smyth report focused heavily on information already available in declassified literature such as much of basic nuclear physics used in weapons which was either already widely known in scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist smyth stated purpose of smyth report in preface this contrasted somewhat with what groves wrote in foreword writing thumb richard tolman left and henry d smyth right smyth possessed security clearances necessary to visit project sites access documents and to discuss work with research personnel groves approved smyth s request to hire another princeton physicist lincoln g smith as a research assistant a letter to manhattan project s senior managers kenneth nichols robert oppenheimer ernest lawrence harold urey and franklin matthias explained since smyth still had his commitments at princeton and chicago he could only work on report part time he wrote report in his office in princeton s palmer laboratory bars were installed on windows of smyth s office and one adjacent to it hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that only access was through adjacent office where there was an armed guard guards worked in eight hour shifts and one was present around clock when smyth sent papers to groves in washington d c they went by military courier smyth sent an outline and rough draft of report to groves for approval in august 1944 followed in february 1945 by drafts of first twelve chapters leaving only final chapter to be completed groves and conant reviewed drafts and made several criticisms they felt that it was too technical for general readers did not mention names of enough participants and dwelt too much on activities at los alamos laboratory groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned as he felt that this would lessen danger of security breaches after smyth made a series of changes in response to this groves sent manuscript to his scientific adviser richard tolman tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at national defense research committee as technical aides paul c fine from university of texas and william from harvard university they had dual task of editing and censoring manuscript smyth and tolman accepted a set of criteria agreeing that information could be released under conditions writing to oppenheimer in april 1945 smyth noted that thumb left secretary of war henry l stimson right and his advisors review 2nd armored division in germany in july 1945 left to right major general floyd l parks general george s patton jr colonel william h kyle john j mccloy harvey h bundy tolman and his assistants finished making their changes in july 1945 and groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel each submitted a written report which was returned with courier and manuscript these were busy people who sometimes only had a few days or even hours to look at manuscript many but not all merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it nichols commander of manhattan district sent back a detailed review he had concerns about amount of credit being given to different people and organizations and recommended that full credit be given to h d smyth for preparing it and that statement be made that army has no responsibility for report except for asking him to do it smyth was given credit but no such statement was issued to prepare final draft for printer groves brought typists with required security clearances to washington d c from manhattan district s headquarters in oak ridge because manhattan project was an allied endeavor groves had to obtain permission from british and american governments to publish smyth report a meeting was held on august 2 1945 in office of secretary of war henry stimson accompanying stimson were his two assistants harvey bundy and george l harrison and his military aide colonel william h kyle groves conant and tolman represented manhattan project james chadwick head of british scientific mission to manhattan project and roger makins from british embassy represented britain meeting went on for two hours as groves and conant sought to reassure stimson that report would not give vital secrets away to soviet union for his part chadwick who had not yet read manuscript could not fathom why americans wanted to publish such a document when he did read it he became quite alarmed his concerns were addressed in a meeting with groves and conant and he accepted their point of view i am now convinced he wrote that very special circumstances arising from nature of project and of its organization demand special treatment and a report of this kind may well be necessary to maintain security of really essential facts of project publication a thousand copies of report were printed by lithography at pentagon and deposited in groves s office in new war department building in washington d c where they were kept securely locked away final approval was sought from president harry s truman in a meeting at white house on august 9 1945 three days after bombing of hiroshima stimson harrison groves conant vannevar bush and fleet admiral william d leahy presented their views and truman authorized immediate release of report war department released thousand copies of report that had been kept in groves s office to media for use by radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9 00 pm on august 11 1945 and for newspapers of august 12 thumb original cover of lithograph edition of smyth report with red title stamp this is copy in rare books and special collections division of library of congress original title of report before it was published in book form was nuclear bombs a general account of development of methods of using nuclear energy for military purposes under auspices of united states government 1940 1945 word nuclear was changed to atomic because while former was favored by physicists it was not in common use by general public at that time this was title used on copyright certificate book was copyrighted to smyth but issued with statement that reproduction in whole or in part is authorized and permitted groves had report copyrighted by smyth in order to prevent someone else from it groves was concerned about security implications of title so instead of having atomic bombs on cover it was left blank and a rubber stamp was made intention was for this to be used on each copy before it was distributed this was done for copyright deposit copies but not those given to press or public lumbering subtitle therefore became title a side effect of this was that it became generally known as smyth report over years term nuclear gradually gained traction and by 1960 it had become more common than atomic in mid 1945 smyth approached datus c smith director of princeton university press about possibility of renting his printing plant to government during a two week summer shutdown so that smyth could produce 5 000 copies of a top secret report smith s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5 000 copies of a top secret report he found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material under circumstances he felt that he could not risk this after smyth report was officially released smith immediately offered to publish it smyth patiently explained that anyone was free to publish it but princeton university press was only willing to do so on understanding that this would be smyth s edition meanwhile smyth approached mcgraw hill about publishing it editors at mcgraw hill found manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite smyth balked at this as it would have meant going through censorship process again james s thompson president of mcgraw hill pointed out u s government printing office would be putting out an edition probably more cheaply than he could and there would likely be little profit in a mcgraw hill edition smyth then turned back to princeton university press he had only one condition that he receive no royalties princeton university press agreed but added a stipulation of its own that groves s approval be secured smyth obtained this in a letter dated august 25 1945 princeton university press received a copy of typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from smyth on august 17 1945 had already started work from another copy maple press of york pennsylvania was lined up to do printing because of wartime shortages one of a publisher s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper smith approached manny and leonard from central paper told them about smyth report and its significance and asked them if they could deliver of paper to maple press in twelve days they found a carload of paper on a siding in new england and sent it to york providing enough paper for 30 000 copies only half what princeton university press wanted first edition of 30 000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30 000 copies presses were held for three hours while train made its way to a siding in york where paper was unloaded and brought to printing plant by trucks there were minor differences between original text and version published by princeton in princeton publication first and middle names were added instead of previous use of abbreviations in response to public concerns about radioactivity groves had text added to paragraph 12 18 explaining how height of explosions over hiroshima and nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into upper atmosphere he also had a one sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in production reactors redacted this deletion was soon noticed by russian translators and only served to highlight its importance to soviet atomic bomb project letter from arnold to h a fidler september 1948 later editions also incorporated changes four typographical errors were found and word photon in paragraph 1 44 aroused so much correspondence from readers who mistakenly believed that it should be proton that it was decided to re word paragraph british government became concerned that smyth report did not cover british part in project and issued its own 40 page report which was incorporated into fifth printing in november 1945 as appendix 7 a two page report by canadian government was added as appendix 8 smyth report was translated into over 40 different languages in addition to princeton university press it was also published by government printing office infantry journal and his majesty s stationery office and was reprinted in october 1945 issue of reviews of modern physics reception thumb cover of russian translation of smyth report first copies were delivered to bookstores on september 10 many were wary of it due to its technical nature and feared that sales would be low an exception was scribner s bookstores which placed large early orders at oak ridge manhattan project s major production site 8 000 copies were sold through employee welfare organization similar arrangements were made for los alamos and richland washington which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce smyth report was on new york times bestseller list from october 14 1945 until january 20 1946 between 1946 and when smyth report went out of print in 1973 it went through eight printings and princeton university press sold 62 612 paperback and 64 129 hardback copies groves did not intend smyth report to be last word on project it formed an addendum to manhattan district history official history of project this eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements it was written in immediate postwar years by chemists metallurgists physicists and administrators who had worked on project since there were no security restrictions it covered every aspect of manhattan project but was itself classified most of it was declassified in 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars except for some technical details on construction of bombs in her 2008 phd dissertation rebecca schwartz argued that smyth s academic background and smyth report s security driven focus on physics at expense of chemistry metallurgy and ordnance promoted a public perception of manhattan project as primarily achievement of physics and physicists according to schwartz postwar histories and popular writing tended to follow smyth report in this regard creating a lasting historiographical legacy ever since wrote jon agar atomic bomb has been seen as an achievement of physics in particular prominence given to einstein s mass energy equivalence equation indelibly associated it with manhattan project smyth report wrote robert p crease more than any other single document made an emblem of atomic energy and
