air stripline is a form of electrical planar transmission line whereby a conductor in form of a thin metal strip is suspended between two ground planes idea is to make dielectric essentially air mechanical support of line may be a thin substrate periodical insulated supports or device connectors and other electrical items air stripline is most commonly used at microwave frequencies especially in c band its advantage over standard stripline and other planar technologies is that its air dielectric avoids dielectric loss many useful circuits can be constructed with air stripline and it is also easier to achieve strong coupling between components in this technology than with other planar formats it was invented by robert m barrett in 1950s structure thumb upright 1 7 diagram of structure of dielectric supported air stripline air stripline is a form of stripline using air as dielectric material between central conductor and ground planes using air as dielectric has advantage that it avoids transmission losses usually associated with dielectric materials maichen pp 87 88 there are two basic ways that air stripline is constructed in dielectric supported stripline also called suspended stripline or suspended substrate strip conductor is deposited on a thin solid dielectric substrate sometimes on both sides and connected together to form a single conductor oliner p 557 558 this substrate is then clamped in place between walls supporting two ground planes in this method strip can be manufactured by printed circuit techniques making it cheap and leading to further advantage that other components can be printed on dielectric in same operation purpose of solid dielectric is mechanical support for conductor rosloniec p 253 but it is made as thin as possible to minimise its electrical effect flimsy nature of substrate means that it can easily be distorted because of this design needs to take account of thermal stability issues han hwang p 21 60 high end designs may use a crystalline substrate such as boron nitride or sapphire as suspended substrate bhat koul p 302 other method of construction uses a more substantial solid metal bar as strip supported on periodically spaced insulators this method may be more suitable for high power applications in such applications corners of conductor cross section may be rounded to prevent high field intensities and arcing occurring at those points insulators are electrically undesirable they detract from goal of having a purely air dielectric add discontinuities to line and are potentially a point at which tracking can occur in some components there are points at which lines need to be grounded either directly or through a discrete component in such circuits these grounding points can double as mechanical supports and need for supporting insulators avoided matthaei et al pp 422 423 uses thumb upright 1 7 examples of structures possible with air stripline directional coupler top left branch line coupler top right coupled line filter bottom left and hybrid ring power splitter bottom right air stripline finds its greatest use at microwave frequencies in c band at these frequencies and barrow 1977 for instance it has advantage of compactness over waveguide air stripline can be used outside c band but at higher ku band waveguide tends to dominate because of its lower loss han hwang pp 21 7 21 50 at microwave frequencies passive circuits such as filters power dividers and directional couplers tend to be constructed as distributed element circuits these circuits can be constructed using any transmission line format coaxial line format commonly used for interconnecting devices has been used for this kind of device construction but is not most convenient format for manufacturing stripline was developed as a better solution for circuit construction and air stripline too fills this role besser gilmore pp 49 50 air stripline is particularly useful in c band for creating beam forming networks from these components han hwang p 21 50 air stripline can achieve strong indirect coupling in these components more easily than other planar formats in standard stripline coupling is usually achieved by running lines side by side for a distance coupling between edges of lines in this way is relatively weak and is limited by closest distance lines can be set together this limit is governed by maximum resolution of printing process and in power applications by electric field strength between lines for this reason stripline parallel coupled lines are used in directional couplers with a coupling factor no more than power splitters with their coupling factor use a direct coupling technique air stripline makes use of an alternative arrangement with lines stacked one atop of other this broadside coupling is much stronger than edge coupling so lines do not need to be so close to achieve same coupling factor in dielectric supported stripline this can be achieved by printing two lines on opposite sides of dielectric broadside coupling can of course be achieved in solid dielectric filled stripline as well with buried line techniques but that requires additional dielectric layers and additional manufacturing processes another technique available to air stripline to increase coupling is use of thick rectangular strips to increase side coupling this also makes mechanical support easier because lines are more rigid bhat koul pp 212 280 287 302 311 history stripline was invented by robert m barrett of us air force cambridge research center in early 1950s air stripline under registered mark stripline was first manufactured commercially by airborne instruments laboratory ail in form of suspended stripline however stripline has since become a generic term for that structure with any dielectric unadorned term stripline would now likely be assumed to mean stripline with a solid dielectric early on stripline was planar technology of choice but has now been
