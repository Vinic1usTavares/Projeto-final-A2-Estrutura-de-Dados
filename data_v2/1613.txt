of his novel sinister barrier about aliens who own human race unknowns first issue appeared in march 1939 in addition to sinister barrier it included h l gold s trouble with water a humorous fantasy about a new yorker who meets a water gnome gold s story was first of many in unknown to combine commonplace reality with fantastic campbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted that fantasy elements in a story be developed logically for example jack williamson s darker than you think describes a world in which there is a scientific explanation for existence of werewolves similarly l sprague de camp and fletcher pratt s harold shea series about a modern american who finds himself in worlds of various mythologies depicts a system of magic based on mathematical logic other notable stories included several well received novels by l ron hubbard and short stories such as manly wade wellman s when it was moonlight and fritz leiber s two sought adventure first in his fafhrd and gray mouser series unknown was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales and cancelled in 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that campbell had to choose between turning astounding into a bimonthly or ending unknown magazine is generally regarded as finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published despite fact that it was not commercially

leader in fantasy genre though competitors such as strange stories were also being launched campbell began acquiring stories suitable for new magazine without a definite launch date in mind when eric frank russell sent him manuscript of his novel sinister barrier campbell decided it was time to put his plans into action first issue of unknown appeared in march 1939 it was a monthly at first but

of new magazine he argued that it has been quality of fantasy that you have read in past that has made very word anathema unknown will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in past as to change your entire understanding of term first issue following month led with russell s sinister barrier novel that had persuaded campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion plot involving aliens who own human race has been described by sf historian mike ashley as a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy ashley time machines pp 140 141 campbell asked russell for revisions to story to emphasize fantastic elements but still demanded that russell work out logical implications of his premises this became a defining characteristic of fiction published in unknown in ashley s words campbell brought science fiction rationale to fantasy first issue also contained horace l gold s trouble with water a comic fantasy about a modern new yorker who offends a water gnome in its and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope trouble with water was a better indication than sinister barrier of direction unknown would take campbell commented in a letter at time that sinister barrier trouble with water and where angels fear by manly wade wellman were only stories in first issue that accurately reflected his goals for magazine john w campbell letters p 44 under campbell s editorial supervision fantasy element in unknown stories had to be treated rigorously this naturally led to appearance in unknown of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction stories and campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular contributors many of whom were also appearing in pages of astounding l ron hubbard theodore sturgeon and l sprague de camp were among most prolific hubbard contributed eight lead novels including typewriter in sky slaves of sleep and fear described by ashley as a classic psychological thriller sf historian and critic thomas clareson describes all eight as outstanding de camp in collaboration with fletcher pratt contributed three stories featuring harold shea who finds himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules mike ashley unknown in clute grant encyclopedia of fantasy p 974 title of one of these mathematics of magic is

carter creation of tomorrow pp 25 26 asimov records that during war he read only these two magazines asimov in memory yet green p 379 sf historian paul carter has argued that spectrum of fantastic fiction from weird tales through unknown to astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed many stories in early science fiction magazines such as wonder stories were more like works of edgar allan poe than they were tales of scientific imagination fritz leiber s first published story was two sought adventure which appeared in august 1939 issue of unknown this was first story in his long running fafhrd and gray mouser series about a pair of adventurers in a sword and sorcery setting four more fafhrd and gray mouser stories appeared in unknown in as many years and leiber s novel conjure wife about a man who discovers that all women are secretly witches was lead story in april 1943 issue protagonist a university professor is forced to abandon scepticism and discover underlying equations of magic via symbolic logic in critic david langford s description david langford fritz leiber in clute grant encyclopedia of fantasy pp 573 574 leiber also contributed smoke ghost in october 1941 described by ashley as arguably first seriously modern ghost story another writer whose first story appeared in unknown was james h schmitz whose appeared in august 1943 issue del rey world of science fiction p 113 other notable stories that appeared in unknown include jack williamson s darker than you think december 1940 which provides a scientific basis for a race of werewolves living undetected alongside human beings expanded into a novel in 1948 it remains williamson s best known fantasy and sf historian malcolm edwards comments that two protagonists relationship is depicted with a tortured and still haunting erotic frankness unusual in genre literature of 1940s john clute jack williamson in clute grant encyclopedia of fantasy p 1018 in addition to harold shea pieces de camp published several other well received stories including wheels of if october 1940 and lest darkness fall december 1939 an alternate history story about a time traveler who attempts to save roman empire from coming dark ages edwards and clute comment that story is most accomplished early excursion into history in magazine sf and is regarded as a classic malcolm edwards john clute l sprague de camp in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction pp 308 310 also highly regarded is wellman s when it was moonlight december 1940 a story about poe first sixteen issues of unknown had cover paintings but from july 1940 cover style was changed to a table of contents with a small ink drawing usually accompanying summary of each story in an attempt to make magazine appear more dignified see individual issues for convenience an online index is available at cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines six of sixteen paintings were by h w scott manuel islip modest stein graves gladney and edd cartier provided others cartier was only one of these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals he painted four of unknowns last six covers before change to a text heavy design ashley time machines pp 266 282 influence thumb left illustration by edd cartier for l ron hubbard s fear july 1940 unknown was along with weird tales an important early influence on fantasy genre in foreword to from unknown worlds in 1948 campbell commented that fantasy before unknown had been too much infused with gloom and terror his approach in unknown had been to assume that creatures of mythology and folklore could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story horror stories he said had a place but horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with blunt instrument technique of so called gothic horror tale campbell insisted on same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers and in words of clareson this led to destruction of not only prevalent narrative tone but also most of trappings that had dominated fantasy from castle of otranto and monk through nineteenth century to weird tales unknown quickly separated itself from weird tales whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock closest predecessor to unknown was thorne smith whose prohibition era topper stories also mixed fantasy with humor before unknown fantasy had received little serious attention though on occasion writers such as james branch cabell had achieved respectability in ashley s opinion unknown created modern genre of fantasy though commercial success for genre had to wait until 1970s brian stableford peter nicholls fantasy in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction p 410 clareson also suggests that unknown influenced science fiction that appeared in astounding after unknown folded according to this view stories such as clifford simak s city series would not have appeared without destruction of genre boundaries that campbell oversaw clareson further proposes that galaxy science fiction and magazine of fantasy science fiction two of most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines were direct descendants of unknown unknown is widely regarded as finest fantasy magazine ever published ashley says for example that unknown published without doubt greatest collection of fantasy stories produced in one magazine ashley history of science fiction magazine vol 2 p 40 despite its lack of commercial success unknown is most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines lester del rey describes it as having gained a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match del rey world of science fiction p 96 edwards comments that unknown appeared during campbell s peak years as an editor its reputation may stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best in a conversation with david g hartwell in 1962 shirley jackson stated she owned a complete run of unknown and expressed strong admiration for publication stating it s best hartwell dark descent pp 108 bibliographic details spring summer autumn winter jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec1939 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 19402 5
