thumb upright 1 35 alt 18th century watercolour of st mary s church st mary s church in 1755 viewed from north east st mary s church reculver was founded in 7th century as either a minster or a monastery on site of a roman fort at reculver which was then at north eastern extremity of kent in south eastern england in 669 site of fort was given for this purpose by king ecgberht of kent to a priest named bassa beginning a connection with kentish kings that led to king eadberht ii of kent being buried there in 760s and church becoming very wealthy by beginning of 9th century from early 9th century to 10th church was treated as essentially a piece of property with ownership passing between kings of mercia and wessex and archbishops of canterbury viking attacks may have extinguished church s religious community in 9th century although an early 11th century record indicates that church was then in hands of a dean accompanied by monks by time of domesday book completed in 1086 st mary s was serving as a parish church original building which incorporated stone and tiles scavenged from roman fort was a simple one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel with a small room or porticus built out from each of church s northern and southern sides where nave and chancel met church was much altered and expanded during middle ages last addition in 15th century was of north and south porches leading into nave this expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for settlement of reculver but its decline led to church s decay and in face of coastal erosion its almost complete demolition in 1809 church s twin towers were preserved by intervention of trinity house since they had long been important as a landmark for shipping some materials from structure were incorporated into a replacement church also dedicated to st mary built at hillborough in same parish much of rest was used for building of a new harbour wall at margate known as margate pier other remnants of original 7th century church apart from those on site include fragments of a high cross of stone that stood inside church and two stone columns that formed part of an arch between nave and chancel which were still in place when church was demolished these are now kept in canterbury cathedral and are among features that have led to church being described as an exemplar of anglo saxon church architecture and sculpture origins thumb upright alt king hlothhere s charter of 679 king hlothhere of kent grants land to abbot berhtwald and his monastery at reculver in 679 in earliest surviving original anglo saxon charter first church known to have existed at reculver was founded in 669 when king ecgberht of kent gave land there to bassa priest for this purpose author of anglo saxon chronicle clearly considered this to be a significant event and it may be that king ecgberht s intention in founding a church at reculver was to create an ecclesiastical centre with a strong english element to counterbalance domination of canterbury church by archbishop theodore from tarsus now in turkey abbot hadrian of st augustine s from north africa probably cyrenaica and their equally non native followers historians vary over whether to call church a minster or a monastery thus susan kelly uses former term but nicholas brooks uses latter commenting that foundation of this church sited within remains of roman fort of exemplifies widespread practice in anglo saxon england of re using roman walled places for major churches new church was built almost completely from demolished roman structures building formed a nave measuring by and an apsidal chancel which was externally polygonal but internally round and was separated from nave by a triple arch formed by two columns made of limestone from marquise in pas de calais region of northern france arches were formed using roman tiles but columns were made for church rather than being roman in origin and their form has been attributed to late roman and early byzantine architectural influences probably transmitted via contemporary architecture of merovingian france around inside of apse was a stone bench and two small rooms or porticus forming rudimentary transepts were built out from north and south sides of church where nave met chancel from which they could be accessed presence of a stone bench around inside of apse has been attributed to influence from syrian church at a time when its followers were being displaced walls of church were rendered inside and out giving them a plain appearance and hiding masonry thumb left alt view of interior of ruined church interior of ruined church looking eastwards from an elevated gallery between towers in 2015 a curved strip of concrete towards top of image marks line of apse and two circles of concrete represent foundations for columns of triple chancel arch to right of these is southern porticus where king eadberht ii of kent was buried in 760s parched grass in central nave area indicates underlying presence of original concrete flooring ten years after foundation of church in 679 king hlothhere of kent granted lands at sturry about south west of reculver and at sarre in western part of isle of thanet across wantsum channel to east to abbot berhtwald and his monastery grant was made at reculver and charter in which it was recorded was probably written by a reculver scribe grant of sarre in particular is significant in original 7th century charter recording this grant reculver is referred to as a civitas or city but this is probably a reference to either its roman past or church s monastic status rather than a large population centre in 692 reculver s abbot berhtwald was elected archbishop of canterbury from which position he probably offered reculver patronage and support bede writing no more than 40 years later described berhtwald as having been well educated in bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs but in terms indicating that berhtwald was not a scholar further charters show that monastery at reculver continued to benefit from kentish kings in 8th century under abbots fl fl 760 and fl 784 acquiring lands in higham and and exemption from toll due on one ship at and king eadberht ii of kent was buried in church in 760s properties belonging to reculver in 7th and 8th centuries are indicated in passing by otherwise unrelated records such as estate at higham land probably in high weald area of kent from which iron may have been sourced for use or sale at or on behalf of reculver and an unidentified property named land in district of eastry such records also identify other abbots of reculver namely aethelmaer fl 699 fl fl 803 fl 805 fl fl fl and beornhelm fl thumb alt triple arch in 7th century church of reculver triple arch of 7th century church between nave and chancel until demolition in early 19th century arch was high and columns by early 9th century monastery had become extremely wealthy but from then on it appears in records as essentially a piece of property for most of period from 764 to 825 kent was under control of kings of mercia beginning with offa 757 96 who treated kent as part of his patrimony he may also have claimed direct control of reculver as he did with similar churches in other areas in 811 control of monastery appears to have been in hands of archbishop wulfred of canterbury who is recorded as having deprived it of some of its land but by 817 reculver was in hands of king coenwulf of mercia 796 821 together with nunnery at minster in thanet through which he would also have had strategically lucrative control of wantsum channel coenwulf had by then secured a privilege from pope leo iii that gave him right to dispose of his monasteries in england at will in that year a monumental showdown began between archbishop wulfred and king coenwulf over control of monasteries featuring reculver and minster in thanet in particular dispute over reculver continued until 821 when wulfred made a humiliating submission to coenwulf surrendering to him an estate of 300 hides possibly at eynsham in oxfordshire and paying a fine of ps120 to secure return of reculver and minster in thanet record of dispute indicates that wulfred continued to be denied control of reculver and minster in thanet after 821 by cwoenthryth coenwulf s heir and abbess of minster in thanet until a final settlement was reached at a synod at in 825 from 825 control of kent fell to kings of wessex and a compromise was reached between archbishop ceolnoth and king egbert in 838 confirmed by his son aethelwulf in 839 recognising egbert and aethelwulf as lay lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship particularly over election of abbots and abbesses to bishops one copy of record of this agreement was preserved either at reculver or at lyminge a factor leading to this abandonment of wulfred s strict policy may have been increasing intensity of viking attacks which had begun in kent in late 8th century and had seen ravaging of isle of sheppey in 835 an army of vikings spent winter of 851 on isle of thanet and same occurred on isle of sheppey in 855 reculver like most of kentish monasteries lay in an exposed coastal location and would have presented an obvious target for vikings in search of treasure by 10th century monastery at reculver had ceased to be an important church in kent and together with its territory it was in hands of kings of wessex alone in a charter of 949 king eadred of england gave reculver back to archbishops of canterbury at which time estate included hoath and herne land at sarre in thanet and land at about south west of reculver monastery to parish church thumb alt 15th

from mainland kent reculver may have remained home to a religious community into 10th century despite its vulnerability to viking attacks it is possible that abbot and community of reculver took refuge from vikings in canterbury as abbess and community of lyminge did in 804 a monk of reculver named ymar was recorded as a saint in early 15th century by thomas elmham who found name in a martyrology and wrote that ymar was buried in st john s church margate ymar was probably killed by vikings in 10th century and hence regarded as a martyr church in east kent seems broadly to have preserved its primary character against all odds but evidence for monastery at reculver is lacking by 11th century monastery had dropped out of sight entirely last abbot is recorded as although it is unknown when he was abbot it must have been after 890 possibly 905 when name of abbot beornhelm last appears in anglo saxon charters church was last described as a monastery in about 1030 when it was governed by a dean named and was home to monks two of whom are named as and these names indicate presence of a religious community from european continent probably flemings this may have been nothing more than a temporary resurgence of communal life at reculver at least for a period in earlier eleventh century perhaps old minster was provided as a refuge for a body of foreign clerics by 1066 monastery had become a parish church with no baptismal function and its territory had become part of endowment of archbishops of canterbury domesday book records archbishop s annual income from reculver in 1086 as ps42 7s ps42 35 this value can be compared with for example ps20 due to him from manor of maidstone and ps50 from borough of sandwich included in domesday account for reculver as well as church farmland a mill salt pans and a fishery are 90 villeins and 25 these numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependents as they only represent adult male heads of households by 13th century reculver parish provided an ecclesiastical benefice of exceptional wealth which led to disputes between lay and church interests in 1291 of pope nicholas iv put total income due to rector and vicar of reculver at about ps130 included in parish were chapels of ease at st nicholas at wade and all saints church shuart both on isle of thanet and at hoath and herne parish was broken up in 1310 by robert winchelsey archbishop of canterbury from 1294 to 1313 who created parishes from reculver s chapelries at herne and on isle of thanet st nicholas at wade and shuart in response to difficulties posed by distance between them and their mother church at reculver and a steady increase in population which winchelsey estimated at more than 3 000 at this time shuart became part of st nicholas at wade parish and its church was later demolished however st mary s church reculver continued to receive payments from parishes of herne and st nicholas at wade in 19th century as a token of subjection to reculver as well as for repair of st mary s church and parish retained a perpetual curacy at hoath until 1960 enlargement and decline enlargement thumb alt refer to caption ruins of st mary s church reculver seen from south east in 2011 church building was considerably enlarged over time outer walls of north and south porticus were extended westwards to enclose nave in 8th century forming a series of rooms including chapels on both northern and southern sides and a porch across western side towers were added as part of an extension with a new west front in late 12th century when internal walls of rooms added in 8th century were demolished creating aisles on north and south sides of nave in 13th century original apse was demolished and chancel more than doubled in size incorporating a triple east window of lancets with columns of purbeck marble and in 15th century north and south porches were added to nave at some point in same period according to j russell a sundial was added to south wall of south tower about from ground a chantry in church was endowed in 1354 in memory of alicia de and two more were endowed in 1371 by thomas niewe a former vicar of reculver these chantries were suppressed in reign of edward vi in 1548 or very early in 1549 towers were topped with spires by 1414 since they are shown in an illustrated map drawn by thomas elmham in or before that year and north tower held a ring of bells accessed by a spiral staircase addition of towers an extraordinary investment for a parish church and extent to which church was enlarged in middle ages suggest that a thriving township must have developed nearby despite all building work church retained many prominent anglo saxon features and one in particular roused john leland to an enthusiasm which he seldom displayed when he visited reculver in 1540 thumb left upright alt refer to caption interior of west end of ruins of st mary s church reculver in 2008 gallery between towers

lyke soon after in 1576 william lambarde described reculver as poore and simple in 1588 there were 165 communicants people in reculver parish taking part in services of holy communion at church and in 1640 there were 169 but a map of about 1630 shows that church then stood only about from shore in january 1658 local justices of peace were petitioned concerning encroachments of sea that had since michaelmas last 29 september 1657 encroached on land near six rods and will doubtless do more harm village s failure to support two beer shops in 1660s points clearly to a declining population and village was mostly abandoned around end of 18th century its residents moving to hillborough about south west of reculver but within reculver parish decline of settlement led to decline of church in 1776 thomas described it as full of solitude and languished into decay in 1787 john pridden noticed that roofline of nave must have been lowered at some time judging by tops of east and west walls and fact that tops of two windows over west door were at that time filled in with brick he also noted that roof had been repaired in 1775 by a sayer churchwarden these details appearing embossed on replacement lead but he described church as a weather beaten building away by fury of elements and a letter to gentleman s magazine in 1809 said that it was then somewhat dilapidated with trifling repairs such as have only tended to obliterate its once harmonizing beauties destruction in autumn of 1807 a northerly storm combined with a high tide to bring erosion of cliff on which church stood to within churchyard destroying ten yards 9 1 m of wall around churchyard not ten yards from foundation of church sea defences had been in place since at least 1783 but although they had been costly to build their design had led to further undermining of cliff two further schemes were devised by sir thomas page and john rennie to preserve cliff by means of new sea defences rennie s being estimated to cost ps8 277 instead at a vestry meeting on 12 january 1808 and at instigation of vicar christopher naylor it was decided that church should be demolished decision was reached by vote among eight of leading residents of reculver and hoath including vicar votes were evenly split so vicar used his casting vote in favour of demolition naylor applied to archbishop of canterbury charles manners sutton for permission to demolish arguing that in all human probability parishioners would shortly be deprived of a place for interment of their dead archbishop commissioned neighbouring clergy and landowners to assess situation and they reported in march 1809 that church should be demolished to save materials for erection of another church demolition was begun in september 1809 using

published by george dowker in 1878 he described finding foundations of apsidal chancel and of columns that formed part of triple chancel arch and noted that original floor of church was of concrete or opus signinum more than thick quoting floor had previously been described in 1782 prior to church s demolition as polished smooth and finished in red a sample having been taken with difficulty using a pickaxe within floor dowker also found what he believed was foundation for stone cross described by leland and noted that concrete floor appeared to have been laid around it floor of chancel appeared to have been raised by about when chancel was extended in early english period and had been covered with encaustic tiles dowker also reported hearing from a mr about existence of a large circular burial vault at east end of chancel containing coffins arranged in a circle further excavations were undertaken in 1920s by c r peers who found that nave of original church had external doors on north south and west sides and that chancel had doors leading into north and south porticus which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides regarding concrete floor described by dowker peers noted that surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick and believed that it was of same date as stone that dowker described as foundation for stone cross excavations also revealed steps leading down to burial vault reported by dowker although peers did not refer to either steps or vault in his report extensions of porticus to west and around original west front were dated to no more than 100 years after church was first built and peers observed that these extensions had been given same type of floor as original church drawing comparisons with 7th century chapel of st peter on wall at bradwell on sea in essex and abbey of st augustine at canterbury peers suggested that original church at reculver probably had windows set high in northern and southern walls of nave areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on site by strips of concrete edged with flint church was found to have been free standing so any other monastic buildings must have stood apart in 1966 archaeologists discovered foundations of what they identified as probably a medieval building rectangular and on an east west axis with its eastern wall aligned with that of church precinct which it pre dated extending over and in contact with western end of a roman bath house it stood a few yards east of south eastern corner of 13th century chancel this building was not recorded by william boys who drew a plan of roman fort and church in 1781 otherwise no such buildings have been found but they may all have been in area to north of church which has been lost to sea in this connection peers noted that cloisters of early canterbury churches of st augustine s and christ church were both on their northern sides and that st augustine s had also been free standing in 7th century a building that stood west northwest of church may have had an anglo saxon doorway and dimensions of an anglo saxon church and had appearance of having been part of some monastic erection it was demolished after sea weakened its foundations during storms in winter of 1782 leland reported another building outside churchyard where it was believed that a parish church had stood while main church at reculver was still a monastery this building formerly a chapel dedicated to st james was later known as chapel house and stood in north eastern corner of fort until it collapsed into sea on
