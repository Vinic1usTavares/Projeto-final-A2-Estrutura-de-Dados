kentrosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from late jurassic of tanzania type species is k aethiopicus named and described by german palaeontologist edwin hennig in 1915 often thought to be a primitive member of stegosauria several recent cladistic analyses find it as more derived than many other stegosaurs and a close relative of stegosaurus from north american morrison formation within stegosauridae fossils of k aethiopicus have been found only in tendaguru formation dated to late kimmeridgian and early tithonian ages about 152 million years ago hundreds of bones were unearthed by german expeditions to german east africa between 1909 and 1912 although no complete skeletons are known remains provided a nearly complete picture of build of animal kentrosaurus generally measured around in length as an adult and weighed about it walked on all fours with straight hindlimbs it had a small elongated head with a beak used to bite off plant material that would be digested in a large gut it had a probably double row of small plates running down its neck and back these plates gradually merged into spikes on hip and tail longest spikes were on tail end and were used to actively defend animal there also was a long spike on each shoulder thigh bones come in two different types suggesting that one sex was larger and more stout than other description kentrosaurus was a small stegosaur it had typical dinosaurian body characterised by a small head a long neck short forelimbs and long hindlimbs and a long horizontal and muscular tail typical stegosaurid traits included elongation and flatness of head powerful build of forelimbs erect and pillar like hindlimbs and an array of plates and spikes running along both sides of top mid line of animal only a single complete tooth was known when hennig published his monography in 1925 later a part of a dentary tooth bearing bone of front lower jaw was found which bears a just emerging tooth and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of stegosaurus albeit much smaller similarly tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges size and posture left thumb size compared to a human kentrosaurus aethiopicus was smaller than stegosaurus ungulatus hesperosaurus mjosi dacentrurus armatus and and about as large as huayangosaurus total length of a composite skeletal mount in museum fur naturkunde berlin germany from tip of snout to tip of tail is slightly more than half of this length is made up by tail larger single elements were found so that animal could probably attain a total length of in 2010 gregory s paul estimated weight of a kentrosaurus at an estimate for 4 5 m long composite mount in museum fur naturkunde berlin by mallison on basis of a virtual 3d skeleton and 3d model varied between 1073 l and 1267 l and a body mass between depending on amount of musculature reconstructed for tail long tail of kentrosaurus results in a position of center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal it rests just in front of hip a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs however femora are straight in kentrosaurus as opposed to typical bipeds indicating a straight and vertical limb position thus hindlimbs though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium did not support animal alone and very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15 of bodyweight distinguishing features thumb life restoration kentrosaurus can be distinguished from other members of stegosauria by a number of extensions of vertebrae which in tail do not run sub parallel as in most dinosaurs in front third of tail they point backwards usual direction in middle tail however they are almost vertical and further back they are hook shaped and point obliquely forward also typical is that dorsal back vertebrae have a neural arch more than twice as high as centrum vertebral body and almost completely occupied by extremely spacious neural canal process front blade of ilium widens laterally to front outer side and does not taper furthermore there is a unique combination of traits not in themselves unique transverse processes side extensions of tail are present up to 28th vertebra of series transverse processes of front tail vertebrae are rod shaped with narrow bases and do not touch plate formed by fusion of processes of sacral vertebrae chevrons bones pointing to below from bottom side of tail vertebrae have shape of an inverted t length of ilium equals or is greater than that of thigh bone armour thumb left lectotype partial individual from excavation st at kindope tendaguru tanzania typically for a stegosaur kentrosaurus had extensive osteoderm bony structures in skin covering including small plates probably located on neck and anterior trunk and spikes of various shapes spikes of kentrosaurus are very elongated with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres plates have a thickened section in middle as if they were modified spines spikes and plates were likely covered by horn aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains thus exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain a pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along path of an articulated tail thumb tail spikes at museum of palaeontology of tubingen hennig and janensch while grouping dermal armour elements into four distinct types recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them shorter and flatter plates at front gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards rear suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along entire body in fifteen pairs because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows along back of animal a marked contrast to better known north american stegosaurus which had one row of plates on neck trunk and tail and two rows of spikes on tail tip there is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly and not only slightly asymmetrical and having a very broad base because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on hips at iliac blade while many recent reconstructions place it on shoulder because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on shoulder in chinese stegosaurs and huayangosaurus discovery and species thumb left outdated skeletal mount lectotype and paralectotypes museum fur naturkunde this mount was erected in 1925 and was disassembled in 2006 in 2007 it was reassembled with a slightly altered posture first fossils of kentrosaurus were discovered by german tendaguru expedition in 1909 recognised as belonging to a stegosaur by expedition leader werner janensch on 24 july 1910 and described by german palaeontologist edwin hennig in 1915 name kentrosaurus was coined by hennig and comes from greek kentron kentron meaning sharp point or prickle and sauros sauros meaning lizard hennig added specific name aethiopicus to denote provenance from africa from 1909 onwards kentrosaurus remains were uncovered in four quarries in saurierschichten middle saurian beds and one quarry in saurierschichten upper saurian beds during four field seasons german expedition found over 1200 bones of kentrosaurus belonging to about fifty individuals many of which were destroyed during second world war today almost all remaining material is housed in museum fur naturkunde berlin roughly 350 remaining specimens while museum of institute for geosciences of university of tubingen houses a composite mount roughly 50 of it being original bones thumb endocasts of sacral ganglion and brain at museum of paleontology of tubingen although no complete individuals were found some material was discovered in association including a nearly complete tail hip several dorsal vertebrae and some limb elements of one individual these form core of a mount in museum fur naturkunde by janensch mount was dismantled during museum renovation in 2006 2007 and re mounted in an improved pose by research casting international some other material including a braincase and spine was thought to have been misplaced or destroyed during world war ii however all supposedly lost cranial material was later found in a drawer of a basement cupboard type and sole accepted species of kentrosaurus is kentrosaurus aethiopicus named by hennig in 1915 fragmentary fossil material from wyoming named stegosaurus longispinus by charles gilmore in 1914 was in 1993 classified as a north american species of kentrosaurus as k longispinus however this action was not accepted by paleontological community and s longispinus has been assigned to its own genus alcovasaurus differing from kentrosaurus in having more elongated tail spikes and structure of pelvis and vertebrae ulansky r e 2014 evolution of stegosaurs dinosauria ornithischia dinologia 35 pp in

thumb right lateral view of a skeleton on display at museum fur naturkunde berlin in original description hennig did not designate a holotype specimen however in a detailed monography on osteology systematic position and palaeobiology of kentrosaurus in 1925 hennig picked most complete partial skeleton today as mb r 4800 1 through mb r 4800 37 as a lectotype see syntype this material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae several vertebrae of back a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia both femora and an ulna and is included in mounted skeleton at museum fur naturkunde in berlin germany type locality is kindope tanzania near tendaguru hill unaware that hennig had already defined a lectotype peter galton selected two dorsal vertebrae specimens mb r 1930 and mb r 1931 from material figured in hennig s 1915 description as holotypes this definition of a holotype is not valid because hennig s selection has priority in 2011 heinrich mallison clarified that all material known to hennig in 1915 i e all bones discovered before 1912 when hermann heck concluded last german excavations are paralectotypes and that mb r 4800 is correct lectotype naming controversy soon after its description a controversy arose over stegosaur s name which is very similar to ceratopsian centrosaurus under rules of biological nomenclature forbidding two animals may not be given same name hennig renamed his stegosaur kentrurosaurus pointed tail saurian in 1916 while hungarian paleontologist franz nopcsa renamed genus doryphorosaurus lance bearing saurian same year if a renaming had been necessary hennig s would have had priority however because both spellings and pronunciations are different centrosaurus is pronounced with a soft c both doryphorosaurus and kentrurosaurus are unneeded replacement names kentrosaurus remains valid name for genus with kentrurosaurus and doryphorosaurus being its junior objective synonyms phylogeny kentrosaurus was by hennig assigned to stegosauridae in 1915 this is confirmed by modern cladistic analyses although in 1915 stegosauridae was a far more inclusive concept a consecutive narrowing down of this concept caused kentrosaurus until 1980s to be seen as a typical primitive stegosaurian to be placed in a more derived higher position in stegosaur evolutionary tree derived traits include a sacral yoke a long process a long thighbone and two rows of plates or spikes a study by octavio mateus e a in 2009 recovered kentrosaurus in a basal position in stegosauridae as shown by this cladogram earlier analyses had shown kentrosaurus closer in tree to stegosaurus basal traits include a prominent foramen at quadrate in skull maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at margin and a shoulder spine paleobiology thumb left depiction of kentrosaurus reaching for leaves on a tree like all ornithischians kentrosaurus was a herbivore fodder was barely chewed and swallowed in large chunks one theory on stegosaurid diet holds that they were low level browsers eating foliage and low growing fruit from various non flowering plants kentrosaurus was capable of eating at heights of up to when on all fours it may also have been possible for it to rear up on its hindlegs to reach vegetation higher in trees with its centre of mass close to hind limbs animal could potentially support itself as it stood up hips were likely capable of allowing a vertical trunk rotation of about 60 degrees and tail probably would either have been fully lifted not blocking this movement or have enough curvature to rest on ground thus it could have provided additional support though precisely because of this flexibility it is not certain whether much support was actually provided it was not stiff enough to function as a third leg as had been suggested by robert thomas bakker in this pose kentrosaurus could have fed at heights of as plates and spikes would have been obstacles during copulation it is possible that pairs mated back to back with female staying still in a posture as male manoeuvres this penis into her cloaca shoulder spikes would have made female unable to lay on her side during mating as is proposed for stegosaurus defense thumb right tail spikes on museum fur naturkunde berlin mount because tail had at least forty caudal vertebrae it was highly mobile it could possibly swing at an arc of 180 degrees covering entire half circle behind it swing speeds at tail end may have been as high as 50 km h continuous rapid swings would have allowed spikes to slash open skin of its attacker or to stab soft tissues and break ribs or facial bones more directed blows would have resulted in sides of spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of legs by blunt trauma these attacks would have crippled small and medium sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones earlier interpretations of defensive behaviour of kentrosaurus included suggestion that animal might have charged to rear to run through attackers with its spines in way of modern porcupines though kentrosaurus likely stood with forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs it is hypothesised that animal adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself its neck was flexible enough to allow it to keep sight of predators as it could reach sides of its body with its snout and look over back in addition posterior position of center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion but meant that animal could quickly rotate around hips by pushing sideways with arms keeping tail pointed at attacker kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable a quick predator could have made it to tail base where impact speed would be much lower when tail passed and neck and upper part of body would have been unprotected by tail swings a successful predation of kentrosaurus may have required group hunting compared to more robust spikes of stegosaurus thinner spikes of kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending growth in 2013 a study by ragna e a concluded that bone histology of kentrosaurus indicated that it had a higher growth rate than reported for stegosaurus and scutellosaurus in view of relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone as stegosaurus was larger than kentrosaurus this contradicts general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones sexual dimorphism differences in proportions not size of femurs led holly barden and susannah maidment to realize that kentrosaurus probably showed sexual dimorphism this dimorphism of femurs consisted in them being either more or less robust than other occurrence ratio of robust morph to gracile one was 2 1 and it is likely that higher percentage of animals were females because of this ratio it was considered reasonable to assume that in their society kentrosaurus males mated with more than one female a behaviour also found in other vertebrates problem posed by ratio is that multiple specimens studied died in same place but probably not in a sudden mass death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered in an earlier study by galton in 1982 it was suggested that individual difference in sacral rib count of both kentrosaurus and dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs having also first sacral vertebra connected to ilium in addition to subsequent four sacrals paleoecology kentrosaurus lived in what is now tanzania in late jurassic tendaguru formation main kentrosaurus quarries were located in middle saurian beds dating from upper kimmeridgian some remains were found in upper saurian beds dating from tithonian since 2012 boundary between kimmeridgian and tithonian is dated at 152 1 million year ago tendaguru ecosystem primarily consisted of three types of environment shallow lagoon like marine environments tidal flats and low coastal environments and vegetated inland environments marine environment existed above fair weather wave base and behind and barriers it appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes ponds and pools these environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts well vegetated were dominated by conifers overall late jurassic tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods during early cretaceous tendaguru became more humid tendaguru beds are similar to morrison formation of north america except in its marine kentrosaurus would have coexisted with fellow ornithischians like sauropods giraffatitan brancai dicraeosaurus and d africana and tornieria africanus theropods allosaurus tendagurensis ceratosaurus ceratosaurus ingens elaphrosaurus and and pterosaur other organisms that inhabited tendaguru included corals echinoderms cephalopods bivalves gastropods decapods sharks fish crocodilians and small mammals like tendagurensis see also timeline
