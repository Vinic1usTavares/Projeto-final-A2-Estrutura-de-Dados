voting rights act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in united states that prohibits racial discrimination in voting it was signed into law by president lyndon b johnson during height of civil rights movement on august 6 1965 and congress later amended act five times to expand its protections designed to enforce voting rights guaranteed by fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to united states constitution act secured right to vote for racial minorities throughout country especially in south according to u s department of justice act is considered to be most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in country act contains numerous provisions that regulate elections act s general provisions provide nationwide protections for voting rights section 2 is a general provision that prohibits every state and local government from imposing any voting law that results in discrimination against racial or language minorities other general provisions specifically outlaw literacy tests and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities act also contains special provisions that apply to only certain jurisdictions a core special provision is section 5 preclearance requirement which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving from u s attorney general or u s district court for d c that change does not discriminate against protected minorities another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide bilingual ballots and other election materials section 5 and most other special provisions apply to jurisdictions encompassed by coverage formula prescribed in section 4 b coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965 and congress updated formula in 1970 and 1975 in shelby county v holder 2013 u s supreme court struck down coverage formula as unconstitutional reasoning that it was no longer responsive to current conditions shelby county v holder court did not strike down section 5 but without a coverage formula section 5 is unenforceable background as initially ratified united states constitution granted each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents united states constitution art i sec 2 cl 1 after civil war three reconstruction amendments were ratified and limited this discretion thirteenth amendment 1865 prohibits slavery fourteenth amendment 1868 grants citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in united states and guarantees every person due process and equal protection rights and fifteenth amendment 1870 provides that t he right of citizens of united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude these amendments also empower congress to enforce their provisions through appropriate legislation to enforce reconstruction amendments congress passed enforcement acts in 1870s acts criminalized obstruction of a citizen s voting rights and provided for federal supervision of electoral process including voter registration however in 1875 supreme court struck down parts of legislation as unconstitutional in united states v cruikshank and united states v reese after reconstruction era ended in 1877 enforcement of these laws became erratic and in 1894 congress repealed most of their provisions southern states generally sought to disenfranchise racial minorities during and after reconstruction from 1868 to 1888 electoral fraud and violence throughout south suppressed african american vote from 1888 to 1908 southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting jim crow laws they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions including literacy tests poll taxes property ownership requirements moral character tests requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted which excluded many african americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible during this period supreme court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities in giles v harris 1903 court held that irrespective of fifteenth amendment judiciary did not have remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote thumb upright 1

increased pressure on federal government to protect voting rights of racial minorities in 1957 congress passed first civil rights legislation since reconstruction civil rights act of 1957 this legislation authorized attorney general to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose fifteenth amendment rights were denied created civil rights division within department of justice to enforce civil rights through litigation and created commission on civil rights to investigate voting rights deprivations further protections were enacted in civil rights act of 1960 which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities although these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights strict legal standards made it difficult for department of justice to successfully pursue litigation for example to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test department needed to prove that rejected voter registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to accepted applications of whites this involved comparing thousands of applications in each of state s counties in a process that could last months department s efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials who would claim to have misplaced voter registration records of racial minorities remove registered racial minorities from electoral rolls and resign so that voter registration ceased moreover department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage thus between 1957 and 1964 african american voter registration rate in south increased only marginally even though department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits congress responded to rampant discrimination against racial minorities in public accommodations and government services by passing civil rights act of 1964 act included some voting rights protections it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter and to accept applications that contained minor errors and it created a presumption that persons with a sixth grade education were sufficiently literate to vote however despite lobbying from civil rights leaders act did not prohibit most forms of voting discrimination president lyndon b johnson recognized this and shortly after 1964 elections in which democrats gained overwhelming majorities in both chambers of congress he privately instructed attorney general nicholas katzenbach to draft toughest voting rights act that you can however johnson did not publicly push for legislation at time his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after congress had passed civil rights act of 1964 and johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his great society reforms by angering southern democrats in congress following 1964 elections civil rights organizations such as southern christian leadership conference sclc and student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc pushed for federal action to protect voting rights of racial minorities their efforts culminated in protests in alabama particularly in city of selma where county sheriff jim clark s police force violently resisted african american voter registration efforts speaking about voting rights push in selma james forman of sncc said our strategy as usual was to force u s government to intervene in case there were arrests and if they did not intervene that inaction would once again prove government was not on our side and thus intensify development of a mass consciousness among blacks our slogan for this drive was one man one vote in january 1965 martin luther king jr james bevel and other civil rights leaders organized several demonstrations in selma that led to violent clashes with police these marches received national media coverage and drew attention to issue of voting rights king and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on february 1 for violating an anti parade ordinance this inspired similar marches in following days causing hundreds more to be arrested on february 4 civil rights leader malcolm x gave a militant speech in selma in which he said that many african americans did not support king s nonviolent approach he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting king next day king was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights letter from a selma jail appeared in new york times with nation paying increasing attention to selma and voting rights president johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation and on february 6 he announced he would send a proposal to congress however he did not reveal proposal s content or when it would come before congress on february 18 in marion alabama state troopers violently broke up a nighttime voting rights march during which officer james fowler shot and killed young african american protester jimmie lee jackson who was unarmed and protecting his mother spurred by this event and at initiation of bevel on march 7 sclc and sncc began selma to montgomery marches in which selma residents proceeded to march to alabama s capital montgomery to highlight voting rights issues and present governor george wallace with their grievances on first march demonstrators were stopped by state and county police on horseback at edmund pettus bridge near selma police shot tear gas into crowd and trampled protesters televised footage of scene which became known as bloody sunday generated outrage across country in wake of events in selma president johnson addressing a televised joint session of congress on march 15 called on legislators to enact expansive voting rights legislation he concluded his speech with words we shall overcome a major anthem of civil rights movement voting rights act of 1965 was introduced in congress two days later while civil rights leaders

senate majority leader mike mansfield d mt and senate minority leader everett dirksen r il both of whom had worked with attorney general katzenbach to draft bill s language although democrats held two thirds of seats in both chambers of congress after 1964 senate elections johnson worried that southern democrats would filibuster legislation as they had opposed other civil rights efforts he enlisted dirksen to help gain republican support dirksen did not originally intend to support voting rights legislation so soon after supporting civil rights act of 1964 but he expressed willingness to accept revolutionary legislation after learning about police violence against marchers in selma on bloody sunday given dirksen s key role in helping katzenbach draft legislation it became known informally as bill after mansfield and dirksen introduced bill 64 additional senators agreed to cosponsor it with a total 46 democratic and 20 republican cosponsors bill contained several special provisions that targeted certain state and local governments a coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to act s other special provisions covered jurisdictions a preclearance requirement that prohibited covered jurisdictions from implementing changes to their voting procedures without first receiving approval from u s attorney general or u s district court for d c that changes were not discriminatory and suspension of tests or devices such as literacy tests in covered jurisdictions bill also authorized assignment of federal examiners to register voters and of federal observers to monitor elections to covered jurisdictions that were found to have engaged in egregious discrimination bill set these special provisions to expire after five years scope of coverage formula was a matter of contentious congressional debate coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if 1 jurisdiction maintained a test or device on november 1 1964 and 2 less than 50 of jurisdiction s voting age residents either were registered to vote on november 1 1964 or cast a ballot in november 1964 presidential election this formula reached few jurisdictions outside deep south to appease legislators who felt that bill unfairly targeted southern jurisdictions bill included a general prohibition on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a test or device for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during 5 years preceding its bailout request additionally bill included a bail in provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in special provisions voting rights act of 1965 ss 3 c formerly 42 u s c ss 1973a c bill was first considered by senate judiciary committee whose chair senator james eastland d ms opposed legislation with several other southern senators on committee to prevent bill from dying in committee mansfield proposed a motion to require judiciary committee to report bill out of committee by april 9 which senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13 during committee s consideration of bill senator ted kennedy d ma led an effort to amend bill to prohibit poll taxes although twenty fourth amendment which banned use of poll taxes in federal elections was ratified a year earlier johnson s administration and bill s sponsors did not include a provision in voting rights bill banning poll taxes in state elections because they feared courts would strike down legislation as unconstitutional additionally by excluding poll taxes from definition of tests or devices coverage formula did not reach texas or arkansas mitigating opposition from those two states influential congressional delegations nonetheless with support of liberal committee members kennedy s amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9 4 vote in response dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from coverage formula any state that had at least 60 of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed national average in preceding presidential election this amendment which effectively exempted all states from coverage except mississippi passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent dirksen offered to drop amendment if poll tax ban were removed ultimately bill was reported out of committee on april 9 by a 12 4 vote without a recommendation on april 22 full senate started debating bill dirksen spoke first on bill s behalf saying that legislation is needed if unequivocal mandate of fifteenth amendment is to be enforced and made effective and if declaration of independence is to be made truly meaningful senator strom thurmond r sc retorted that bill would lead to despotism and tyranny and senator sam ervin d nc argued that bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under article i section 2 of constitution to establish voter qualifications and because bill s special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions on may 6 ervin offered an amendment to abolish coverage formula s automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration this amendment overwhelmingly failed with 42 democrats and 22 republicans voting against it after lengthy debate ted kennedy s amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49 45 on may 11 however senate agreed to include a provision authorizing attorney general to sue any jurisdiction covered or non covered to challenge its use of poll taxes an amendment offered by senator robert kennedy d ny to enfranchise english illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth grade education in a non english speaking school also passed by 48 19 southern legislators offered a series of amendments to weaken bill all of which failed on may 25 senate voted for cloture by a 70 30 vote thus overcoming threat of filibuster and limiting further debate on bill on may 26 senate passed bill by a 77 19 vote democrats 47 16 republicans 30 2 only senators

tax ban and coverage formula and he led opposition to bill in committee committee eventually approved bill on may 12 but it did not file its committee report until june 1 bill included two amendments from subcommittee a penalty for private persons who interfered with right to vote and a prohibition of all poll taxes poll tax prohibition gained speaker of house john mccormack s support bill was next considered by rules committee whose chair howard w smith d va opposed bill and delayed its consideration until june 24 when celler initiated proceedings to have bill discharged from committee under pressure from bill s proponents smith allowed bill to be released a week later and full house started debating bill on july 6 to defeat voting rights act mcculloch introduced an alternative bill h r 7896 it would have allowed attorney general to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination against a jurisdiction and it would have imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth grade education mcculloch s bill was co sponsored by house minority leader gerald ford r mi and supported by southern democrats as an alternative to voting rights act johnson administration viewed h r 7896 as a serious threat to passing voting rights act however support for h r 7896 dissipated after william m tuck d va publicly said he preferred h r 7896 because voting rights act would legitimately ensure that african americans could vote his statement alienated most supporters of h r 7896 and bill failed on house floor by a 171 248 vote on july 9 later that night house passed voting rights act by a 333 85 vote democrats 221 61 republicans 112 24 conference committee chambers appointed a conference committee to resolve differences between house and senate versions of bill a major contention concerned poll tax provisions senate version allowed attorney general to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate while house version outright banned all poll taxes initially committee members were stalemated to help broker a compromise attorney general katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed department of justice to sue states that maintained poll taxes to assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough katzenbach enlisted help of martin luther king jr who gave his support to compromise king s endorsement ended stalemate and on july 29 conference committee reported its version out of committee house approved this conference report version of bill on august 3 by a 328 74 vote democrats 217 54 republicans 111 20 and senate passed it on august 4 by a 79 18 vote democrats 49 17 republicans 30 1

george w bush signs amendments to act in july 2006 congress enacted major amendments to act in 1970 1975 1982 1992 and 2006 each amendment coincided with an impending expiration of some or all of act s special provisions originally set to expire by 1970 congress repeatedly reauthorized special provisions in recognition of continuing voting discrimination congress extended coverage formula and special provisions tied to it such as section 5 preclearance requirement for five years in 1970 seven years in 1975 and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006 in 1970 and 1975 congress also expanded reach of coverage formula by supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when congress expanded meaning of tests or devices to encompass any jurisdiction that provided english only election information such as ballots if jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of jurisdiction s voting age citizens these expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage including many outside of south to ease burdens of reauthorized special provisions congress liberalized bailout procedure in 1982 by allowing jurisdictions to escape coverage by complying with act and affirmatively acting to expand minority political participation in addition to reauthorizing original special provisions and expanding coverage congress amended and added several other provisions to act for instance congress expanded original ban on tests or devices to apply nationwide in 1970 and in 1975 congress made ban permanent separately in 1975 congress expanded act s scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination congress defined language minority to mean persons who are american indian asian american alaskan natives or of spanish heritage voting rights act of 1965 ss 14 c 3 formerly 42 u s c ss 1973l c 3 congress amended various provisions such as preclearance requirement and section 2 s general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws to prohibit discrimination against language minorities congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in section 203 which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions with large numbers of english illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information in language of language minority group originally set to expire after 10 years congress reauthorized section 203 in 1982 for seven years expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years bilingual election requirements have remained controversial with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that bilingual election requirements constitute costly unfunded mandates several of amendments responded to judicial rulings with which congress disagreed in 1982 congress amended act to overturn supreme court case mobile v bolden 1980 which held that general prohibition of voting discrimination prescribed in section 2 prohibited only purposeful discrimination congress responded by expanding section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory effect regardless of whether practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose creation of this results test shifted majority of vote dilution litigation brought under act from preclearance lawsuits to section 2 lawsuits in 2006 congress amended act to overturn two supreme court cases reno v bossier parish school board 2000 reno v bossier parish school board which interpreted section 5 preclearance requirement to prohibit only voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a retrogressive discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose and georgia v ashcroft 2003 georgia v ashcroft which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates in 2014 voting rights amendments act was introduced in congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions in response to supreme court case shelby county v holder 2013 which struck down coverage formula as unconstitutional it was referred to constitution and civil justice congressional subcommittee on february 11 2015 but no action was taken on it and it expired provisions thumb alt refer to caption first page of voting rights act of 1965 act contains two types of provisions general provisions which apply nationwide and special provisions which apply to only certain states and local governments most provisions are designed to protect voting rights of racial and language minorities term language minority means persons who are american indian asian american alaskan natives or of spanish heritage act s provisions have been colored by numerous judicial interpretations and congressional amendments general provisions general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws section 2 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard practice or procedure in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of right to vote on account of race color or language minority status voting rights act of 1965 ss 2 formerly 42 u s c ss 1973 supreme court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce this prohibition in mobile v bolden 1980 supreme court held that as originally enacted in 1965 section 2 simply restated fifteenth amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose mobile v bolden in 1982 congress amended section 2 to create a results test which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose 1982 amendments provided that results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation when determining whether a jurisdiction s election law violates this general prohibition courts have relied on factors enumerated in senate judiciary committee report associated with 1982 amendments senate factors including history of official discrimination in jurisdiction that affects right to vote degree to which voting in jurisdiction is racially polarized extent of jurisdiction s use of majority vote requirements unusually large electoral districts prohibitions on bullet voting and other devices that tend to enhance opportunity for voting discrimination whether minority candidates are denied access to jurisdiction s candidate slating processes if any extent to which jurisdiction s minorities are discriminated against in socioeconomic areas such as education employment and health whether overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns exist extent to which minority candidates have won elections degree that elected officials are unresponsive to concerns of minority group and whether policy justification for challenged law is tenuous report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination vote denial in which a person is denied opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted and vote dilution in which strength or effectiveness of a person s vote is diminished most section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution especially claims that a jurisdiction s redistricting plan or use of at large multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates an at large election can dilute votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in jurisdiction redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by packing high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or cracking minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts in thornburg v gingles 1986 supreme court used term vote dilution through submergence to describe claims that a jurisdiction s use of an at large multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under section 2 under gingles test plaintiffs must show existence of three preconditions racial or language minority group is sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a single member district minority group is politically cohesive meaning its members tend to vote similarly and majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat minority s preferred candidate thornburg v gingles first precondition is known as compactness requirement and concerns whether a majority minority district can be created second and third preconditions are collectively known as racially polarized voting or racial bloc voting requirement and they concern whether voting patterns of different racial groups are different from each other if a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist then plaintiff must additionally show using remaining senate factors and other evidence that under totality of circumstances jurisdiction s redistricting plan or use of at large or multimember elections diminishes ability of minority group to elect candidates of its choice subsequent litigation further defined contours of these vote dilution through submergence claims in bartlett v strickland 2009 bartlett v strickland supreme court held that first gingles precondition can be satisfied only if a district can be drawn in which minority group comprises a majority of voting age citizens this means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where size of minority group despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with help of crossover votes from some members of majority group in contrast supreme court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy gingles preconditions as a coalition and lower courts have split on issue supreme court provided additional guidance on totality of circumstances test in johnson v de grandy 1994 court emphasized that existence of three gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans in particular court held that even where three gingles preconditions are satisfied a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority minority districts that is proportional to minority group s population size decision thus clarified that section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize number of majority minority districts opinion also distinguished proportionality of majority minority districts which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice from proportionality of election results which section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities an issue regarding third gingles precondition remains unresolved in gingles supreme court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race such as party affiliation a plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate congress s intent to make section 2 a results test but justice white maintained that proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in racial discrimination since gingles lower courts have split on issue although most section 2 litigation has involved claims of vote dilution through submergence courts also have addressed other types of vote dilution under this provision in holder v hall 1994 holder v hall supreme court held that claims that minority votes are diluted by small size of a governing body such as a one person county commission may not be brought under section 2 a plurality of court reasoned that no uniform non benchmark size for a governing body exists making relief under section 2 impossible another type of vote dilution may result from a jurisdiction s requirement that a candidate be elected by a majority vote a majority vote requirement may cause a minority group s candidate of choice who would have won election with a simple plurality of votes to lose after a majority of voters unite behind another candidate in a runoff election supreme court has not addressed whether such claims may be brought under section 2 and lower courts have reached different conclusions on issue in addition to claims of vote dilution courts have considered vote denial claims brought under section 2 supreme court in richardson v ramirez 1974 richardson v ramirez held that felony disenfranchisement laws cannot violate section 2 because among other reasons section 2 of fourteenth amendment permits such laws a federal district court in mississippi held that a dual registration system that requires a person to register to vote separately for state elections and local elections may violate section 2 if system has a racially disparate impact in light of senate factors mississippi state chapter operation push v allain 674 f supp 1245 n d miss 1987 starting in 2013 lower federal courts began to consider various challenges to voter id laws brought under section 2 specific prohibitions act contains several specific prohibitions on conduct that may interfere with a person s ability to cast an effective vote one of these prohibitions is prescribed in section 201 which prohibits any jurisdiction from requiring a person to comply with any test or device to register to vote or cast a ballot term test or device is defined as literacy tests educational or knowledge requirements proof of good moral character and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting voting rights act of 1965 ss 201 formerly 42 u s c ss before act s enactment these devices were primary tools used by jurisdictions to prevent racial minorities from voting originally act suspended tests or devices temporarily in jurisdictions covered by section 4 b coverage formula but congress subsequently expanded prohibition to entire country and made it permanent relatedly section 202 prohibits jurisdictions from imposing any residency requirement that requires persons to have lived in jurisdiction for more than 30 days before being eligible to vote in a presidential election several further protections for voters are contained in section 11 section 11 a prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter s ballot similarly section 11 b prohibits any person from intimidating harassing or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote two provisions in section 11 address voter fraud section 11 c prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election and section 11 e prohibits voting twice in a federal election finally under section 208 a jurisdiction may not prevent anyone who is english illiterate or has a disability from being accompanied into ballot box by an assistant of person s choice only exceptions are that assistant may not be an agent of person s employer or union bail in section 3 c contains a bail in or pocket trigger process by which jurisdictions that fall outside coverage formula of section 4 b may become subject to preclearance under this provision if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters in violation of fourteenth or fifteenth amendments a court may order jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws by federal government because courts have interpreted fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to prohibit only intentional discrimination a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if plaintiff proves that jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate section 3 c contains its own preclearance language and differs from section 5 preclearance in several ways unlike section 5 preclearance which applies to a covered jurisdiction until such time as jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under section 4 a bailed in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long as court orders moreover court may require jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes for example bail in of new mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans this differs from section 5 preclearance which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes during act s early history section 3 c was little used no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975 between 1975 and 2013 18 jurisdictions were bailed in including 16 local governments and states of arkansas and new mexico although supreme court held section 4 b coverage formula unconstitutional in shelby county v holder 2013 it did not hold section 3 c unconstitutional therefore jurisdictions may continue to be bailed in and subjected to section 3 c preclearance in months following shelby county courts began to consider requests by attorney general and other plaintiffs to bail in states of texas and north carolina and in january 2014 a federal court bailed in evergreen alabama a more narrow bail in process pertaining to federal observer certification is prescribed in section 3 a under this provision a federal court may certify a non covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if court determines that jurisdiction violated voting rights guaranteed by fourteenth or fifteenth amendments jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under section 3 a are not subject to preclearance special provisions coverage formula thumb upright 1 2 alt map depicting states and counties encompassed by act s coverage formula in january

majority of map accurately depicts covered jurisdictions before supreme court s decision in shelby county v holder 2013 which declared coverage formula unconstitutional section 4 b contains a coverage formula that determines which states and local governments may be subjected to act s other special provisions except for section 203 c bilingual election requirements which fall under a different formula congress intended for coverage formula to encompass most pervasively discriminatory jurisdictions a jurisdiction is covered by formula if as of november 1 1964 1968 or 1972 jurisdiction used a test or device to restrict opportunity to register and vote and less than half of jurisdiction s eligible citizens were registered to vote on november 1 1964 1968 or 1972 or less than half of eligible citizens voted in presidential election of november 1964 1968 or 1972 as originally enacted coverage formula contained only november 1964 triggering dates subsequent revisions to law supplemented it with additional triggering dates of november 1968 and november 1972 which brought more jurisdictions into coverage for purposes of coverage formula term test or device includes same four devices prohibited nationally by section 201 literacy tests educational or knowledge requirements proof of good moral character and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting and one further device defined in section 4 f 3 in jurisdictions where more than 5 of citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group any practice or requirement by which registration or election materials are provided only in english types of jurisdictions that coverage formula applies to include states and political subdivisions of states section 14 c 2 defines political subdivision to mean any county parish or other subdivision of a state which conducts registration for voting voting rights act ss 14 c 2 formerly 42 u s c ss 1973l c 2 as congress added new triggering dates to coverage formula new jurisdictions were brought into coverage 1965 coverage formula included whole of alabama alaska georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina and virginia and some subdivisions usually counties in arizona hawaii idaho and north carolina 1968 coverage resulted in partial coverage of alaska arizona california connecticut idaho maine massachusetts new hampshire new york and wyoming connecticut idaho maine massachusetts and wyoming filed successful bailout lawsuits as also provided by section 4 1972 coverage covered whole of alaska arizona and texas and parts of california florida michigan new york north carolina and south dakota special provisions of act were initially due to expire in 1970 and congress renewed them for another five years in 1975 act s special provisions were extended for another seven years in 1982 coverage formula was extended again this time for 25 years but no changes were made to coverage formula and in 2006 coverage formula was again extended for 25 years throughout its history coverage formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions for scrutiny most of which were in deep south in shelby county v holder 2013 supreme court declared coverage formula unconstitutional because criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism other special provisions that are dependent on coverage formula such as section 5 preclearance requirement remain valid law however without a valid coverage formula these provisions are unenforceable preclearance requirement section rights act of 1965 ss 5 formerly 42 u s c ss 1973c requires that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval known as preclearance before implementing changes to their election laws a covered jurisdiction has burden of proving that change does not have purpose or effect of discriminating on basis of race or language minority status if jurisdiction fails to meet this burden federal government will deny preclearance and jurisdiction s change will not go into effect supreme court broadly interpreted section 5 s scope in allen v state board of election 1969 allen v state board of elections holding that any change in a jurisdiction s voting practices even if minor must be submitted for preclearance court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared private plaintiffs may sue jurisdiction in plaintiff s local district court before a three judge panel in these section 5 enforcement actions a court considers whether jurisdiction made a covered voting change and if so whether change had been precleared if jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance court will order jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing change however court may not consider merits of whether change should be approved lopez v monterey county lopez i jurisdictions may seek preclearance through either an administrative preclearance process or a judicial preclearance process if a jurisdiction seeks administrative preclearance attorney general will consider whether proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect after jurisdiction submits proposed change attorney general has 60 days to interpose an objection to it 60 day period may be extended an additional 60 days if jurisdiction later submits additional information if attorney general interposes an objection then change is not precleared and may not be implemented attorney general s decision is not subject to judicial review morris v but if attorney general interposes an objection jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance and court may disregard attorney general s objection at its discretion if a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance it must file a declaratory judgment action against attorney general in u s district court for d c a three judge panel will consider whether voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect and losing party may appeal directly to supreme court private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits in several cases supreme court has addressed meaning of discriminatory effect and discriminatory purpose for section 5 purposes in beer v united states 1976 beer v united states court held that for a voting change to have a prohibited discriminatory effect it must result in retrogression backsliding under this standard a voting change that causes discrimination but does not result in more discrimination than before change was made cannot be denied preclearance for having a discriminatory effect for example replacing a poll tax with an equally expensive voter registration fee is not a retrogressive change because it causes equal discrimination not more relying on senate report for act court reasoned that retrogression standard was correct interpretation of term discriminatory effect because section 5 s purpose is to insure that gains thus far achieved in minority political participation shall not be destroyed through new discriminatory procedures retrogression standard applies irrespective of whether voting change allegedly causes vote denial or vote dilution in 2003 supreme court held in georgia v ashcroft that courts should not determine that a new redistricting plan has a retrogressive effect solely because plan decreases number of minority majority districts court emphasized that judges should analyze various other factors under totality of circumstances such as whether redistricting plan increases number of influence districts in which a minority group is large enough to influence but not decide election outcomes in 2006 congress overturned this decision by amending section 5 to explicitly state that diminishing ability of a protected minority to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or right to vote within meaning of section 5 voting rights act of 1965 ss 5 b formerly 42 u s c ss 1973c b uncertainty remains as to what this language precisely means and how courts may interpret it before 2000 discriminatory purpose prong of section 5 was understood to mean any discriminatory purpose which is same standard used to determine whether discrimination is unconstitutional in reno v bossier parish bossier parish ii 2000 supreme court extended retrogression standard holding that for a voting change to have a discriminatory purpose under section 5 change must have been implemented for a retrogressive purpose therefore a voting change intended to discriminate against a protected minority was permissible under section 5 so long as change was not intended to increase existing discrimination this change significantly reduced number of instances in which preclearance was denied based on discriminatory purpose in 2006 congress overturned bossier parish ii by amending section 5 to explicitly define purpose to mean any discriminatory purpose voting rights act of 1965 ss 5 c formerly 42 u s c 1973c c federal examiners and observers until 2006 amendments to act section 6 allowed appointment of federal examiners to oversee certain jurisdictions voter registration functions federal examiners could be assigned to a covered jurisdiction if attorney general certified that department of justice received 20 or more meritorious complaints that covered jurisdiction denied its residents right to vote based on race or language minority status or assignment of federal examiners was otherwise necessary to enforce voting rights guaranteed by fourteenth or fifteenth amendments federal examiners had authority to register voters examine voter registration applications and maintain voter rolls goal of federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in voter registration process such as refusing to register qualified applicants purging qualified voters from voter rolls and limiting hours during which persons could register federal examiners were used extensively in years following act s enactment but their importance waned over time 1983 was last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote in 2006 congress repealed provision under act s original framework in any jurisdiction certified for federal examiners attorney general could additionally require appointment of federal observers by 2006 federal examiner provision was used solely as a means to appoint federal observers when congress repealed federal examiner provision in 2006 congress amended section 8 to allow for assignment of federal observers to jurisdictions that satisfied same certification criteria that had been used to appoint federal examiners federal observers are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate ballots goal of federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in election process such as election officials denying qualified minority persons right to cast a ballot intimidation or harassment of voters on election day or improper vote counting discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits between 1965 and supreme court s 2013 decision in shelby county v holder to strike down coverage formula attorney general certified 153 local governments across 11 states because of time and resource constraints federal observers are not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to bail out of its certification bailout under section 4 a a covered jurisdiction may seek exemption from coverage through a process called bailout to achieve an exemption a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three judge panel of district court for d c that jurisdiction is eligible to bail out as originally enacted a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail out if it had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during 5 years preceding its bailout request therefore a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed to prove that it had not misused a test or device since at least 1962 until 1970 this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before act was enacted five years earlier in 1965 making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out however section 4 a also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner discriminatory or otherwise hence under original act a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement but in course of amending act in 1970 and 1975 to extend special provisions congress also extended period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years respectively these extensions continued effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before act s enactment in 1965 in 1982 congress amended section 4 a to make bailout easier to achieve in two ways first congress provided that if a state is covered local governments in that state may bail out even if state is ineligible to bail out second congress liberalized eligibility criteria by replacing 17 year requirement with a new standard allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out by proving that in 10 years preceding its bailout request jurisdiction did not use a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect no court determined that jurisdiction denied or abridged right to vote based on racial or language minority status jurisdiction complied with preclearance requirement federal government did not assign federal examiners to jurisdiction jurisdiction abolished discriminatory election practices and jurisdiction took affirmative steps to eliminate voter intimidation and expand voting opportunities for protected minorities additionally congress required jurisdictions seeking bailout to produce evidence of minority registration and voting rates including how these rates have changed over time and in comparison to registration and voting rates of majority if court determines that covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout it will enter a declaratory judgment in jurisdiction s favor court will retain jurisdiction for following 10 years and may order jurisdiction back into coverage if jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination voting rights act of 1965 ss 4 a formerly 42 u s c ss 1973 a 1 f 1982 amendment to bailout eligibility standard went into effect on august 5 1984 between that date and 2013 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions in each instance attorney general consented to bailout request between that date and 2009 all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in virginia in 2009 a municipal utility jurisdiction in texas bailed out after supreme court s opinion in northwest austin municipal utility district no 1 v holder 2009 northwest austin municipal utility district no 1 v holder which held that local governments that do not register voters have ability to bail out after this ruling jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before supreme court held in shelby county v holder 2013 that coverage formula was unconstitutional separate provisions allow a covered jurisdiction that has been certified to receive federal observers to bail out of its certification alone under section 13 attorney general may terminate certification of a jurisdiction if 1 more than 50 of jurisdiction s minority voting age population is registered to vote and 2 there is no longer reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination alternatively district court for d c may order certification terminated bilingual election requirements two provisions require certain jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages section 4 f 4 and section 203 c a jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials related to an election such as voter registration materials ballots notices and instructions in language of any applicable language minority group residing in jurisdiction language minority groups protected by these provisions include asian americans hispanics native americans and native alaskans voting rights act of 1965 ss 4 f 4 formerly 42 u s c ss 1973b f 4 congress enacted provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against protected groups section 4 f 4 applies to any jurisdiction encompassed by section 4 b coverage formula where more than 5 of citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group section 203 c contains a formula that is separate from section 4 b coverage formula and therefore jurisdictions covered solely by 203 c are not subject to act s other special provisions such as preclearance section 203 c formula encompasses jurisdictions where following conditions exist a single language minority is present that has an english illiteracy rate higher than national average and either number of limited english proficient members of language minority group is at least 10 000 voting age citizens or large enough to comprise at least 5 of jurisdiction s voting age citizen population or jurisdiction is a political subdivision that contains an indian reservation and more than 5 of jurisdiction s american indian or alaska native voting age citizens are members of a single language minority and are limited english proficient section 203 b defines limited english proficient as being unable to speak or understand english adequately enough to participate in electoral process determinations as to which jurisdictions satisfy section 203 c criteria occur once a decade following completion of decennial census at these times new jurisdictions may come into coverage while others may have their coverage terminated additionally under section 203 d a jurisdiction may bail out of section 203 c coverage by proving in federal court that no language minority group within jurisdiction has an english illiteracy rate that is higher than national illiteracy rate after 2010 census 150 jurisdictions across 25 states were covered under section 203 c including statewide coverage of california texas and florida impact thumb alt refer to caption final page of voting rights act of 1965 signed by president lyndon b johnson president of senate hubert humphrey and speaker of house john mccormack after its enactment in 1965 law immediately decreased racial discrimination in voting suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for high numbers of racial minorities to register to vote nearly 250 000 african americans registered in 1965 one third of whom were registered by federal examiners in covered jurisdictions less than one third 29 3 of african american population was registered in 1965 by 1967 this number increased to more than half 52 1 and a majority of african american residents became registered to vote in 9 of 13 southern states similar increases were seen in number of african americans elected to office between 1965 and 1985 african americans elected as state legislators in 11 former confederate states increased from 3 to 176 nationwide number of african american elected officials increased from 1 469 in 1970 to 4 912 in 1980 by 2011 number was approximately 10 500 similarly registration rates for language minority groups increased after congress enacted bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992 in 1973 percent of hispanics registered to vote was 34 9 by 2006 that amount nearly doubled number of asian americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58 by 2006 after act s initial success in combating tactics designed to deny minorities access to polls act became predominately used as a tool to challenge racial vote dilution starting in 1970s attorney general commonly raised section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased effectiveness of racial minorities votes including discriminatory annexations redistricting plans and election methods such as at large election systems runoff election requirements and prohibitions on bullet voting in total 81 2 541 of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution claims brought under section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution between 1982 creation of section 2 results test and 2006 at least 331 section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions in 1980s 60 of section 2 lawsuits challenged at large election systems in 1990s 37 2 challenged at large election systems and 38 5 challenged redistricting plans overall plaintiffs succeeded in 37 2 of 331 lawsuits and they were more likely to succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions by enfranchising racial minorities act facilitated a political realignment of democratic and republican parties between 1890 and 1965 minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative southern democrats to dominate southern politics after democratic president lyndon b johnson signed act into law newly enfranchised racial minorities began to vote for liberal democratic candidates throughout south and southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from democrat to republican en masse these dual trends caused two parties to ideologically polarize with democratic party becoming more liberal and republican party becoming more conservative trends also created competition between two parties which republicans capitalized on by implementing southern strategy over subsequent decades creation of majority minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments by packing liberal leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority minority districts large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white conservative and republican while this increased elected representation of racial minorities as intended it also decreased white democratic representation and increased representation of republicans overall by mid 1990s these trends culminated in a political realignment democratic party and republican party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties respectively and both parties came to compete for electoral success in south with republican party controlling most of southern politics a 2016 study in american journal of political science found that members of congress who represented jurisdictions subject to preclearance requirement were substantially more supportive of civil rights related legislation than legislators who did not represent covered jurisdictions a 2018 study in journal of politics found that section 5 of 1965 voting rights act increased black voter registration by 14 19 percentage points white registration by 10 13 percentage points and overall voter turnout by 10 19 percentage points additional results for democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites a 2019 study in american economic journal found that preclearance substantially increased turnout among minorities even as far as to 2012 year prior to supreme court ruling ending preclearance study estimates that preclearance led to an increase in minority turnout of 17 percentage points constitutionality voter eligibility provisions early in act s enforcement history supreme court addressed constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting in katzenbach v morgan 1966 court upheld constitutionality of section 4 e this section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth grade education in an american school in which predominant language was spanish such as schools in puerto rico voting rights act of 1965 ss 4 e formerly 42 u s c ss 1973b e although court had earlier held in lassiter v northampton county board of elections 1959 that literacy tests did not violate fourteenth amendment lassiter v northampton county board of elections in morgan court held that congress could enforce fourteenth amendment rights such as right to vote by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional katzenbach v morgan after congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting section 201 court upheld ban as constitutional in oregon v mitchell 1970 oregon v mitchell also in oregon v mitchell supreme court addressed constitutionality of various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting court upheld section 202 which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election additionally court upheld provision lowering minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections but it held that congress exceeded its power by lowering voting age to 18 in state elections this precipitated ratification of twenty sixth amendment following year which lowered voting age in all elections to 18 court was deeply divided in oregon v mitchell and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for holding section 2 results test constitutionality of section 2 which contains a general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws has not been definitively explained by supreme court as amended in 1982 section 2 prohibits any voting practice that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether practice was enacted or is administered for purpose of discriminating this results test contrasts with fourteenth and fifteenth amendments both of which directly prohibit only purposeful discrimination given this disparity whether supreme court would uphold constitutionality of section 2 as appropriate legislation passed to enforce fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and under what rationale remains unclear in mississippi republican executive opinion v brooks 1984 mississippi republican executive opinion v brooks supreme court summarily affirmed without a written opinion a lower court s decision that 1982 amendment to section 2 is constitutional justice rehnquist joined by chief justice burger dissented from opinion their reasoning was that case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing in later cases supreme court is more likely to disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion but lower courts must respect supreme court s unwritten summary as being as equally binding on them as supreme court judgments with written opinions partially due to brooks constitutionality of section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts coverage formula and preclearance supreme court has upheld constitutionality of section 5 preclearance requirement in three cases first case was south carolina v katzenbach 1966 south carolina v katzenbach which was decided about five months after act s enactment court held that section 5 constituted a valid use of congress s power to enforce fifteenth amendment reasoning that exceptional circumstances of pervasive racial discrimination combined with inadequacy of case by case litigation in ending that discrimination justified preclearance requirement court also upheld constitutionality of 1965 coverage formula saying that it was rational in both practice and theory and that bailout provision provided adequate relief for jurisdictions that may not deserve coverage supreme court again upheld preclearance requirement in city of rome v united states 1980 city of rome v united states court held that because congress had explicit constitutional power to enforce reconstruction amendments by appropriate legislation act did not violate principles of federalism court also explicitly upheld discriminatory effect prong of section 5 stating that even though fifteenth amendment directly prohibited only intentional discrimination congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate risk that jurisdictions may engage in intentional discrimination finally court upheld 1975 extension of section 5 because of record of discrimination that continued to persist in covered jurisdictions court further suggested that temporary nature of special provisions was relevant to section 5 s constitutionality final case in which supreme court upheld section 5 was lopez v monterey county lopez ii 1999 lopez v monterey county lopez ii in lopez ii court reiterated its reasoning in katzenbach and rome and it upheld as constitutional requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement even if parent state was not itself a covered jurisdiction 2006 extension of section 5 was challenged before supreme court in northwest austin municipal utility district no 1 v holder 2009 lawsuit was brought by a municipal water district in texas that elected members to a water board district wished to move a voting location from a private home to a public school but that change was subject to preclearance because texas was a covered jurisdiction district did not register voters and thus it did not appear to qualify as a political subdivision eligible to bail out of coverage although court indicated in dicta a non binding part of court s opinion that section 5 presented difficult constitutional questions it did not declare section 5 unconstitutional instead it interpreted law to allow any covered local government including one that does not register voters to obtain an exemption from preclearance if it meets bailout requirements on november 9 2012 supreme court granted certiorari in case of shelby county v holder limited to question of whether congress decision in 2006 to reauthorize section 5 of voting rights act under pre existing coverage formula of section 4 b exceeded its authority under fourteenth and fifteenth amendments thus violating tenth amendment and article iv of united states constitution on june 25 2013 court struck down section 4 b as unconstitutional court reasoned that coverage formula violates constitutional principles of equal sovereignty of states and federalism because its disparate treatment of states is based on 40 year old facts having no logical relationship to present day which makes formula unresponsive to current needs court did not strike down section 5 but without section 4 b no jurisdiction may be subject to section 5 preclearance unless congress enacts a new coverage formula after decision several states that were fully or partially covered including texas mississippi north carolina and south carolina implemented laws that were previously denied preclearance this prompted new legal challenges to these laws under other provisions unaffected by court s decision such as section 2 racial gerrymandering while section 2 and section 5 prohibit jurisdictions from drawing electoral districts that dilute votes of protected minorities supreme court has held that in some instances equal protection clause of fourteenth amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities court first recognized justiciability of affirmative racial gerrymandering claims in shaw v reno 1993 shaw v reno shaw i in miller v johnson 1995 miller v johnson court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if jurisdiction used race as predominant factor in determining how to draw district lines for race to predominate jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles which include compactness and respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests if a court concludes that racial considerations predominated then redistricting plan is considered racially gerrymandered and must be subjected to strict scrutiny meaning that redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional only if it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest in bush v vera 1996 bush v vera a plurality of supreme court assumed that complying with section 2 or section 5 constituted compelling interests and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering see also help america vote act hava national voter registration act of 1993 uniformed and overseas
