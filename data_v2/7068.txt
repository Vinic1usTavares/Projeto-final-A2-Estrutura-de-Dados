of best episodes ever and mtv s aly semigran called it authentic and one of very best of season if not series as a whole robert canning of ign wrote that it was a great episode that truly showcased talents of jane lynch and rated it 8 5 out of 10 rolling stone erica futterman said that episode felt like a recycled version of things we ve seen previously and added that show is not as entertaining when it s simply a showcase emily vanderwerff of a v club gave episode a c and characterized funeral scene as highlight of an uneven episode atlantic kevin fallon wrote killing off sue s sister seemed cruel but ultimately paid off it s too bad episode completely derailed afterward dying its own rapid death in turn anthony benigno of faster times had little good to say and singled out writers for doing such a crappy job on penultimate episode of season lynch as sue received high praise for her acting canning wrote that she stole episode and perfectly portrayed a woman whose hard heart was trying terribly not to break but not being able to stop it buddytv john kubicek stated it s impossible for me to say that lynch wasn t exceptional because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with character respers france commented that we got to see range and complexity of sue sylvester and sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly said that lynch did an outstanding job of delivering even funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness sue s characterization in series was criticized by several reviewers however amy reiter of los angeles times stated that consistent inconsistency of sue s character is wearing thin and that our sense of her fails to advance wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister futterman called episode a too little too late attempt at redemption for sue s poor characterization this season vanderwerff wrote that episode feels very self consciously like a way to just remove her character from table for season finale that it feels very self consciously like an attempt by show to address fact that character doesn t make any sense and criticized death of jean killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it fallon described funeral plot line as pure classic glee random emotionally manipulative wholly unnecessary to plot development and in end deeply moving secondary plot line about auditions for new directions soloist at nationals was roundly criticized canning called it a faux drama though he added that jesse was a delight to despise and vanderwerff said it was completely ridiculous to do this with nationals coming up in a week s time and constructed almost entirely to make jesse a jerk houston chronicle bobby hankinson also hit on lack of preparation for upcoming competition and stated that it seemed like a very bad idea to be going without a setlist already decided on much less with songs unwritten he said four audition numbers were awkwardly paced though he thought they were fantastic reiter said they stood out like gems in a somewhat muddy episode canning and vanderwerff also criticized block of four songs in middle of episode which as vanderwerff put it stops show cold james poniewozik of time was unhappy for another reason altogether having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music but it ain t a musical poniewozik wrote of will s broadway plans that his ambitions and guilt over them make a much more believable and compelling conflict than matthew morrison has had to convey for much of season vanderwerff complimented morrison on his portrayal of will every time show hands him anything to play that s something that makes vague sense he does a good job with it other kudos for actors were provided by respers france who highlighted further great acting seen during finn and quinn s moment in his truck and e online jenna mullins who called scene where finn and kurt help sue with her sister s room positively heartbreaking and trio of characters magnificent although canning stated that terri leaving lacked much punch poniewozik commented that it was satisfying to see her realized as an adult for once musical commentary while placement of four solos together in middle of episode was questioned songs themselves were met with approbation vanderwerff called all four really good performances santana s rendition of back to black was declared spot on by futterman and raymund flandez of wall street journal wrote that it was performed with raspy sensitivity and went deep into emotional truth of song kubicek was less enthusiastic and called it pretty good but nothing groundbreaking or special and semigran called it decent benigno said that rivera s delivery gives this song its smoldering swagger and gave it an a and poniewozik praised rivera as really impressive some people received adequate to good reviews gonzalez missed kurt s usual charisma and thought performance a bit lackluster and benigno called it kind of a boring cover it received their lowest grades of show b and b respectively kubicek stated kurt has a unique voice that sounds positively beautiful with right melodic song but this is a terrible song for his style and vanity fair brett berk added after he gave it two out of five stars that it was not best showcase of kurt s talents futterman and reiter referred approvingly to kurt s upper register and both reiter and respers france said he ripped it on his song try a little tenderness received a stream of bouquets from critics kubicek raved that mercedes gave 100 of what she has to offer which is pure greatness and respers france said she stole night and was amazing berk broke his own scale of one to five stars with six stars and praised unstinting instrument that is mercedes voice gonzalez gave it an a and called it pure perfection but benigno was more restrained with a b and wrote she hits a little too hard for my taste and vocals threaten to engulf song itself my man was also lauded flandez called it and futterman summed up with she nails funny girl closer making it one of rachel s top performances on show berk called it good singing and gave it three stars out of five and gonzalez gave it an a benigno was more generous with an a grade and said even by lea michele s standards vocals here are fan fucking tastic hankinson agreed rachel truly nailed most difficult song she s ever sung one group number pure imagination received reviews that touched on song itself as much as performance fallon called it unsettling yet touching and poniewozik described it as odd but perfect berk on other hand characterized it as pure dreck benigno felt that while song was really quite good stupidity of scene it was in detracted from it resulting in a grade of b while gonzalez when she gave it an a said she hadn t been a huge fan of cover when she heard it before show aired but it grew on her in context futterman wrote new directions break into a restrained tender take on pure imagination with lush harmonies on chorus that s exactly right for moment chart history only three of five cover versions debuted on billboard hot 100 pure imagination debuted at number fifty nine back to black at number eighty two and my man at number ninety four peak chart positions for season 2 singles
