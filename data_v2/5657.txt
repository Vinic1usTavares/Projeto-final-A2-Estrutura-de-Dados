right thumb 320px paintings of four times of day clockwise from top left morning noon night and evening four times of day is a series of four oil paintings by english artist william hogarth they were completed in 1736 and in 1738 were reproduced and published as a series of four engravings they are humorous depictions of life in streets of london vagaries of fashion and interactions between rich and poor unlike many of hogarth s other series such as a harlot s progress a rake s progress industry and idleness and four stages of cruelty it does not depict story of an individual but instead focuses on society of city in a humourous manner hogarth does not offer a judgment on whether rich or poor are more deserving of viewer s sympathies in each scene while upper and middle classes tend to provide focus there are fewer moral comparisons than seen in some of his other works their dimensions are about by each four pictures depict scenes of daily life in various locations in london as day progresses morning shows a prudish spinster making her way to church in covent garden past revellers of previous night noon shows two cultures on opposite sides of street in st giles evening depicts a dyer s family returning hot and bothered from a trip to sadler s wells and night shows disreputable goings on around a drunken freemason staggering home near charing cross background four times of day was first set of prints that hogarth published after his two great successes a harlot s progress 1732 and a rake s progress 1735 it was among first of his prints to be published after engraving copyright act 1734 which hogarth had helped push through parliament a rake s progress had taken early advantage of protection afforded by new law unlike harlot and rake four prints in times of day do not form a consecutive narrative and none of characters appears in more than one scene hogarth conceived of series as representing in a humorous manner morning noon evening and night hogarth took his inspiration for series from classical satires of horace and juvenal via their augustan counterparts particularly john gay s trivia and jonathan swift s a description of a city shower and a description of morning paulson 1992 pp 140 149 he took his artistic models from other series of times of day seasons and ages of man such as those by nicolas poussin and nicholas and from pastoral scenes but executed them with a twist by transferring them to city he also drew on flemish times of day style known as points du jour in which gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses shesgreen 1983 p 12 but in hogarth s works gods were recast as his central characters lady a frosty aurora in morning pie girl a pretty london venus in noon pregnant woman a sweaty diana in evening and freemason a drunken pluto in night left thumb william portrait 1758 hogarth designed series for an original commission by jonathan tyers in 1736 in which he requested a number of paintings to decorate supper boxes at vauxhall gardens paulson 1992 p 127 128 hogarth is believed to have suggested to tyers that supper boxes at gardens be decorated with paintings as part of their refurbishment among works featured when renovation was completed was hogarth s picture of henry viii and anne boleyn originals of four times of day were sold to other collectors but scenes were reproduced at vauxhall by francis hayman and two of them evening and night hung at pleasure gardens until at least 1782 dobbs p 30 engravings are mirror images of paintings since engraved plates are copied from paintings image is reversed when printed which leads to problems ascertaining times shown on clocks in some of scenes images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in london at time but moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of hogarth s other works and lower classes do not escape ridicule either often theme is one of over orderliness versus chaos paulson 1971 p 404 four plates depict four times of day but they also move through seasons morning is set in winter noon in spring and evening in summer however night sometimes misidentified as being in september takes place on oak apple day in may rather than in autumn evening was engraved by bernard baron a french engraver who was living in london and although designs are hogarth s it is not known whether he engraved any of four plates himself prints along with a fifth picture strolling actresses dressing in a barn from 1738 were sold by subscription for one guinea ps in half payable on ordering and half on delivery after subscription price rose to five shillings per print ps in making five print set four shillings dearer overall although strolling actresses dressing in a barn was not directly connected to other prints it seems that hogarth always envisaged selling five prints together adding strolling actresses as a complementary theme just as he had added southwark fair to subscription for rake s progress whereas characters in four times play their roles without being conscious of acting company of strolling actresses are fully aware of differences between reality of their lives and roles they are set to play representations of aurora and diana also appear in both hogarth advertised prints for sale in may 1737 again in january 1738 and finally announced plates were ready on 26 april 1738 paintings were sold individually at an auction on 25 january 1745 along with original paintings for a harlot s progress a rake s progress and strolling actresses dressing in a barn cunningham p 124 sir william heathcote purchased morning and night for 20 guineas and ps20 6s respectively ps and ps in and duke of ancaster bought noon for ps38 17s ps in and evening for ps39 18s ps

prim is followed by her shivering red nosed pageboy mirroring hesperus dawn bearer woman is only one who seems unaffected by cold suggesting it may be her element although outwardly shocked dress of woman which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind she is commonly described as a spinster and considered to be a hypocrite ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing or half seen beggar before her figure of spinster is said to be based on a relative of hogarth who recognising herself in picture cut him out of her will fielding later used woman as model for his character of bridget in tom jones right thumb spinster

object hangs at her side interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors in form of a skeleton or a miniature portrait hinting perhaps at a romantic disappointment although clearly a portrait in painting object is indistinct in prints from engraving other parts of scene are clearer in print however in background a quack is selling his medicine and while in painting advertising board is little more than a transparent outline in print dr rock s name can be discerned inscribed on board below royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment salesman may be rock himself hogarth s opinion of rock is made clear in penultimate plate of a harlot s progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with dr while moll hackabout dies unattended in corner hogarth revisited morning in his bidding ticket battle of pictures for auction of his works held in 1745 in this his own paintings are pictured being attacked by ranks of old masters morning is

her nagging head removed to create man s ideal of a good woman paulson 1979 p 31 2 in top window of good woman a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into street as she argues providing a stark contrast to good woman pictured on sign below ronald paulson sees kite hanging from church as part of a trinity of signs kite indicating purpose of church ascent into heaven just as other signs for good eating and good woman indicate predilections of those on that side of street however he also notes it as another nod to pastoral tradition here instead of soaring above fields it hangs on church wall time is unclear allan cunningham states it is half past eleven cunningham p 118 and suggests that hogarth uses early hour to highlight debauchery occurring opposite church yet print shows hands at a time that could equally be half past twelve paulson 1965 p 179 and painting shows a thin golden hand pointing to ten past twelve in this scene more than any of others hogarth s sympathies seem to be with lower classes and more specifically with english although there is disorder on english side of street there is an abundance of good eating and characters are rosy cheeked and well nourished even street girl can eat her fill pinch faced huguenots on other hand have their customs and dress treated as mercilessly as any characters in series a national enmity towards french even french refugees may explain why english are depicted somewhat more here than they are by figures in accompanying scenes hogarth mocked continental fashions again in marriage a la mode 1743 1745 and made a

four times of day was first series of prints that hogarth had issued since success of harlot and rake and would be only set he would issue until marriage a la mode in 1745 so it was eagerly anticipated on hearing of its imminent issue george faulkner wrote from dublin that he would take 50 sets cunningham p 120 series lacks moral lessons that are found in earlier series and revisited in marriage a la mode and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve same success though it has found an enduring niche as a snapshot of society of hogarth s time at auction of 1745 paintings of four times of day raised more than those of rake and night which is generally regarded as worst of series fetched highest single total cunningham commented sarcastically such was reward then to which patrons of genius thought these works entitled cunningham p 126 while horace walpole praised accompanying print strolling actresses dressing in a barn as being finest of hogarth s works he had little to say of four times of day other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with hogarth s other works walpole in hogarth p 70 morning and night are now in national trust bearsted

clock as ex hoc momento in his new view of london and did not mention a figure above it date 1715 is shown on clock case in 1717 volume of vitruvius britannicus so perhaps indicates clock had been

were not common pets in london during his lifetime they are often depicted suffering consequences of life of a vagabond on streets in contrast to dogs which are normally shown reflecting feelings of their masters or good naturedly testing limits of society one notable exception is first plate of four stages of cruelty in which cruelty of society is reflected by torture of faithful dog references
