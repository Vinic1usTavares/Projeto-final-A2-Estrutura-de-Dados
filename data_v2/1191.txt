details available sources give no clue as to albin s pattern of allegiance in these factional politics and neither do his recorded activities professor donald watt has suggested that albin was probably aligned with durward faction in contrast for instance to allegedly comyn aligned clement of dunblane watt dictionary pp 5 7 watt even argued that albin s postulation was probably due to influence of alan durward who at time was a close advisor of king alexander ii middle episcopate 1250s thumb modern photograph of brechin cathedral and round tower despite albin s suggested allegiance

archdeaconry to abbot of arbroath who then appointed adam one of albin s relatives outcome of case is not known and it is therefore unclear whether or not adam was deposed as archdeacon all that can be confirmed is that no other archdeacon is attested by name until 1284 watt dictionary p 7 watt fasti ecclesiae p 54 stay of cardinal ottobono fieschi later pope adrian v in england from 29 october
