being designated as a royal borough and 100th anniversary of it becoming a city it was designed by spouses william marks simpson and marjory emory simpson virginia senator carter glass sought legislation for a norfolk half dollar but bill was amended in committee to provide for commemorative medals instead unaware of change glass and bill s sponsor in house of representatives absalom w robertson shepherded legislation through congress local authorities in norfolk did not want medals and sought an amendment which passed congress in june 1937 legislation required that all coins be dated 1936 thus there are five dates on half dollar none of which are date of coining 1937 by that time anniversaries had passed and sales were poorer than hoped almost a third of mintage was returned

charter as a royal borough by george ii and lieutenant governor of virginia robert dinwiddie presented norfolk with a ceremonial mace in 1753 making norfolk only american city to have a mace from colonial times despite being nearly destroyed during american revolutionary war norfolk was almost as large a port as new york city by 1790 but its importance declined in 19th century it remains home to a major naval base in 1930s commemorative coins were not sold by government congress in authorizing legislation usually designated an organization which had exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to public at a premium in case of norfolk half dollar responsible group was norfolk advertising board inc affiliated with norfolk chamber of commerce legislation virginia senator carter glass introduced a bill for a norfolk bicentennial half dollar on may 20 1936 it was referred to committee on banking and commerce bill was reported back to senate by alva adams of colorado on june 20 committee recommended in report that a medal not a coin be issued they attached a 1935 letter from president franklin d roosevelt complaining that commemorative coins of a purely local nature were being authorized by congress and recommending that commemorative medals be issued instead june 20 1936 final day of session was an exceptionally busy day in congress after adams reported bill back to senate 1936 congressional record vol 82 p 10345 june 20 1936 glass attempted to have it considered by that body but initially joseph guffey of pennsylvania objected demanding regular order 1936 congressional record vol 82 p june 20 1936 later that day glass advised senate that guffey had stated he would not further object and again asked to have bill considered this time it passed without objection or debate and title was changed to reflect that medals were to be struck rather than coins 1936 congressional record vol 82 p june 20 1936 bill was considered by house of representatives later same day absalom w robertson of virginia moved that house pass it stating that bill authorized medals but when questioned by robert f rich of pennsylvania stated that bill was for silver coins 1936 congressional record vol 82 p 10680 june 20 1936 house passed bill without amendment or debate and it was signed into law by president roosevelt on 28th such medals would have had no market as collectors of day preferred legal tender coins which is what promoters of bill wanted and so no medals were struck it was at first hoped that initial bill might be used to authorize coins when this proved not to be case head of norfolk advertising board franklin e turin was interviewed in norfolk ledger dispatch on august 5 and ripped away veil of secrecy that has shrouded negotiations and called a spade a spade turin blamed roosevelt for mix up and stated that senator glass had said he had not realized bill had been changed nor had representative robertson senator glass promised another attempt glass reintroduced bill this time numbered as s 4 on january 6 1937 it was reported back to senate on 16th by adams with an amendment containing language usual to commemorative coin bills that federal government would not be responsible for expenses of preparing dies for coinage senate passed it without objection on january 19 1937 congressional record vol 83 p 298 january 19 1937 bill was transmitted to house where it was referred to committee on coinage weights and measures that committee on may 26 reported bill back recommending that it pass after being amended including increasing authorized mintage from 20 000 to 25 000 report drew attention to unfortunate error of previous year and that in making this favorable report it is merely helping to correct this oversight house passed amended bill on june 21 without discussion or dissent 1937 congressional record vol 83 p 6060 june 21 1937 as two houses had not passed same version bill returned to senate where on june 22 on glass s motion that body agreed to house s amendments 1937 congressional record vol 83 p 6116 june 22 1937 roosevelt signed bill authorizing 25 000 half dollars on 28th preparation expecting a coin to be authorized rather than a medal norfolk advertising board hired husband and wife william marks simpson and marjory emory simpson to design half dollar and on september 26 1936 william simpson submitted prints of his design to commission of fine arts fine arts commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by president warren g harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks including coins designs were referred to sculptor member of commission lee lawrie in general lawrie was enthusiastic but had some suggestions one was to shorten mace which almost touched letter o in on original models he also advised that further attention should be given to lettering commission chairman charles moore wrote to william simpson on september 29 informing him of this and adding his own congratulations on design no formal approval was given at that time as coin had not been authorized after coin bill passed congress in june 1937 simpsons modified design slightly with tip of mace now between words and and minor changes being made to obverse photographs of revised models were sent to fine arts commission on august 10 1937 designs were approved on august 14 design obverse depicts city seal of norfolk a sailing ship is shown sailing on stylized waves below is a plow and three sheaves of wheat underneath that is latin word translated as may you prosper above ship is meaning both land and sea are your riches inscriptions trace progress of norfolk from borough to city and include date 1936 as required by legislation though coin was not struck until 1937 reverse shows norfolk s mace with date of land grant 1636 divided by it and flanked by of dogwood that date is explained by words name of country denomination inscriptions required by law and designers initials in lower right are also on reverse there are five dates on coin none of which is year of minting 1937 q david bowers described obverse as most cluttered commemorative design ever produced art historian cornelius vermeule in his volume on u s commemorative coins and medals called norfolk piece a low point in commemorative design his view was not entirely negative saying that skill in spacing letters in casting surfaces and in modeling high relief saves much of composition still commemoration of norfolk s anniversaries is a document of epigraphy rather than figural art vermeule noted that coin had been designed by a married couple and that coin gives ample evidence that two heads need not be better than one production and distribution in september 1937 philadelphia mint struck 25 000 norfolk half dollars plus 13 extra that would be held for inspection and testing at 1938 meeting of annual assay commission they were placed on sale at 1 50 each with an initial limit of 20 per purchaser this limit was later dropped to allow bulk sales to dealers there was controversy over half dollar bearing british crown as part of mace some said crown had no place on an american coin and over fact that anniversary had passed in 1936 this turin addressed in advertisements stating that crown only appeared as part of historic mace and that city would have issued coin in 1936 but for mix up sales were slower than hoped and turin promoted coin through 1938 with mass mailings to coin collectors despite this 5 000 coins were returned to philadelphia mint for redemption and melting in 1938 and 3 077 more at a later date several thousand had been sold in bulk to dealers and wholesale quantities were available on coin market for years afterward norfolk half dollar sold at retail for about 1 50 in 1940 in uncirculated condition it thereafter increased in value selling for about 18 by 1955 and 170 by 1975 deluxe edition of
