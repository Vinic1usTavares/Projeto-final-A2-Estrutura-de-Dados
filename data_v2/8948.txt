termites are eusocial insects that are classified at taxonomic rank of infraorder isoptera or as epifamily termitoidae within cockroach order blattodea termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from cockroaches during jurassic or triassic however first termites possibly emerged during permian or even carboniferous about 3 106 species are currently described with a few hundred more left to be described although these insects are often called white ants they are not ants like ants and some bees and wasps from separate order hymenoptera termites divide labour among castes consisting of male and female workers and soldiers that are usually sterile all colonies have fertile males called kings and one or more fertile females called queens termites mostly feed on dead plant material and cellulose generally in form of wood leaf litter soil or animal dung termites are major detritivores particularly in subtropical and tropical regions and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance termites are among most successful groups of insects on earth colonising most landmasses except antarctica their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals termite queens have longest lifespan of any insect in world with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years unlike ants which undergo a complete metamorphosis each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg nymph and adult stages colonies are described as superorganisms because termites form part of a self regulating entity colony itself termites are a delicacy in diet of some human cultures and are used in many traditional medicines several hundred species are economically significant as pests that can cause serious damage to buildings crops or plantation forests some species such as west indian drywood termite cryptotermes brevis are regarded as invasive species etymology infraorder name isoptera is derived from greek words iso equal and ptera winged which refers to nearly equal size of fore and hind wings termite derives from latin and late latin word termes woodworm white ant altered by influence of latin to rub wear erode from earlier word termite nests were commonly known as or in earlier english termites were known as wood ants or white ants modern term was first used in 1781 taxonomy and evolution left thumb 200px alt giant northern termite is most primitive living termite its body plan has been described as a cockroach s abdomen stuck to a termite s fore part its wings have same form as roach wings and like roaches it lays its eggs in a case external appearance of giant northern termite mastotermes darwiniensis is suggestive of close relationship between termites and cockroaches termites were formerly placed in order isoptera as early as 1934 suggestions were made that they were closely related to wood eating cockroaches genus cryptocercus based on similarity of their symbiotic gut flagellates in 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when f a mckittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cryptocercus nymphs in 2008 dna analysis from 16s rrna sequences supported position of termites being nested within evolutionary tree containing order blattodea which included cockroaches cockroach genus cryptocercus shares strongest phylogenetical similarity with termites and is considered to be a sister group to termites termites and cryptocercus share similar morphological and social features for example most cockroaches do not exhibit social characteristics but cryptocercus takes care of its young and exhibits other social behaviour such as trophallaxis and allogrooming termites are thought to be descendants of genus cryptocercus some researchers have suggested a more conservative measure of retaining termites as termitoidae an epifamily within cockroach order which preserves classification of termites at family level and below termites have long been accepted to be closely related to cockroaches and mantids and they are classified in same superorder dictyoptera oldest unambiguous termite fossils date to early cretaceous but given diversity of cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects they likely originated earlier in jurassic or triassic further evidence of a jurassic origin is assumption that extinct consumed termites judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite eating mammals oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from upper cretaceous in west texas where oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered claims that termites emerged earlier have faced controversy for example f m indicated that mastotermitidae termites may go back to late permian 251 million years ago and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to wings of mastotermes of mastotermitidae most primitive living termite have been discovered in permian layers in kansas it is even possible that first termites emerged during carboniferous folded wings of fossil wood roach arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a resemble those seen in mastotermes only living insect with same pattern krishna et al though consider that all of paleozoic and triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from isoptera thumb macro image of a worker primitive giant northern termite mastotermes darwiniensis exhibits numerous cockroach like characteristics that are not shared with other termites such as laying its eggs in rafts and having anal lobes on wings it has been proposed that isoptera and be grouped in clade termites are sometimes called white ants but only resemblance to ants is due to their sociality which is due to convergent evolution with termites being first social insects to evolve a caste system more than 100 million years ago termite genomes are generally relatively large compared to that of other insects first fully sequenced termite genome of nevadensis which was published in journal nature communications consists of roughly while two subsequently published genomes macrotermes natalensis and cryptotermes secundus are considerably larger at around 1 as of 2013 about 3 106 living and fossil termite species are recognised classified in 12 families reproductive and or soldier castes are usually required for identification infraorder isoptera is divided into following clade and family groups showing subfamilies in their respective classification basal termite families epifamily termitoidae family family mastotermitidae parvorder family termopsidae family archotermopsidae family hodotermitidae family family neoisoptera neoisoptera literally meaning newer termites in an evolutionary sense are a recently coined that include families commonly referred to as higher termites although some authorities only apply this term to largest family termitidae latter characteristically do not have nymphs many lower termite worker nymphs have capacity to develop into reproductive castes see below cellulose digestion in higher termites has co evolved with eukaryotic gut microbiota and many genera have symbiotic relationships with fungi such as termitomyces in contrast lower termites typically have flagellates and prokaryotes in their five families are now

termite extinct flourished in austria during miocene and had a wingspan of and a body length of most worker and soldier termites are completely blind as they do not have a pair of eyes however some species such as hodotermes mossambicus have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight alates winged males and females have eyes along with lateral ocelli lateral ocelli however are not found in all termites absent in families hodotermitidae termopsidae and archotermopsidae like other insects termites have a small tongue shaped labrum and a clypeus clypeus is divided into a and termite antennae have a number of functions such as sensing of touch taste odours including pheromones heat and vibration three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape a pedicel typically shorter than scape and flagellum all segments beyond scape and pedicel mouth parts contain a maxillae a labium and a set of mandibles maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling consistent with all insects anatomy of termite thorax consists of three segments prothorax mesothorax and metathorax each segment contains a pair of legs on alates wings are located at mesothorax and metathorax mesothorax and metathorax have well developed exoskeletal plates prothorax has smaller plates thumbnail diagram showing a wing along with clypeus and leg termites have a ten segmented abdomen with two plates tergites and sternites tenth abdominal segment has a pair of short cerci there are ten tergites of which nine are wide and one is elongated reproductive organs are similar to those in cockroaches but are more simplified for example intromittent organ is not present in male alates and sperm is either or however mastotermitidae termites have sperm with limited motility genitals in females are also simplified unlike in other termites mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches non reproductive castes of termites are wingless and rely exclusively on their six legs for locomotion alates fly only for a brief amount of time so they also rely on their legs appearance of legs is similar in each caste but soldiers have larger and heavier legs structure of legs is consistent with other insects parts of a leg include a coxa trochanter femur tibia and tarsus number of tibial spurs on an individual s leg varies some species of termite have an arolium located between claws which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites unlike in ants hind wings and fore wings are of equal length most of time alates are poor flyers their technique is to launch themselves in air and fly in a random direction studies show that in comparison to larger termites smaller termites cannot fly long distances when a termite is in flight its wings remain at a right angle and when termite is at rest its wings remain parallel to body caste system thumbnail caste system of termites a king b queen c secondary queen d tertiary queen e soldiers f worker worker termites undertake most labour within colony being responsible for foraging food storage and brood and nest maintenance workers are tasked with digestion of cellulose in food and are thus most likely caste to be found in infested wood process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components it frees parents from feeding all but first generation of offspring allowing for group to grow much larger and ensuring that necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another some termite species may rely on nymphs to perform work without differentiating as a separate caste workers may be male or female and are usually sterile especially in termites that have a nest site that is separate from their foraging site sterile workers are sometimes termed as true workers while those that are fertile as in wood nesting termopsidae are termed as false workers soldier caste has anatomical and behavioural specialisations and their sole purpose is to defend colony many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged they cannot feed themselves instead like juveniles they are fed by workers simple holes in forehead that exude defensive secretions are a feature of family rhinotermitidae many species are readily identified using characteristics of soldiers larger and darker head and large mandibles among certain termites soldiers may use their globular heads to block their narrow tunnels different sorts of soldiers include minor and major soldiers and nasutes which have a horn like nozzle frontal projection a these unique soldiers are able to spray noxious sticky secretions containing at their enemies nitrogen fixation plays an important role in nasute nutrition soldiers are usually sterile but some species of termopsidae are known to have neotenic forms with soldier like heads while also sexual organs reproductive caste of a mature colony includes a fertile female and male known as queen and king queen of colony is responsible for egg production for colony unlike in ants king mates with her for life in some species abdomen of queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity a characteristic known as depending on species queen starts producing reproductive winged alates at a certain time of year and huge swarms emerge from colony when nuptial flight begins these swarms attract a wide variety of predators life cycle thumbnail alt a termite nymph looks like a smaller version of an adult but lacks specialisations that would enable identification of its caste a young termite nymph nymphs first moult into workers but others may further moult to become soldiers or alates termites are often compared with social hymenoptera ants and various species of bees and wasps but their differing evolutionary origins result in major differences in life cycle in eusocial hymenoptera workers are exclusively female males drones are haploid and develop from unfertilised eggs while females both workers and queen are diploid and develop from fertilised eggs in contrast worker termites which constitute majority in a colony are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs depending on species male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony life cycle of a termite begins with an egg but is different from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis with egg nymph and adult stages nymphs resemble small adults and go through a series of moults as they grow in some species eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three nymphs first moult into workers and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs development of nymphs into adults can take months time period depends on food availability temperature and general population of colony since nymphs are unable to feed themselves workers must feed them but workers also take part in social life of colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging building or maintaining nest or tending to queen pheromones regulate caste system in termite colonies preventing all but a very few of termites from becoming fertile queens queens of eusocial termite reticulitermes speratus are capable of a long lifespan without sacrificing fecundity these long lived queens have a significantly lower level of oxidative damage including oxidative dna damage than workers soldiers and nymphs lower levels of damage appear to be due to increased catalase an enzyme that protects against oxidative stress reproduction thumbnail alt hundreds of winged termite reproductives swarming after a summer rain filling field of photograph

place for a colony a termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot when they do they excavate a chamber big enough for both close up entrance and proceed to mate after mating pair never go outside and spend rest of their lives in nest nuptial flight time varies in each species for example alates in certain species emerge during day in summer while others emerge during winter nuptial flight may also begin at dusk when alates swarm around areas with lots of lights time when nuptial flight begins depends on environmental conditions time of day moisture wind speed and precipitation number of termites in a colony also varies with larger species typically having 100 1 000 individuals however some termite colonies including those with large individuals can number in millions queen only lays 10 20 eggs in very early stages of colony but lays as many as 1 000 a day when colony is several years old at maturity a primary queen has a great capacity to lay eggs in some species mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40 000 eggs a day two mature ovaries may have some 2 000 ovarioles each abdomen increases queen s body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely attendant workers provide assistance thumb alt in this movie workers pick eggs from egg pile groom them and then return them into egg pile they coat eggs with their saliva to protect them against drying out and to protect them against infection saliva contains which has antibacterial properties also acts as an egg recognition pheromone egg grooming behaviour of reticulitermes speratus workers in a nursery king grows only slightly larger after initial mating and continues to mate with queen for life a termite queen can live between 30 to 50 years this is very different from ant colonies in which a queen mates once with male s and stores gametes for life as male ants die shortly after mating if a queen is absent a termite king produces pheromones which encourage development of replacement termite queens as queen and king are monogamous sperm competition does not occur termites going through incomplete metamorphosis on path to becoming alates form a in certain species of termite functioning as potential supplementary reproductives these supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon death of a king or queen or when primary reproductives are separated from colony have ability to replace a dead primary reproductive and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony some queens have ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction studies show that while termite queens mate with king to produce colony workers queens reproduce their replacements neotenic queens parthenogenetically neotropical termite and several other related species produce colonies that contain a primary king accompanied by a primary queen or by up to 200 neotenic queens that had originated through thelytokous parthenogenesis of a founding primary queen form of parthenogenesis likely employed maintains heterozygosity in passage of genome from mother to daughter thus avoiding inbreeding depression behaviour and ecology diet right thumb alt a dense pile of termite faecal pellets about 10 centimeters by 20 centimeters by several centimeters in height which have accumulated on a wooden shelf from termite activity somewhere above frame of this photograph termite faecal pellets termites are detritivores consuming dead plants at any level of decomposition they also play a vital role in ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood faeces and plants many species eat cellulose having a specialised midgut that breaks down fibre termites are considered to be a major source 11 of atmospheric methane one of prime greenhouse gases produced from breakdown of cellulose termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa and other microbes such as protists in their guts to digest cellulose for them allowing them to absorb end products for their own use gut protozoa such as in turn rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of necessary digestive enzymes most higher termites especially in family termitidae can produce their own cellulase enzymes but they rely primarily upon bacteria flagellates have been lost in termitidae scientists understanding of relationship between termite digestive tract and microbial is still rudimentary what is true in all termite species however is that workers feed other members of colony with substances derived from digestion of plant material either from mouth or anus geetha iyer scroll in mar 09 2017 why indians worship mound of much hated termite soldier termites and reproductive castes obtain their nutrients from workers through oral or anal trophallaxis judging from closely related bacterial species it is strongly presumed that termites and cockroach s gut microbiota derives from their ancestors certain species such as tubiformans have seasonal food habits for example they may preferentially consume red three awn aristida during summer dactyloides from may to august and blue grama bouteloua gracilis during spring summer and autumn colonies of g tubiformans consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high various woods differ in their susceptibility to termite attack differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content hardness and resin and lignin content in one study drywood termite cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by termite colony these preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour some species of termite practice they maintain a garden of specialised fungi of genus termitomyces which are nourished by excrement of insects when fungi are eaten their spores pass undamaged through intestines of termites to complete cycle by germinating in fresh faecal pellets molecular evidence suggests that family macrotermitinae developed agriculture about 31 million years ago it is assumed that more than 90 percent of dry wood in semiarid savannah ecosystems of africa and asia are reprocessed by these termites originally living in rainforest fungus farming allowed them to colonise african savannah and other new environments eventually expanding into asia depending on their feeding habits termites are placed into two groups lower termites and higher termites lower termites predominately feed on wood as wood is difficult to digest termites prefer to consume fungus infected wood because it is easier to digest and fungi are high in protein meanwhile higher termites consume a wide variety of materials including faeces humus grass leaves and roots gut in lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa while higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa predators thumbnail crab spider with a captured alate termites are consumed by a wide variety of predators one termite species alone hodotermes mossambicus was found in stomach contents of 65 birds and 19 mammals arthropods such as ants centipedes cockroaches crickets dragonflies scorpions and spiders reptiles such as lizards and amphibians such as frogs and toads consume termites with two spiders in family being specialist termite predators other predators include aardvarks anteaters bats bears bilbies many birds echidnas foxes galagos numbats mice and pangolins aardwolf is an insectivorous mammal that primarily feeds on termites it locates its food by sound and also by detecting scent secreted by soldiers a single aardwolf is capable of consuming thousands of termites in a single night by using its long sticky tongue sloth bears break open mounds to consume nestmates while chimpanzees have developed tools to fish termites from their nest wear pattern analysis of bone tools used by early robustus suggests that they used these tools to dig into termite mounds thumbnail left a matabele ant megaponera analis kills a macrotermes bellicosus termite soldier during a raid among all predators ants are greatest enemy to termites some ant genera are specialist predators of termites for example megaponera is a strictly termite eating genus that perform raiding activities some lasting several hours is another termite raiding species with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home all while recruiting additional nestmates to raiding site through chemical trails malaysian ants uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies once inside ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites a scout recruits 10 30 workers to an area where termites are present killing them by immobilising them with their stinger and iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds and so termites are preyed on by these ants no evidence for any kind of relationship other than a predatory one is known other ants including camponotus crematogaster leptogenys rhytidoponera and also prey on termites in contrast to all these ant species and despite their enormous diversity of prey ants rarely consume termites ants are not only invertebrates that perform raids many wasps and several species including lepeletier and araujo are known to raid termite mounds during termites nuptial flight parasites pathogens and viruses termites are less likely to be attacked by parasites than bees wasps and ants as they are usually well protected in their mounds nevertheless termites are infected by a variety of parasites some of these include dipteran flies mites and a large number of nematode parasites most nematode parasites are in order rhabditida others are in genus mermis and under imminent threat of an attack by parasites a colony may migrate to a new location fungal pathogens such as aspergillus nomius and metarhizium anisopliae are however major threats to a termite colony as they are not host specific and may infect large portions of colony transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact m anisopliae is known to weaken termite immune system infection with a nomius only occurs when a colony is under great stress termites are infected by viruses including and nuclear virus locomotion and foraging because worker and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly and reproductives use their wings for just a brief amount of time termites predominantly rely upon their legs to move about foraging behaviour depends on type of termite for example certain species feed on wood structures they inhabit and others harvest food that is near nest most workers are rarely found out in open and do not forage unprotected they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a pheromone that attracts workers foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands in one species nasutitermes there are three phases in a foraging expedition first soldiers scout an area when they find a food source they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge in second phase workers appear in large numbers at site third phase is marked by a decrease in number of soldiers present and an increase in number of workers isolated termite workers may engage in levy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food competition competition between two colonies always results in agonistic behaviour towards each other resulting in fights these fights can cause mortality on both sides and in some cases gain or loss of territory cemetery pits may be present where bodies of dead termites are buried studies show that when termites encounter each other in foraging areas some of termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to isolation of area and thus need to construct new tunnels conflict between two competitors does not always occur for example though they might block each other s passages colonies of macrotermes bellicosus and macrotermes are not always aggressive towards each other suicide cramming is known in coptotermes formosanus since c formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die successfully blocking tunnel and ending all agonistic activities among reproductive caste neotenic queens may compete with each other to become dominant queen when there are no primary reproductives this struggle among queens leads to elimination of all but a single queen which with king takes over colony ants and termites may compete with each other for nesting space in particular ants that prey on termites usually have a negative impact on arboreal nesting species communication thumbnail hordes of nasutitermes on a march for food following and leaving trail pheromones most termites are blind so communication primarily occurs through chemical mechanical and pheromonal cues these methods of communication are used in a variety of activities including foraging locating reproductives construction of nests recognition of nestmates nuptial flight locating and fighting enemies and defending nests most common way of communicating is through antennation a number of pheromones are known including contact pheromones which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming and alarm trail and sex pheromones alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from frontal gland trail pheromones are secreted from sternal gland and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources sternal and tergal glands when termites go out to look for food they forage in columns along ground through vegetation a trail can be identified by faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects workers leave pheromones on these trails which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors termites can also communicate through mechanical cues vibrations and physical contact these signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source when termites construct their nests they use predominantly indirect communication no single termite would be in charge of any particular construction project individual termites react rather than think but at a group level they exhibit a sort of collective cognition specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building termite adds these objects onto existing structures and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers result is a self organised process whereby information that directs termite activity results from changes in environment rather than from direct contact among individuals termites can distinguish nestmates and non nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons released from cuticle allow recognition of alien termite species each colony has its own distinct odour this odour is a result of genetic and environmental factors such as termites diet and composition of bacteria within termites intestines defence thumbnail 180px alt to demonstrate termite repair behaviour a hole was bored into a termite nest over a dozen worker termites with pale heads are visible in this close up photo most facing camera as they engage in repair activities from inside of hole about a dozen soldier termites with orange heads are also visible some facing outwards from hole others patrolling surrounding area termites rush to a damaged area of nest termites rely on alarm communication to defend a colony alarm pheromones can be released when nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens termites always avoid nestmates infected with metarhizium anisopliae spores through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones in some species some soldiers block tunnels to prevent their enemies from entering nest and they may deliberately rupture themselves as an act of defence in cases where intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than soldier s head soldiers form a phalanx like formation around breach and bite at intruders if an invasion carried out by megaponera analis is successful an entire colony may be destroyed although this scenario is rare to termites any breach of their tunnels or nests is a cause for alarm when termites detect a potential breach soldiers usually bang their heads apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach additionally an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to disturbed area which is also a way to recruit extra workers thumbnail left nasute termite soldiers on rotten wood pantropical subfamily nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers known as nasutes that have ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn like frontal projection that they use for defence nasutes have lost their mandibles through course of evolution and must be fed by workers a wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in liquids that nasutes secrete similarly formosan subterranean termites have been known to secrete naphthalene to protect their nests soldiers of species commit suicide by autothysis rupturing a large gland just beneath surface of their cuticles thick yellow fluid in gland becomes very sticky on contact with air entangling ants or other insects that are trying to invade nest another termite also engages in suicidal defence workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals then deliberately rupture themselves releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies soldiers of neotropical termite family serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis with body rupturing between head and abdomen when soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders they engage in autothysis creating a block that denies entry to any attacker workers use several different strategies to deal with their dead including burying cannibalism and avoiding a corpse altogether to avoid pathogens termites occasionally engage in in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from colony to dispose of it elsewhere which strategy is used depends on nature of corpse a worker is dealing with i e age of carcass relationship with other organisms thumbnail 180px alt western underground orchid lives completely underground it is unable to photosynthesize and it is dependent on underground insects such as termites for pollination flower head shown is only about 1 5 centimetres across dozens of tiny rose coloured florets are arranged in a tight cluster surrounded by petals that give flower appearance of a pale miniature tulip rhizanthella gardneri is only orchid known to be pollinated by termites a species of fungus is known to mimic termite eggs successfully avoiding its natural predators these small brown balls known as termite balls rarely kill eggs and in some cases workers tend to them this fungus mimics these eggs by producing a cellulose digesting enzyme known as a unique mimicking behaviour exists between various species of beetles and certain termite species within reticulitermes beetles share same cuticle hydrocarbons as termites and even them this chemical mimicry allows beetles to integrate themselves within termite colonies developed appendages on abdomen of allows beetle to mimic a termite worker some species of ant are known to capture termites to use as a fresh food source later on rather than killing them for example formica nigra captures termites and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground certain species of ants in subfamily ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal eggs or nymphs ants such as megaponera analis attack outside of mounds and dorylinae ants attack underground despite this some termites and ants can coexist peacefully some species of termite including nasutitermes form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species earliest known association between azteca ants and nasutitermes termites date back to oligocene to miocene period thumbnail left an ant raiding party collecting militaris termites after a successful raid 54 species of ants are known to inhabit nasutitermes mounds both occupied and abandoned ones one reason many ants live in nasutitermes mounds is due to termites frequent occurrence in their geographical range another is to protect themselves from floods iridomyrmex also inhabits termite mounds although no evidence for any kind of relationship other than a predatory one is known in rare cases certain species of termites live inside active ant colonies some invertebrate organisms such as beetles caterpillars flies and millipedes are and dwell inside termite colonies they are unable to survive independently as a result certain beetles and flies have evolved with their hosts they have developed a gland that secrete a substance that attracts workers by licking them mounds may also provide shelter and warmth to birds lizards snakes and scorpions termites are known to carry pollen and regularly visit flowers so are regarded as potential pollinators for a number of flowering plants one flower in particular rhizanthella gardneri is regularly pollinated by foraging workers and it is perhaps only orchidaceae flower in world to be pollinated by termites many plants have developed effective defences against termites however seedlings are vulnerable to termite attacks and need additional protection as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed seedling stage defence is typically achieved by secreting chemicals into woody cell walls this reduces ability of termites to efficiently digest cellulose a commercial product has been developed in australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings an extract of a species of australian has been shown to repel termites tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by toxic material to extent that they will starve rather than consume food when kept close to extract they become disoriented and eventually die relationship with environment termite populations can be substantially impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention a brazilian study investigated termite assemblages of three sites of under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in semi arid region of northeastern brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects a total of 26 species of termites were present in three sites and 196 encounters were recorded in transects termite assemblages were considerably different among sites with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance related to reduction of tree density and soil cover and with intensity of trampling by cattle and goats wood feeders were most severely affected feeding group

ground an arboreal termite nest in mexico thumb termite nest in a banksia palm beach sydney a termite nest can be considered as being composed of two parts inanimate and animate animate is all of termites living inside colony and inanimate part is structure itself which is constructed by termites nests can be broadly separated into three main categories subterranean completely below ground epigeal protruding above soil surface and arboreal built above ground but always connected to ground via shelter tubes epigeal nests mounds protrude from earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud a nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs stumps and dead parts of trees as did termites millions of years ago to build their nests termites primarily use faeces which have many desirable properties as a construction material other building materials include partly digested plant material used in carton nests arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood and soil used in subterranean nest and mound construction not all nests are visible as many nests in tropical forests are located underground species in subfamily apicotermitinae are good examples of subterranean nest builders as they only dwell inside tunnels other termites live in wood and tunnels are constructed as they feed on wood nests and mounds protect termites soft bodies against desiccation light pathogens and parasites as well as providing a fortification against predators nests made out of carton are particularly weak and so inhabitants use counter attack strategies against invading predators arboreal carton nests of mangrove swamp dwelling nasutitermes are enriched in lignin and depleted in cellulose and this change is caused by bacterial decay in gut of termites they use their faeces as a carton building material arboreal termites nests can account for as much as 2 of above ground carbon storage in puerto rican mangrove swamps these nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially wood material from stems and branches of mangrove trees namely rhizophora mangle red mangrove avicennia germinans black mangrove and laguncularia racemose white mangrove some species build complex nests called polycalic nests this habitat is called polycalic species of termites form multiple nests or connected by subterranean chambers termite genera and are known to have polycalic species polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of nasutitermes mounds nests are considered mounds if they protrude from earth s surface a mound provides termites same protection as a nest but is stronger mounds located in areas with torrential and continuous rainfall are at risk of mound erosion due to their clay rich construction those made from carton can provide protection from rain and in fact can withstand high precipitation certain areas in mounds are used as strong points in case of a breach for example colonies build narrow tunnels used as strong points as diameter of tunnels is small enough for soldiers to block a highly protected chamber known as queens cell houses queen and king and is used as a last line of defence species in genus macrotermes arguably build most complex structures in insect world constructing enormous mounds these mounds are among largest in world reaching a height of 8 to 9 metres 26 to 29 feet and consist of chimneys pinnacles and ridges another termite species amitermes meridionalis can build nests 3 to 4 metres 9 to 13 feet high and 2 5 metres 8 feet wide tallest mound ever recorded was 12 8 metres 42 ft long found in democratic republic of congo sculptured mounds sometimes have elaborate and distinctive forms such as those of compass termite amitermes meridionalis and a laurensis which builds tall wedge shaped mounds with long axis oriented approximately north south which gives them their common name this orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation north south orientation causes internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during morning while avoiding overheating from midday sun temperature then remains at a plateau for rest of day until evening shelter tubes thumb upright alt photo taken upwards from ground level of shelter tubes going up shaded side of a tree where main trunk of tree divides into separate major branches shelter tube also branches although nests are not visible in this photo branches of shelter tube presumably lead up to polycalic sister colonies of arboreal termites that built these tubes shelter tubes on a tree trunk provide cover for trail from nest to forest floor termites construct shelter tubes also known as earthen tubes or mud tubes that start from ground these shelter tubes can be found on walls and other structures constructed by termites during night a time of higher humidity these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators especially ants shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way these passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour size of these shelter tubes depends on number of food sources that are available they range from less than 1 cm to several cm in width but may be dozens of metres in length relationship with humans as pests thumb 200px left termite damage on external structure owing to their wood eating habits many termite species can do significant damage to unprotected buildings and other wooden structures termites play an important role as decomposers of wood and vegetative material and conflict with humans occurs where structures and landscapes containing structural wood components cellulose derived structural materials and ornamental vegetation provide termites with a reliable source of food and moisture their habit of remaining concealed often results in their presence being undetected until timbers are severely damaged with only a thin exterior layer of wood remaining which protects them from environment of 3 106 species known only 183 species cause damage 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures in north america 18 subterranean species are pests in australia 16 species have an economic impact in indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests and in tropical africa 24 in central america and west indies there are 17 pest species among termite genera coptotermes has highest number of pest species of any genus with 28 species known to cause damage less than 10 of drywood termites are pests but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical subtropical and other regions dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil drywood termites thrive in warm climates and human activities can enable them to invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods containers and ships colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions some termites are considered invasive species cryptotermes brevis most widely introduced invasive termite species in world has been introduced to all islands in west indies and to australia thumb right 200px termite damage in wooden house stumps in addition to causing damage to buildings termites can also damage food crops termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast growing plants most attacks occur at harvest time crops and trees are attacked during dry season damage caused by termites costs southwestern united states approximately 1 5 billion each year in wood structure damage but true cost of damage worldwide cannot be determined drywood termites are responsible for a large proportion of damage caused by termites goal of termite control is to keep structures and susceptible ornamental plants free from termites structures may be homes or business or elements such as wooden fence posts and telephone poles regular and thorough inspections by a trained professional may be necessary to detect termite activity in absence of more obvious signs like termite or alates inside or adjacent to a structure termite monitors made of wood or cellulose adjacent to a structure may also provide indication of termite foraging activity where it will be in conflict with humans termites can be controlled by application of bordeaux mixture or other substances that contain copper such as copper to better control population of termites various methods have been developed to track termite movements one early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin g igg marker proteins from rabbits or chickens termites collected from field could be tested for rabbit igg markers using a rabbit igg specific assay more recently developed less expensive alternatives include tracking termites using egg white cow milk or soy milk proteins which can be sprayed on termites in field termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein specific elisa test as food thumb mozambican boys from tribe collecting flying termites thumb these flying alates were collected as they came out of their nests in ground during early days of rainy season 43 termite species are used as food by humans or are fed to livestock these insects are particularly important in impoverished countries where malnutrition is common as protein from termites can help improve human diet termites are consumed in many regions globally but this practice has only become popular in developed nations in recent years termites are consumed by people in many different cultures around world in many parts of africa alates are an important factor in diets of native populations groups have different ways of collecting or cultivating insects sometimes collecting soldiers from several species though harder to acquire queens are regarded as a delicacy termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein they are regarded as pleasant in taste having a nut like flavour after they are cooked alates are collected when rainy season begins during a nuptial flight they are typically seen around lights to which they are attracted and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited in addition to africa termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in asia and north and south america in australia indigenous australians are aware that termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity there are few explanations as to why termite mounds are main sources of soil consumption in many countries including kenya tanzania zambia zimbabwe and south africa researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture as they are high in protein and can be used to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans in agriculture thumb left scientists have developed a more affordable method of tracing movement of termites using traceable proteins termites can be major agricultural pests particularly in east africa and north asia where crop losses can be severe 3 100 in crop loss in africa counterbalancing this is greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation in south america cultivated plants such as eucalyptus upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations with attacks on leaves roots and woody tissue termites can also attack other plants including cassava coffee cotton fruit trees maize peanuts soybeans and vegetables mounds can disrupt farming activities making it difficult for farmers to operate farming machinery however despite farmers dislike of mounds it is often case that no net loss of production occurs termites can be beneficial to agriculture such as by boosting crop yields and enriching soil termites and ants can re colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into ground and increases amount of nitrogen in soil both essential for growth of crops in science and technology termite gut has inspired various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner renewable energy sources termites are efficient bioreactors capable of producing two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper approximately 200 species of microbes live inside termite hindgut releasing hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest through action of unidentified enzymes in termite gut polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen bacteria within gut turns sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy community dna sequencing of microbes in termite hindgut has been employed to provide a better understanding of metabolic pathway genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass development of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has been inspired by complex mounds that termites build these robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid capable of climbing and lifting up bricks such robots may be useful for future projects on mars or for building levees to prevent flooding termites use sophisticated means to control temperatures of their mounds as discussed above shape and orientation of mounds of australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during day as towers heat up solar chimney effect stack effect creates an updraft of air within mound wind blowing across tops of towers enhances circulation of air through mounds which also include side vents in their construction solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in middle east and near east for passive cooling as well as in europe by romans it is only relatively recently however that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture especially in africa stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings in culture thumb right 250px pink hued eastgate centre eastgate centre is a shopping centre and office block in central harare zimbabwe whose architect mick pearce used passive cooling inspired by that used by local termites it was first major building exploiting termite inspired cooling techniques to attract international attention other such buildings include learning resource center at catholic university of eastern africa and council house 2 building in melbourne australia few zoos hold termites due to difficulty in keeping them captive and to reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests one of few that do zoo basel in switzerland has two thriving macrotermes bellicosus populations resulting in an event very rare in captivity mass migrations of young flying termites this happened in september 2008 when thousands of male termites left their mound each night died and covered floors and water pits of house holding their exhibit african tribes in several countries have termites as totems and for this reason tribe members are forbidden to eat reproductive alates termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma bronchitis hoarseness influenza sinusitis tonsillitis and whooping cough in nigeria macrotermes is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women in southeast asia termites are used in ritual practices in malaysia singapore and thailand termite mounds are commonly worshiped among populace abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits believing a local guardian dwells within mound this is known as and kong in urban areas local residents construct red painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned where they pray for good health protection and luck see also termite shield notes references
