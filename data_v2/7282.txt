schlumbergera is a small genus of cacti with six to nine species found in coastal mountains of south eastern brazil plants grow on trees or rocks in habitats that are generally shady with high humidity and can be quite different in appearance from their desert dwelling cousins most species of schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf like pads joined one to other and flowers which appear from areoles at joints and tips of stems two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti recent phylogenetic studies using dna have led to three species of related genus hatiora being transferred into schlumbergera though this change is not universally accepted common names for these cacti generally refer to their flowering season in northern hemisphere they are called christmas cactus thanksgiving cactus crab cactus and holiday cactus in brazil genus is referred to as may flower reflecting period in which they flower in southern hemisphere most of popular houseplants are cultivars of schlumbergera rather than species with flowers in white pink yellow orange red or purple easter cactus or whitsun cactus until recently placed in genus hatiora is also called a holiday cactus and has flowers in red orange pink and white cultivars of christmas cactus fall into two main groups truncata group contains all cultivars with features derived mainly from species s truncata stem segments with pointed teeth flowers held more or less horizontally usually above horizontal whose upper side is differently shaped from lower side zygomorphic and pollen which is yellow they generally flower earlier than members of buckleyi group and although common names are not applied consistently may be distinguished as thanksgiving cactus crab cactus or claw cactus buckleyi group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from s russelliana stem segments with rounded more symmetrical teeth more or less symmetrical regular flowers which hang down below horizontal and pollen which is pink they generally flower later than members of truncata group and are more likely to be called christmas cactus description thumb zygomorphic flower probably of a cultivar in s truncata group cut in half to show its internal structure alt flower cut in half vertically with base to left bases of tepals form a kind of tube upper parts bending away from tube stamens run full length of flower from left to right and emerge from end some start at very base of flower others start from further along to right being joined to a tepal in wild species of schlumbergera grow either on trees epiphytic or on rocks epilithic and can form sizeable shrubs with woody bases a height of up to has been reported for one species s opuntioides they are leafless green stems acting as photosynthetic organs stems are composed of segments which take one of two forms in most species segments are strongly flattened cladodes being made up of a central core with two or more rarely three wings special structures characteristic of cacti called areoles then occur at ends of segments of stem in two species stems are less flattened more cylinder shaped and areoles are arranged in a more or less spiral pattern all over segments in both cases areoles which may have wool and bristles are where flower buds appear particularly pp 18 19 flowers either hang downwards and are almost regular radially symmetrical or actinomorphic or as in most species are held more or less horizontally with higher side of flower different from lower side radially asymmetrical or zygomorphic in those species whose flowers are held up their angle with horizontal is relatively constant and is characteristic of species each flower has 20 30 tepals outer tepals those closer to base of flower are short and unconnected and spread out or curve backwards inner tepals those towards tip of flower are longer and in most species become progressively more fused together at base to form a floral tube in some species difference between outer and inner tepals creates appearance of a flower within a flower flowers produce nectar in a chamber at base of floral tube in most species many stamens are arranged in two series with inner stamens being fused at base to form a short tubular structure and outer stamens arising from along floral tube style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6 8 lobes style plus stigma is roughly same length as stamens if flower is fertilized a fleshy fruit forms either smooth or with ribs brown or black seeds are about 1 mm in diameter taxonomy thumb drawing of s russelliana type species from botanical magazine 1839 alt drawing is probably of a pressed specimen as it appears flat base is at bottom and plant then branches repeatedly about six times in longest branch most branches end in either buds or regular flowers which are pinkish genus is one of a small number belonging to a group of cacti classified as tribe rhipsalideae species of cacti belonging to this group are quite distinct in appearance and habit from most other cacti since they grow on trees or rocks as epiphytes or although species are easy to identify as members of rhipsalideae for many years there was confusion as to how they should be divided into genera this confusion extended to schlumbergera whose complicated taxonomic history has been detailed by mcmillan and horobin modern genus schlumbergera was created by charles lemaire in 1858 name commemorates frederic schlumberger who had a collection of cacti at his chateau near rouen lemaire placed only one species in his new genus a plant discovered in brazil in 1837 which had been named epiphyllum russellianum by william j hooker lemaire renamed it schlumbergera epiphylloides under current rules of botanical nomenclature it should have been called schlumbergera russelliana which is its current name lemaire noted similarity of his schlumbergera epiphylloides to a species first described as epiphyllum truncatum by adrian hardy haworth in 1819 but did not accept that two species should be included in same genus in 1890 karl moritz schumann created new genus zygocactus transferring epiphyllum truncatum to zygocactus truncatus although he later placed it back in epiphyllum abandoning zygocactus generic name zygocactus continued to be widely used in 1913 nathaniel britton and joseph rose followed lemaire in keeping schlumbergera russelliana and zygocactus truncatus in separate genera they also transferred easter cactus to schlumbergera as s gaertneri initiating a lasting confusion between these two genera in 1953 reid venable moran placed both schlumbergera russelliana and zygocactus truncatus in genus schlumbergera other species were added later by david hunt including those formerly placed in epiphyllanthus to form modern total of six full species and a number of hybrids schlumbergera and hatiora have long been confused species in former genus generally have flowers that are zygomorphic with a distinct floral tube while those in latter have actinomorphic flowers with inconspicuous tubes dna data shows that as previously circumscribed two genera are not monophyletic and three species in hatiora subgenus rhipsalidopsis have been transferred into schlumbergera although this change has not been universally adopted synonymy following genera are now synonyms of schlumbergera i e they have no species not moved into schlumbergera epiphyllanthus a berger nom zygocactus k schum kreuz orth var epiphyllum pfeiff but not epiphyllum haw case of epiphyllum is complex in 1753 carl linnaeus created genus cactus as more species were discovered this proved too broad and new genera were set up to subdivide cacti genus epiphyllum was created in 1812 by haworth based on linnaeus s cactus in 1831 johann link created genus phyllocactus based on same species following ludwig pfeiffer in 1837 european tradition was to use phyllocactus for epiphytic cacti with large regular flowers and epiphyllum for irregular flowered species now called schlumbergera truncata under modern rules phyllocactus is an illegitimate name as is epiphyllum in sense of pfeiffer thus epiphyllum pfeiff is a synonym of schlumbergera true genus epiphyllum haw now has around 19 species species between six and nine species are currently recognized in narrowest

roughly south west to north east along part of this coastline is coloured red red strip is about five times as long as wide and extends either side of rio de janeiro schlumbergera occurs only in coastal mountains of south east brazil in states of sao paulo rio de janeiro minas gerais and espirito santo sites where it has been found range from close to tropic of capricorn northwards to i e in southernmost part of tropics plants grow at altitudes from in case of s truncata to in case of s microsphaerica either in coastal moist forests or in rocky areas natural distribution of schlumbergera species has become confused because european cultivars were deliberately introduced into some areas including serra dos national park by brazilian agricultural department to compensate for over collecting of wild plants because of their height and proximity to atlantic ocean coastal mountains produce high altitude moist forests warm moist air is forced upwards into higher colder locations where it condenses schlumbergera species grow in habitats which are generally relatively cool shaded and of high humidity david hunt describes collecting specimens in conditions of cloud drizzle and overnight temperatures down to plants are epiphytic or lithophytic growing on moss covered tree branches or in rock crevices often in small pockets of substrate formed from decayed leaves and other vegetation s microsphaerica is found at higher altitudes above in barren rocky habitats and tolerates higher light levels flowers of schlumbergera have adaptations for pollination by hummingbirds tubular flowers with abundant nectar and colours towards red end of spectrum most species require cross pollination to set seed exceptions are s kautskyi and s microsphaerica as noted above latter is found at higher altitudes where hummingbirds may be absent or less common fruits of schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe and appear to be adapted for distribution by birds which eat seeds and pulp contained in fruit birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on tree branches where seeds might be able to germinate segments may also break off from stems and take root thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively cultivation of christmas cacti history thumb s truncata group gold charm note very pointed teeth at end of segments zygomorphic

by 1818 and s russelliana was introduced in 1839 two species were deliberately crossed in england by w buckley resulting in hybrid now called s x buckleyi first recorded in 1852 by 1860s a substantial number of cultivars cultivated varieties were available in a range of colours and habits and were used as ornamental plants in stoves heated greenhouses and in houses where they were popular for their autumn and winter flowering many cultivars were selected seedlings of s truncata but at least three s x buckleyi hybrids were available of which one now called s buckleyi is thought to be original christmas cactus by early part of 20th century genus had become less popular and many of early cultivars were lost particularly pp 56 63 from around 1950s onwards breeding resumed in europe north america australia and new zealand new plants were produced by crossing among species and existing cultivars of s truncata s russelliana and hybrid s x buckleyi treatments which induced mutations were also used result was a wide range of flower colours which had not been available before including first true yellow to be sold commercially s gold charm which was a sterile triploid breeders aimed for plants which grew strongly were upright at point of sale rather than pendulous had many flowers or buds and were adapted to living as house plants in 1980s species s orssichiana was also used in crosses hybrid of s truncata and s orssichiana has been named s x reginae or s reginae group one of first cultivars was s bristol queen s opuntioides crosses have also been made but have not resulted in commercially available cultivars modern cultivars thumb member of s buckleyi group viewed from below rounded rather than pointed edges of segments pendant more or less regular flowers and pink pollen alt picture shows a flower from more or less below tepals radiate outwards from centre more or less symmetrically petals nearest viewer bend outwards less than those further away mcmillan and horobin have listed hundreds of modern european north american and australian cultivars of christmas cactus which they put into a number of cultivar groups truncata group contains all cultivars with mainly s truncata characteristics stem segments with pointed teeth dentate zygomorphic flowers held more or less horizontally usually above horizontal and pollen which is yellow buckleyi group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from s russelliana stem segments with rounded more symmetrical teeth crenate more regular flowers which hang down below horizontal and pollen which is pink there is considerable variation within this group mcmillan and horobin introduced subcategories tb for those more like s truncata and bt for those more like classic s x buckleyi with b reserved for first generation f1 s x buckleyi hybrids reginae group contains cultivars known to be derived from hybrids with s orssichiana exotica group is used for small number of hybrids involving s opuntioides attempts have also been made to classify cultivars by colour a difficulty is that flowers of many cultivars exhibit different colours depending on temperature during bud formation and growth in particular temperatures below produce pink tones in otherwise white and yellow cultivars and deepen colour in pink and red cultivars availability of iron to plant has also been suggested to affect flower colour in united states cultivars are propagated in large numbers for sale before thanksgiving day fourth thursday in november in europe plants are mainly sold later in year in period before christmas a single dutch grower de vries of netherlands was reported in 1989 as producing 2 000 000 plants per year common names plants are offered for sale under a variety of common names earliest english common name was christmas cactus in europe where plants are largely produced for sale in period before christmas this remains most widely used common name in many languages for cultivars of all groups e g in german in french and in spanish this is also name used in canada in united states where plants are produced for thanksgiving holiday in november name thanksgiving cactus is used christmas cactus may then be restricted to cultivars of buckleyi group particularly very old cultivars such as buckleyi name crab cactus referring to clawed ends of stems is also used for truncata group link cactus is another common name describing way that stems of genus as a whole are made up of linked segments name chain cactus is common in new zealand and may also refer to hatiora species easter cactus or whitsun cactus is now placed in genus hatiora but was at one time included in schlumbergera or one of its synonyms name holiday cactus has been used to include both schlumbergera and hatiora cultivars care of cultivars when grown as house plants schlumbergera cultivars are said to be relatively easy to care for mcmillan and horobin describe in detail their cultivation in both commercial and domestic conditions their specific recommendations include growing medium free draining humus rich somewhat acid growing media are used for commercial production such as a mixture of peat or and an inert material such as grit sharp sand or polystyrene beads it is recommended that plants should be grown in relatively small pots half height pots are suitable watering they are more tolerant of drought than many house plants but can be damaged by both under and over watering keeping growing medium just moist throughout year avoids either extreme light they can be damaged by exposure to more than small amounts of sunlight members of buckleyi group such as old fashioned christmas cactus with pendant flowers are more tolerant of high light levels than members of truncata group such as most of modern cultivars too much light causes stems to take on a reddish colouration however very low light levels will prevent flowering day length is important in controlling flowering continuous darkness for at least 12 hours is necessary to induce bud formation a period of about 8 days with 16 hours of darkness at has been shown to cause flower buds to form lower temperatures slow this process advice sometimes given to withhold water to produce flower buds has been shown to be incorrect propagation both commercially and in home propagation can be achieved by using short pieces of stem one to three segments long twisted off rather than cut cuttings are allowed to dry for 1 7 days forming a callus at broken end and then rooted in an open growing medium temperatures above and up to in long day short night conditions speed rooting pests and diseases in cultivation these plants have been described as remarkably free from pests and diseases two significant insect pests are aphids on young shoots buds and flowers and root mealybugs which attack below soil level stems and roots can be rotted by diseases caused by fungi and similar organisms these include infections by species of fusarium a fungus and phytophthora and both water moulds approved chemical treatments can be used in case of insect attack or these diseases aphids mealybugs and other invertebrate pests can spread viruses symptoms vary with species but a loss of vigour is usual cactus virus x has been isolated from s truncata there is no treatment for virus diseases it is recommended that infected plants be destroyed references bibliography external links schlumbergera growing information species cultivar varieties pictures and videos time lapse video of
