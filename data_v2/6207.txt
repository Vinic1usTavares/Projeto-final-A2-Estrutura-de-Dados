between 19th century austro german tradition and modernism of early 20th century while in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of europe during nazi era after 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners mahler then became one of most frequently performed and recorded of all composers a position he has sustained into 21st century in 2016 a bbc music magazine survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in top ten symphonies of all time born in bohemia then part of austrian empire to jewish parents of humble origins german speaking mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age after

opera hofoper during his ten years in vienna mahler who had converted to catholicism to secure post experienced regular opposition and hostility from anti semitic press nevertheless his innovative productions and insistence on highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of greatest of opera conductors particularly as an interpreter of stage works of wagner mozart and tchaikovsky

activity while he earned his living as a conductor aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in vienna mahler s works are generally designed for large orchestral forces symphonic choruses and operatic soloists these works were frequently controversial when first performed and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval

wagner composers with whom he would be particularly associated for rest of his career but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction and a falling out with his more experienced fellow conductor ludwig during his 12 months in prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas 12 titles were new in his repertory and he also performed beethoven s ninth for first time in his life by end of season in july 1886 mahler left prague to take up his post at neues stadttheater in leipzig where rivalry with his senior colleague arthur nikisch almost began at once this conflict was primarily over how two should share conducting duties for theatre s new production of wagner s ring cycle nikisch s illness from february to april 1887 meant that mahler took charge of whole cycle except gotterdammerung and scored a resounding public success this did not however win him popularity with orchestra who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules carr p 43 in leipzig mahler befriended captain carl von weber 1849 1897 grandson of composer and agreed to prepare a performing version of carl maria von weber s unfinished opera die drei pintos three

becomes a bride closely follows text of a wunderhorn poem melodies for second and fourth songs of cycle were incorporated into first symphony which mahler finished in 1888 at height of his relationship with marion von weber intensity of mahler s feelings is reflected in music which originally was written as a five movement symphonic poem with a descriptive programme one of these movements later discarded was based on a passage from his earlier work der trompeter von sackingen after completing symphony mahler composed a 20 minute symphonic poem funeral rites which later became first movement of his second symphony carr pp 48 49 there has been frequent speculation about lost or destroyed works from mahler s early years franklin 10 das klagende lied early songs first symphony

of early symphonic works had been held in dresden this archive if it existed was almost certainly destroyed in bombing of dresden in 1945 budapest and hamburg 1888 97 royal opera budapest on arriving in budapest in october 1888 mahler encountered a cultural conflict between conservative hungarian nationalists who favoured a policy of magyarisation and progressives who wanted to maintain and develop country s austro german cultural traditions in opera house a dominant conservative caucus led by music director sandor had maintained a limited repertory of historical and folklore opera by time that mahler began his duties progressive camp had gained ascendancy following appointment of liberal minded ferenc von beniczky as intendant franklin 5 budapest 1888 91 aware of delicate situation mahler moved cautiously he delayed his first appearance on conductor s stand until january 1889 when he conducted hungarian language performances of das rheingold and die walkure to initial public acclaim sadie pp 508 09 however his early successes faded when plans to stage remainder of ring cycle and other german operas were frustrated by a renascent conservative faction which favoured a more traditional hungarian programme in search of non german operas to extend repertory mahler visited in spring 1890 italy where among works he discovered was pietro mascagni s recent sensation

negative comments from his vienna conservatory contemporary viktor von herzfeld who had remarked that mahler like many conductors before him had proved not to be a composer carr pp 53 54 in 1891 hungary s move to political right was reflected in opera house when beniczky on 1 february was replaced as intendant by count geza zichy a conservative aristocrat determined to assume artistic control over mahler s head however mahler had foreseen that and had secretly been negotiating with bernhard pollini director of stadttheater hamburg since summer and autumn of 1890 and a contract was finally signed in secrecy on 15 january 1891 mahler more or less forced himself to be sacked from his budapest post and he succeeded on 14 march 1891 by his departure he received a large sum of indemnity carr

music writer peter franklin conductor inspired hatred and respect in almost equal measure he found support however from hans von bulow who was in hamburg as director of city s subscription concerts

that living with him was like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by waves carr p 108 alma soon became resentful because of mahler s insistence that there could only be one composer in family and that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him role of composer worker s role falls to me yours is that of a loving companion and understanding partner i m asking a very great deal and i can and may do so because i know what i have to give and will give in exchange she wrote in her diary how hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of things closest to one s heart carr pp 143 44 mahler s requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities imposed strains and precipitated rebellion on alma s part marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion particularly from mahler in summer of 1907 mahler exhausted from effects of campaign against him in vienna took his family to maiernigg soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria anna recovered but after a fortnight s struggle maria died on 12 july franklin 8 europe and new york 1907 11 immediately following this devastating loss mahler learned that his heart was defective a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a vienna specialist who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise extent to which mahler s condition disabled him is unclear alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence though mahler himself in a letter written to her on 30 august 1907 said that he would be able to live a normal life apart from avoiding over fatigue carr pp 152 54 illness was however a further depressing factor at end of summer villa at maiernigg was closed and never revisited blaukopf p 217 last years 1908

mahler s performances were widely praised especially his fidelio on 20 march 1908 in which he insisted on using replicas that were at time being made of alfred roller s vienna sets carr p 163 on his return to austria for summer of 1908 mahler established himself in third and last of his composing studios in pine forests close to toblach in tyrol here using a text by hans based on ancient chinese poems he composed das lied von der erde song of earth despite symphonic nature of work mahler refused to number it hoping thereby to escape curse of ninth symphony that he believed had affected fellow composers beethoven schubert and bruckner on 19 september 1908 premiere of seventh symphony in prague was deemed by alma mahler a critical rather than a popular success a mahler p 143 for its 1908 09 season metropolitan management brought in italian conductor arturo toscanini to share duties with mahler who made only 19 appearances in entire season one of these was a much praised performance of smetana s bartered bride on 19 february 1909 anon 1909 in early part of season mahler conducted three concerts with new york symphony orchestra anon 1908 this renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with opera house and accept conductorship of re formed new york philharmonic he continued to make occasional guest appearances at met his last performance being tchaikovsky s queen of spades on 5 march 1910 blaukopf pp 225 26 back in europe for summer of 1909 mahler worked on his ninth symphony and made a conducting tour of netherlands 1909 10 new york philharmonic season was long and taxing mahler rehearsed and conducted 46 concerts but his programmes were often too demanding for popular tastes his own first symphony given its american debut on 16 december 1909 was one of pieces that failed with critics and public and season ended with heavy financial losses carr pp 172 73 highlight of mahler s 1910 summer was first performance of eighth symphony at munich on 12 september last of his works to be premiered in his lifetime occasion was a triumph easily mahler s biggest lifetime success according to biographer robert p 207 but it was overshadowed by composer s discovery before event that alma had begun an affair with young architect walter gropius greatly distressed mahler sought advice from sigmund freud and appeared to gain some comfort from his meeting with psychoanalyst one of freud s observations was that much damage had been done by mahler s insisting that alma give up her composing mahler accepted this and started to positively encourage her to write music even editing orchestrating and promoting some of her works alma agreed to remain with mahler although relationship with gropius continued surreptitiously in a gesture of love mahler dedicated his eighth symphony to her illness and death thumb alt a tall stone column bearing words gustav mahler surrounded by a low green hedge with a floral bloom in

from a sore throat which persisted on 21 february 1911 with a temperature of 40 degc 104 degf mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at carnegie hall with a program of mainly new italian music including world premiere of busoni s berceuse this was mahler s last concert lebrecht p p 233 after weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone and could be fatal mahler did not give up hope he talked of resuming concert season and took a keen interest when one of alma s compositions was sung at a public recital by soprano frances alda on 3 march carr p 214 on 8 april mahler family and a permanent nurse left new york on board ss amerika bound for europe they reached paris ten days later where mahler entered a clinic at neuilly but there was no improvement on 11 may he was taken by train to low sanatorium in vienna where he developed pneumonia and entered a coma hundreds had come to sanitorium during this brief period to show their admiration for great composer after receiving treatments of radium to reduce swelling on his legs and morphine for his general ailments he died on 18 may on 22 may 1911 mahler was buried in grinzing cemetery de as he had requested next to his daughter maria his tombstone was inscribed only with his name because any who come to look for me will know

bruno walter alfred roller secessionist painter gustav and representatives from many of great european opera houses carr pp 2 3 new york times reporting mahler s death called him one of towering musical figures of his day but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration incidentally exaggerating length of second symphony to two hours and forty minutes anon 1911 in london times obituary said his conducting was more accomplished than that of any man save richter and that his symphonies were undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth mitchell vol ii pp 413 15 alma mahler survived her husband by more than 50 years dying in 1964 she married walter gropius in 1915 divorced him five years later and married writer franz werfel in 1929 steen pp 764 65 in 1940 she published a memoir of her years with mahler entitled gustav mahler

daughter anna mahler became a well known sculptor she died in 1988 mitchell mahler companion p 580 international gustav mahler society was founded in 1955 in vienna with bruno walter as its first president and alma mahler as an honorary member society aims to create a complete critical edition of mahler s works and to commemorate all aspects of composer s life music three creative periods thumb upright 1 3 alt three staves of printed music showing vocal line and piano accompaniment of first few bars opening of lieder eines fahrenden gesellen published 1897 in a version for voice and piano deryck cooke and other analysts have divided mahler s composing life into three distinct phases a long first period extending from das klagende lied in 1880 to end of wunderhorn phase in 1901 a middle period of more concentrated composition ending with mahler s departure for new york in 1907 and a brief late period of elegiac works before his death in 1911 cooke pp 27 71 103 main works of first period are first four symphonies lieder eines fahrenden gesellen song cycle and various song collections in which wunderhorn songs predominate in this period songs and symphonies are closely related and symphonic works are programmatic mahler initially gave first three symphonies full descriptive programmes all of which he later repudiated cooke p 34 he devised but did not publish titles for each of movements for fourth symphony from these titles german music critic paul conjectured a programme in which death appears in scherzo in friendly legendary guise of fiddler tempting his flock to follow him out of this world la grange vol 2 pp 757 59 middle period comprises a triptych of purely instrumental symphonies fifth sixth and seventh ruckert songs and kindertotenlieder two final wunderhorn settings and in some mahler s last great affirmative statement choral eighth symphony cooke believes that eighth stands on its own between middle and final periods cooke p 93 mahler had by now abandoned all explicit programmes and descriptive titles he wanted to write absolute music that spoke for itself la grange vol 2 p 805 cooke refers to a new granite like hardness of orchestration in middle period symphonies while songs have lost most of their folk character and cease to fertilise symphonies as explicitly as before mitchell vol ii p 32 three works of brief final period das lied von der erde ninth and incomplete tenth symphonies are expressions of personal experience as mahler faced death sadie pp 524 25 each of pieces ends quietly signifying that aspiration has now given way to resignation schonberg p 143 cooke considers these works to be a loving rather than a bitter farewell to life cooke p 103 composer alban berg called ninth most marvellous thing that mahler ever wrote none of these final works were performed in mahler s lifetime blaukopf p 240 antecedents and influences mahler was a late romantic part of an ideal that placed austro german classical music on a higher plane than other types through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance franklin 9 musical style he was one of last major composers of a line which includes among others beethoven schubert liszt wagner bruckner and brahms cooke pp 10 11 from these antecedents mahler drew many of features that were to characterise his music thus from beethoven s ninth symphony came idea of using soloists and a choir within symphonic genre from beethoven liszt and from a different musical tradition berlioz came concept of writing music with an inherent narrative or programme and of breaking away from traditional four movement symphony format examples of wagner and bruckner encouraged mahler to extend scale of his symphonic works well beyond previously accepted standards to embrace an entire world of feeling early critics maintained that mahler s adoption of many different styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own cooke on other hand asserts that mahler redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his own personality on practically every note to produce music of outstanding originality cooke pp 13 14 music critic harold schonberg sees essence of mahler s music in theme of struggle in tradition of beethoven however according to schonberg beethoven s struggles were those of an indomitable and triumphant hero whereas mahler s are those of a psychic weakling a complaining adolescent who enjoyed his misery wanting whole world to see how he was suffering schonberg p 138 yet schonberg concedes most of symphonies contain sections in which mahler deep thinker is transcended by splendour of mahler musician genre except for his juvenilia little of which has survived mahler composed only in media of song and symphony with a close and complex interrelationship between two donald mitchell writes that this interaction is against which all mahler s music can be considered mitchell vol ii p 47 initial connection between song and symphony occurs with song cycle lieder eines fahrenden gesellen and first symphony although this early evidence of cross fertilisation is important it is during mahler s extended wunderhorn phase in which his second third and fourth symphonies were written that song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled themes from wunderhorn song das leben heavenly life composed in 1892 became a key element in third symphony completed in 1896 song itself forms finale to fourth 1900 and its melody is central to whole composition mitchell vol ii p 309 for second symphony written between 1888 and 1894 mahler worked simultaneously on wunderhorn song des antonius von padua sermon of st anthony of padua to fishes and on scherzo based on it which became symphony s third movement la grange vol 2 p 743 another wunderhorn setting from 1892 primal light is used as second symphony s fourth penultimate movement mitchell vol ii p 136 in mahler s middle and late periods song symphony relationship is less direct however musicologist donald mitchell notes specific relationships between middle period songs and their contemporaneous symphonies second kindertotenlieder song and from fifth symphony last kindertotenlieder song and sixth symphony finale sadie p vol ii pp 36 41 mahler s last work employing vocal and orchestral forces das lied von der erde is subtitled a symphony mitchell categorises it as a song and symphony style union of song and symphonic form in mahler s music is in cooke s view organic his songs flower naturally into symphonic movements being already symphonic in cast cooke p 43 to sibelius mahler expressed belief that symphony must be like world it must embrace everything mitchell vol ii p 286 true to this belief mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works bird calls and cow bells to evoke nature and countryside bugle fanfares street melodies and country dances to summon lost world of his childhood life s struggles are represented in contrasting moods yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony suffering and despair by discord distortion and amid all this is mahler s particular hallmark constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness typified in second movement of fifth symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march trite melody soon changes its character and in due course re emerges as one of majestic brucknerian chorales which mahler uses to signify hope and resolution of conflict cooke pp 16 17 mahler himself recognised idiosyncrasies in his work calling scherzo in third symphony most farcical and at same time most tragic piece that ever existed it is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue la grange vol 2 p 179 range of musical moods cooke maintains comes from mahler s amazing orchestration which in writer s view defies analysis it speaks for itself cooke p 14 franklin lists specific features which are basic to mahler s style extremes of volume use of off stage ensembles unconventional arrangement of orchestral forces and frequent recourse to popular music and dance forms such as landler and waltz musicologist vladimir karbusicky maintains that composer s jewish roots had lasting effects on his creative output he pinpoints central part of third movement of first symphony as most characteristically yiddish music in mahler s work barham karbusicky pp 196 201 czech composer journalist max brod has also identified jewish tunes and rhythms in mahler s music blaukopf p 140 a technical device much used by mahler is that of progressive tonality which deryck cooke describes as procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated and which is often used to symbolise gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over whole course of a symphony deryck cooke notes 29 may 1964 this technique was also used by mahler s danish contemporary carl nielsen mahler first employed device in an early song memory and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies for example predominant key of first symphony is d major at beginning of finale conflict movement key switches to f minor and only after a lengthy battle gets back to d near end second symphony begins in c minor and ends in e flat movements of fifth symphony progress successively from c sharp minor to a minor then d major f major and finally to d major sixth symphony unusually for mahler begins and ends in same key a minor signifying that in this case conflict is unresolved cooke pp 83 87 reception early responses 1889 1911 thumb upright alt caricature of mahler surrounded by comical musical instruments including a motor horn which he is operating by use of his feet a satirical comment on mahler s sixth symphony caption translates my god i ve forgotten motor horn now i

america fourth symphony with 61 performances given most frequently adler did not enumerate performances of songs in his lifetime mahler s works and their performances attracted wide interest but rarely unqualified approval for years after its 1889 premiere critics and public struggled to understand first symphony described by one critic after an 1898 dresden performance as dullest symphonic work new epoch has produced la grange vol 2 p 99 p 140 second symphony was received more positively one critic calling it most masterly work of its kind since mendelssohn la grange vol 2 pp 141 42 such generous praise was rare particularly after mahler s accession to vienna hofoper directorship his many enemies in city used anti semitic and conservative press to denigrate almost every performance of a mahler work la grange vol 2 pp 148 55 307 09 thus third symphony a success in krefeld in 1902 was treated in vienna with critical scorn anyone who has committed such a deed deserves a couple of years in prison la grange vol 3 pp 68 69 a mix of enthusiasm consternation and critical contempt became normal response to new mahler symphonies although songs were better received la grange vol 3 pp 107 08 after his fourth and fifth symphonies failed to gain general public approval mahler was convinced that his sixth would finally succeed la grange vol 3 p 405 however its reception was dominated by satirical comments on mahler s unconventional percussion effects use of a wooden mallet birch rods and a huge square bass drum la grange vol 3 pp 412 13 viennese critic heinrich reinhardt dismissed symphony as brass lots of brass incredibly much brass even more brass nothing but brass la grange vol 3 p 536 one unalloyed performance triumph within mahler s lifetime was premiere of eighth symphony in munich on 12 september 1910 advertised by its promoters as symphony of a thousand at its conclusion applause and celebrations reportedly lasted for half an hour relative neglect 1911 50 performances of mahler s works became less frequent after his death in netherlands advocacy of willem mengelberg ensured that mahler remained popular there and mengelberg s engagement with new york philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought mahler regularly to american audiences carr pp 221 24 however much american critical reaction in 1920s was negative despite a spirited effort by young composer aaron copland to present mahler as a progressive 30 years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than richard strauss copland pp 149 50 earlier in 1916 leopold stokowski had given american premieres of eighth symphony and das lied von der erde in philadelphia eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to new york where it scored a further triumph ander smith p 91 an early proponent of mahler s work in britain was adrian boult who as conductor of city of birmingham orchestra performed fourth symphony in 1926 and das lied von der erde in 1930 mitchell mahler companion p 557 halle orchestra brought das lied and ninth symphony to manchester in 1931 sir henry wood staged eighth in london in 1930 and again in 1938 when young benjamin britten found performance execrable but was nevertheless impressed by music british critics during this period largely treated mahler with condescension and faint praise thus dyneley hussey writing in 1934 thought children s songs were delightful but that symphonies should be let go hussey pp 455 56 composer conductor julius harrison described mahler s symphonies as interesting at times but laboriously put together and as lacking creative spark harrison p 237 bernard shaw in his role as music critic thought that musical audiences of 1930s would find mahler and bruckner expensively second rate shaw p 753 before mahler s music was banned as degenerate during nazi era symphonies and songs were played in concert halls of germany and austria often conducted by bruno walter or mahler s younger assistant otto klemperer and also by willem mengelberg in austria mahler s work experienced a brief renaissance between 1934 and 1938 a period known today as when authoritarian regime with help of alma mahler and bruno walter who were both on friendly terms with new chancellor kurt schuschnigg sought to make mahler into a national icon with a status comparable to that of wagner in germany niekerk pp 216 17 271 mahler s music was performed during nazi era in berlin in early 1941 and in amsterdam during german occupation of netherlands by jewish orchestras and for jewish audiences alone works performed included second symphony berlin first and fourth symphonies and songs of a wayfarer amsterdam niekerk pp 216 271 modern revival according to american composer david schiff his compatriot leonard bernstein used to imply that he had single handedly rescued mahler from oblivion in 1960 after 50 years of neglect schiff points out that such neglect was only relative far less than incomplete disregard of bach in years after his death although bernstein gave mahler revival further impetus it was well under way before 1960 sustained by conductors such as stokowski dimitri and john barbirolli and by long time mahler advocate aaron copland mahler himself predicted his place in history once commenting would that i could perform my symphonies for first time 50 years after my death deryck cooke argues that mahler s popularity escalated when a new postwar generation of music lovers arose by dated polemics of anti romanticism which had affected mahler s reputation in inter war years in this more liberated age enthusiasm for mahler expanded even into places spain france italy which had long been resistant to him cooke pp 3 4 robert carr s simpler explanation for 1950s mahler revival is that it was long playing record in early 1950s rather than zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible mahler s work became accessible and repeatable in home in years following his centenary in 1960 mahler rapidly became one of most performed and most recorded of all composers and has largely remained thus in britain and elsewhere carr notes extent of mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut bringing problems of over familiarity harold schonberg comments that it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty adding that a response of anything short of rapture to mahler symphonies will bring to critic long letters of furious denunciation schonberg p 137 in a letter to alma dated 16 february 1902 mahler wrote with reference to richard strauss my day will come when his is ended if only i might live to see it with you at my side a mahler pp 220 21 carr observes that mahler could conceivably have lived to see his day his near contemporary richard strauss survived until 1949 while sibelius just five years younger than mahler lived until 1957 steen p 742 later influence donald mitchell writes that mahler s influence on succeeding generations of composers is a complete subject in itself mitchell vol ii pp 373 74 mahler s first disciples included arnold schoenberg and his pupils alban berg and anton webern who together founded second viennese school schonberg pp 256 58 mahler s music influenced trio s move from progressive tonalism to atonality music without a key although mahler rejected atonality he became a fierce defender of bold originality of schoenberg s work at premiere of latter s first string quartet in february 1907 mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking hecklers la grange vol 3 pp 608 09 schoenberg s serenade op 24 1923 berg s three pieces for orchestra 1915 and webern s six pieces 1928 all carry echoes of mahler s seventh symphony carr p 105 among other composers whose work carries influence of mahler mitchell lists america s aaron copland german song and stage composer kurt weill mitchell vol ii p 261 italy s luciano berio russia s dmitri shostakovich and england s benjamin britten american composers leonard bernstein and samuel barber were also influenced by mahler s work lebrecht p 5 excerpt in a 1989 interview pianist conductor vladimir ashkenazy said that connection between mahler and shostakovich was very strong and obvious their music represented individual versus vices of world kozinn 1989 mitchell highlights britten s marvellously keen spare and independent writing for wind in first movement of cello symphony of 1963 which clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which mahler did so much to establish mitchell concludes with statement even were his own music not to survive mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in music of these pre
