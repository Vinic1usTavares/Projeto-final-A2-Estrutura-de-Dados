within its range it can be very common in some areas but scarce in others in india is abundant in punjab very common along west coast and its hills in southern india especially in state of karnataka and north to bengal it is uncommon to rare in ganges valley northern bengal and assam it is prevalent in myanmar it is also common in thailand in pattaya and other tourist towns where its main prey rats have abundant food habitat d russelii is not restricted to any particular habitat but does tend to avoid dense forests snake is mostly found in open grassy or bushy areas but may also be found in second growth forests scrub jungles on forested plantations and farmland it is most common in plains coastal lowlands and hills of suitable habitat generally it is not found at altitude but has been reported as far up as 2300 3000 m 7 500 9 800 ft humid environments such as marshes swamps and rain forests are avoided this species is often found in highly urbanized areas and settlements in countryside attraction being rodents commensal with man as a result those working outside in these areas are most at risk of being bitten d russelii does not associate as closely with human habitation as naja and bungarus species cobras and kraits behaviour d russelii is terrestrial and active primarily as a nocturnal forager however during cool weather it alters its behavior and becomes more active during day adults are reported to be slow and sluggish unless pushed beyond a certain limit after which they can become very aggressive juveniles though are generally more nervous when threatened they form a series of s loops raise first third of body and produce a hiss that is supposedly louder than that of any other snake when striking from this position they can exert so much force that even a large individual can lift most of its body off ground in process these snakes are strong and may react violently to being picked up bite may be a snap or they may hang on for many seconds although this genus does not have heat sensitive pit organs common to it is one of a number of that are apparently able to react to thermal cues further supporting notion that they too possess a heat sensitive organ identity of this sensor is not certain but nerve endings in supranasal sac of these snakes resemble those found in other heat sensitive organs thumb d russelii in bangalore india reproduction d russelii is mating generally occurs early in year although pregnant females may be found at any time gestation period is more than six months young are produced from may to november but mostly in june and july it is a prolific breeder litters of 20 40 are common although fewer offspring may occur as few as one reported maximum is s viper delivers 75 bangalore mirror in a single litter at birth juveniles are in total length minimum total length for a gravid female is about it seems that sexual maturity is achieved in 2 3 years in one case it took a specimen nearly 4 5 hours to give birth to 11 young prey thumb d russelii hunting d russelii feeds primarily on rodents although especially it will also eat small reptiles land crabs scorpions and other arthropods juveniles are crepuscular feeding on lizards and foraging actively as they grow and become adults they begin to specialize in rodents indeed presence of rodents and lizards is main reason they are attracted to human habitation juveniles are known to be cannibalistic mimicry thumb right rough scaled sand boa gongylophis conicus possibly mimics appearance of d russelii some herpetologists believe because d russelii is so successful as a species and has such a fearful reputation within its natural environment another snake has come to mimic its appearance superficially rough scaled sand boa gongylophis conicus has a color pattern that often looks like that of d russelii though it is completely harmless venom quantity of venom produced by individual specimens of d russelii is considerable reported venom yields for adult specimens range from 130 250 mg to 150 250 mg to 21 268 mg for 13 juveniles with an average total length of average venom yield was 8 79 mg mean 45 mg in mice which is used as a possible indicator of snake venom toxicity is 0 133 mg kg intravenous 0 40 mg kg intraperitoneal about 0 75 mg kg subcutaneous for most humans a lethal dose is about 40 70 mg in general toxicity depends on a combination of five different venom fractions each of which is less toxic when tested separately venom toxicity and bite symptoms in humans vary within different populations and over time envenomation symptoms begin with pain at site of bite immediately followed by swelling of affected extremity bleeding is a common symptom especially from gums and in urine and sputum may show signs of blood within 20 minutes after bite blood pressure drops and heart rate falls blistering occurs at site of bite developing along affected limb in severe cases necrosis is usually superficial and limited to muscles near bite but may be severe in extreme cases vomiting and facial swelling occur in about one third of all cases kidney failure renal failure also occurs in approximately 25 30 percent of untreated bites severe disseminated intravascular coagulation also can occur in severe early medical treatment and early access to antivenom can prevent and drastically reduce chance of developing severe potentially lethal complications severe pain may last for 2 4 weeks locally it may persist depending on level of tissue damage often local swelling peaks within 48 72 hours involving both affected limb and trunk if swelling up to trunk occurs within 1 2 hours massive envenomation is likely discoloration may occur throughout swollen area as red blood cells and plasma leak into muscle tissue death from septicaemia or kidney respiratory or cardiac failure may occur 1 to 14 days after bite or even later a study in lancet showed that out of a sample of people bitten by d russelii who survived 29 of them suffered severe damage to their pituitary glands which later resulted in hypopituitarism other scientific studies support hypothesis that d russelii bites can cause hypopituitarism because this venom is so effective at inducing thrombosis it has been incorporated into an in vitro diagnostic test for blood clotting that is widely used in hospital laboratories this test is often referred to as dilute russell s viper venom time drvvt in venom directly activates factor x which turns prothrombin into thrombin in presence of factor v and phospholipid venom is diluted to give a clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds and phospholipid is reduced to make test extremely sensitive to phospholipid drvvt test is more sensitive than test for detection of lupus anticoagulant an autoimmune disorder because it is not influenced by deficiencies in clotting factors viii ix or xi antiphospholipid syndrome at retrieved 27 september 2006 in india
