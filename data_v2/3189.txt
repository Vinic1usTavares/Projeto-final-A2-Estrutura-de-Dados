of 7 1 close to its score of 7 4 for emotion and reviewer brad nelson found it to be more of a continuation of its parent album rather than a typical assorted b sides collection remarking these are pop songs gorgeous and direct but they are also extremely recursive spaces blushing compressions of time small infinities of heartbreak nelson commended jepsen s talent for maintaining a person to person intimacy in songs that still sound enormous jessica goodman of entertainment weekly came to similar conclusions about jepsen s pop persona and highlighted ep s tail end summer release her timing shows she couldn t care less about becoming pop s queen bee again she d rather throw coolest party in town side b is that bash intimate yet inclusive with an invitation personally delivered by

potential and pondered whether songs were all blueprints to run away with me first drafts of a single meant to define of emotion and yet in their raw state they show jepsen at her most powerful and
