thumb upright 1 4 asteroids of inner solar system and jupiter jupiter trojans are divided into two groups greek camp in front of and trojan camp trailing behind jupiter in their orbit jupiter trojans commonly called trojan asteroids or simply trojans are a large group of asteroids that share planet jupiter s orbit around sun relative to jupiter each trojan librates around one of jupiter s two stable lagrange points lying 60deg ahead of planet in its orbit and 60deg behind jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated curved regions around these lagrangian points with an average semi major axis of about 5 2 au first jupiter trojan discovered 588 achilles was spotted in 1906 by german astronomer max wolf a total of 7 040 jupiter trojans have been found by convention they are each named from greek mythology after a figure of trojan war hence name trojan total number of jupiter trojans larger than 1 km in diameter is believed to be about approximately equal to number of asteroids larger than 1 km in asteroid belt like main belt asteroids jupiter trojans form families jupiter trojans are dark bodies with reddish featureless spectra no firm evidence of presence of water or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained but it is thought that they are coated in tholins organic polymers formed by sun s radiation jupiter trojans densities as measured by studying binaries or rotational vary from 0 8 to 2 5 g cm 3 jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during early stages of solar system s formation or slightly later during migration of giant planets term trojan asteroid specifically refers to asteroids co orbital with jupiter but general term trojan is sometimes more generally applied to other small solar system bodies with similar relationships to larger bodies for example there are both mars trojans and neptune trojans as well as a recently discovered earth trojan nasa s wise mission finds first trojan asteroid sharing earth s orbit 27 july 2011 term trojan asteroid is normally understood to specifically mean jupiter trojans because first trojans were discovered near jupiter s orbit and jupiter currently has by far most known trojans observational history thumb right upright maximilian franz joseph cornelius wolf 1890 discoverer of first trojan in 1772 italian born mathematician joseph louis lagrange in studying restricted three body problem predicted that a small body sharing an orbit with a planet but lying 60deg ahead or behind it will be trapped near these points trapped body will librate slowly around point of equilibrium in a tadpole or horseshoe orbit these leading and trailing points are called and lagrange points first asteroids trapped in lagrange points were observed more than a century after lagrange s hypothesis those associated with jupiter were first to be discovered e e barnard made first recorded observation of a trojan identified as rd at time in 1904 but neither he nor others appreciated its significance at time barnard believed he had seen recently discovered saturnian satellite phoebe which was only two arc minutes away in sky at time or possibly an asteroid object s identity was not understood until its orbit was calculated in 1999 first accepted discovery of a trojan occurred in february 1906 when astronomer max wolf of heidelberg state observatory discovered an asteroid at lagrangian point of sun jupiter system later named 588 achilles in 1906 1907 two more jupiter trojans were found by fellow german astronomer august kopff 624 hektor and 617 patroclus hektor like achilles belonged to swarm ahead of planet in its orbit whereas patroclus was first asteroid known to reside at lagrangian point behind planet by 1938 11 jupiter trojans had been detected this number increased to 14 only in 1961 as instruments improved rate of discovery grew rapidly by january 2000 a total of 257 had been discovered by may 2003 number had grown to 1 600 there are 4 601 known jupiter trojans at and 2 439 at nomenclature custom of naming all asteroids in jupiter s and points after famous heroes of trojan war was suggested by johann of vienna who was first to accurately calculate their orbits asteroids in leading orbit are named after greek heroes greek node or camp or achilles group and those at trailing orbit are named after heroes of troy trojan node or camp asteroids 617 patroclus and 624 hektor were named before greece troy rule was devised resulting in a greek spy in trojan node and a trojan spy in greek node numbers and mass thumb right a gravitational potential contour plot showing earth s lagrangian points and are above and below planet respectively jupiter s lagrangian points are similarly situated in its much larger orbit estimates of total number of jupiter trojans are based on deep surveys of limited areas of sky swarm is believed to hold between 160 240 000 asteroids with diameters larger than 2 km and about 600 000 with diameters larger than 1 km if swarm contains a comparable number of objects there are more than jupiter trojans 1 km in size or larger for objects brighter than absolute magnitude 9 0 population is probably complete these numbers are similar to that of comparable asteroids in asteroid belt total mass of jupiter trojans is estimated at 0 0001 of mass of earth or one fifth of mass of asteroid belt two more recent studies indicate that above numbers may overestimate number of jupiter trojans by several fold this overestimate is caused by 1 assumption that all jupiter trojans have a low albedo of about 0 04 whereas small bodies may have an average albedo as high as 0 12 2 an incorrect assumption about distribution of jupiter trojans in sky according to new estimates total number of jupiter trojans with a diameter larger than 2 km is and in l4 and l5 swarms respectively these numbers would be reduced by a factor of 2 if small jupiter trojans are more reflective than large ones number of jupiter trojans observed in swarm is slightly larger than that observed in because brightest jupiter trojans show little variation in numbers between two populations this disparity is probably due to observational bias some models indicate that swarm may be slightly more stable than swarm largest jupiter trojan is 624 hektor which has an average diameter of 203 3 6 km there are few large jupiter trojans in comparison to overall population with decreasing size number of jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84 km much more so than in asteroid belt a diameter of 84 km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9 5 assuming an albedo of 0 04 within 4 4 40 km range jupiter trojans size distribution resembles that of main belt asteroids nothing is known about masses of smaller jupiter trojans size distribution suggests that smaller trojans may be products of collisions by larger jupiter trojans orbits thumb animation of orbit of 624 hektor blue set against orbit of jupiter outer red ellipse jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5 05 and 5 35 au mean semi major axis is 5 2 0 15 au and are distributed throughout elongated curved regions around two lagrangian points each swarm stretches for about 26deg along orbit of jupiter amounting to a total distance of about 2 5 au width of swarms approximately equals two hill s radii which in case of jupiter amounts to about 0 6 au many of jupiter trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to jupiter s orbital plane up to 40deg jupiter trojans do not maintain a fixed separation from jupiter they slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points periodically moving closer to jupiter or farther from it jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around lagrangian points average period of their libration is about 150 years amplitude of libration along jovian orbit varies from 0 6deg to 88deg with average being about 33deg simulations show that jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one lagrangian point to another these are called horseshoe orbits currently no jupiter trojan with such an orbit is known dynamical families and binaries discerning dynamical families within jupiter trojan population is more difficult than it is in asteroid belt because jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions this means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with overall swarm by 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified jupiter trojan families are much smaller in size than families in asteroid belt largest identified family menelaus group consists of only eight members in 2001 617 patroclus was first jupiter trojan to be identified as a binary asteroid binary s orbit is extremely close at 650 km compared to 35 000 km for primary s hill sphere largest jupiter trojan 624 hektor is probably a contact binary with a moonlet satellite discovery physical properties thumb right trojan 624 hektor indicated is similar in brightness to dwarf planet pluto jupiter trojans are dark bodies of irregular shape their geometric albedos generally vary between 3 and 10 average value is 0 056 0 003 for objects larger than 57 km and 0 121 0 003 r band for those smaller than 25 km asteroid 4709 ennomos has highest albedo 0 18 of all known jupiter trojans little is known about masses chemical composition rotation or other physical properties of jupiter trojans rotation rotational properties of jupiter trojans are not well known analysis of rotational light curves of 72 jupiter trojans gave an average rotational period of about 11 2 hours whereas average period of control sample of asteroids in asteroid belt was 10 6 hours distribution of rotational periods of jupiter trojans appeared to be well approximated by a maxwellian function maxwellian function is where is average rotational period is dispersion of periods whereas distribution for main belt asteroids was found to be non maxwellian with a deficit of periods in range 8 10 hours maxwellian distribution of rotational periods of jupiter trojans may indicate that they have undergone a stronger collisional evolution compared to asteroid belt in 2008 a team from calvin college examined light curves of a sample of ten jupiter trojans and found a median spin period of 18 9 hours this value was significantly higher than that for main belt asteroids of similar size 11 5 hours difference could mean that jupiter trojans possess a lower average density which may imply that they formed in kuiper belt see below composition spectroscopically jupiter trojans mostly are d type asteroids which predominate in outer regions of asteroid belt a small number are classified as p or c type asteroids their spectra are red meaning that they reflect more light at longer wavelengths or neutral and featureless no firm evidence of water organics or other chemical compounds has been obtained 4709 ennomos has an albedo slightly higher than jupiter trojan average which may indicate presence of water ice some other jupiter trojans such as 911 agamemnon and 617 patroclus have shown very weak absorptions at 1 7 and 2 3 mm which might indicate presence of organics jupiter trojans spectra are similar to those of irregular moons of jupiter and to a certain extent comet nuclei though jupiter trojans are spectrally very different from redder kuiper belt objects a jupiter trojan s spectrum can be matched to a mixture of water ice a large amount of carbon rich material charcoal and possibly magnesium rich silicates composition of jupiter trojan population appears to be markedly uniform with little or no differentiation between two swarms a team from keck observatory in hawaii announced in 2006 that it had measured density of binary jupiter trojan 617 patroclus as being less than that of water ice 0 8 g cm3 suggesting that pair and possibly many other trojan objects more closely resemble comets or kuiper belt objects in composition water ice with a layer of dust than they do main belt asteroids countering this argument density of hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve 2 480 g cm3 is significantly higher than that of 617 patroclus such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin origin and evolution two main theories have emerged to explain formation and evolution of jupiter trojans first suggests that jupiter trojans formed in same part of solar system as jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming last stage of jupiter s formation involved runaway growth of its mass through accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from protoplanetary disk during this growth which lasted for only about 10 000 years mass of jupiter increased by a factor of ten planetesimals that had approximately same orbits as jupiter were caught by increased gravity of planet capture mechanism was very efficient about 50 of all remaining planetesimals were trapped this hypothesis has two major problems number of trapped bodies exceeds observed population of jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude and present jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by capture model simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit creation of similar trojans for saturn and this has been borne out by observation to date no trojans have been found near saturn in a variation of this theory jupiter captures trojans during its initial growth then migrates as it continues to grow during jupiter s migration orbits of objects in horseshoe orbits are distorted causing l4 side of these orbits to be over occupied as a result an excess of trojans is trapped on l4 side when horseshoe orbits shift to tadpole orbits as jupiter grows this model also leaves jupiter trojan population 3 4 orders of magnitude too large second theory proposes that jupiter trojans were captured during migration of giant planets described in nice model in nice model orbits of giant planets became unstable years after solar system s formation when jupiter and saturn crossed their 1 2 mean motion resonance encounters between planets resulted in uranus and neptune being scattered outward into primordial kuiper belt disrupting it and throwing millions of objects inward when jupiter and saturn were near their 1 2 resonance orbits of pre existing jupiter trojans became unstable during a secondary resonance with jupiter and saturn this occurred when period of trojans libration about their lagrangian point had a 3 1 ratio to period at which position where jupiter passes saturn circulated relative to its perihelion this process was also reversible allowing a fraction of numerous objects scattered inward by uranus and neptune to enter this region and be captured as jupiter s and saturn s orbits separated these new trojans had a wide range of inclinations result of multiple encounters with giant planets before being captured this process can also occur later when jupiter and saturn cross weaker resonances in a revised version of nice model jupiter trojans are captured when jupiter encounters an ice giant during instability in this version of nice model one of ice giants uranus neptune or a lost fifth planet is scattered inward onto a jupiter crossing orbit and is scattered outward by jupiter causing orbits of jupiter and saturn to quickly separate when jupiter s semi major axis jumps during these encounters existing jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi major axes similar to jupiter s new semi major axis are captured following its last encounter ice giant can pass through one of libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to other after encounters end some of these jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when jupiter and saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as 3 7 resonance via mechanism of original nice model long term future of jupiter trojans is open to question because multiple weak resonances with jupiter and saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time collisional shattering slowly depletes jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected ejected jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of jupiter or jupiter family comets simulations show that orbits of up to 17 of jupiter trojans are unstable over age of solar system levison et al believe that roughly 200 ejected jupiter trojans greater than 1 km in diameter might be travelling solar system with a few possibly on earth crossing orbits some of escaped jupiter trojans may become jupiter family comets as they approach sun and their surface ice begins evaporating exploration on 4 january 2017 nasa announced that lucy was selected as one of their next two discovery program missions lucy is set to explore six jupiter trojans it is scheduled for launch in 2021 and will arrive at trojan cloud in 2027 after a fly by of a main belt asteroid it will then return to vicinity of earth for a gravity assist to take it to jupiter s trojan cloud where it will visit 617 patroclus japanese space agency has proposed solar sail for late 2020s to either analyse a trojan asteroid in situ or to perform a sample return mission see also comet
