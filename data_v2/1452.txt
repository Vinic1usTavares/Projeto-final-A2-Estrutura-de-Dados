principality of nitra also known as duchy of nitra was a west slavic polity encompassing a group of settlements that developed in 9th century around nitra in present day slovakia its history remains uncertain because of a lack of contemporary sources territory s status is subject to scholarly debate some modern historians describe it as an independent polity that was annexed either around 833 or 870 by principality of moravia while others say that it was under influence of neighbouring west slavs from moravia from its inception background modern day slovakia was dominated for centuries by germanic peoples including quadi and or lombards who were there until middle of 6th century a new material culture characterized by handmade pottery cremation burials and small square sunken huts that typically featured a corner stone oven appeared in plains along middle danube around that time new culture with its spartan and egalitarian nature sharply differed from earlier archaeological cultures of central europe according to barford a report by byzantine historian procopius is first certain reference to early slav groups inhabiting parts of present day slovakia procopius wrote that an exiled lombard prince named mustered an army taking with him not only those of lombards who had followed him but also many of procopius history of wars 7 35 19 pp 461 463 in 540s nomadic avars who arrived from eurasian steppes invaded carpathian basin and subjugated local inhabitants in second half of 6th century thereafter slavic groups inhabiting areas around core regions of avar khaganate paid tribute to avars khaganate experienced a series of internal conflicts in 630s according to chronicle of slavs who are known as wends rebelled against avars and elected a frankish trader named samo as their king in early 7th century samo s realm which emerged in northern or northwestern regions of carpathian basin existed for more than three decades it disintegrated soon after its founder s death and avar control of region was restored avar khaganate collapsed around 803 as a result of several successful military campaigns launched by franks against it fall of khaganate contributed to rise of new polities among slavs in region shift in political control was accompanied by changes in military strategy and equipment according to curta swords and other items of mikulcice horizon show a shift from mounted combat tactics typical of nomadic warfare to heavy cavalry equipment and development of a local elite in regions to north of river danube and great hungarian plain in early 9th century sources thumb upright 0 6 left alt pribina s sculpture modern sculpture of pribina in nitra remains of a 9th century fortress covering age of which has not been determined were unearthed in centre of nitra beeby writes that fortress belongs to great moravian period according to steinhubel fortress may have been named after river nitra which flows below hill upon which it stood archaeological research shows that a settlement inhabited by blacksmiths goldsmiths and other artisans developed at fortress an extensive network of settlements emerged around it in 9th century main source of information about polity now known as principality of nitra is conversion of bavarians and a document compiled around 870 to promote interests of archdiocese of salzburg in pannonia manuscripts state that one pribina who had been driven across danube by mojmir duke of moravians fled to radbod margrave of pannonia c 833 856 in east francia around 833 radbod introduced him to king louis german who ordered that pribina should be instructed in faith and baptized according to a sentence in three of eleven extant manuscripts of conversion archbishop adalram of salzburg r 821 836 consecrated a church for pribina on his estate at a place over danube called nitrava at an unspecified date modern historians debate whether this sentence was part of original text or was only a marginal note which was interpolated into main text in 12th century scholarly debates status and location of pribina s nitrava thumb right upright 0 8 alt map of moravia and nitra a map presenting theory of co existence of two principalities moravia and nitra before 830s according to a widely accepted interpretation of conversion pribina was initially ruler of an independent polity which was centered on nitra for instance barford writes that pribina was apparently prince of nitra pribina s assumed realm is described as first demonstrable slavic state north of middle danube by lukacka lukacka also says that pribina had a retinue and that most its members certainly descended from former tribal aristocracy but some of them could have come from free strata of mass of people richard marsina says that it can hardly be unambiguously decided whether pribina was prince of a greater tribe or of two or three smaller joined tribes he adds that pribina may have belonged to second or third generation of heads of this polity which emerged in valleys of rivers nitra and vah scholars who write that pribina was an independent ruler also say that his principality was united with moravia after he was exiled from his homeland kirschbaum and steinhubel add that forced unification of two s moravia and pribina s mojmir gave rise to empire of great moravia according to marsina inhabitants of pribina s principality who definitely were aware of their difference from moravian slavs preserved their specific consciousness even within great moravia which contributed to development of common consciousness of ancestors of slovak people pribina was not an independent ruler but duke mojmir of moravia s lieutenant in nitra according to vlasto he says that pribina s attempts to achieve independence led to his exile identification of nitra with nitrava is not universally accepted by scholars imre boba and charles bowlus are among scholars who challenged that identification imre boba says humanist historian johannes aventinus wrongly identified nitrava granted along with brno and olomouc by louis german according to aventinus with nitra because nitrava was in hunia or to south of bavaria he also says that latin term locus nitrava could not refer to a city according to his view none of modern names of nitra slovak nitra hungarian nyitra and german neutra could develop from a nitrava form boba s linguistic approach is not compliant with onomastic research which suggests that nitra was primary form of place name and nitrava is only secondary name both forms were recorded already in 9th century czech historian dusan trestik who says that association of nitra with nitrava cannot be challenged writes that latter form developed from name of nitra river which fits well into system of indo european toponyms other rivers with similar names are not known charles bowlus also rejects identification of nitrava with nitra because latter town was only annexed by moravia during reign of svatopluk years after pribina s expulsion according to a letter that archbishop of salzburg and his suffragans wrote around 900 according to trestik content of letter can be explained as a reasonable mistake of its who knew that territory was in past a separate realm different from moravia duchy of nitra kingdom of hungary duchy or ducatus is denomination for territories occasionally governed separately by members dukes of arpad dynasty within kingdom of hungary in 11th 12th centuries symbol of ducal power was a sword while royal power was represented by crown modern historians do not share a consensual view on origins of duchy or territorial units administered by members of royal family within medieval kingdom of hungary gyorgy gyorffy writes that ducatus or duchy developed from command over and other ethnic groups which joined federation of hungarian tribes according to his opinion this command was initially even before hungarian conquest of carpathian basin around 895 bestowed upon heir to supreme head of hungarian tribal federation in accordance with customs of turkic peoples of eurasian steppes therefore gyorffy continues crown prince s command over these ethnic groups transformed in course of 10th century into his authority over territories where they settled on other hand gyula kristo who rejected gyorffy s theory writes that duchy only came into being when king andrew i granted one third of his kingdom to his younger brother bela around 1048 he cites illuminated chronicle which clearly states that this was first division of kingdom practise of dynastical divisions of kingdom s territories commenced in 1048 when king andrew i of hungary conceded one third of counties of his kingdom in appanage to his brother bela territories entrusted to members of ruling dynasty were organized around two or three centers and duchy made up one third of kingdom s territory bela s autonomous duchy ducatus extended from morava river to border of transylvania it was composed of two parts nitra and neighboring bihar extending from upper tisa in north to river in south from transylvanian borders in east to tisa river in west bela was a sovereign lord of his demesne this is testified by ducal half denarii they had words bela engraved on them as well as by previously mentioned hungarian chronicle bela probably had coins struck at his ducal seat in nitra and new fortifications were added to nitra castle at that time duke bela was heir presumptive but later king andrew i fathered a son solomon birth of solomon gave rise to conflicts between two brothers that resulted in a civil war civil war stopped in 1060 when bela defeated his brother and ascended throne mikulas teich dusan kovac and martin d brown slovakia in history cambridge university press 2011 p 26 when bela died in 1063 his sons geza ladislaus and lampert had to flee from kingdom of hungary because their cousin solomon who had already been crowned in 1057 returned followed by troops his brother in law henry iv holy roman emperor provided him shortly afterwards king boleslaw ii of poland provided military assistance to three dukes thus they could return to kingdom however parties wanted to avoid emerging civil war and therefore they made an agreement on 20 january 1064 in gyor under agreement three brothers geza ladislaus and lampert accepted rule of their cousin king solomon who conceded them their father s former duchy ducatus mikulas teich dusan kovac and martin d brown slovakia in history cambridge university press 2011 p 26 28 following a nine year long period of cooperation conflicts arose among king and dukes and latter could expand their power over larger part of kingdom and king had to flee to western borders in 1074 eldest duke geza was proclaimed king while king solomon could maintain his rule only in some western counties of kingdom following his ascension to throne king geza confirmed his brothers ladislaus and lampert in possession of duchy when geza died on 25 april 1077 his partisans proclaimed ladislaus king who could enforce king solomon to accept his rule in 1081 during ladislaus reign duchy may have governed by his brother duke lampert but it has not been proven yet mikulas teich dusan kovac and martin d brown slovakia in history cambridge university press 2011 p 27 28 ducatus was revived in 1095 1096 when king coloman of hungary made an agreement with his brother prince almos who had been debating coloman s right to throne following death of king ladislaus i and conceded territories in appanage to him in 1105 duke almos rebelled against his brother and sought for military assistance from holy roman empire and poland but his troops were defeated by king shortly afterwards in 1107 duke almos made a pilgrimage to holy land and taking advantage of his absence king coloman occupied territories of duchy when duke almos returned from holy land and realised that his territories had been incorporated into royal domains he escaped to court of henry v holy roman emperor upon duke s request emperor laid siege to bratislava however king coloman sought assistance of duke boleslaw iii of poland who attacked bohemia in november emperor made a peace with coloman who let his brother come back to his court but duchy and his ducal power was not to be restored shortly afterwards coloman set up
