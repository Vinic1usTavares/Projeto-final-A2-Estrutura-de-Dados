also known as roughage are plant materials classified as legumes or grasses found in pastures or in hay often pastures and will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of grasses fertilization management and environmental conditions grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients some commonly used grasses include timothy brome fescue coastal bermuda orchard grass and kentucky bluegrass another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is beet pulp a byproduct left over from processing of sugar beets which is high in energy as well as fiber legumes such as clover or alfalfa are usually higher in protein calcium and energy than grasses however they require warm weather and good soil to produce best nutrients legume hays are generally higher in protein than grass hays they are also higher in minerals particularly calcium but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus because they are high in protein they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work but calcium phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities hay is a dried mixture of grasses and legumes it is cut in field and then dried and baled for storage hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on before seed heads are fully mature and before stems of

after a heavy workout as long as a hot horse continues to work it can drink its fill at periodic intervals provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources but when workout is over a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30 90 minutes before it can be allowed all water it wants at one time however dehydration is also a concern so some water needs to be offered during cooling off process a hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked sometimes thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout cooling down period even a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction colic additionally dehydration can lead to weight loss because horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva thus decreasing amount of feed and dry forage consumed thus it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot
