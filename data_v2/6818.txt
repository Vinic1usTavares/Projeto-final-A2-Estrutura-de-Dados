kepler 7 is a star located in constellation lyra in field of view of kepler mission a nasa operation in search of earth like planets it is home to fourth of first five planets that kepler discovered this planet a jupiter size gas giant named kepler 7b is as light as styrofoam star itself is more massive than sun and is nearly twice sun s radius it is also slightly metal rich a major factor in formation of planetary systems kepler 7 s planet was presented on january 4 2010 at a meeting of american astronomical society nomenclature and discovery kepler 7 received its name because it was home to seventh planetary system discovered by nasa led kepler mission a project aimed at detecting terrestrial planets that transit or pass in front of their host stars as seen from earth planet orbiting kepler 7 was fourth planet to be discovered by kepler spacecraft first three planets combed from kepler s data had been previously discovered and were used to verify accuracy of kepler s measurements kepler 7b was announced to public on january 4 2010 at 215th meeting of american astronomical society in washington d c along with kepler 4b kepler 5b kepler 6b and kepler 8b kepler 7b was noted for its unusually and extremely low density planet s initial discovery by kepler was verified by additional observations made at observatories in hawaii texas arizona california and canary islands characteristics kepler 7 is a sunlike star that is 1 347 msun and 1 843 rsun this means that star is about 35 more massive and 84 wider than sun star is estimated to be 3 5 1 billion years old it is also estimated to have a metallicity of fe h 0 11 0 03 meaning that kepler 7 is approximately 30 more metal rich than sun metallicity plays a significant role in formation of planetary systems as metal rich stars tend to be more likely to have planets in orbit star s effective temperature is 44 k in comparison 4 6 billion year old sun releases less heat with an effective temperature of 5778 k thumb 300px a picture showing relative sizes of first five planets discovered by kepler kepler 7b is largest highlighted in yellow star has an apparent magnitude of 13 meaning that it is extremely dim as seen from earth it cannot be seen with naked eye it is estimated to lie at approximately light years from solar system there is a star that is 4 magnitudes dimmer located 1 90 arcseconds away whether this a gravitationally bound companion star or a chance optical alignment is unknown planetary system kepler 7b is only planet that has been discovered in kepler 7 s orbit it is 433 mj and 1 478 rj meaning it is 43 mass of planet jupiter but is nearly three halves its size with a density of 166 grams cc planet is approximately 17 density of water this is comparable to styrofoam at a distance of au from its host star kepler 7b completes an orbit around kepler 7 every 4 days planet mercury however orbits sun at 3871 au and takes approximately 87 97 days to complete one orbit kepler 7b s eccentricity is assumed to be 0 which would give kepler 7b a circular orbit by definition see also list of extrasolar planets references external links category planetary systems category lyra constellation 7 category planetary transit variables
