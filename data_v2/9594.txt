strongholds at both belmont missouri and columbus kentucky but was not given enough troops and was only able to disrupt their positions grant s troops had to fight their way back to their union boats and escaped back to cairo under fire from heavily fortified stronghold at columbus although grant and his army retreated battle gave his volunteers much needed confidence and experience also president lincoln noticed that grant was a general willing to fight confederate held columbus blocked union access to lower mississippi grant and general james b mcpherson came up with a plan to bypass columbus and with a force of 25 000 troops move against fort henry on tennessee river and then ten miles east to fort donelson on cumberland river with aid of gunboats opening both rivers and allowing union access further south grant presented his plan to henry halleck his new commander under newly created department of missouri halleck was considering same strategy but rebuffed grant believing he needed twice number of troops however after halleck telegraphed and consulted mcclellan about plan he finally agreed on condition that attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy flag officer andrew h foote foote s gunboats bombarded fort henry leading to its surrender on february 6 1862 before grant s infantry even arrived grant then ordered an immediate assault on fort donelson under command of john b floyd which dominated cumberland river unlike fort henry grant was now going up against a force equal to his unaware of garrison s strength grant s forces were over confident grant mcclernand and smith positioned their divisions around fort next day mcclernand and smith launched probing attacks on apparent weak spots in confederate line only to retreat with heavy losses on february 14 1862

in command of simon bolivar buckner who submitted to grant s demand for unconditional and immediate surrender grant had won first major victory for union capturing floyd s entire rebel army of more than 12 000 halleck was angry that grant had acted without his authorization and complained to mcclellan accusing grant of neglect and inefficiency on march 3 halleck sent a telegram to washington complaining that he had no communication with grant for a week three days later halleck followed up with a postscript claiming word has just reached me that grant has resumed his bad habits of drinking lincoln regardless promoted grant to major general of volunteers while northern press treated grant as a hero playing off his initials they took to calling him unconditional surrender grant

their assessment grant whose forces numbered 45 000 wanted to attack confederates at corinth but halleck ordered him not to attack until major general don carlos buell arrived with his division of 25 000 meanwhile grant prepared for an attack on confederate army of roughly equal strength instead of preparing defensive fortifications between tennessee river and owl creek and clearing fields of fire they spent most of their time drilling largely inexperienced troops while sherman dismissed reports of nearby confederates union inaction created opportunity for confederates to attack first before buell arrived on morning of april 6 1862 grant s troops were taken by surprise when confederates led by generals albert sidney johnston and p g t beauregard struck first like an alpine avalanche near shiloh church attacking five divisions of grant s army and forcing a confused retreat toward tennessee river johnston was wounded and died and command fell upon beauregard one union line held confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called hornet s nest giving grant time to assemble artillery and 20 000 troops near pittsburg landing confederates finally broke through hornet s nest to capture a union division but grant s last line held pittsburg landing while exhausted confederates lacking reinforcements halted their advance day s fighting had been costly with thousands of troops killed and wounded that evening heavy rain set in sherman found grant standing alone under a tree in rain well grant we ve had devil s own day of it haven t we sherman said yes replied grant lick em tomorrow though bolstered by 18 000 fresh troops from divisions of major generals buell and lew wallace grant counterattacked at dawn next day and regained field forcing disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to corinth while thousands deserted halleck ordered grant not to advance more than one day from pittsburg landing stopping pursuit of confederate army although grant had won battle situation was little changed with union in possession of pittsburg landing and confederates once again holed up in corinth grant now realizing that south was determined to fight and that war would not be won with one battle would later write then indeed i gave up all idea of saving union except by complete conquest shiloh was costliest battle in american history to that point and staggering 23 746 total casualties stunned nation briefly hailed a hero for routing confederates grant was soon mired in controversy northern press castigated grant for shockingly high casualties and accused him of drunkenness during battle contrary to accounts of officers and others with him at time however grant s victory at shiloh ended any chance for confederates to prevail in mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in west halleck arrived from st louis on april 11 took command and assembled a combined army of about 120 000 men on april 29 1862 he relieved grant of field command and replaced him with major general george henry thomas halleck slowly marched his army to take corinth entrenching each night meanwhile beauregard pretended to be reinforcing sent deserters to union army with that story and moved his army out during night to halleck s surprise when he finally arrived at corinth on may 30 discouraged grant considered resigning

george washington grant said nothing publicly but wanted job and encouraged his men washburne urged him to run grant demurred saying he would be happy for republicans to win with another candidate though he preferred james g blaine to john sherman even so conkling and john a logan began to organize delegates in grant s favor when convention convened in chicago in june there were more delegates pledged to grant than to any other candidate but he was still short of a majority vote to get nomination at convention conkling nominated grant with an eloquent speech most famous line being when asked which state he hails from our sole reply shall be he hails from appomattox and its famous apple tree with 370 votes needed for nomination first ballot had grant at 304 blaine at 284 sherman at

pledging company s securities on multiple loans in a process called ward in collusion with banker james d fish and kept secret from bank examiners retrieved firm s securities from company s bank vault when trades went bad multiple loans came due all backed up by same collateral historians agree that grant was likely unaware of ward s intentions but it is unclear how much buck grant knew in may 1884 enough investments went bad to convince ward that firm would soon be bankrupt ward who assumed grant was a child in business matters told him of impending failure but assured grant that this was a temporary shortfall grant approached businessman william henry vanderbilt who gave him a personal loan of 150 000 grant invested money in firm but it was not enough to save it from failure essentially penniless but compelled by a sense of personal honor he repaid what he could with his civil war mementos and sale or transfer of all other assets vanderbilt took title to grant s home although he allowed grants to continue to reside there and pledged to donate souvenirs to federal government and insisted debt had been paid in full grant was distraught over ward s deception and asked privately how he could ever trust any human being again in march 1885 as his health was failing he testified against both ward and fish ward was convicted of fraud in october 1885 months after grant s death and

stories of his military experiences often making slight mistakes in terms of dates and locations as a poor hardscrabble farmer in st louis just before war he kept his neighbors spellbound till midnight listening intently to his vivid narrations of army experiences in calm moments during civil war he often spoke of his recent experiences typically in terse and often eloquent language grant s interpretations changed over time in his letters written during mexican war period there is no criticism of war by contrast his memoirs are highly critical of political aspects condemning war as unwarranted aggression by united states grant told and retold his war stories so many times that writing his memoirs was more a matter of repetition and polish rather than trying to recall his memories for first time in summer of 1884 grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late october when he learned it was cancer possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking grant chose not to reveal seriousness of his condition to his wife who soon found out from grant s doctor before being diagnosed grant was invited to a methodist service for civil war veterans in

corrupt administration while ignoring his presidential accomplishments grant s reputation fell as post war efforts in late 19th century national reconciliation took hold among whites as popularity of

and said grant s success as president was hardly less significant than his success at war in 1931 historians paxson and bach noted that grant s presidency had some achievements after all in 1934
