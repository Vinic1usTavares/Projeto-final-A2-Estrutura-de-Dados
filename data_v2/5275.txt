thumb upright 1 25 zellige terracotta tiles in marrakech forming edge to edge regular and other tessellations thumb upright 1 25 a wall sculpture in leeuwarden celebrating artistic tessellations of m c escher a tessellation of a flat surface is tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes called tiles with no overlaps and no gaps in mathematics tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries a periodic tiling has a repeating pattern some special kinds include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of same shape and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups a tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called non periodic an aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern in geometry of higher dimensions a space filling or honeycomb is also called a tessellation of space a real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons such tilings may be decorative patterns or may have functions such as providing durable and water resistant pavement floor or wall coverings historically tessellations were used in ancient rome and in islamic art such as in decorative geometric tiling of alhambra palace in twentieth century work of m c escher often made use of tessellations both in ordinary euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry for artistic effect tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting tessellations form a class of patterns in nature for example in arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs history thumb left a temple mosaic from ancient sumerian city of uruk iv 3400 3100 bc showing a tessellation pattern in coloured tiles tessellations were used by sumerians about 4000 bc in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles decorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called tesserae were widely employed in classical antiquity sometimes displaying geometric patterns in 1619 johannes kepler made an early documented study of tessellations he wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his harmonices mundi he was possibly first to explore and to explain hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes thumb upright 1 25 roman geometric mosaic some two hundred years later in 1891 russian crystallographer fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of plane features one of seventeen different groups of fyodorov s work marked unofficial beginning of mathematical study of tessellations other prominent contributors include aleksei and nikolai belov 1964 and heinrich and otto 1963 etymology in latin tessella is a small cubical piece of clay stone or glass used to make mosaics word tessella means small square from tessera square which in turn is from greek word tessera for four it corresponds to everyday term tiling which refers to applications of tessellations often made of glazed clay overview thumb upright left a tiling tiled floor in archeological museum of seville spain using square triangle and hexagon prototiles tessellation in two dimensions also called planar tiling is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes known as tiles can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps according to a given set of rules these rules can be varied common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles and that no corner of one tile can lie along edge of another tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule among those that do a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices having same angle between adjacent edges for every tile there are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations equilateral triangle square and regular hexagon any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints for example there are eight types of semi regular tessellation made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having same arrangement of polygons at every corner irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape artist m c escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles shaped like animals and other natural objects if suitable contrasting colours are chosen for tiles of differing shape striking patterns are formed and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors thumb elaborate and colourful zellige tessellations of glazed tiles at alhambra in spain that attracted attention of m c escher more formally a tessellation or tiling is a cover of euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets called tiles such that tiles intersect only on their boundaries these tiles may be polygons or any other shapes many tessellations are formed from a finite number of prototiles in which all tiles in tessellation are congruent to given prototiles if a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation shape is said to tessellate or to tile plane conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles plane periodically without reflections some tiles fail criterion but still tile plane no general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile plane or not which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations mathematically tessellations can be extended to spaces other than euclidean plane swiss geometer ludwig schlafli pioneered this by defining which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes these are analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions he further defined schlafli symbol notation to make it easy to describe polytopes for example schlafli symbol for an equilateral triangle is 3 while that for a square is 4 schlafli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly for example a tiling of regular hexagons has three six sided polygons at each vertex so its schlafli symbol is 6 3 other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings when tessellation is made of regular polygons most common notation is vertex configuration which is simply a list of number of sides of polygons around a vertex square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4 4 4 4 or 44 tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6 6 6 or 63 in mathematics introduction to tessellations mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings an edge is intersection between two bordering tiles it is often a straight line a vertex is point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles using these terms an isogonal or vertex transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical that is arrangement of polygons about each vertex is same fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form tessellation for example a regular tessellation of plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex sides of polygons are not necessarily identical to edges of tiles an edge to edge tiling is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side i e no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile in an edge to edge tiling sides of polygons and edges of tiles are same familiar brick wall tiling is not edge to edge because long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks a normal tiling is a tessellation for which every tile is topologically equivalent to a disk intersection of any two tiles is a single connected set or empty set and all tiles are uniformly bounded this means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all tiles in whole tiling condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin thumb left upright 15th convex monohedral pentagonal tiling discovered in 2015 a monohedral tiling is a tessellation in which all tiles are congruent it has only one prototile a particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is spiral monohedral tiling first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by heinz voderberg in 1936 voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a hirschhorn tiling published by michael d hirschhorn and d c hunt in 1985 is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons regular pentagons cannot tile euclidean plane as internal angle of a regular pentagon is not a divisor of 2 an isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to same transitivity class that is all tiles are transforms of same prototile under symmetry group of tiling if a prototile admits a tiling but no such tiling is isohedral then prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings a regular tessellation is a highly symmetric edge to edge tiling made up of regular polygons all of same shape there are only three regular tessellations those made up of equilateral triangles squares or regular hexagons all three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral thumb upright a pythagorean tiling a semi regular or archimedean tessellation uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement there are eight semi regular tilings or nine if mirror image pair of tilings counts as two these can be described by their vertex configuration for example a semi regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has vertex configuration 4 82 each vertex has one square and two octagons many non edge to edge tilings of euclidean plane are possible including family of pythagorean tilings tessellations that use two sizes of square each square touching four squares of other size an edge tessellation is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up position of a neighbouring tile such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles wallpaper groups thumb upright this tessellated monohedral street pavement uses curved shapes instead of polygons it belongs to wallpaper group p3 tilings with translational symmetry in two independent directions can be categorized by wallpaper groups of which 17 exist it has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in alhambra palace in granada spain though this is disputed variety and sophistication of alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers of three regular tilings two are in wallpaper group and one is in p4m tilings in 2d with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by seven frieze groups describing possible frieze patterns notation can be used to describe wallpaper groups of euclidean plane aperiodic tilings thumb left upright a penrose tiling with several symmetries but no periodic repetitions penrose tilings which use two different quadrilateral prototiles are best known example of tiles that forcibly create non periodic patterns they belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings one class that can be generated in this way is rep tiles these tilings have surprising self replicating properties pinwheel tilings are non periodic using a rep tile construction tiles appear in infinitely many orientations it might be thought that a non periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry but this is not so aperiodic tilings while lacking in translational symmetry do have symmetries of other types by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches a substitution rule such as can be used to generate some penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs illustrates scaling symmetry a fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling and to study quasicrystals which are structures with aperiodic order thumb a set of 13 wang tiles that tile plane only aperiodically wang tiles are squares coloured on each edge and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have same colour hence they are sometimes called wang dominoes a suitable set of wang dominoes can tile plane but only aperiodically this is known because any turing machine can be represented as a set of wang dominoes that tile plane if and only if turing machine does not halt since halting problem is undecidable problem of deciding whether a wang domino set can tile plane is also undecidable thumb upright random truchet tiling truchet tiles are square tiles decorated with patterns so they do not have rotational symmetry in 1704 sebastien truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours these can tile plane either periodically or randomly tessellations and colour thumb left if colours of this tiling are to form a pattern by repeating this rectangle as fundamental domain at least seven colours are required more generally at least four colours are needed sometimes colour of a tile is understood as part of tiling at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later when discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether colours are part of tiling or just part of its illustration this affects whether tiles with same shape but different colours are considered identical which in turn affects questions of symmetry four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal euclidean plane with a set of four available colours each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length colouring guaranteed by four colour theorem does not generally respect symmetries of tessellation to produce a colouring which does it is necessary to treat colours as part of tessellation here as many as seven colours may be needed as in picture at right tessellations with polygons thumb upright a voronoi tiling in which cells are always convex polygons next to various tilings by regular polygons tilings by other polygons have also been studied any triangle or quadrilateral even non convex can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation often in more than one way copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2 fold rotational symmetry with centres at midpoints of all sides for an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2 as fundamental domain we have quadrilateral equivalently we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors starting from a rotational centre we can divide this by one diagonal and take one half a triangle as fundamental domain such a triangle has same area as quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting if only one shape of tile is allowed tilings exists with convex n for n equal to 3 4 5 and 6 for see pentagonal tiling for see hexagonal tiling for see heptagonal tiling and for see octagonal tiling for results on tiling plane with polyominoes see polyomino ss uses of polyominoes voronoi tilings voronoi or dirichlet tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as set of points closest to one of points in a discrete set of defining points think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all points closest to a given city or post office voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is dual graph of a voronoi tessellation delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation in part because among all possible triangulations of defining points delaunay triangulations maximize minimum of angles formed by edges voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of plane tessellations in higher dimensions thumb upright tessellating three dimensional space rhombic dodecahedron is one of solids that can be stacked to fill space exactly tessellation can be extended to three dimensions certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill or tile three dimensional space including cube only platonic polyhedron to do so rhombic dodecahedron truncated octahedron and triangular quadrilateral and hexagonal prisms among others any polyhedron that fits this criterion is known as a and may possess between 4 and 38 faces naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite a kind of garnet and fluorite thumb upright left illustration of a schmitt conway biprism also called a schmitt conway danzer tile tessellations in three or more dimensions are called honeycombs in three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex similarly in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex however there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions uniform polyhedra can be constructed using wythoff construction schmitt conway biprism is a convex polyhedron with property of tiling space only aperiodically a schwarz triangle is a spherical triangle that can be used to tile a sphere tessellations in non euclidean geometries thumb left upright tiling in hyperbolic plane seen in poincare disk model projection thumb regular 3 5 3 icosahedral honeycomb one of four regular compact honeycombs in hyperbolic 3 space it is possible to tessellate in non euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry a uniform tiling in hyperbolic plane which may be regular quasiregular or semiregular is an edge to edge filling of hyperbolic plane with regular polygons as faces these are vertex transitive transitive on its vertices and isogonal there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other a uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space is a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells in 3 dimensional hyperbolic space there are nine coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs generated as wythoff constructions and represented by permutations of rings of coxeter diagrams for each family in art thumb upright roman mosaic floor panel of stone tile and glass from a villa near antioch in roman syria 2nd century ad in architecture tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times mosaic tilings often had geometric patterns later civilisations also used larger tiles either plain or individually decorated some of most decorative were moorish wall tilings of islamic architecture using girih and zellige tiles in buildings such as alhambra and la tessellations frequently appeared in graphic art of m c escher he was inspired by moorish use of symmetry in places such as alhambra when he visited spain in 1936 escher made four circle limit drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry for his woodcut circle limit iv 1960 escher prepared a pencil and ink study showing required geometry escher explained that no single component of all series which from infinitely far away rise like rockets perpendicularly from limit and are at last lost in it ever reaches boundary line thumb upright left a quilt showing a regular tessellation pattern tessellated designs often appear on textiles whether woven stitched in or printed tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking motifs of patch shapes in quilts tessellations are also a main genre in origami paper folding where pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion in manufacturing tessellation is used in manufacturing industry to reduce wastage of material yield losses such as sheet metal when cutting out shapes for objects like car doors or drinks cans tessellation is apparent in mudcrack like cracking of thin c xia j w hutchinson crack patterns in thin films j mech phys solids 48 1107 2000 with a degree of self organisation being observed using micro and nanotechnologies in nature thumb upright a honeycomb is a natural tessellated structure honeycomb is a well known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells left upright thumb tessellate pattern in a colchicum flower in botany term tessellate describes a checkered pattern for example on a flower petal tree bark or fruit flowers including fritillary and some species of colchicum are characteristically tessellate many patterns in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials these patterns can be described by gilbert tessellations also known as random crack networks gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model for formation of mudcracks needle like crystals and similar structures model named after edgar gilbert allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over plane each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through initiation point its slope chosen at random creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as lava cools extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava one example of such an array of columns is giant s causeway in northern ireland tessellated pavement a characteristic example of which is found at neck on tasman peninsula of tasmania is a rare sedimentary rock formation where rock has fractured into rectangular blocks other natural patterns occur in foams these are packed according to plateau s laws which require minimal surfaces such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible in 1887 lord kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces in 1993 denis weaire and robert phelan proposed weaire phelan structure which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than kelvin s foam in puzzles and recreational mathematics thumb upright traditional tangram dissection puzzle tessellations have given rise to many types of tiling puzzle from traditional jigsaw puzzles with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard and tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis for example and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares often used in tiling puzzles authors such as henry dudeney and martin gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics for example dudeney invented hinged dissection while gardner wrote about rep tile a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of same shape inspired by gardner s articles in scientific american amateur mathematician marjorie rice found four new tessellations with pentagons squaring square is problem of tiling an integral square one whose sides have integer length using only other integral squares an extension is squaring plane tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions james and frederick
