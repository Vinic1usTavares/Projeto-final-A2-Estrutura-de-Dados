japanese sleeper ray narke japonica is a species of electric ray in family it is common in inshore and offshore waters of northwestern pacific ocean from southern japan to southern china growing up to long japanese sleeper ray has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc colored reddish to chocolate brown above sometimes with darker or lighter spots and lighter brown below spiracles behind its small eyes have raised smooth rims its short and muscular tail bears a single dorsal fin positioned aft of rounded pelvic fins and terminates in a large caudal fin inhabiting shallow sandy areas near rocky reefs japanese sleeper ray is a bottom dwelling predator of invertebrates like other members of its family it can produce a strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes females give live birth to litters of up to five pups gestating young are sustained at first by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species as vulnerable due to its susceptibility to trawl fisheries that operate intensively throughout its range taxonomy first specimens of japanese sleeper ray known to science were four fish collected from japan by german naturalists philipp franz von siebold and heinrich burger during second quarter of 19th century specimens were stuffed and deposited at national museum of natural history in leiden three of them were labeled as narcine spec and one as narcine this material formed basis for a description authored by coenraad jacob temminck and hermann schlegel which was published in 1850 as part of fauna japonica a series of monographs on japanese zoology temminck and schlegel assigned new species to subgenus astrape of genus torpedo later authors would synonymize astrape with narke in 1947 marinus reexamined four original specimens and designated largest long as species lectotype other common names for this ray are japanese electric ray and japanese spotted torpedo some taxonomists believe that sleeper torpedo may be conspecific with japanese sleeper ray as their morphology is virtually identical description thumb left upright illustration of a japanese sleeper ray from sagami sea this specimen was unusual in having dark spots both above and below japanese sleeper ray has an almost circular pectoral fin disc wider than long two large kidney shaped electric organs are visible under skin on either side of head small protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised smooth rims nostrils are small and placed close together and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps mouth protrusible mouth forms a short transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove there are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw arranged into bands teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns five pairs of short gill slits are located on underside of disc pelvic fins are large and broad with convex margins and originate beneath pectoral fins adult males have stubby claspers that do not extend past pelvic fin margins tail is short and thick with a fold of skin along either side there is a single rounded dorsal fin positioned behind pelvic fins large caudal fin is nearly symmetrical above and below caudal peduncle and has rounded corners skin is soft and lacks dermal denticles japanese sleeper ray is reddish to chocolate brown above and paler brown below some individuals are plain while others have dark or light spots over their dorsal rarely also ventral surfaces maximum known length of this species is distribution and habitat japanese sleeper ray inhabits continental shelf waters in northwestern pacific ocean from southern japan and korea to southeastern china and taiwan this common bottom dwelling species can be found in sandy areas often near rocky reefs both close to and far from shore off izu peninsula it has been reported from in depth biology and ecology thumb blotchy swell shark is a predator of japanese sleeper ray thumb narke japonica temminck and schlegel drawn and painted by kawahara 1823 1829 fairly inactive in nature japanese sleeper ray spends much of its time lying buried on sea floor it can produce an electric shock of 30 80 volts to ward off predators which include blotchy swell shark its electric organs are composed of electrocytes which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly like substance these electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns with many columns making up each electric organ this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel diet of japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates a parasite of this species is tapeworm japonica 1934 1955 japanese sleeper ray is viviparous with developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk produced by mother females bear litters of up to five pups in early summer newborns measure long and are lighter and more uniform in color than adults sexual maturity is reached at a length between for males and at around for females human interactions shock from japanese sleeper ray is strong but not life threatening to humans there is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched with a camera by rubbing its back against camera port suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity this and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors and can serve as a model for human nervous system though little specific data are available japanese sleeper ray is believed to be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range it is not utilized economically however electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded and shrimp trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere given high intensity of fishing activity off east asia international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as
