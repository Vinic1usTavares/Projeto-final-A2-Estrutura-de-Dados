schwanter s composition more exotic scoring as well as schwantner s minimalistic treatment of music s more militant episodes gives it a drive and dramatic punch of its own album features raymond bazemore as narrator goodfellow described bazemore s occasionally sing song narration in new morning for world as he wrote that flagello s work contained writing of remarkable clarity and italianate warmth but thought bazemore s voice sounded hoarse towards end and preferred solo sections in new morning for world seattle times melinda bargreen called album strong and emotionally convincing and praised excellent performances with strong soloists she wrote that both works were composed in styles that are distinctively modern but tonal and accessible bargreen described bazemore s voice as deeply affecting and complimented depreist for conducting with an obvious passion for music drawing remarkably detailed and virtuosic performances from his orchestra tim smith of sun sentinel said both works were well worth hearing and encouraged orchestras to explore pieces along with works by other african american composers to provide public with broader programming smith described new morning for world as remarkably lyrical and quite dramatic he found bazemore s sing song narration to be too affected but found conclusion touching and complimented orchestra for its overall sturdy communicative performance smith called flagello s score unabashedly romantic and described as effective work of bazemore depreist and orchestra track listing new morning for world daybreak of freedom
