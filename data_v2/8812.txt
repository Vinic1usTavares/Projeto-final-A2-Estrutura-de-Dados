president fred seibert allowed lawrence to create a new team of companions for jonny but lawrence chose to revive original group sebast and lawrence decided to make series as realistic as possible through accurate physics and depictions of machinery lawrence emphasized believability eschewing ridiculous laser guns for real sidearms creative team researched child psychology ensuring they could depict realistic action and consequences without fueling nightmares seibert described show s theme as x files for kids citing difficult questions and mysteries to be posed in each episode departures from classic series included new character designs and introduction of a new character to quest family takashi designed jonny to be edgy and handsome and rendered characters in style of japanese

network in other formats until january 3 2003 and on cnx until 2003 overview show s premise is that dr quest a famous investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son jonny quest adopted son hadji singh bodyguard race bannon race s daughter jessie and pet bulldog bandit real adventures is set a few years after classic series making jonny and his friends teenagers lawrence aimed to use existing real phenomenon such as airstrips of nazca ruins of teotihuacan or possible existence of giant squid to capture audiences curiosity stressing plausibility he suggested writers cover real world enigmas cryptozoology unique locales an alien posing as vice president and fictional but believable mysteries quests would frequently visit virtual environment of questworld and encounter villainous jeremiah surd and ezekiel rage paralyzed years prior by race s swat team surd would try to exact revenge through technology rage a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission would try to destroy world with nuclear terrorism quests would sparingly fight monsters of week instead battling antagonists whose conflicts lay in personal objective or ambition opposed by dr quest lawrence stationed family at a new compound on coast of maine replete with houses barns and workshops rooms suited for each character included a library for dr quest workshop for jonny computer equipped den for jessie dojo and gym for race and lighthouse lookout for hadji s meditation lawrence equipped dr quest with a fleet of air land and sea vehicles including a 1940s biplane and state of art catamaran named questor with diving bells and smaller research vessels stored in hulls peter lawrence prided real adventures on strength of its writing opining that very few writers in this or any other field actually write visually and contesting that each episode would have enough material or potential to develop into a movie characters thumb hadji jessie and jonny from season one episode expedition to alt characters hadji singh jessie bannon and jonny quest are shown with faces emphasized in an ice setting hadji is very tan skinned wearing a turban navy blue sweater and red suspenders jessie is pale skinned with red hair and green eyes and is wearing a blue snow suit with pink highlights and black suspenders jonny has blonde hair and blue eyes and is lightly tanned he s wearing a black snow suit with red suspenders peter lawrence described jonny as a hero in training on cusp of adulthood he remarked that jonny possessed a straight ahead right on attitude free of introspection or self doubt jonny quest jonny quest age 14 he s a confident problem solver that s prone to getting in trouble writers framed him as more an intuitive thinker than an intellectual and created tension by contrasting his father s academic leanings with jonny s affinity for race s daring lifestyle jonny inherited his father s driving curiosity rendering him a walking query as well as his mother s restless adventurous spirit takashi designed jonny to be lean wiry athletic and coordinated creative directors centered episodes around jonny seibert summarized shift hadji hadji quest age 16 became dr quest s personal assistant lacking his mentor s formal education but sharing his burning interest in archaeology anthropology and paranormal a hindu as mentioned in original series episode riddle of gold and a yogi he held a fatalistic attitude towards show s drama reacting to situations from philosophical point of view that everything is as it s supposed to be hadji often used wise aphorisms taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling jonny lawrence cut hadji s classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices he doesn t say things like sim sim sala bim anymore season one voice actor michael benyaer explained writers and producers actually researched actual yogic powers he can do more plausible stuff there is an episode where hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that bad guys think he is dead takashi drew hadji taller and thinner than his classic counterpart jessie bannon jessie bannon age 15 was characterized to be just as tough smarter and more thoughtful than jonny written as more of an egghead she elected to spend time with dr quest as jonny did with race and was more in tune with hadji turner conceived jessie as cool independent and a strong role model for contemporary girls peter lawrence took pains to ensure jessie would not be written as a guy in a skirt and made her more mature than jonny race bannon race bannon jessie s father age 38 retained his classic laconic sense of humor and fearless dependable nature he retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency writers noted that race was helplessly overprotective of jessie and jonny was boy race never had race was also given a western us accent and a knack for crafting elaborate colorful similes peter lawrence sculpted race to be a cowboy philosopher or philosopher warrior writers tasked race with physical and self defense training for quest team dr benton quest dr benton quest age 55 retired from government research and operated from quest compound on coast of maine driven by curiosity he was consulted by individuals governments and corporations to investigate enigmatic events described as single minded almost to point of obsession in his pursuit of knowledge he often encountered trouble as his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self preservation jessie appreciated his ponderous sense of humor show s promoters summarized him as benevolent king archetype bandit bandit family dog also appeared in series lawrence removed bandit s clownish origins stressing that bandit could not understand english nor reliably save family from perilous situations summarizing group s behavior lawrence wrote jonny s response to danger will be close to race s jessie s intrigue with mysterious unexplained phenomena will be close to dr quest s and hadji with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life is different again takashi designed each character as physically fit and well sculpted to reflect a more exercise oriented society fred seibert downplayed worries that new characters would disappoint cult fans of classic series he hoped real adventures would find success as new interpretations of comic book heroes had done second season changes season two directors larry houston and davis doi changed show to resemble classic franchise writer glenn leopold revived hadji s latent psionic powers including spoon bending and rope tricks as he felt first season s realism was not that interesting to watch all characters lost a year in age jonny became 13 writer lance falk returned race to governmental guard duty sealed by an episodic visit with classic quest spymaster phil race lost his western accent with falk even comparing race s western accent to batman having a french accent and dr quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills falk regarded jessie as missing piece needed to complete quest family and leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes some fans complained about changes to jessie criticized as a damsel in distress with stereotypically female pink clothes jonny saved jessie from danger several times falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic human fears such as claustrophobia censors asked second season team to replace firearms with dart guns notably in episode general winter right 120px thumb lance falk season two writer second season writers took greater creative liberties with real adventures invoking ghosts other dimensions and megalomaniacal schemes leopold and falk sought to create a slam bang adventure show with real monsters and heightened narrative emphasis on jonny and his friends falk explained that cool contrivances took precedence over accuracy stating that jonny quest is a show with one foot in fantastic and one foot solidly based in reality opposed to questworld new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use it in their episodes falk felt that virtual reality undermined show s strong connection to reality and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents dr quest would have turned system off writers brought back several classic characters including pasha peddler jezebel jade dr zin and his twin daughters anaya and melana falk honored quest creator doug by creating an eponymous grandfather for jonny in episode nuclear netherworld as well as homage to william hanna s of new mexico where jonny s grandfather resides team created estella velasquez as jessie s mother to retcon telefilms feeling that jade would never get married writers eventually killed off villains ezekiel rage and dr jeremiah surd in favor of new adversaries comparing quest without zin to james bond without s p e c t r e falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between dr quest and zin falk planned to resuscitate palm key as quest home in new episodes cartoon network did not renew real adventures despite a pledge to explore history of jonny s mother rachel in season premiere cast first season of real adventures featured j d roth as jonny george segal as dr quest robert patrick as race jesse douglas as jessie michael benyaer as hadji and veteran voice actors frank welker and michael bell as dr jeremiah surd and ezekiel rage respectively a childhood fan of original series j d roth was inspired by turner s vision for new series and swiftly accepted role of jonny roth was attracted by jonny s star quality and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers he enjoyed jonny s infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity roth also admired show s educational quality something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots when asked about how he played relationship with jonny s father he commented jonny is crazy about his dad he looks up to him and thinks he is smartest man ever to walk to face of earth he has typical teenage relationship with his father but his father definitely sees something in him dr quest knows that jonny is going to be something really special michael benyaer also enjoyed playing hadji he is one of few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy i mean how many east indian heroes have been on television hadji is for sensitive kids out there he is outsider in all of us a star wars fan benyaer was happy to work with mark hamill for in realm of condor peter lawrence s request for an indian descended voice actor was seen as an unusual case of multi ethnic casting producers struggled to cast jessie bannon peter lawrence ultimately chose jesse douglas who he felt reflected jessie s energy and intelligence jesse douglas has immense energy huge energy and is kind of woman who could do all kind of things jessie could do you know athletic smart so and so forth sic douglas impressed lawrence with her active lifestyle including ballet equestrianism and tennis when asked about character s inclusion douglas stated i d be bummed if i upset anybody jessie is pretty cool it is not like she is a girl who is whining all time if anything she is a really good springboard for rest of storyline roth supported her claiming that jonny hasn t discovered girls yet but when he does jessie would be type of girl he d like to be with i think something will happen between them but right now jess is his best friend h b chief fred seibert agreed hinting that as adults there might be a tracy hepburn thing going on turner approached george segal to audition for part of dr quest segal described show as having a real family feeling about it i d never seen this stuff before that was quite remarkable hanna barbera bought out first cast s
