of old us 16 which was decommissioned in 1962 beginnings muskegon grand rapids lansing detroit corridor was initially named grand river road an indian trail that was designated as a military highway in 1825 roadway was included as a branch of division 2 of state trunkline highway system when that was created in may 1913 when system was signposted in 1919 highway was assigned m 16 designation

interstates alt map of east of grand rapids highway was a major artery of national importance and was added to proposed interregional highway system as part of a northern route between chicago and detroit by 1940s a branch from grand rapids to muskegon was added later that decade and in 1957 chicago detroit route was labeled as part of interstate 94 with interstate 94n on spur to muskegon michigan believing that this would cause considerable confusion to public requested a change in april 1958 which would move i 94 to shorter kalamazoo route which was planned as i 92 make muskegon detroit route i 96 and assign i 67 to connection from i 94 to i 96 at grand rapids but this was initially rejected by american association of state highway officials aasho by mid 1959 michigan s plan had been approved with one change i 96 would take south leg from i 94 at benton harbor to grand rapids and north leg to muskegon would be i 196 construction of brighton farmington expressway piece of

separate related highways named business spur interstate 196 bs i 196 for muskegon and for detroit in 1963 michigan state highway department petitioned aasho to again make change it had requested back in 1958 moving i 96 over i 196 to end at muskegon and renumbering i 96 west of grand rapids to i 67 state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from public about confusion caused by numbering at their october 21 1963 meeting aasho approved relocation of i 96 but rejected i 67 stating that number should be kept for a more major route in case system is expanded and instead assigned i 196 to not yet complete benton harbor grand rapids highway signage was switched in january 1964 with scheduled completion of lodge freeway on october 29 1964 a full freeway route was available from i 96 into downtown detroit via i 696 and lodge but it would be some time before i 96 was finished into city construction of jeffries freeway detroit expressway and transit system plan prepared in 1945 for city of detroit included a grand river expressway which was to parallel grand river avenue into downtown and relieve congestion on that artery a rail line would be built in median of freeway west of west chicago street where streetcars would exit onto existing surface tracks on grand river avenue into downtown plan called for a future conversion to rapid transit with a grade separated route to downtown department of street railways determined in 1947 that operation would cost 6 million per year equivalent to yr in and planned transit line was dropped from plans by 1961 proposed highway was renamed jeffries freeway after edward jeffries who served as detroit mayor from 1940 to 1948 first piece of jeffries freeway connected fisher freeway i 75 with ford freeway i 94 in 1970 it was extended northwest to livernois avenue exit in july 1971 and then to grand river avenue at schaefer highway exit 185 in 1973 in 1976 freeway was extended west to southfield freeway

jeffries freeway approaching m 39 southfield freeway in detroit alt photograph showing originally route of interstate 96 from east end of existing freeway in farmington through detroit named jeffries freeway commonly referred to as simply jeffries was to closely parallel grand river avenue formerly us 16 however by 1963 several freeway revolts were taking place in urban locations throughout country including detroit several of detroit s planned freeways were modified scaled back or outright cancelled to minimize impact to existing communities and businesses it was decided that jeffries freeway would no longer utilize grand river avenue corridor instead new i 96 freeway corridor would partially use right of way from c o railroad through city of livonia ultimately being built over schoolcraft road and utilize planned i 275 freeway bypassing detroit to west to connect back to existing freeway subsequent history since completion of i 96 in 1977 several changes to freeway have taken place beginning in 1984 an extension of us 27 freeway later to become i 69 bypassing lansing opened us 27 was then cosigned with i 96 along western side of lansing three years later i 69
