areas are located in 54 cities and municipalities within 8 counties these areas are thought to contain approximately 31 000 land mines in addition to unexploded ordnance left over from croatian war of independence land mines were used extensively during war by all sides in conflict about 1 5 million were deployed they were intended to strengthen defensive positions lacking sufficient weapons or manpower but played a limited role in fighting after war of territory was initially suspected to contain mines but this estimate was later reduced to after physical inspection demining programmes were coordinated through governmental bodies such as croatian mine action centre which was hiring private demining companies employing 632 deminers areas are marked with 12 280 warning signs 509 people had been killed and 1 466 injured by land mines in croatia since war with these figures including 60 deminers and seven croatian army engineers killed during demining operations in immediate aftermath of war there were about 100 civilian mine casualties per year but this decreased to below ten per year by 2010 through demining mine awareness and education programmes croatia has spent approximately eur450 million on demining since 1998 when process was taken over by private contractors coordinated by croatian mine action centre cost to complete demining is estimated at eur500 million or more economic loss to croatia due to loss of land use within suspected minefields is estimated at eur47 3 million per year background in 1990 following electoral defeat of communist regime in croatia by croatian democratic union hdz ethnic tensions between croats and serbs worsened after elections yugoslav people s army jna confiscated croatia s territorial defence weapons to minimize potential resistance on 17 august tensions escalated to an open revolt by croatian serbs jna stepped in preventing croatian police from intervening revolt centred on predominantly serb populated areas of dalmatian hinterland around city of knin parts of lika kordun and banovina regions and eastern croatian settlements with a significant serb population this area was subsequently named republic of serbian krajina rsk rsk declared its intention to join serbia and as a result came to be viewed by government of croatia as a breakaway region by march 1991 conflict had escalated into what became known as croatian war of independence in june croatia declared its independence as yugoslavia disintegrated by january 1992 rsk held of territory within borders claimed by croatia this territory ranged from in depth and had a front line along croatian controlled territory wartime use thumb marking of a minefield left over from croatian war of independence land mines were first used by jna in early 1991 before its withdrawal from croatia to protect military barracks and other facilities even jna facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way using mines such as prom 1 bounding mine and directional anti personnel mine croatian army hv and croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991 relying heavily on them to stop advances by jna and army of rsk arsk until early 1992 these early minefields were laid with little documentation in 1992 arsk increased its use of mines to secure front line largely due to its limited number of troops consequently arsk constructed static defensive lines consisting of trenches bunkers and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly manned defences to delay hv offensives this approach was necessitated by limited depth of rsk territory and lack of reserves available with which to counterattack or block breaches of its defensive line which meant that arsk was unable to employ defence in depth tactics combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and lack of markings or fencing led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces it is estimated that a total of 1 5 million land mines were laid during war hv successfully used anti tank mines as obstacles in combination with infantry anti tank weapons destroying or disabling more than 300 jna tanks particularly during defensive operations in slavonia conversely anti personnel mines deployed by arsk proved less effective against hv during operations flash and storm in 1995 during these operations hv crossed or bypassed many arsk minefields based on information from land based and unmanned aerial vehicle reconnaissance of movement of arsk patrols civilian populations and activation of mines by wildlife out of 224 hv personnel killed in operations flash and storm only 15 fatalities were caused by land mines similarly out of 966 wounded in two offensives only 92 were injured by land mines casualties a total of 509 people had been killed and 1 466 injured by land mines in 1 352 incidents in croatia there were 557 civilian casualties from land mines between 1991 and 1995 during war and in its immediate aftermath between 1996 and 1998 there were approximately 100 civilian casualties from land mines per year in croatia but number gradually decreased to less than ten per year by 2010 during war 57 hv troops were killed or injured by mines in 1992 in 1995 169 were killed or injured most during operations flash and storm out of 130 000 hv troops involved seven hv engineers were killed and 18 injured by land mines during hv mine clearance operations between 1996 and 1998 civilian casualties include 60 deminers killed since 1998 croatia has established an extensive framework to assist those injured by mines and families of mine victims this assistance includes emergency and ongoing medical care physical rehabilitation psychological and social support employment and social

of independence areas suspected to contain land mines are marked with more than 12 000 warning signs areas thought to contain unexploded ordnance but no land mines are marked with 409 warning signs suspected minefields are primarily located in forests 62 percent remainder are on agricultural land 26 percent karst and shrubland 12 percent social and economic impacts land mines are a safety issue for populations living near minefields in 2008 an estimated 920 000 people in croatia were endangered by their proximity to mined areas 20 8 percent of population land mines are also a significant problem for development because a substantial portion of minefields in croatia are on agricultural land and in forests some drainage channels are consequently inaccessible for maintenance resulting in intermittent flooding this is particularly severe in areas bordering hungary similar problems are caused by mines laid on banks of drava kupa and sava rivers presence of land mines adversely affected post war recovery in rural areas reducing amount of available agricultural land impeding development and affecting quality of life for people in mined areas in addition to agriculture most significant economic problem caused by mines in croatia is their impact on tourism especially on forested areas and hunting in areas inland from adriatic sea coast in 2012 it was estimated that economy of croatia lost 355 million kuna 47 3 million euros a year from effects of mine suspected areas on economy because of importance of tourism to croatian economy areas frequented by tourists or near major tourist routes have been given priority for demining other safety related areas receiving demining priority are settlements commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields agricultural land infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance national parks in croatia were also demined as top priority areas along with areas significant for fire protection theft of minefield signs is a significant problem and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among local population that signs harm tourism signs are regularly replaced sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles since 1990s only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in croatia government of croatia established several bodies to address problem of land mines in croatia foremost among them are office for mine action and croatian mine action centre office for mine action is a government agency tasked with providing expert analysis and advice on demining croatian mine action centre is a public sector body tasked with planning and conducting demining surveys accepting cleared areas marking mine suspected areas quality assurance demining research and development and victim assistance work of croatian mine action centre is supervised by office for mine action as refugees flee to europe
