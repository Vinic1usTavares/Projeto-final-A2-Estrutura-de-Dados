haryanto with two renault cars last to be eliminated lewis hamilton set fastest time in q2 at 1 06 228 fastest time set in any session at red bull ring however both ferrari and red bull set their fastest times in q2 on supersoft tyres unlike mercedes who used ultrasoft compound meaning that both teams were able to start race on harder tyre realizing this mercedes tried to counter move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres but were unable to improve on their times due to rain starting to fall jenson button moved into q3 while his teammate fernando alonso did not ending up 14th on grid in 12th place wehrlein equalled manor s highest ever qualifying result being between two haas drivers esteban gutierrez and romain grosjean on grid following their problems in q1 perez and sainz

able to reverse into his slot one row behind just 0 5 seconds before start light procedure started avoiding a penalty at start hamilton got away well from pole position while hulkenberg lost ground button was second as rosberg moved ahead of ricciardo and verstappen having gotten a new car built overnight daniil kvyat retired at end of lap two after having started from pitlane on lap six rosberg got ahead of hulkenberg in fourth position while verstappen took advantage and overtook hulkenberg as well raikkonen got ahead of button into second on lap seven tyre stops started on lap nine as hulkenberg and alonso were first to come in followed by button one lap later after gutierrez came past him into ninth on lap 12 massa headed for pitlane as well as wehrlein made a pit stop on lap 14 hamilton was still in lead followed by raikkonen and rosberg thumb left max verstappen qualified only ninth but fought his way up to second in race nico rosberg made his pit stop shortly thereafter putting on soft compound tyre while hamilton stayed out in meantime vettel had moved up into third place right behind his teammate raikkonen hamilton came into pitlane on lap 22 and problems with his stop saw him lose position to rosberg raikkonen briefly led race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop only to come out behind both red bull drivers more trouble was ahead for ferrari as vettel who was in lead at that point retired on lap 27 when he crashed into barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded this incident sent safety car out bringing field back together rosberg was now leading race from hamilton verstappen ricciardo and raikkonen safety car came back in on lap 32 with rosberg leading field at flying restart quickly pulling out a two second advantage over hamilton sergio perez was winner of restart moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later on lap 39 button moved ahead of felipe nasr into seventh position after keeping gap at around two seconds for a number of laps a mistake by rosberg saw hamilton close back up to him allowing him to use drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50 including valtteri bottas on lap 52 while nico hulkenberg took his third stop a lap before serving a five second time penalty for speeding in pitlane in process on lap 55 hamilton was first of leading duo to come in for a pitstop followed by rosberg a lap later a quicker stop for rosberg and a mistake by hamilton on his lap after pitting saw rosberg emerge from his stop ahead verstappen was in lead soon followed closely by two mercedes drivers on lap 58 raikkonen overtook ricciardo for fourth place while verstappen was staying in lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15 he lost lead to rosberg however on lap 61 with hamilton getting past him as well soon after as mercedes duo battled for race win several drivers retired in closing stages of race including hulkenberg and massa raikkonen was closing in to verstappen in third while pascal wehrlein edged closer to bottas in tenth place as well on last lap hamilton attempted to overtake rosberg into turn two hamilton went to outside but rosberg turned into corner late on inside and both cars touched damaging rosberg s front wing and pushing hamilton off track they almost touched again as hamilton rejoined track hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as rosberg nursed his damaged car to finish line he was relegated to fourth position as both verstappen and raikkonen moved past him over course of lap further behind perez retired elevating wehrlein into last point scoring position in tenth post race thumb pascal wehrlein recorded his first ever point in formula one at podium ceremony following race hamilton was booed by crowd in podium interview conducted by spanish tv presenter noemi de miguel he shrugged off reaction saying that s not my problem it s theirs both hamilton and verstappen expressed delight at their result while raikkonen said that it had not been an easy day for team stressing that ferrari had not achieved what they could have since he felt that he could have overtaken verstappen towards end hamilton s win was 250th victory by a british driver in formula one and his first at spielberg circuit crash between two mercedes drivers on last lap was a talking point after race describing incident as brainless their director of motorsport toto wolff declared that he was fed up with trying to analyse contacts between his drivers emphasising that such incidents needed to stop it had been second time in five races that pair had crashed into each other with first accident coming at spanish grand prix wolff said that should a similar situation arise in future team would contemplate settling order of cars by telling them not to race each other though he admitted that such a decision would be unpopular he made his feelings about possible team orders clear by saying thought makes we want to puke myself but if racing is not possible without contact that is a consequence one day after race it was reported that team even contemplated using measures as far as fines and temporary suspensions for their drivers if another accident between two should occur concerning sebastian vettel s tyre failure supplier pirelli announced that blowup was not caused by a wrong strategy from ferrari but rather by debris on track as a result of race nico rosberg retained his lead in drivers championship although hamilton closed gap to eleven points two ferrari drivers of vettel and raikkonen followed in third and fourth both on 96 points followed by ricciardo in fifth with 88 in constructors standings mercedes
