biblical criticism is an umbrella term for those methods of studying bible that embrace two distinctive perspectives concern to avoid dogma and bias by applying a non sectarian reason based judgment and reconstruction of history according to contemporary understanding biblical criticism uses grammar structure development and relationship of language to identify such characteristics as bible s literary structure its genre its context meaning authorship and origins biblical criticism includes a wide range of approaches and questions within four major contemporary methodologies textual source form and literary criticism textual criticism examines text and its manuscripts to identify what original text would have said source criticism searches texts for evidence of original sources form criticism identifies short units of text and seeks to identify their original setting each of these is primarily historical and pre compositional in its concerns literary criticism on other hand focuses on literary structure authorial purpose and reader s response to text through methods such as rhetorical criticism canonical criticism and narrative criticism biblical criticism began as an aspect of rise of modern culture in west some scholars claim that its roots reach back to reformation but most agree it grew out of german enlightenment german pietism played a role in its development as did british deism with its greatest influences being rationalism and protestant scholarship enlightenment age and its skepticism of biblical and ecclesiastical authority ignited questions concerning historical basis for man jesus separately from traditional theological views concerning him this quest for jesus of history began in biblical criticism s earliest stages reappeared in nineteenth century and again in twentieth remaining a major occupation of biblical criticism on and off for over 200 years in late twentieth and early twenty first century biblical criticism was influenced by a wide range of additional academic disciplines and theoretical perspectives changing it from a primarily historical approach to a multidisciplinary field in a field long dominated by white male protestants non white scholars women and those from jewish and catholic traditions became prominent voices globalization brought a broader spectrum of worldviews into field and other academic disciplines as diverse as near eastern studies psychology anthropology and sociology formed new methods of biblical criticism such as socio scientific criticism and psychological biblical

beginning histoire critique du vieux testament par le r p richard simon title page of richard simon s critical history 1685 an early work of biblical criticism tradition portrays moses as author of first five books of bible including book of genesis philosophers and theologians such as thomas hobbes 1588 1679 benedict spinoza 1632 1677 and richard simon 1638 1712 questioned mosaic authorship spinoza states that moses could not have written preface to deuteronomy since he never crossed jordan he points out that deuteronomy 31 9 references moses in third person and he lists multiple other inconsistencies and anomalies that led him to conclude that it was plain that these pentateuchal books were not written by moses himself jean astruc 1684 1766 a french physician believed these critics were wrong about mosaic authorship according to old testament scholar edward young 1907 1968 astruc believed that moses used hereditary accounts of hebrew people to assemble book of genesis accordingly astruc borrowed methods of textual criticism used to investigate greek and roman texts and applied them to bible in search of those original accounts astruc believed that he had identified them as separate sources that were edited together into book of genesis thus explaining genesis problems while still allowing for mosaic authorship twenty or so protestant universities in germany adopted and developed astruc s method there was a willingness among doctoral candidates to re express christian doctrine in terms of scientific method and of historical understanding common during german enlightenment circa 1750 1850 german pietism played a role in rise of biblical criticism by supporting desire to break hold of religious authority rationalism also became a significant influence in development of biblical criticism providing its concern to avoid dogma and bias through reason for example swiss theologian jean alphonse turretin 1671 1737 attacked conventional exegesis interpretation and argued for critical analysis led solely by reason turretin believed that bible could be considered authoritative even if it was not considered inerrant this has become a common modern judeo christian view johann salomo semler 1725 1791 argued for an end to all doctrinal assumptions giving historical criticism its non sectarian nature as a result semler is often called by whom father of historical critical research semler distinguished between inward and outward religion idea that for some people their religion is their highest inner purpose while for others religion is a more exterior practice a tool to accomplish other purposes more important to individual such as political or economic goals modern psychology recognizes this concept communications scholar james a herrick 1954 says even though most scholars agree that biblical criticism evolved out of german enlightenment there are also histories of biblical scholarship that have found strong direct links with british deism herrick references german theologian henning graf 1929 2010 as linking deism with humanist world view which has also been significant in biblical criticism some scholars such as gerhard ebeling 1912 2001 rudolf bultmann 1884 1976 and ernst 1906 1998 trace biblical criticism s origins to reformation three early scholars of reformation era helped to lay foundations of modern biblical criticism joachim camerarius 1500 1574 hugo grotius 1583 1645 and matthew tindal 1653 1733 camerarius advocated using context to interpret bible texts grotius paved way for comparative religion studies by analyzing new testament texts in light of classical jewish and early christian writings tindal as part of english deism asserted that jesus taught natural religion an faith that church later changed this view drove a wedge between scripture and church s claims of religious truth thumb right upright 0 8 alt oil painting of reimarus hermann samuel reimarus 1694 1768 studied

and 1778 publishing them as die fragmente eines unbekannten fragments of an unknown author over time they came to be known as wolfenbuttel fragments after library where lessing worked reimarus distinguished between what jesus taught and how he is portrayed in new testament according to reimarus jesus was a political messiah who failed at creating political change and was executed his disciples then stole body and invented story of resurrection for personal gain reimarus controversial work prompted a response from semler in 1779 der fragmente eines answering fragments of an unknown semler refuted reimarus arguments but it was of little consequence reimarus writings had already made a lasting change in practice of biblical criticism by making it clear that such criticism could exist independently of theology and of faith reimarus had shown biblical criticism could serve its own ends be governed solely by rational criteria and reject deference to religious tradition lessing contributed to field of biblical criticism by seeing reimarus writings published but he also made contributions of his own arguing that proper study of biblical texts requires knowing context in which they were written this has since become an accepted concept during this period biblical scholar johann david michaelis 1717 1791 wrote first historical critical introduction to new testament

johann philipp gabler 1753 1826 and georg lorenz bauer 1755 1806 took a different approach they used concept of myth as a tool for interpreting bible rudolf bultmann later picked up this approach and it became particularly influential in early twentieth century nineteenth century theologians richard and kendall soulen say biblical criticism reached full flower in nineteenth century becoming major transforming fact of biblical studies in modern period they note that people working at that time saw themselves as continuing aims of protestant reformation landmarks in understanding bible and its background occurred during this century with many modern concepts having their roots here for example in 1835 and again in 1845 theologian ferdinand christian baur 1792 1860 postulated a sharp contrast between apostles peter and paul since then this concept has occasioned widespread debate within topics such as pauline and new testament studies early church studies jewish law theology of grace and doctrine of justification foundations of anti jewish bias were also established in field at this time under guise of scholarly objectivity first enlightenment protestant to call for de judaizing of christianity was johann semler emancipation of reason from word of god was a primary goal of semler and enlightenment exegetes yet picture of jews and judaism found in biblical criticism of this period is colored by classic anti jewish stereotypes despite tradition s lip service to emancipation he took a stand against discrimination in society while at same time writing theology that was strongly negative toward jews and judaism he saw christianity as something new and universal that superseded all that came before it this stark contrast between judaism and christianity became a common theme along with a strong prejudice against jews and judaism in herder 1744 1803 schleiermacher 1768 1834 de wette 1780 1849 baur 1792 1860 strauss 1808 1874 1822 1889 history of religions

on bible s composition and history while lower criticism is concerned with interpreting its meaning for its readers later in 19th century discovery of ancient manuscripts revolutionized textual criticism and translation during this period bible scholar h j holtzmann 1832 1910 developed a listing of chronological order of new testament texts height of biblical criticism is also represented by history of religions school known in german as schule or alternatively religionsgeschichtliche schule this school a group of german protestant theologians associated with university of gottingen in late 19th century sought to understand judaism and christianity within their relationship to other religions of near east late nineteenth century saw first quest for historical jesus which primarily involved writing versions of life of jesus important scholars of this quest included david strauss 1808 1874 whose cultural significance lies in his contribution to weakening established authorities and whose theological significance resides in his confrontation of doctrine of christ s divinity with modern critical study of history adolf von 1851 1930 contributed to quest for historical jesus

gottingen weiss wrote his most influential work on apocalyptic proclamations of jesus it was left to albert schweitzer 1875 1965 to finish pursuit of apocalyptic jesus and to revolutionize new testament scholarship at turn of century he proved to most of that scholarly world that jesus teachings and actions were determined by his eschatological outlook he also critiqued romanticized lives of jesus as built on dubious assumptions reflecting more of life of author than jesus twentieth century thumb upright alt black and white photo of barth laughing while speaking standing at a podium

instead its re expression in terms of existential philosophy of martin heidegger 1889 1976 bultmann claimed myths are true anthropologically and existentially but not cosmologically as a major proponent of form criticism bultmann set agenda for a generation of leading new testament scholars redaction criticism was another common approach to biblical criticism used in early to mid twentieth century while form criticism divided text into small units redaction emphasized literary integrity of larger literary units discovery of dead sea scrolls at qumran in 1948 renewed interest in contributions archaeology could make to biblical studies as well as to challenges it presented to various aspects of biblical criticism new testament scholar joachim jeremias 1900 1979 used linguistics and history to describe jesus jewish environment biblical theology movement of 1950s produced a massive debate between old testament and new testament scholars over unity of bible rise of redaction criticism closed it by bringing about a greater emphasis on diversity after 1970 biblical criticism began to change radically and pervasively new criticism literary criticism developed new historicism a literary theory that views history through literature also developed biblical criticism began to apply new literary approaches such as structuralism and rhetorical criticism which concentrated less on history and more on texts themselves in 1970s new testament scholar e p sanders 1937 advanced new perspective on paul which has greatly influenced scholarly views on relationship between pauline christianity and jewish christianity in pauline epistles sanders also advanced study of historical jesus by putting jesus life in context of first century second temple judaism in 1974 theologian hans frei published eclipse of biblical narrative which became a landmark work leading to development of post critical biblical interpretation third period of focused study on historical jesus began in 1985 with jesus seminar by 1990 biblical criticism was no longer primarily a historical discipline but had instead become a group of disciplines with often conflicting interests new perspectives from different ethnicities feminist theology catholicism and judaism revealed an untapped world previously overlooked by majority of white male protestants who had dominated biblical criticism from its beginnings globalization brought different world views while other academic fields such as near eastern studies sociology and anthropology became active in biblical criticism as well these new points of view created awareness that bible can be rationally interpreted from many different perspectives in turn this awareness changed biblical criticism s central concept from criteria of neutral judgment to that of beginning from a recognition of various biases reader brings to study of texts major methods of criticism theologian david r law writes that textual source form and redaction criticism are employed together by biblical scholars old testament hebrew bible and new testament are distinct bodies of literature that raise their own problems of interpretation therefore separating these methods and addressing bible as a whole is an artificial approach that is necessary only for purpose of description textual criticism thumb upright 8 alt photo of a fragment

extant manuscripts of hebrew bible they represent every book except esther though most are fragmentary new testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work having over 5

roman historian tacitus annales and historiae each survive in only a single medieval manuscript there are a total of 476 extant non christian manuscripts dated to second century these texts were all

gospel of luke folio from codex alexandrinus contains gospel of luke with decorative a variant is simply any variation between two texts and while exact number is somewhat disputed scholars agree more texts more variants this means there are more variants concerning new testament texts than old testament texts variants are not evenly distributed throughout texts textual scholar kurt aland explains that charting variants shows new testament is 62 9 variant free many variants originate in simple misspellings or mis copying for example a scribe would drop one or more letters skip a word or line write one letter for another transpose letters and so on some variants represent a scribal attempt to simplify or harmonize by changing a word or a phrase ehrman explains scribe a will introduce mistakes which are not in manuscript of scribe b copies of text a with mistake will subsequently contain that same mistake multiple generations of texts that follow containing error are referred to as a family of texts over time texts descended from a that share error and those from b that do not share it will diverge further but later texts will still be identifiable as descended from one or other because of presence or absence of that original mistake textual criticism studies differences between these families to piece together what original looked like sorting out wealth of source material is complex so textual families were sorted into categories tied to geographical areas divisions of new testament textual families were alexandrian also called neutral text western latin translations and eastern used by antioch and constantinople forerunners of modern textual criticism can be found in both early rabbinic judaism and early church rabbis addressed variants in hebrew texts as early as ad 100 tradition played a central role in their task of producing a standard version of hebrew bible hebrew text they produced stabilized by end of second century and has come to be known as masoretic text source of christian old testament however discovery of dead sea scrolls in 1947 has created problems while 60 of dead sea manuscripts are closely related to masoretic tradition others bear a closer resemblance to septuagint ancient greek version of hebrew texts and samaritan pentateuch for textual criticism this has raised question of whether or not there is such a thing that can be considered original text thumb upright 8 left alt photo of painting of griesbach johann jakob griesbach 1745 1812 an influential german textual critic two main processes of textual criticism are recension and emendation recension is selection of most trustworthy evidence on which to base a text emendation is attempt to eliminate errors which are found even in best manuscripts despite its use of objective rules there is a subjective element involved in textual criticism textual critic chooses a reading based on personal judgment experience and common sense biblical scholar david clines gives example of amos 6 12 it reads does one plough with oxen obvious answer is yes but context of passage seems to demand a no usual reading therefore is to amend this to does one plough sea with oxen amendment has a basis in text which is believed to be corrupted but is nevertheless a matter of personal judgment all of this contributes to textual criticism being one of most contentious areas of biblical criticism as well as largest it uses specialized methodologies enough specialized terms to create its own lexicon and is guided by a number of principles yet any of these can be contested as well as any conclusions based on them and they often are for example in late 1700s textual critic johann jacob griesbach developed fifteen critical principles for determining which texts are likely oldest and closest to original one of griesbach s rules is shorter reading is preferred this was based on idea scribes were more likely to add to a text than omit from it making shorter texts more likely to be older latin scholar albert c clark challenged this in 1914 based on his study of cicero clark argued omission was a more common scribal error than addition saying a text is like a traveler who goes from one inn to another losing an article of luggage at each stop clark s claims were criticized by those who supported griesbach s principles clark responded but disagreement continued nearly eighty years later theologian and priest james took up case after close study of multiple new testament papyri he concluded clark was right some scholars have recently called to abandon older approaches to textual criticism in favor of new computer assisted methods for determining manuscript relationships in a more reliable way source criticism source criticism is search for original sources that form basis of biblical text it can be traced back to 17th century french priest richard simon in old testament studies source criticism is generally focused on identifying sources within a single text for example modern view of origins of book of genesis was first laid in 1753 by french physician jean astruc he presumed moses used ancient documents to write it so his goal was identifying and reconstructing those documents by separating book of genesis back into those original sources he discovered genesis alternates use of two different names for god while rest of pentateuch after exodus 3 omits that alternation he found repetitions of certain events such as parts of flood story that are repeated three times he also found apparent anachronisms statements seemingly from a later time than genesis was set astruc hypothesized that this separate material was fused into a single unit that became book of genesis thereby creating its duplications and parallelisms further examples of products of source criticism include its two most influential and well known theories concerning origins of pentateuch documentary hypothesis and four gospels two source hypothesis wellhausen s documentary hypothesis thumb upright 8 alt photo of head and shoulders painting of wellhausen looking directly at camera julius wellhausen one of originators of documentary hypothesis theologian antony f campbell says source criticism s most influential work is julius wellhausen s prolegomena zur geschichte prologue to history of israel 1878 which sought to establish sources of first five books of old testament wellhausen correlated history and development of those five books known as pentateuch with development of jewish faith documentary hypothesis also known as theory or wellhausen theory says pentateuch was combined out of four separate and coherent sources known as j which stands for which is spelled with a j in german e for elohist d for deuteronomist and p for priestly source old testament scholar karl graf 1815 1869 suggested p in 1866 as last stratum of wellhausen theory therefore documentary hypothesis is sometimes also referred to as graf wellhausen hypothesis later scholars inferred more sources with increasing information about their extent and inter relationship fragmentary theory was a later understanding of wellhausen produced by form criticism this theory argues that fragments of various documents and not continuous documents are sources for pentateuch this accounts for diversity but not structural and chronological consistency supplementary hypothesis can be seen as an evolution of documentary hypothesis that solidified in 1970s proponents of this view assert three sources for pentateuch with deuteronomist as oldest source and torah assembled from a central core document elohist then supplemented by fragments taken from other sources advocates of documentary hypothesis contend it accounts well for differences and duplication found in each of pentateuchal books furthermore they argue it provides an explanation for peculiar character of material labeled p which reflects perspective and concerns of israel s priests however original theory has also been heavily criticized old testament scholar ernest nicholson says that by end of 1970s and into 1990s one major study after another like a series of hammer blows rejected main claims of documentary theory and criteria on which those claims are grounded it has been criticized for its dating of sources for assuming that original sources were coherent and for assuming e and p were originally complete documents studies of literary structure of pentateuch have shown j and p used same structure and that motifs and themes cross boundaries of various sources which undermines arguments for separate origins problems and criticisms of documentary hypothesis have been brought on by such literary analysis but also by anthropological developments and by various archaeological findings such as those indicating hebrew is older than previously believed presently few biblical scholars still hold to wellhausen s documentary hypothesis in its classical form however while current debate has modified wellhausen s conclusions nicholson says for all that it needs revision and development in detail work of wellhausen remains basis for understanding pentateuch critical scholar pauline agrees stating that general contours of wellhausen s view remain with newer documentary hypothesis providing best answers to complex question of how pentateuch was formed new testament synoptic problem in new testament studies source criticism has taken a slightly different approach from old testament studies by focusing on identifying common sources of multiple texts this has revealed gospels are both products of sources and sources themselves as sources matthew mark and luke are partially dependent on each other and partially independent of each other this is called synoptic problem and explaining it is single greatest dilemma of new testament source criticism multiple theories exist to address dilemma however two theories have become predominant two source hypothesis and four source hypothesis mark is shortest of four gospels with only 661 verses but six hundred of those verses are in matthew and 350 of them are in luke some of these verses are copied verbatim most scholars agree that this indicates mark was a source for matthew and luke there is also some verbatim agreement between matthew and luke of verses not found in mark in 1838 religious philosopher christian hermann weisse developed a theory about this he postulated a hypothetical collection of jesus sayings from an additional source called q taken from which is german for source if this document existed it has now been lost but some of its material can be deduced indirectly comparing what is common to matthew and luke yet absent in mark critical scholar heinrich julius holtzmann demonstrated in 1863 probable existence of q well enough for it to be accepted as a likely second source along with mark for matthew and luke this allowed two source hypothesis to emerge as best supported of various synoptic solutions there is also material unique to each gospel this indicates additional separate sources for matthew and for luke biblical scholar b h streeter used this insight to refine and expand two source theory into a four source theory in 1925 while most scholars agree that two source theory offers best explanation for synoptic problem it has not gone without dispute synoptic seminar disbanded in 1982 reporting that its members could not agree on a single thing leading some to claim problem is unsolvable no single theory offers a complete solution there are complex and important difficulties that create challenges to every theory one example is basil christopher butler s challenge to legitimacy of two source theory arguing it contains a lachmann fallacy that says two source theory loses cohesion when it is acknowledged that no source can be established for mark form criticism form criticism began in early twentieth century when theologian karl ludwig schmidt observed that mark s gospel is composed of short units schmidt asserted these small units were remnants and evidence of oral tradition that preceded writing of gospels bible scholar richard says this most significant insight which established foundation of form criticism has never been refuted hermann gunkel 1862 1932 and martin 1883 1947 built from this insight and pioneered form criticism form criticism breaks bible down into those short units called which are then classified by genre prose or verse letters laws court archives war hymns poems of lament and so on form criticism then theorizes concerning individual pericope s sitz im leben setting in life or place in life based on their understanding of folklore form critics believed early christian communities formed sayings and teachings of jesus according to their needs their situation in life and that each form could be identified by situation in which it had been created thumb

text type setting and language that challenge several of its aspects and assumptions hoffman yair 2004 review of marvin a sweeney and ehud ben zvi eds changing face of form criticism for twenty first century 2003 review of biblical literature biblical scholar richard burridge explains general critique of form criticism came from various sources putting several areas in particular under scrutiny analogy between development of gospel and folklore needed reconsideration because of developments in folklore studies it was less easy to assume steady growth of an oral tradition in stages length of time needed for laws of oral transmission to operate was greater than taken by gospels even existence of such laws was questioned in early to mid twentieth century bultmann and other form critics said they had found oral laws of development within new testament in 1970s new testament scholar e p sanders argued against existence of such laws during latter half of twentieth century observations from field studies of cultures with existing oral traditions lent support to sanders view for example in 1978 linguists milman parry and albert bates lord observed that oral tradition does not develop in same manner as written texts writing tends to develop in a linear manner beginning with a crude first draft which is then edited bit by bit to become more polished oral tradition is more complex and multidirectional in its development religion scholar burke o long sums up contemporary view by observing that since oral tradition does not follow same developmental pattern as written texts laws of oral development cannot be arrived at by studying written texts additional challenges of form criticism have also been raised for example biblical studies scholar werner h kelber says form criticism throughout mid twentieth century was so focused toward finding each pericope s original form that it distracted from any serious consideration of memory as a dynamic force in construction of gospels or early church community tradition what kelber refers to as form criticism s astounding myopia has produced enough criticism to revive interest in memory as an analytical category within biblical criticism knierim says sitz im leben has been challenged by studies that demonstrate a text type does not automatically reveal setting another example concerns hellenistic culture that surrounded first century palestine form criticism assumed early church was heavily influenced by that culture however in 1970s e p sanders as well as gerd theissen sparked new rounds of studies that included anthropological and sociological perspectives reestablishing judaism as predominant influence on jesus paul and new testament new testament scholar n t wright says earliest traditions of jesus reflected in gospels are written from perspective of second temple judaism and must be interpreted from standpoint of jewish eschatology and apocalypticism bultmann has been personally criticized for being overly focused on heidegger s philosophy in his philosophical foundation and for working with a priori notions concerning folklore distinction between palestinian and hellenistic communities length of oral period and more that were not derived from study but were instead constructed according to a preconceived pattern for some many challenges to form criticism mean its future is in doubt bible scholar anthony j campbell says form criticism had a meteoric rise in early part of twentieth century and fell from favor toward its end for some future of form criticism is not an issue it has none but if form criticism embodies an essential insight it will continue two elements embody this insight and give it its value concern for nature of text and for its shape and structure if can be scraped away good stuff may still be there redaction criticism thumb upright 1 2 alt diagram of how much of gospels is shared and different a diagram of complexity of synoptic problem redaction is process of editing multiple sources often with a similar theme into a single document redaction critics focus on discovering how literary units were originally edited redacted into their current forms redaction criticism developed after world war ii in germany and in 1950s in england and north america and can be seen as a correlative to form criticism it is dependent on both source and form criticism because it is necessary to identify traditions before determining how redactor has made use of them however redaction criticism rejects source and form criticism s description of bible texts as mere collections of fragments where form criticism fractures biblical elements into smaller and smaller individual pieces redaction criticism attempts to interpret whole literary unit as a result redaction criticism provides a corrective to methodological imbalance of form criticism quote in see also form criticism saw synoptic writers as mere collectors and focused on sitz im leben as creator of texts redaction criticism deals more positively with gospel writers restoring an understanding of them as theologians of early church bible scholars richard and kendall soulen explain that when redaction criticism is applied to synoptic gospels it is evangelist s use disuse or alteration of traditions open to him that is in view rather than form and original setting of traditions themselves since redaction criticism was developed from form criticism it shares many of its weaknesses for example it assumes an extreme skepticism toward historicity of jesus and gospels just as form criticism does redaction criticism seeks historical community of final redactors of gospels though there is often no textual clue and its method in finding final editor s theology is flawed in new testament redaction discerns evangelist s theology by focusing and relying upon differences between gospels yet it is unclear whether every difference has theological meaning how much meaning or whether a difference is a stylistic or even an accidental change further it is not at all clear whether difference was made by evangelist who could have used already changed story when writing a gospel evangelist s theology more likely depends on what gospels have in common as well as their differences one of weaknesses of redaction criticism in its new testament application is that it assumes markan priority redaction criticism can only function when sources are already known and since redaction criticism of synoptics has been based on markan priority of two source theory if priority of matthew is ever established redaction criticism would have to begin all over again followers of other theories concerning synoptic problem such as those who support hypothesis which says matthew was written first luke second and mark third do not accept redaction criticism literary criticism thumb left upright 1 2 alt statue of northrop frye sitting on a bench at university of toronto statue of

older methods of criticism opened door for literary criticism in 1957 literary critic northrop frye wrote an analysis of bible from perspective of his literary background that used literary criticism to understand bible forms it became influential in moving biblical criticism from a historical to a literary focus by 1974 two methodologies being used in literary criticism were rhetorical analysis and structuralism rhetorical analysis divides a passage into units observes how a single unit shifts or breaks taking special note of poetic devices meter parallelism word play and so on it then charts writer s thought progression from one unit to next and finally assembles data in an attempt to explain author s intentions behind piece structuralism looks at language to discern layers of meaning with goal of uncovering a work s deep structures premises as well as purposes of author in 1981 literature scholar robert alter also contributed to development of biblical literary criticism by publishing an influential analysis of biblical themes from a literary perspective 1980s saw rise of formalism which focuses on plot structure character and themes reader response criticism which focuses on reader rather than author was put forward by old testament scholar david m gunn in 1987 new testament scholar donald guthrie highlights a flaw in literary critical approach to gospels genre of gospels has not been fully determined no conclusive evidence has yet been produced to settle question of genre and without genre no adequate parallels can be found and without parallels it must be considered to what extent principles of literary criticism are applicable validity of using same critical methods for novels and for gospels without assurance gospels are actually novels must be questioned types of literary criticism canonical criticism has both theological and literary roots its origins are found in church s views of scripture as sacred as well as in literary critics who began to influence biblical scholarship in 1940s and 1950s canonical criticism responded to two things 1 sense that biblical criticism had obscured meaning and authority of canon of scripture and 2 fundamentalism in christian church that had arisen in america in 1920s and 1930s canonical criticism does not reject historical criticism and sociological analysis but considers them secondary in

unity instead of taking them apart and focusing on isolated pieces this begins from position that scripture contains within it what is needed to understand it rather than being understandable only as product of a historically determined process canonical criticism helped literary criticism move biblical studies in a new direction by focusing on text rather than author it uses text itself needs of communities addressed by those texts and interpretation likely to have been formed originally to meet those needs canonical critic then relates this to overall canon canonical criticism is associated

criticism by looking into inner theological meaning author was trying to communicate rhetorical scholar sonja k foss says there are ten methods of practicing rhetorical criticism but each focuses on three dimensions of rhetoric authors what they use to communicate and what they are trying to communicate rhetorical criticism is systematic effort to understand message being communicated in a focused and conscious manner biblical rhetorical criticism asks how hearing texts impacted audience it attempts to discover and evaluate rhetorical devices language and methods of communication used within texts to accomplish goals of those texts phyllis trible a student of muilenburg has become one of leading practitioners of rhetorical criticism and is known for her detailed literary analysis and her feminist critique of biblical interpretation within narrative criticism critics approach scripture as story narrative criticism analyzes narratives as complete tapestries organic wholes and attends to constitutive features of narratives such as characters setting plot literary devices for example irony point of view narrator implied author and implied reader james l a glossary of new testament narrative criticism with illustrations in religions 10 3 217 1 narrative criticism began being used to study new testament in 1970s and a decade later study also included old testament however first time a published approach was labeled narrative criticism was in 1980 in article narrative criticism and gospel of mark written by bible scholar david rhoads narrative criticism has its foundations in form criticism but it is not a historical discipline it is purely literary historical critics began to recognize bible was not being studied in manner other ancient writings were studied and they began asking if these texts should be understood on their own terms before being used as evidence of something else like history it is now accepted as axiomatic in literary circles that meaning of literature transcends historical intentions of author narrative criticism embraces textual unity of canonical criticism while admitting existence of sources and redactions of historical criticism narrative critics choose to focus on artistic weaving of biblical texts into a sustained narrative picture literary scholar steven weitzman 1892 1957 has argued that narrative economy omitting comments about thoughts or emotional state of a character and narrative unity are what make text a work of art narrative critics encourage implied reader to see biblical characters as literary figures observe textual unity importance of narrator implied authorial intent and to be aware that a narrative can be interpreted in multiple ways this perspective is key auerbach says since so much in bible stories is dark and incomplete and since reader knows that god is a hidden god reader s effort to interpret it constantly finds something new to feed on there is no end for interpretation life of jesus research thumb alt painting of three crosses with jesus in center and women at his feet ernst hildebrand s 1910 painting christi depicts crucifixion of jesus crucifixion is widely regarded by historians as a real historical event quest for historical jesus also known as life of jesus research is an area of biblical criticism that seeks to reconstruct life and teachings of jesus of nazareth by critical historical methods quest began with posthumous publication of hermann reimarus effort to reconstruct an authentic historical picture of jesus instead of a theological one quest was a product of enlightenment skepticism of late eighteenth century and produced a stark division between history and theology study flourished in nineteenth century making its mark in theology of german protestant liberals they saw purpose of a historically true life of jesus as a critical force that functioned theologically against high christology established by roman catholicism centuries before after albert schweitzer s von reimarus zu wrede was published as quest of historical jesus in 1910 its title provided label for field of study for next eighty years interest languished in early twentieth century but revived in 1950s with some scholars asserting there have been three distinct quests however bible scholar stanley porter asserts that there has been one fluctuating but still continuous multifaceted quest for historical jesus from beginning by end of twentieth century a more trusting attitude towards historical reliability of sources gradually replaced enlightenment skepticism e p sanders explains that because of desire to know everything about jesus including his thoughts and motivations and because there are such varied conclusions about him it seems to many scholars that it is impossible to be certain about anything yet according to sanders we know a lot about jesus sanders view characterizes most contemporary studies reflecting this shift phrase quest for historical jesus has largely been replaced by life of jesus research lasting achievement of contemporary quest has been sensitizing scholars to jesus jewish environment

however there were also conservative protestants who accepted it william robertson smith 1846 1894 is an example of a nineteenth century evangelical who believed historical criticism was a legitimate outgrowth of protestant reformation s focus on biblical text he saw it as a necessary tool to enable intelligent churchgoers to understand bible and was a pioneer in establishing final form of supplementary hypothesis of documentary hypothesis a similar view was later advocated by primitive methodist biblical scholar a s peake 1865 1929 other evangelical protestant scholars such as edwin m

that no exegete was allowed to interpret a text to contradict church doctrine later in 1943 on fiftieth anniversary of providentissimus deus pope pius xii issued papal encyclical divino spiritu

k m adam says postmodernism is not so much a method as a stance it has three general features 1 it denies any privileged starting point for truth 2 it is critical of theories that attempt to explain totality of reality and 3 it attempts to show that all ideals are grounded in ideological economic or political self interest postmodernists are suspicious of traditional theology and neutrality of reason and emphasize relativism and indeterminacy of texts in textual criticism postmodernists reject idea of a sacred text treating all manuscripts as equally valuable feminist criticism is an aspect

standing exclusivity of christian theology as western in 1980s phyllis trible and elisabeth schussler fiorenza reframed biblical criticism itself by challenging supposed disinterest and objectivity it claimed for itself and exposing how ideological theological stances had played a critical role in interpretation feminist biblical interpreters are characterized by claim that classical models of understanding are patriarchal and therefore that makes it impossible for those models to identify true contribution of women feminist criticism embraces a reader response approach to text that includes an attitude of dissent or resistance post critical biblical interpretation shares postmodernist suspicion of non neutrality of traditional approaches but is not hostile toward theology it begins with understanding that historical biblical criticism s focus on historicity produced a distinction between meaning of what text says and what it is about what it references this produced doubts about text s veracity theologian hans frei writes that what he refers to as realistic narratives of literature including bible don t allow for such separation subject matter is identical to verbal meaning and is found in plot and nowhere else as frei puts it scripture simultaneously depicts and renders reality if any of what it talks about its subject matter is constituted by or identical with its narrative psychological biblical criticism applies psychology to biblical texts it was not until 1990s that it began to have an influence among new critical approaches bible scholar wayne rollins says goal of a psychological critical approach is to find expressions of human psyche in biblical texts it can be used in both a historical and a literary manner to examine psychological
