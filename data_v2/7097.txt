m32 is a motorway in south gloucestershire and bristol england which at roughly is one of britain s shortest it provides a link from m4 a major motorway linking london and south wales to bristol city centre and is maintained by highways england national roads body motorway was planned concurrently with m4 in 1960s and construction was complete to eastville in northeast bristol by 1970 southernmost section was delayed by engineering challenges and industrial action and did not open until 1975 since mid 2000s there have been plans to use m32 as part of a park and ride facility which would reduce congestion in bristol though m32 has a small traffic flow it is one of most congested motorways in region as it connects a number of key areas as well as providing one of few high quality routes into centre of bristol it is only significant link from m4 to a4174 bristol ring road parts of m32 are reaching end of their intended lifespan leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for remedial work local residents have criticised m32 complaining that it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level route thumb left 200px northern section of m32 connects to m4 at a modified roundabout m32 is long its northern end is at junction 19 of m4 near winterbourne down originally a grade separated roundabout junction it was modified in 1992 to remove conflicting traffic movements in order to increase capacity motorway then runs south between filton in west and frenchay in east after meeting a4174 ring road at junction 1 it crosses boundary from south gloucestershire to bristol passing to east of horfield and easton junction 2 next to eastville park meets b4469 providing access to horfield midway through a speed limit begins motorway continues further south and ends just beyond junction 3 north of st paul s a dual carriageway continues as a4032 into centre of bristol with a speed limit m32 is a trunk road therefore its maintenance and upkeep is paid for by highways england national roads authority most of road has two lanes in each direction though an extended sliproad north of junction 2 provides a climbing lane and short section between junction 1 and m4 has three lanes both ways history construction thumb left 250px southern section of m32 was last to be built and passes close to numerous housing estates m32 was planned to be a key radial link through to hub of a network of radial and ring roads within a rectangle encompassing bristol other bounds of this scheme were parts of m4 north eastern side m5 north western side and tidal reaches of river avon south western side south eastern side not being defined by landmarks motorway was partly funded by gloucestershire county council and bristol city council with a 75 per cent grant supplied by national ministry of transport it was provisionally called spur or bristol parkway during construction and was built in three distinct stages between 1966 and 1975 first section from m4 to junction 1 opened concurrently with that motorway in september 1966 second section through to junction 2 was a co operative design between gloucestershire county surveyor and design consultants freeman fox partners construction was awarded to sir robert mcalpine who began work in june 1968 northern section was designed as a full speed motorway as far as eastville after which motorway ran on an elevated section with a lower design standard this section was opened by secretary of state for transport john peyton in july 1970 total cost was ps3 million now ps million in 1972 a polystyrene storage depot on muller road near junction 2 caught fire leading to closure of southbound m32 for six days third section was most technically demanding as it ran through heavily built up urban areas and required numerous properties to be demolished along with thirteen arch viaduct near stapleton road that was built in 1874 work was delayed owing to three day week industrial action in 1974 and further because of a national builders strike during construction local government act 1972 was passed and responsibility passed to newly created avon county council in april 1974 this section and hence full extent of motorway was opened to traffic in may 1975 cost was reported to be ps10 4 million now ps million bus improvements a bus lane constructed in 2008 on southbound carriageway of a4032 newfoundland way links end of m32 at junction 3 with cabot circus it starts just south of junction 3 and runs for adjacent to central reservation and becomes a general running lane for its final to a signal controlled junction hard shoulder and remaining width of carriageway were rebuilt as two narrowed running lanes for general traffic and speed limit was reduced to in 2009 council announced that a park and ride facility would be developed next to m32 to help alleviate congestion in city centre project was expected to create 1 500 parking spaces and cost ps191 million in 2015 construction began on a bus only junction between junctions 1 and 2 on land partly allocated to stapleton allotments and near stoke park estate project is part of north fringe to hengrove metrobus rapid transit route package and involves creating new slip roads a connecting route to stoke lane and a new bridge over m32 to be completed by mid 2016 bridge was lifted into place in june which required closing m32 to all traffic traffic m32 is a relatively lightly trafficked route compared to neighbouring motorways such as m4 and m5 in 2001 average daily traffic flow was 40 400 vehicles northbound and 39 900 southbound while in 2014 combined flow for both directions averaged 75 000 vehicles despite this m32 is frequently congested as it is a popular route into centre of bristol during morning rush hour queues can tail back onto motorway from city centre in 2014 highways agency reported that m32 between junctions 1 and 2 was most unreliable motorway journey along entire m4 corridor between london and south wales with over 56 per cent of journeys taking longer than predicted problem is exacerbated whenever there is an incident on m4 around bristol as drivers attempt to use m32 as a diversion route creating further traffic and congestion m32 forms a bottleneck at its northern end as it is only link between m4 and a4174 bristol ring road in 2015 chris skidmore member of parliament for kingswood launched campaign which would see a new road running from m4 at emersons green to a4174 highways england are concerned that m32 especially its elevated sections will reach its planned end of life around 2020 urgent works were recommended on eastville viaduct in particular which had deficient surfacing barriers and lighting a speed limit was placed along viaduct while surveying work was carried out in 2016 during metrobus junction refurbishments community and environment thumb 220px m32 has been criticized for passing close to stoke park and part of estate grounds were given up for motorway m32 has been criticised for severing longstanding links in bristol older residents have claimed that formerly close knit communities such as easton have been shut off by imposing concrete barriers next to motorway it has been criticised for running alongside grounds of stoke park spoiling local atmosphere and requiring part of estate including duchess pond to be demolished in 2008 jeremy isaacs claimed motorway was a reason that bristol did not win european capital of culture award that year adding that m32 had created a concrete divide between eastville st paul s and easton local residents have complained about noise on m32 a report by department for environment food and rural affairs showed that traffic noise can be as loud as 75 decibels in neighbouring estates in 2014 a petition was created to campaign bristol city council to install quieter road surfaces and noise barriers along motorway in 2011 a council gardening scheme created a horticultural landscape next to southern end of m32 project included planting of red poppies and a spokesman said they hoped it would enhance view from motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies gardens were well received by locals and led to a city wide project called meadow bristol to grow similar meadows elsewhere junctions data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway
