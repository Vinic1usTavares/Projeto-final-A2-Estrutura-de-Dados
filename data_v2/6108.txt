1936 atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 1936 and lasted until november 30 1936 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin 1936 season was fairly active with 20 tropical cyclones including 3 tropical depressions seven storms became hurricanes of which one became a major hurricane in addition season was unusual in fact that no storms moved across large portions of caribbean sea seven storms including three hurricanes struck united states season also set many records for earliest date for a numbered storm though all were surpassed by extreme activity of 2005 season systems tropical storm one on june 9 a tropical cyclone with atmospheric pressure below made landfall on pacific coast of guatemala it moved northeastward across central america but dissipated before reaching western caribbean sea on june 12 storm quickly re organized and again developed into a tropical storm on june 12 it moved north northeastward resulting in light winds as it paralleled eastern coasts of belize and yucatan peninsula after reaching gulf of mexico with peak winds of storm turned to northeast then to east on june 15 tropical storm made landfall about to south of fort myers florida and after crossing state it passed over miami before entering atlantic ocean it weakened as it accelerated northeastward through bahamas and on june 17 system dissipated to north of bermuda while crossing central america storm produced heavy rainfall in southern florida winds from storm ranged from to a peak of in miami storm produced heavy rainfall in southern florida ranging from 8 to 15 inches 200 to 380 mm rainfall caused flooding of highways and lowlands drowned several livestock and some damage storm caused three indirect deaths when a coast guard airplane crashed in tampa bay while in search of small boats tropical storm two an area of disturbed weather was first detected near yucatan peninsula on june 18 it tracked west northwestward and developed into a tropical storm following day storm continued to west northwest until june 21 when storm turned to west southwest having remained a minimal tropical storm for all of its lifetime 40 mph 70 km h storm struck northeast mexico on june 21 and dissipated next day storm caused higher than normal tides along texas coastline and no damage or deaths were reported hurricane three a small tropical storm developed on june 26 while located east of brownsville texas it moved northwestward and rapidly strengthened almost immediately after formation similar to humberto of 2007 attaining hurricane status with peak winds of by early on june 27 later on june 27 hurricane made landfall near port aransas with a pressure of storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on june 28 near san antonio texas a small craft warning was issued for corpus christi area on morning of storm making landfall and national weather bureau issued a hurricane warning just 45 minutes prior to hurricane striking land upon making landfall storm caused a 3 8 foot 1 2 m storm tide and many small boats were capsized or driven ashore hurricane produced wind gusts of up to in ingleside and up to in port aransas destroying cooling towers at a local oil refinery and damaging a few houses along its path storm produced heavy rainfall though specifics are unknown severe crop

hurricane or strong tropical storm system quickly weakened just after moving inland and dissipated on same day hurricane brought heavy rains to mainland mexico while highest winds recorded at tampico were on august 19 as center passed nearby just to north storm warnings were issued on august 17 and 18 as system initially approached upper gulf coast of louisiana and texas but system s west

northeast hurricane reached a peak intensity of on september 21 while located about southwest of bermuda it turned to north and slowly weakened a cold front turned hurricane to northeast and system became extratropical on september 25 a short time before making landfall on southern nova scotia hours after landing extratropical remnant was absorbed by approaching cold front impact if any is unknown tropical depression a tropical depression formed in western atlantic ocean on september 25 it moved west northwestward making landfall on eastern florida before entering gulf of mexico on september 28 depression turned to northwest and struck land near apalachicola as a minimal system it dissipated over land on october 1 minimum central pressure in depression was 1006 mbar depression produced winds of up to in tarpon springs effects were minimal tropical storm sixteen an area of disturbed weather persisted across northwestern caribbean sea in early october it tracked northwestward over yucatan peninsula and subsequent to development of a low level circulation system organized into a tropical storm on october 9 while located about northwest of capital of campeche after moving

system dropped heavy rainfall across southeastern mexico though damage if any is unknown tropical storm seventeen toward end of november a cold front was moving eastward across central atlantic ocean a broad low formed on november 28 but it was not evident by two days later another low formed on december 2 to west southwest of canary islands which was an occluded low it moved to west northwest and became more tropical finally transitioning into a tropical storm by december 4 transition to a tropical cyclone was determined on ships reporting gale force winds near center although it is possible system was a subtropical cyclone instead on december 6 storm turned to west southwest and reached its peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h an approaching cold front caused storm to become extratropical early on december 7 after reaching a position to northeast of lesser antilles extratropical storm turned to northwest on december 10 later turning to northeast on december 14 a larger extratropical low absorbed storm on december 16 accumulated cyclone energy rating ace table below shows ace for each storm in season broadly speaking ace is a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by duration of its lifetime thus hurricanes that lasted a long time such as thirteen have higher aces despite high number of storms most were relatively short lived and weak and ace only suggested a near normal season ace rating is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength ace 104 kt2 storm 1 thirteen 34 1 2 eleven 25 1 3 fifteen 14 6 4 eight 7 43 5 five 6 23
