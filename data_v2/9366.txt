diffused lighting camouflage was a form of active camouflage using counter illumination to enable a ship to match its background night sky that was tested by royal canadian navy on corvettes during world war ii principle was discovered by a canadian professor edmund godfrey burr in 1940 it attracted interest because it could help to hide ships from submarines in battle of atlantic and research project began early in 1941 royal navy and us navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943 concept behind diffused lighting camouflage was to project light on to sides of a ship to make its brightness match its background projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to hull and prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell concept was never put into production though canadian prototypes did briefly see service canadian ideas were adapted by us air force in its yehudi lights project concept thumb left upright 1 5 firefly squid uses bioluminescence to counter illuminate its underside to match brighter sea surface above diffused lighting camouflage was explored by royal canadian navy rcn and tested at sea on corvettes during world war ii and later in armed forces of uk and us thumb principle of counter illumination camouflage in squid when seen from below by a predator animal s light helps to match its brightness and colour to sea surface an equivalent strategy known to zoologists as counter illumination is used by many marine organisms notably cephalopods including squid underside is covered with small photophores organs that produce light squid varies intensity of light according to brightness of sea surface far above providing effective camouflage by lighting out animal s shadow in 1940 edmund godfrey burr a canadian professor at mcgill university r c fetherstonhaugh r c 1947 pages 337 341 serendipitously stumbled on principle of counter illumination or as he called it diffused lighting camouflage burr 1947 pages 45 54 burr 1948 pages 19 35 burr had been tasked by canada s national research council nrc to evaluate night observation instruments with these he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against night sky which was never completely black burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness one night in december 1940 burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish light reflected from snow had illuminated underside of plane just enough to cancel out difference in brightness camouflaging plane perfectly burr informed nrc who told rcn they realized that technique could help to hide ships from german submarines in battle of atlantic before introduction of centimetre radar submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen diffused lighting camouflage might rcn believed redress balance prototyping royal canadian navy thumb left hmcs cobalt began secret sea trials of diffused lighting camouflage in january 1941 burr was quickly called to canada s naval services headquarters to discuss how to apply diffused lighting camouflage simple tests in laboratory served as proof of concept in january 1941 sea trials began on new corvette hmcs cobalt she was fitted with ordinary light projectors neither designed for robustness nor waterproofed on temporary supports on one side of hull brightness was controlled manually trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed

around funnel september 1941 second version with blue green filters over projectors was trialled on board corvette hmcs chambly in may 1941 this gave better results as filters removed reddish bias to lamps when at low intensity lower colour temperature supports too were retractable so delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use this second version reduced chambly s visibility by 50 in most conditions and sometimes by as much as 75 this was enough to justify development of a more robust version third version featured a photocell to measure brightness of night sky and ship s side projectors brightness was automatically controlled to balance out difference it was tested in september 1941 on corvette hmcs kamloops royal navy parallel trials of canadian diffused lighting equipment were carried out in march 1941 by royal navy on corvette hms trillium in clyde approaches admiralty report on trillium trials stated that under certain weather conditions canadian trials in spite of crude equipment used gave highly satisfactory results experience gained during present trials indicated that in various other types of weather this same equipment gave a much less conclusive indication of its value and described technical difficulties that any future version would face admiralty informed prime minister winston churchill at end of that month stating that results seem quite promising churchill replied next day suggesting that surely all this business should be pressed forward on a broader front than one ship accordingly in april 1941 admiralty ordered further development work for full scale trials british general electric company developed a manually operated diffused lighting system which was trialled on ocean boarding vessel hms largs and light cruiser hms penelope largs surface observation trials were conducted between 25 january and 6 february 1942 air observation trials using hudson bombers took place on nights of 4 5 february and 25 26 march 1942 they found an average reduction in range at which ship could be seen at night from another ship of around 25 using binoculars 33 using naked eye results from air were less conclusive best case was on exceptionally clear moonless night of 29 30 january 1942 when largs could be seen from a surface ship with naked eye at unlighted but only with her diffused lighting a 57 reduction by june 1942 royal navy commanders considered that camouflage was largely unnecessary given that enemy would be using rdf and submarine hydrophones in april 1943 admiralty decided that diffused lighting was impractical and development was halted though discussions continued with canadian navy us navy us navy trialled an automatic system made by general electric of new york on supply ship uss but halted research in 1942 us navy sent its control system and diffused lighting fittings to canada s nrc which installed it on corvettes hmcs edmundston and hmcs rimouski in 1943 and carried out further prototyping summary technical report of division 16 ndrc volume 2 visibility studies and some applications in field of camouflage washington d c office of scientific research and development national defense research committee 1946 pages 14 16 and 225 241 active service thumb canadian corvette hmcs rimouski used its diffused lighting camouflage to attack a u boat both edmundston and rimouski were fitted with about 60 light projectors those on hull were on retractable supports those on superstructure were on fixed supports each ship s diffused lighting system was tested systematically in st margaret s bay and then trialled when actually escorting atlantic convoys in 1943 experimentally diffused lighting reduced ships visibility by up to 70 but at sea electrical equipment proved too delicate and frequently malfunctioned worse system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting and canadian navy considered lighting too green in september 1943 rimouski using her diffused lighting system but also some navigation lights approached in baie des intention was to make rimouski appear as a small and inoffensive ship in an operation to trap submarine and this appears to have worked as u boat did not detect her however attack failed as a wrong signal sent from shore alerted submarine s commander kapitanleutnant schauenburg u 536 dived and escaped following allied victory in battle of atlantic through long range aircraft radar code decryption and better escort tactics need to camouflage ships from submarines greatly decreased and diffused lighting research became a low priority work was halted when war ended in aircraft thumb upright 1 3 yehudi counter illumination system of automatically adjusted forward pointing lights was trialled in b 24 liberators from 1943 onwards because submarines at surface could see dark shape of an attacking aircraft against night sky principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft however british researchers found that amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft s underside in daylight was prohibitive while externally mounted light projectors disturbed aircraft s aerodynamics an american version yehudi using lamps mounted in aircraft s nose and leading edges of wings was trialled in b 24 liberators avenger torpedo bombers and a navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945 by directing light forwards towards an observer rather than towards aircraft s skin system provided effective counter illumination camouflage with an affordable use of energy more like that of marine animals than
