that however deutsche welle found other industry observers who credited an increasingly competitive german publishing market with persuading companies to take on books they previously might not have accepted a representative from bookstore also suggested that in past companies would at least have waited longer before releasing such a sensitive book release coincided with widespread skepticism among german public about honesty and motivation of george w bush administration to extent that a survey published in die zeit in july 2003 found that nineteen percent of germans rising to thirty one percent among under 30s believed that elements within united states government were behind 9 11 attacks die zeit july 23 2003 in german results of poll are repeated in english language telegraph deutsche welle and newsweek references this provided fertile ground for cia and september 11 which sold strongly von bulow eclipsed sales of writers who clung to a conventional interpretation of 9 11 attacks such as intelligence expert oliver schrom response work has been described as supporting or fostering anti americanism however in an interview with daily telegraph von bulow denied that his book was contributing to anti american sentiment in germany book has also been attacked for quality of its journalism and research author admitted that much of material came from internet and discharged burden of proof by claiming that it was for american government to refute allegations rather than for him to prove them this produced anger among authors using more conventional journalistic methods line in sand is when respectable media and publishers start serving up fiction as truth was response of oliver schrom whose study of 9 11 attacks pointed finger at intelligence failures rather than a more spectacular claim of cia complicity cia and september 11 was one of subjects of a cover story in der spiegel in september 2003 along with gerhard wisnewski s tv documentary 11 9 and books conspiracies conspiracy theories and secrets of september 11th brockers and operation 9 11 wisnewski article entitled panoply of absurd sharply criticizes von bulow s reliance on internet research in particular that he had used archived but inaccurate stories that had been written in confusion of immediate aftermath of attacks and then dropped an example of this is assertion that at least six of suspected hijackers named in aftermath of attacks turned up alive so called zombie hijackers claim der spiegel offers an explanation for this apparent mystery bbc news used as a source arab news an english language saudi newspaper which in turn had compiled reports from arabic newspapers of people who obviously had nothing to do with attacks but happened to share same names with some of suspected hijackers no photographs of suspected hijackers had been released at this point in time and thus a few cases of mistaken identity occurred in one instance a man with name of said al ghamdi had given an interview to al newspaper in tunis outraged that he had been portrayed by cnn as one of hijackers cnn had broadcast his photograph after doing research on their own and finding a saudi said al ghamdi who had received flight training in united states cnn had found wrong suspect which only became clear once fbi officially released photographs of suspected hijackers spiegel article accuses von bulow of accepting without due scrutiny any fragment or urban legend that fits his suspicions of foul play and describes him as a dreamer however in his analysis of von bulow s book and response to it in germany stefan theil has contended that der spiegel is itself not unknown to publish speculative or conspiratorial theories and suggests that surprisingly strenuous article had deeper motivations than high feelings over journalistic quality he speculates that fact that germans who claimed to believe that george w bush masterminded 9 11 were not actually demonstrating in streets was a sign that they simply regarded conspiracy theorist literature as political entertainment with american difficulties in iraq intensifying and possibility of europe becoming dragged in politicians and journalists alike were being forced to turn away from escapism plots offered allegations of anti semitism der spiegel followed up several claims in an interview with author one of claims in book is that only one israeli citizen died in wtc attack this was reported in new york times on september 22 2001 but israeli consulate later asserted that seven israelis were among dead in wtc unraveling anti semitic 9 11 conspiracy theories anti defamation league published by institute 2003 url accessed april 6 2006 and that a number of indications exist that point to some sort of connection between israeli mossad and act and perpetrators of 9 11 however when interviewed by magazine about claim that 4 000 jewish employees did not attend work at wtc on day of attacks he avoided concrete statements they didn t know about it they had an idea an approach magazine described as convoluted it concludes that his allegations were little more than whispers in dark fueled by conspiracy myths circulating on internet mentions of theory that jews stayed away from wtc on 9 11 and idea of mossad involvement in or foreknowledge of attacks has led to claims that book feeds new anti semitism a report by american jewish committee accused book along with other so called 9 11 conspiracy literature of 2003 of perpetuating myths and stereotyping jews as criminal and conspiratorial european anti semitism reinvents itself robert s wistrich american jewish committee 2005 url accessed april 6 2005 anti defamation league has found evidence of bulow being cited by anti semitic publications and websites keen to link mossad to 9 11 attacks in a prominently placed tv interview menschen bei ard 9 9 2003 andreas von bulow said it was a media scam to accuse him of anti semitism he denied that he ever said or believed anything about jews being warned of attacks one of urban legends he said such claims were nonsense he confirmed however that in his opinion a number of
