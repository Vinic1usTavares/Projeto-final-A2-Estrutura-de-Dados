sophie armant to protestant parents at trois canons near la rochelle little is known of her life before her marriage to jean pierre blanchard world s first professional balloonist date of her marriage is unclear sources quote dates as early as 2006 p 70 1 or 1797 lynn 2006 p 132 but most state 1804 year of her first ascent blanchard had abandoned his first wife victoire lebrun and their four children to travel round europe pursuing his ballooning career and she later died in poverty variously described as blanchard s small ugly nervous wife small with sharp bird like features and later as small and beautiful walker 2004 pp 50 3 sophie was more at home in sky than on ground where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled she was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages but was fearless in air she and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 her 11th ascent possibly his 61st in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury shock apparently left her mute for a while brown 1801 pp 207 8 sophie made her first ascent in a balloon with blanchard in marseilles on 27 december 1804 couple faced bankruptcy as a result of blanchard s poor business sense and they believed a female balloonist was a novelty that might attract enough attention to solve their financial problems she described feeling as an incomparable sensation sensation incomparable sophie made a second ascent with blanchard and for her third ascent on 18 august 1805 she flew solo from garden of cloister of jacobins in toulouse michaud 1854 pp 415 6 she was not first woman balloonist on 20 may 1784 marchioness and countess of countess of and a miss de lagarde had taken a trip on a tethered balloon in paris neither was she first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon in blanchard s time citoyenne henri who had made an ascent with andre jacques garnerin in 1798 was widely credited with that ballooning first although honour actually belonged to elizabeth thible thible an opera singer had made an ascent to entertain gustav iii of sweden in lyon on 4 june 1784 fourteen years before citoyenne henri blanchard was however first woman to pilot her own balloon and first to adopt ballooning as a career walsh 1913 pp 11 12 in 1809 her husband died from injuries sustained when he fell from his balloon in hague after suffering a heart attack after his death sophie continued to make ascents specialising in night flights often staying aloft all night solo career upright thumb ascent from champ de mars 24 june 1810 sophie conducted experiments with parachutes as her husband had parachuting dogs from her balloon and as part of her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from baskets of balloons in particular family of andre jacques garnerin whose wife daughter and niece all performed regularly turgan 1851 p 170 his niece elisa garnerin was blanchard s chief rival as a female aeronaut and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or other blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself but her primary interest was in ballooning figuier 1859 p 239 couple had still been in debt at time of blanchard s death so to minimise her expenses sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon she used a hydrogen filled gas balloon or as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair and there was no requirement for volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon a hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep craft airborne having a smaller easily inflatable balloon was also important in an era when balloon riots were common and disappointed crowds were known to destroy balloons and attack aeronauts when balloons failed to go up as planned because she was small and light she was able to cut back on amount of gas used to inflate balloon sophie had used or at least owned a hot air balloon colonel francis maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for ps40 maceroni 1838 p 41 she became a favourite of napoleon and he appointed her to replace andre jacques garnerin in 1804 garnerin had disgraced himself by failing to control balloon that he had sent up to mark napoleon s coronation in paris balloon eventually drifted as far as rome where it crashed into lago di and became subject of many jokes at napoleon s expense 1857 p 499 title given to her by napoleon is unclear he certainly made her aeronaut of official festivals des fetes with responsibility for organising ballooning displays at major events but he may have also made her his chief air minister of ballooning in which role she is reported to have drawn up plans for an aerial invasion of england martin 2000 p 135 she was able to dissuade napoleon from this impractical plan by pointing out that prevailing winds over channel made such an invasion nearly impossible thumb left upright sophie makes her ascent in milan on 15 august 1811 to mark 42nd birthday of napoleon she made ascents for napoleon s entertainment on 24 june 1810 from champ de mars in paris and at celebration mounted by imperial guard for his marriage to marie louise of austria on birth of napoleon s son blanchard

accompany review of troops by napoleon s brother in law joachim murat king of naples in 1811 when louis xviii entered paris on 4 may 1814 after being restored to french throne blanchard ascended in her balloon from pont neuf as part of triumphal procession louis was so taken with her performance that he dubbed her official aeronaut of restoration peltier 1814 p 391 known throughout europe blanchard drew large crowds for her ascents in frankfurt she was apparently cause of poor reception of carl maria von weber s opera silvana on its opening night 16 september 1810 people of city flocked to see her demonstration while only a few attended opera s debut newman 1945 p 513 she gave many displays in italy in 1811 she travelled from rome to naples splitting journey in half with a stop after 60 miles 97 km and later ascended again from rome to a height of 12 000 feet 3 660 m where she claimed that she fell into a profound sleep for a while before landing at tagliacozzo select reviews 1812 p 176 in same year she again lost consciousness after having to ascend to avoid being trapped in a hailstorm near vincennes she spent 14 1 2 hours in air as a result wason 1897 p 82 sophie crossed alps by balloon shayler 2005 p 10 and on a trip to turin on 26 april 1812 temperature dropped so low that she suffered a nose bleed and icicles formed on her hands and face she almost died on 21 september 1817 when on a flight from nantes her 53rd she mistook a marshy field for a safe landing spot canopy of her balloon became caught in a tree which caused chair to tip over blanchard entangled in rigging was forced into water of marsh and would have drowned had not help arrived soon after her landing sympathising with marie therese de lamourous who was attempting to run a shelter for fallen women la misericorde in bordeaux she offered to donate proceeds from one of her ascents to venture de lamourous refused offer on grounds that she could not be cause of another risking their life yonge 1858 p 57 death thumb upright death of mme blanchard an illustration from late 19th century on 6 july 1819 tivoli gardens in paris her hydrogen filled balloon caught fire and blanchard entangled in surrounding net fell to her death blanchard had performed regularly at tivoli gardens making ascents twice a week when she was in paris she had been warned repeatedly of danger of using fireworks in her exhibitions this display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual and it appears that warnings had made an impression on her some spectators implored her not to make ascent but others eager to see show urged her on one report suggested that she finally made up her mind and stepped into her chair with words ce sera pour la derniere fois let s go this will be for last time ireland 1822 p 402 at about 10 30 p m accounts differ as to exact time blanchard began her ascent carrying a white flag and wearing a white dress and a white hat topped with ostrich plumes wind was blowing strongly and it appears balloon struggled to rise by shedding ballast blanchard managed to get some lift but balloon brushed through trees as it ascended once she had cleared treetops blanchard began display by waving her flag balloon was illuminated by baskets containing bengal fire a slow burning coloured pyrotechnic gentleman s magazine 1819 p 76 a few moments after beginning display and while still ascending balloon was seen to be in flames some reports say that balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire whatever circumstances gas in balloon was burning blanchard began to descend rapidly but balloon caught in wind continued to move off from pleasure gardens even as it went down some spectators thought these events were part of show and applauded and shouted their approval marion 1870 2004 p 99 balloon had not risen very high and although escaping gas was burning gas within balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent craft plummeting directly to ground by rapidly shedding ballast blanchard was able to slow descent most reports say she appeared to be calm during descent but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as craft approached ground rumours later circulated that she had gripped chair of her craft so tightly that several arteries had through effort mathews 1839 p 65 right thumb upright another image of her death from 1869 just above rooftops of rue de provence balloon s gas was exhausted and craft struck roof of a house it was thought likely that she would have survived had that been end of incident but ropes holding chair to body of balloon may have burnt through or impact may have thrown her forwards with result that blanchard trapped in netting of balloon pitched over side of roof into street below john poole an eyewitness described her final moments some reports credit her with crying out a moi help or literally to me as she struck roof turgan 1851 p 145 although crowds rushed to her assistance and attempts were made to save her she had either died instantly from a broken neck or at most ten minutes later most likely cause of accident seemed to be that fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended possibly balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough when she had lit fuses fireworks headed towards balloon instead of away from it one of them burned a hole in fabric igniting gas one man reportedly spotted problem and shouted to her not to light fuses but his cries were drowned out by cheering of crowd later reports suggested she had left gas valve open allowing sparks to ignite gas and set fire to balloon or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout ascent legacy norwich duff who had witnessed blanchard s ascent and accident recorded on hearing she had died proprietors of tivoli gardens immediately announced that admission fees would be donated for support of her children and some spectators stood at gates appealing to citizens of paris for donations appeal raised 2 400 francs but after collection it was discovered that she had no surviving children so money was used instead to erect a memorial topped with a representation of her balloon in flames above her grave in pere lachaise cemetery her tombstone was engraved with epitaph de son art et de son victim of her art and intrepidity remainder of money about 1 000 francs was donated to lutheran eglise des which blanchard had attended though not rich at time of her death she had cleared debts left to her by her husband and was financially secure each of her ascents had cost her around 1 000 francs not including cost of maintenance of balloon in her will she left property worth between 1 000 and 50 1820 p 651 francs to daughter of some acquaintances story of her death was recounted throughout europe jules verne mentioned her in five weeks in a balloon and in gambler fyodor dostoevsky likened thrill of committing oneself in gambling to sensation that blanchard must have felt as she fell for others her death proved a cautionary tale either as an example of a woman exceeding her station as with grenville mellen who said that it proved a woman in a balloon is either out of her element or too high in it mellen 1825 p 154 or as price of vanity for attempting such spectacular shows charles dickens commented jug goes often to well but is pretty sure to get cracked at last dickens 1853 p 488 a
