ariege river flows and northern spain near andorra two general types a small light traditional mountain horse and a taller sportier modern type are found always black in color merens must meet strict physical standards in order to be registered in stud book breed is known for its sure footedness on mountain terrain as well as for its endurance hardiness and docility french breed registry organizes regional offices and partners with other national organizations in europe to preserve and promote breed organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock with a goal of increasing quality in breed in past merens was used for farm work draft work and as pack horses today it is mainly used as a saddle horse although some members of breed have been successful in carriage driving many merens are taken on an annual transhumance seasonal migration in which they are moved higher in mountains during summer and into valleys for winter an old practice it fell into disfavor but has recently re emerged thought to have originated in prehistoric times exact early history of merens remains a mystery theories on its origins include descent from iberian horses similar to many regional mountain horses or possibly oriental horses brought to area by settlers from east small black horses from area of ariege have been recorded as early as time of julius caesar as well as being associated with charlemagne they pulled artillery for napoleon s grand army as well as being used by farmers dock workers miners and smugglers moving goods through pyrenees mountains they were frequently seen at local horse fairs and were used to breed mules in a cross with catalan donkeys by end of 19th century they had gained a reputation as light cavalry horses at same time however uncontrolled crossbreeding led to a decline in purebred population and in 1908 local agricultural society was put in charge of breed breed registry was created in 1933 and in 1948 first stud book was created under control of french national stud in second half of 20th century population sharply declined as mechanization transferred work in cavalry and agriculture to machines by 1970s merens was on verge of extinction with only 40 horses registered in stud book breed was saved by members of hippie movement who re settled in ariege mountains boosting local economy and restarting breeding programs merens also benefited from a new surge in popularity in riding horses and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded leading breeding program to be considered an example for conservation of rare breeds herd size remains relatively small however and one genetic study considers traditional type of breed to be endangered and recommends that efforts should be focused on its preservation naming merens was traditionally bred in village of merens les vals in department of ariege salies and loubes p 301 french national stud calls breed merens a name which was officially mentioned for first time in 1866 laetitia bataille a french horse breeding specialist considers use of merens incorrect and prefers names ariegeois cheval de merens or bataille 2008 pp 83 86 jean louis savignol a traditionalist breeder prefers name saying that merens refers to village and valley in which it is located not horse breed nel p 37 38 characteristics traditional merens is a small light horse well adapted to

is strong and compact with energetic movement merens like many mountain horses is calm docile and hardworking report of a comprehensive study on heritability of breed s temperament was published in idee in 2010 it is a versatile breed and very hardy able to live all year outside without suffering from weather merens are known for their endurance agility and sure footedness they require very little care and can survive on poor food even when working they are resistant to cold but react poorly to heat merens foals are often born in snow without human intervention but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age they show increased resistance to anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern consumption of which can cause bloody sweats and blood in urine in other horses thumb left head and neck of a merens breed standard for merens gives an ideal height of and a weight of desired size for stallions is and 14 1 hands for mares horses smaller than can be considered ponies for some equestrian competitions horses bred in valleys and plains are larger than those bred in mountains latter average around edwards p 251 coat is always black but may have a

close together a recurrent fault in mountain horses feet are large and well formed allowing horses to go without shoes there is abundant feathering on lower legs registration in france breed is organized by sherpa syndicat des de la race union of horse breeders of ariege pyrenees in la bastide de which has about 400 members and 600 horses in stud book sherpa unites eleven regional offices whose purpose is to organize merens breeders and enthusiasts role of sherpa is to decide overall direction of breed in partnership with french national stud it promotes merens at fairs national shows and international exhibitions as well as publishing newsletters and breeder lists sherpa also organizes annual breed show in bouan only purebred merens may be registered in breed stud book selection of stallions is rigorous based on tests at age of three bataille p 86 breeding goal is to produce horses with ideal conformation and good character gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions and during three year old inspections they must perform a dressage test a cross country jumping test a test on longe line and a physical inspection merens has one of most stringent inspection procedures and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in quality of breed mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by french national stud french breeding of merens is divided between two schools of thought first is traditional breeders seeking to preserve original type that of a light draft horse living high in mountains year round and retaining hardiness for which breed is known second comes from conversion of merens to a leisure horse in 1980s and aims to transform physical type of breed into a more sports oriented horse to ensure survival of breed this dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of breed several countries besides france have populations of merens and a few have breed registries and stud books that are recognized by french in italy merens is only foreign breed among breeds of limited distribution recognised by aia national breeders association merens are found mostly in northwestern italy in provinces of cuneo and turin but has spread to other mountain regions such as valleys of bergamo and trento italian breed registry for merens is based in cuneo a belgian non profit organization has been organizing breed in that country since june 2005 and was recognized as an official stud book by belgian ministry of agriculture in august 2006 an agreement has been signed with french breed registry to recognize belgian stud book as a daughter organization merens are also present in netherlands switzerland and germany where there are recognized stud books and active breeding populations there are some merens in czech republic and members of breed have also been exported to india and tunisia transhumance thumb right a mare and foal grazing in their mountain homeland department of ariege is known for annual transhumance seasonal migration of cattle sheep and horses including many members of merens breed each year in june hundreds of horses are moved to summer pastures at around in altitude where they live in a semi feral state traveling on steep mountain paths and weathering storms and other climactic variations in october they return to valleys for winter an old tradition transhumance fell out of favor but has been reintroduced to ariege by association en since 2000 association has worked with local horse breeders to promote return to annual practice around 500 merens make transhumance each year nel p 38 herds are usually led by an experienced mare marked with a bell as is done with cattle a stallion can accompany mares with foals to maintain cohesion of herd and prevent it from mixing with other herds on mountain slopes behavior of herds is midway between that of feral horses and domesticated horses who are around humans year round some horses raised high in mountains stay there year round and do not perform transhumance history thumb right department of ariege in pyrenees mountains history of merens is closely linked to its homeland in pyrenees as evidenced by many myths and legends in which it plays a role vidal saint andre and gasc p 9 origins of merens are very old and are commonly said to be lost in mists of time it is native to upper valley of ariege near andorra bataille 2008 p 84 direct ancestor of merens was probably in this valley during quaternary period approximately 15 000 years ago these wild horses probably moved to mountains to escape global warming that accompanied end of last glacial period collective p 48 physical characteristics of merens are result of harsh mountain environment where they live and they are reminiscent of horses in cave drawings at made some 13 000 years ago these images depict animals with dense coats and a skull shaped like modern merens with a beard like protrusion of hair under jawbone edwards p 250 merens may be of iberian origin as are most breeds from area of pyrenees it resembles norwegian dole gudbrandsdal and british fell and dales ponies unlike latter merens has never been crossed with friesian horse another theory of origin for merens is based on straight or concave facial profile which distinguishes them from convex profiled iberian horses and asserts that they are descended from oriental horses brought to ariege by settlers from east centre national p 116 with isolation of their mountain homeland merens has undergone very little intermingling with foreign breeds antiquity and middle ages thumb right a view of fortress of chateau de montsegur julius caesar mentions small black horses that resemble merens in his commentarii de bello gallico commentaries on gallic war when discussing defeat of crassus by sotiates and their cavalry centre national p 118 historian paul prunet was first to link animals discussed by caesar to merens in vidal saint andre and gasc p 11 although relationship has not been definitely established centre national p 124 location of sotiates is subject of controversy with some authors placing them in district of and others near foix vidal saint andre and gasc p 11 merens may have been used as a pack animal by romans who may have taken some of animals with them when they left small black horse from pyrenees is described throughout antiquity there are also several mentions of what may be merens during middle ages they have been associated with charlemagne vidal saint andre and gasc p 12 and a carolingian statue showing charlemagne on a small horse has been examined and shown that animal resembles a merens standing no more than at shoulder legend of founding of l hospitalet pres l depicts a traveler who exhausted by cold kills his horse and buries himself in steaming bowels swearing that he will build a small hospital in place if he survives vidal saint andre and gasc p 16 local cathars held a special place in their religion for horses especially through their belief in transmigration of souls vidal saint andre and gasc pp 18 19 there was also a belief in that knights took their horses with them when they died vidal saint andre and gasc p 19 in 12th century cathar princess of foix climbed to fortress of chateau de montsegur on back of a small sure footed black horse centre national p 115 in 14th century same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying armies of gaston iii count of foix 18th and 19th centuries horses from ariege were requisitioned for napoleon s grand army during his russian campaign they were used mainly to pull artillery as were most horses of this type from french territory at beginning of 19th century a popular legend has them becoming famous during crossing of berezina river during battle of berezina vidal saint andre and gasc p 20 thumb left a painting of napoleon s crossing of berezina showing many horses used by army merens has long been used as a delivery and courier horse as well as being used by local farmers it has also been used by winemakers of languedoc gardeners and dock workers as well as continuing to be used by french armies who appreciated its endurance breed was used in mines both under saddle and in harness it was used by smugglers moving goods through mountains between france and spain mainly carrying wood and minerals and was known for its endurance and sense of direction merens horses were sold at sur ariege horse fair and were popular with merchants from large cities breed was sometimes called after town and was famous for high quality of its legs and ability to survive on poor food it was used to breed mules and pyrenees mule was derived from a cross between catalan donkeys and horses of breton merens and other breeds before world war i almost 1 000 pyrenees mules were born annually in ariege department first breed show was organized in 1872 by end of 19th century horses from pyrenees were known for their use as light cavalry they were praised for their agility sure footedness robust constitutions and endurance a result of their semi feral existence in pyrenees mountains 20th century starting late 19th century uncontrolled crossbreeding created a decline in population of purebred merens salies and loubes p 300 by early 20th century some breeders in l hospitalet and merens les vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to original merens these breeders wanted to keep alive traditional merens which they valued for its hardiness and versatility in 1908 control of breeding was given to president of societe d agriculture de l ariege agricultural society of ariege gabriel lamarque who was dedicated to preservation of breed in 1933 syndicat d du merens breeding society of merens was created and in 1948 first stud book was created under control of french national stud collective p 39 in 1946 french army ceased to use merens for drawing artillery in mountains and this corresponded to beginning of decline of breed population fell dramatically during second half of 20th century due to modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture in 1950 in senegal merens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than native m bayar but breeding program was not enough to significantly increase merens population use of merens in agriculture continued into 1970s and like many french draft breeds it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat collective p 49 mountains of ariege acted as a sanctuary preventing merens as well as other breeds such as gascon cattle and sheep from disappearing completely chevalier by early 1970s however merens was on verge of extinction by early 1970s there remained only 40 merens horses registered in breed studbook breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse as part of hippie movement people wanting to live on fringe of society settled in small villages of ariege they boosted local economy including encouraging resumption of breeding of merens at same time story of semi feral horse became a local phenomenon vidal saint andre and gasc p 22 this merens orphaned following an accident was raised on bottle fed goat milk he was then sold to a horse dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion he died at twenty having returned to his herd high in mountains vidal saint andre and gasc p 24 thumb left a merens presented in sidesaddle equipment at haras de cluny in 2011 meanwhile merens breed was revived as a fashionable animal of leisure by lucien lafont de a national expert in horse breeding he moved efforts of farmers towards breeding sport pony style animals and breed originally called merens horse was renamed merens pony for commercial and administrative reasons chevalier p 75 with good breeding management and promotion population numbers of breed gradually recovered between 1975 and 1985 number of merens doubled from 2 000 to 4 000 animals and its rescue is considered a good example of saving an endangered breed in 1977 merens was introduced to island of reunion where its breeding is now part of local economy it is used as a saddle horse and for hauling breed is also used for equestrian tourism on mountains of island where it is particularly well suited for steep terrain and climate taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash a national center for breeding of merens was open in 1990 by sherpa to offer support for preservation of breed collective p 50 equestrian center includes a living museum for presentation of breed in 1997 sherpa offered a merens to then prime minister of britain tony blair on january 1 1998 merens was removed from classification of pony and returned to category of horse by french national stud in 2000 merens breed was chosen by jean louis savignol to launch first breeding farm for certified organic horses intended for leisure use rather than human consumption horses are fed a natural diet with a mixture of garlic and clay treated using a combination of homeopathy and osteopathy and moved high in mountains during transhumance each year present today merens closest to original type and lifestyle are found in valleys of high mountains of pyrenees near andorra majority of merens breeding still takes place in ariege traditional homeland of breed however they can also be found in almost all regions of france including alps cevennes centre massif central and ile de france besides annual breed show in bouan merens are also commonly seen at paris international agricultural show and other major horse shows total herd size is relatively small population numbers stabilized somewhat at beginning of 21st century with around 1500 broodmares 150 active stallions and 500 births per year in 2006 455 new foals were registered 1 051 mares and 89 stallions were listed as active breeding stock and there were 306 breeders a term applied to anyone who has at least one active broodmare in same year merens made up 2 percent of total horses in france a genetic study in 2008 considers original type of breed to be endangered author suggested that merens should be a conservation priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among french horse breeds uses thumb right merens in harness in past merens horses were used for farm work particularly on steep or difficult terrain as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges today following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type they are used principally as saddle horses especially for trekking in mountainous areas but have also proved successful in carriage driving some have been used for vaulting dressage show jumping and three day eventing merens is now considered a multi purpose recreational horse that is also attached to cultural identity of ariege region they are used for leisure and competitive trail riding they are consistently ranked in french national competitive trail riding championships and in 1998 a merens finished second in european championships in 1998 stephane bigot made a crossing of pyrenees on a merens many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides through mountains of ariege on merens horses with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of breed several equine therapy centers use merens in their program other uses for breed include various agricultural work including logging where sure footed mountain horses can be used to access areas where equipment cannot go mounted police sometimes use merens a few are bred for their milk which can be used in manufacture of various products notes
