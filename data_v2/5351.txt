taken to bombay for further treatment and once he was completely recovered shooting could be resumed scene that was to be filmed showed rohitashva bhalchandra s character dead on a funeral pyre resuming outdoor shoot after bhalchandra s recovery would have delayed production and incurred costs to avoid both phalke stoically decided to shoot scene with unconscious bhalchandra as in legends of
