imperial succession augustus was born gaius octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of plebeian gens octavia his maternal great uncle julius caesar was assassinated in 44 bc and octavius was named in caesar s will as his adopted son and heir along with mark antony and marcus lepidus he formed second triumvirate to defeat assassins of caesar following their victory at battle of

and stripped of his position and antony committed suicide following his defeat at battle of actium by octavian in 31 bc after demise of second triumvirate augustus restored outward facade of free republic with governmental power vested in roman senate executive magistrates and legislative assemblies in reality however he retained his autocratic power over republic as a military dictator by law augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by senate including supreme military command and those of tribune and censor it took several years for augustus to develop framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule he rejected monarchical titles and instead called himself princeps civitatis first citizen of state resulting constitutional framework became known as principate first phase of roman empire augustus dramatically enlarged empire annexing egypt dalmatia pannonia noricum and raetia expanding possessions in africa and

senators and 2 000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and for those who failed to escape their lives this decree issued by triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay salaries of their troops for upcoming conflict against caesar s assassins marcus junius brutus and gaius cassius longinus scullard 1982 164 rewards for their arrest gave incentive for romans to capture those proscribed while assets and properties of those arrested were seized by triumvirs eck 2003 16 contemporary roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for proscriptions and killing however sources agree that enacting proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies scott 1933 19 20 marcus velleius paterculus asserted that octavian tried to avoid officials whereas lepidus and antony were to blame for initiating them cassius dio defended octavian as trying to spare as many as possible whereas antony and lepidus being older and involved in politics longer had many more enemies to deal with this claim was rejected by appian who maintained that octavian shared an equal interest with lepidus and antony in eradicating his enemies scott 1933 20 suetonius said that octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials but did pursue his enemies with more vigor than other triumvirs plutarch described proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among antony lepidus and octavian for example octavian allowed proscription of his ally cicero antony proscription of his

means to belittle octavian as both battles were decisively won with use of antony s forces in addition to claiming responsibility for both victories antony also branded octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to marcus vipsanius agrippa instead eck 2003 17 18 after philippi a new territorial arrangement was made among members of second triumvirate gaul and province

macedonian campaign whom triumvirs had promised to discharge tens of thousands who had fought on republican side with brutus and cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of octavian if not appeased and they also required land there was no more government controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers so octavian had to choose one of two options alienating many roman citizens by confiscating their land or alienating many roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in roman heartland octavian chose former eck 2003 18 19 there were as many as eighteen roman towns affected by new settlements with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions eck 2003 19 rebellion and marriage alliances there was widespread

meanwhile octavian asked for a divorce from clodia pulchra daughter of fulvia mark antony s wife and her first husband publius clodius pulcher he returned clodia to her mother claiming that their marriage had never been consummated fulvia decided to take action together with lucius antonius she raised an army in italy to fight for antony s rights against octavian lucius and fulvia took a

conflict proved untenable for both octavian and antony however their centurions who had become important figures politically refused to fight due to their caesarian cause while legions under their command followed suit meanwhile in sicyon antony s wife fulvia died of a sudden illness while antony was en route to meet her fulvia s death and mutiny of their centurions allowed two remaining

octavian as a despot at same time octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among roman generals and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever his

still controlled north africa an important regional producer of grain as well as illyria and macedonia two strategic regions with several legions however senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls compared to twenty legions under control of octavian and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to octavian

augustus on 16 january 27 bc senate gave octavian new titles of augustus and princeps eck 2003 50 augustus is from latin word augere meaning to increase and can be translated as illustrious one it was a title of religious authority rather than political authority his new title of augustus was also more favorable than romulus previous one which he styled for himself in reference to story of

avoid eck 2003 149 title princeps senatus originally meant member of senate with highest precedence but in case of augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge eck 2003 3 149 augustus also styled himself as imperator caesar divi filius commander caesar son of deified one with this title he boasted his familial link to deified julius caesar and use of imperator

others to achieve what was still nominally preeminent position in roman state wells p 51 further he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew marcus claudius marcellus follow in

his consulship only other times augustus would serve as consul would be in years 5 and 2 bc eder 2005 26 both times to introduce his grandsons into public life this was a clever ploy by augustus ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain consular position while allowing augustus to exercise wider patronage within senatorial class although augustus had resigned as consul he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout empire this desire as well as marcus primus affair led to a second compromise between him and senate known as second settlement eck 2003 57 primary reasons for second settlement primary reasons for second settlement were as follows first after augustus relinquished annual consulship he was no longer in an official position to rule state yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his roman imperial provinces where he was still a proconsul gruen 2005 37 when he annually held office of consul he had power to intervene with affairs of other provincial proconsuls appointed by senate throughout empire when he deemed necessary eck 2003 56 57 a second problem later arose showing need for second settlement in what became known as marcus primus affair southern p 109 holland p 299 in late 24 or early 23 bc charges were brought against marcus primus

told trial that his client had received specific instructions from augustus ordering him to attack client state southern p 108 later primus testified that orders came from recently deceased marcellus holland p 300 such orders had they been given would have been considered a breach of senate s prerogative under constitutional settlement of 27 bc and its aftermath i e before augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius as macedonia was a senatorial province under senate s jurisdiction not an imperial province under authority of augustus such an action would have ripped away veneer of republican restoration as promoted by augustus and exposed his fraud of merely being first citizen a first among equals even worse involvement of marcellus provided some measure of proof that augustus s policy was to have youth take his place as princeps instituting a form of monarchy accusations that had already played out thumb upright augustus as jove holding a scepter and orb first half of 1st

augustus replied that he came in public interest syme p 333 holland p 300 southern p 108 although primus was found guilty some jurors voted to acquit meaning that not everybody believed augustus s testimony an insult to august one wells p 53 raaflaub p 426 second constitutional settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize augustus s legal authority to intervene in senatorial provinces senate granted augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare or proconsular imperium power that applied throughout empire not solely to his provinces moreover senate augmented augustus s proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius or proconsular imperium applicable throughout empire that was more maius or greater than that held by other proconsuls this in effect gave augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in empire augustus stayed in rome during renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 bc additional powers during second settlement augustus was also granted power of a tribune tribunicia potestas for life though not official title of tribune for some years augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas immunity given to a tribune of plebs now he decided to assume full powers of magistracy renewed annually in perpetuity legally it was closed to patricians a status that augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by julius caesar gruen 2005 36 this power allowed him to convene senate and people at will and lay business before them to veto actions of either assembly or senate to preside over elections and to speak first at any meeting eck 2003 57 58 also included in augustus s tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for roman censor these included right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in public interest as well as ability to hold a census and determine membership of senate eck 2003 59 with powers of a censor augustus appealed to virtues of roman patriotism by banning all attire but classic toga while entering forum eder 2005 30 there was no precedent within roman system for combining powers of tribune and censor into a single position nor was augustus ever elected to office of censor bunson 1994 80 julius caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising morals of state however this position did not extend to censor s ability to hold a census and determine senate s roster office of tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to augustus s amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring praetorship bunson 1994 427 thumb head of augustus as pontifex maximus roman artwork of late augustan period last decade of 1st century bc augustus was granted sole imperium within city of rome itself in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life traditionally proconsuls roman province governors lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed pomerium sacred boundary of rome and entered city in these situations augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul that would mean that when he was in city he might not be constitutional magistrate with most authority thanks to his prestige or auctoritas his wishes would usually be obeyed but there might be some difficulty to fill this power vacuum senate voted that augustus s imperium proconsulare maius superior proconsular power should not lapse when he was inside city walls all armed forces in city had formerly been under control of urban praetors and consuls but this situation now placed them under sole authority of augustus eck 2003 60 in addition credit was given to augustus for each subsequent roman military victory after this time because majority of rome s armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by augustus through legatus who were deputies of princeps in provinces moreover if a battle was fought in a senatorial province augustus s proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of or credit for any major military victory this meant that augustus was only individual able to receive a triumph a tradition that began with romulus rome s first king and first triumphant general lucius cornelius balbus was last man outside augustus s family to receive this award in 19 bc eck 2003 61 tiberius augustus s eldest stepson by livia was only other general to receive a triumph for victories in germania in 7 bc eck 2003 117 conspiracy thumb left a colossal statue of augustus from of herculaneum seated and wearing a laurel wreath many of political subtleties of second settlement seem to have evaded comprehension of plebeian class who were augustus s greatest supporters and clientele this caused them to insist upon augustus s participation in imperial affairs from time to time augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 bc and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by aristocratic senate in 22 21 and 19 bc people rioted in response and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years ostensibly to leave other position open for augustus dio 54 1 6 10 likewise there was a food shortage in rome in 22 bc which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee crisis after a theatrical display of refusal before senate augustus finally accepted authority over rome s grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium and ended crisis almost immediately it was not until ad 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted augustus to establish a praefectus annonae a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for rome eck 2003 78 there were some who were concerned by expansion of powers granted to augustus by second settlement and this came to a head with apparent conspiracy of fannius caepio some

republican government continued with an effective cover up of events holland p 301 in 19 bc senate granted augustus a form of general consular imperium which was probably imperium maius like proconsular powers that he received in 23 bc like his tribune authority consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold in addition augustus was allowed to wear consul s insignia in public and before senate as well as to sit in symbolic chair between two consuls and hold fasces an emblem of consular authority gruen 2005 43 this seems to have assuaged populace regardless of whether or not augustus was a consul importance was that he both appeared as one before people and could exercise consular power if necessary on 6 march 12 bc after

released memoirs of achievements known as res gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors eck 2003 93 augustus also promoted ideal of a superior roman civilization with a task of ruling world to extent to which romans knew it a sentiment embodied in words that contemporary poet virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of augustus tu imperio romane memento roman remember by your strength to rule earth s peoples impulse for expansionism was apparently prominent among all classes at rome and it is accorded divine sanction by virgil s jupiter in book 1 of aeneid where jupiter

toward his sister s son marcellus who had been quickly married to augustus s daughter julia elder eck 2003 114 115 other historians dispute this due to augustus s will being read aloud to senate while he was seriously ill in 23 bc eck 2003 115 instead indicating a preference for marcus agrippa who was augustus s second in charge and arguably only one of his associates who could have controlled legions and held empire together after death of marcellus in 23 bc augustus married his daughter to agrippa this union produced five children three sons and two daughters gaius caesar lucius caesar

fabrication made by those who had favoured postumus as heir or other of tiberius s political enemies livia had long been target of similar rumors of poisoning on behalf of her son most or all of which are unlikely to have been true alternatively it is possible that livia did supply a poisoned fig she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that augustus is said to have enjoyed but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder augustus s health had been in decline in months immediately before his death and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power having at last reluctantly settled on tiberius as his choice of heir eck 2003 123 it is likely that augustus was not expected to return alive from nola but it seems that his health improved once there it has therefore been speculated that augustus and livia conspired to end his life at anticipated time having committed all political process to accepting tiberius in order to not endanger that

in 23 bc for instance matters might have turned out differently attrition of civil wars on old republican oligarchy and longevity of augustus therefore must be seen as major contributing factors in transformation of roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years augustus s own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts he directed future of empire down many lasting paths from existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near frontiers to dynastic principle so often employed in imperial succession to embellishment of capital at emperor s expense augustus s ultimate legacy was peace and prosperity empire enjoyed for next two centuries under system he initiated his memory was enshrined in political ethos of imperial age as a paradigm of good emperor every emperor of rome adopted his name caesar augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title augustan era poets virgil and horace praised augustus as a defender of rome an upholder of moral justice and an individual who bore brunt of responsibility in maintaining empire kelsall 1976 120 however for his rule of rome and establishing principate augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout ages contemporary roman jurist marcus d ad 10 11 fond of days of pre augustan republican liberty in which he had been born openly criticized augustan regime in beginning of his annals roman historian tacitus c 56 c 117 wrote that augustus had cunningly subverted republican rome into a position of slavery he continued to say that with

benign moderate ruler yet like most other historians after death of augustus dio viewed augustus as an autocrat poet marcus annaeus ad 39 65 was of opinion that caesar s victory over pompey and fall of cato younger 95 bc 46 bc marked end of traditional liberty in rome historian chester g starr jr writes of his avoidance of criticizing augustus perhaps augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly anglo irish writer jonathan swift 1667 1745 in his discourse on contests and in athens and rome criticized augustus for installing tyranny over rome and likened what he believed great britain s virtuous constitutional monarchy to rome s moral republic of 2nd century bc in his criticism of augustus admiral and historian thomas gordon 1658 1741 compared augustus to puritanical tyrant oliver cromwell 1599 1658 kelsall 1976 118 thomas gordon and french political philosopher montesquieu 1689 1755 both remarked that augustus was a coward in battle kelsall 1976 119 in his memoirs of court of

public revenue reforms had a great impact on subsequent success of empire augustus brought a far greater portion of empire s expanded land base under consistent direct taxation from rome instead of exacting varying intermittent and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as augustus s predecessors had done this reform greatly increased rome s net revenue from its territorial acquisitions stabilized its flow and regularized financial relationship between rome and provinces rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute eck 2003 83 84 measures of taxation in reign of augustus were determined by population census with fixed quotas for each province citizens of rome and italy paid indirect taxes while direct taxes were exacted from provinces indirect taxes included a 4 tax on price of slaves a 1 tax on goods sold at auction and a 5 tax on inheritance of estates valued at over 100 000 sesterces by persons other than next of kin

farming which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors private contractors who collected taxes for state were norm in republican era some of them were powerful enough to influence number of votes for men running for offices in rome these tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations great private wealth and right to tax local areas use of egypt s immense land rents

maintain its lucrative seaports this position became highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming prefect of praetorian guard bunson 1994 145 highly productive agricultural land of egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions during his reign circus games resulted in killing of 3 500 elephants month of august month of august latin augustus is named after augustus until his time it was called sextilis named so because it had been sixth month of original roman calendar and latin word for six is sex commonly repeated lore has it that august has 31 days because augustus wanted his month to match length of julius caesar s july but this is an invention of 13th century scholar johannes de sacrobosco sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed and it was not chosen for its length see julian calendar according to a senatus consultum quoted by macrobius sextilis was renamed to honor augustus because several of most significant events in his rise to power culminating in fall of alexandria fell in that month macrobius saturnalia 1 12 35 building projects thumb

in 12 bc a solution had to be found in maintaining rome s water supply system this came about because it was overseen by agrippa when he served as aedile and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense in that year augustus arranged a system where senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of water supply and to ensure that rome s aqueducts did not fall into disrepair eck 2003 79 in late augustan era commission of five senators called curatores locorum translated as supervisors of public property was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of state cult augustus created senatorial group of curatores translated as supervisors for roads for upkeep of roads this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs eck 2003 81 corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient greece was dominant architectural style in age of augustus and

his biographer suetonius writing about a century after augustus s death described his appearance as unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life though he cared nothing for personal adornment he was so far from being particular about dressing of his hair that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at same time and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved while at very same time he would either be reading or writing something he had clear bright eyes his teeth were wide apart small and ill kept his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden his eyebrows met his ears were of moderate size and his nose projected a little at top and then bent ever so slightly inward his complexion was between dark and fair he was short of stature although julius his freedman and keeper of his records says that he was five feet and nine inches just under 5 ft 7 in or 1 70 meters in modern height measurements but this was concealed by fine proportion and symmetry of his figure and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him suetonius augustus 79 translated by j c rolfe adding that his shoes were somewhat high soled to
