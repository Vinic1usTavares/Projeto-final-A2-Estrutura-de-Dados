paracetamol poisoning also known as acetaminophen poisoning is caused by excessive use of medication paracetamol acetaminophen most people have few or non specific symptoms in first 24 hours following overdose these include feeling tired abdominal pain or nausea this is typically followed by a couple of days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin blood clotting problems and confusion occurs as a result of liver failure additional complications may include kidney failure pancreatitis low blood sugar and lactic acidosis if death does not occur people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death paracetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as an attempt to end one s life risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism malnutrition and taking of certain other medications liver damage results not from paracetamol itself but from one of its metabolites n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi napqi decreases liver s glutathione and directly damages cells in liver diagnosis is based on blood level of paracetamol at specific times after medication was taken these values are often plotted on rumack matthew nomogram to determine level of concern treatment may include activated charcoal if person seeks medical help soon after overdose attempting to force person to vomit is not recommended if there is a potential for toxicity antidote acetylcysteine is recommended medication is generally given for at least 24 hours psychiatric care may be required following recovery a liver transplant may be required if damage to liver becomes severe need for transplant is often based on low blood ph high blood lactate poor blood clotting or significant hepatic encephalopathy with early treatment liver failure is rare death occurs in about 0 1 of cases paracetamol poisoning was first described in 1960s rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of world in united states more than 100 000 cases occur a year in united kingdom it is medication responsible for greatest number of overdoses young children are most commonly affected in united states and united kingdom paracetamol is most common cause of acute liver failure signs and symptoms signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases first phase begins within hours of overdose and consists of nausea vomiting a pale appearance and sweating however patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in first 24 hours of poisoning rarely after massive overdoses patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in course of poisoning second phase occurs between 24 h and 72 h following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage in general damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize paracetamol individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function international normalized ratio inr and liver transaminases alt and ast rise to abnormal levels acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase typically caused by either syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in some cases acute kidney failure may be primary clinical manifestation of toxicity in these cases it has been suggested that toxic metabolite is produced more in kidneys than in liver third phase follows at 3 to 5 days and is marked by complications of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects low blood sugar kidney failure hepatic encephalopathy brain swelling sepsis multiple organ failure and death if third phase is survived liver necrosis runs its course and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on dose and whether appropriate treatment is received cause toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable in general recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity in adults single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg kg of bodyweight whichever is lower have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times normal value it is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days in adults a dose of 6 grams a day over preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity while in children acute doses above 200 mg kg could potentially cause toxicity acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment with chronic larger than normal doses being major cause of toxicity in children intentional overdosing self poisoning with suicidal intent is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity in a 2006 review paracetamol was most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing in rare individuals paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use this may be due to individual idiosyncratic differences in expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol see paracetamol s metabolism risk factors a number of factors can potentially increase risk of developing paracetamol toxicity chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce cyp2e1 thus increasing potential toxicity of paracetamol in one study of patients with liver injury 64 reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day while 35 took 60 grams a day or less whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists for chronic alcohol users acute alcohol ingestion at time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect for non chronic alcohol users acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect fasting is a risk factor possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves concomitant use of cyp2e1 inhibitor isoniazid increases risk of hepatotoxicity though whether induction is related to hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear concomitant use of other drugs that induce cyp enzymes such as including carbamazepine phenytoin and barbiturates have also been reported as risk factors pathophysiology thumb left upright 1 2 main pathways of paracetamol metabolism click to enlarge pathway leading to napqi is shown in red when taken in normal therapeutic doses paracetamol has been shown to be safe following a therapeutic dose it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via phase ii metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide with a small portion being oxidized via cytochrome p450 enzyme system metabolism of acetaminophen paracetamol and and 3a4 convert approximately 5 of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi under normal conditions napqi is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and acid conjugates in cases of paracetamol overdose sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated and more paracetamol is shunted to cytochrome p450 system to produce napqi as a result hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted as demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration napqi therefore remains in its toxic form in liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules resulting in widespread damage and death leading to acute liver necrosis in animal studies liver s stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70 of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs diagnosis thumb upright 1 4 rumack matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150 a person s history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for diagnosis most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level a drug nomogram developed in 1975 called rumack matthew nomogram estimates risk of toxicity based on serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion to determine risk of potential hepatotoxicity paracetamol level is traced along nomogram use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on nomogram appears to be best marker indicating potential for liver injury a paracetamol level drawn in first four hours after ingestion may underestimate amount in system because paracetamol may still be in process of being absorbed from gastrointestinal tract therefore a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days although in severe cases it may be evident in 12 hours right upper quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated ast alt bilirubin and prolonged coagulation times particularly an elevated prothrombin time after paracetamol overdose when ast and alt exceed 1000 iu l paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed in some cases ast and alt levels can exceed 10 000 iu l detection in body fluids paracetamol may be quantified in blood plasma or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg l which equals 200 umol l levels of 30 300 mg l 200 2000 umol l are often observed in overdose patients postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 400 mg l in persons dying due to acute overdosage automated colorimetric techniques gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for laboratory analysis of drug in physiological specimens r baselt disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man 9th edition biomedical publications seal beach ca 2011 pp 9 12 prevention limitation of availability limiting availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries in uk sales of over counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500 mg tablets in pharmacies and 16 x 500 mg tablets in non pharmacy outlets pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at pharmacist s discretion in ireland limits are 24 and 12 tablets respectively subsequent study suggests that reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose one suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription only medicine or to remove it entirely from market however overdose is a relatively minor problem for example 0 08 of uk population over 50 thousand people present with paracetamol overdose each year in contrast paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people in addition alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose whereas non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use combination with other agents one strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote was a tablet sold in uk which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg methionine an amino acid formerly used in treatment of paracetamol overdose there have been no studies so far on effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote acetylcysteine calcitriol active metabolite of vitamin d3 appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42 increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol mg to 41 nmol mg 24 and 48 hours after administration it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration it has been proposed that co administration of calcitriol via injection may improve treatment outcomes paracetamol replacements paracetamol ester prodrug with l acid pca a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability studies of different paracetamol esters show that l 5 oxo 2 paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of ester are with gsh levels recorded in untreated mice control group mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35 p 0 01 vs untreated control group oral ld50 was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg 1 whereas intraperitoneal ld50 was 1900 mg kg 1 these results taken together with good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol treatment gastric decontamination in adults initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination paracetamol absorption from gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe gastric lavage better known as stomach pumping may be considered if amount ingested is potentially life threatening and procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion activated charcoal is most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol reducing its gastrointestinal absorption administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage it appears that most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained or delayed release paracetamol preparations activated charcoal should also be administered if co ingested drugs warrant decontamination there was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose because of concern that it may also absorb oral antidote acetylcysteine studies have shown that 39 less acetylcysteine is absorbed into body when they are administered together there are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change dosing of oral acetylcysteine after administration of activated charcoal and even whether dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all intravenous has no interaction with activated charcoal inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac has no role in paracetamol overdose because vomiting it induces delays effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage activated charcoal or syrup of ipecac acetylcysteine thumb acetylcysteine is antidote for paracetamol toxicity acetylcysteine also called n acetylcysteine or nac works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of antioxidant glutathione glutathione reacts with toxic napqi metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted nac was usually given following a treatment nomogram one for patients with risk factors and one for those without but use of nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence base to support use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine additionally acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post ingestion and for those who present with liver failure symptoms if person presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose then acetylcysteine significantly reduces risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival if acetylcysteine is started more than 8 hours after ingestion there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because cascade of toxic events in liver has already begun and risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48 hours after ingestion if person presents more than eight hours after paracetamol overdose then activated charcoal is not useful and acetylcysteine is started immediately in earlier presentations charcoal can be given when patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for paracetamol level results to return from laboratory in united states practice intravenous iv and oral administration are considered to be equally effective and safe if given within 8 hours of ingestion however iv is only recommended route in australasian and british practice oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140 mg kg loading dose followed by 70 mg kg every four hours for 17 more doses and if patient vomits within 1 hour of dose dose must be repeated oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste odor and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting if repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300 mg kg recommended administration involves infusion of a 150 mg kg loading dose over 15 to 60 minutes followed by a 50 mg kg infusion over four hours last 100 mg kg are infused over remaining 16 hours of protocol intravenous acetylcysteine has advantage of shortening hospital stay increasing both doctor and patient convenience and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both paracetamol and any co ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral acetylcysteine intravenous dosing varies with weight specifically in children for patients less than 20 kg loading dose is 150 mg kg in 3 ml kg diluent administered over 60 minutes second dose is 50 mg kg in 7 ml kg diluent over 4 hours and third and final dose is 100 mg kg in 14 ml kg diluent over 16 hours most common adverse effect to acetylcysteine treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction usually manifested by rash wheeze or mild hypotension adverse reactions are more common in people treated with iv acetylcysteine occurring in up to 20 of patients anaphylactoid reactions are more likely to occur with first infusion loading dose rarely severe life threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis and may be characterized by respiratory distress facial swelling and even death if an anaphylactoid reaction occurs acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or slowed and antihistamines and other supportive care is administered for example a nebulised beta agonist like salbutamol may be indicated in event of significant bronchospasm or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine it is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes liver transplant in people who develop acute liver failure or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure mainstay of management is liver transplantation liver transplants are performed in specialist centers most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at king s college hospital in london patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood ph less than 7 3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has grade iii or iv encephalopathy a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds and a serum creatinine greater than 300 mmol l in a 24 hour period other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants these techniques have advantage of supporting patient while their own liver regenerates once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication for rest of their lives prognosis mortality rate from paracetamol overdose increases two days after ingestion reaches a maximum on day four and then gradually decreases acidosis is most important single indicator of probable mortality and need for transplantation a mortality rate of 95 without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented ph less than 7 30 other indicators of poor prognosis include chronic kidney disease stage 3 or worse hepatic encephalopathy a markedly elevated prothrombin time or an elevated blood lactic acid level lactic acidosis one study has shown that a factor v level less than 10 of normal indicated a poor prognosis 91 mortality whereas a ratio of factor viii to factor v of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis 100 survival patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life epidemiology many over counter and prescription only medications contain paracetamol because of its wide availability paired with comparably high toxicity compared to ibuprofen and aspirin there is a much higher potential for overdose paracetamol toxicity is one of most common causes of poisoning worldwide in united states united kingdom australia and new zealand paracetamol is most common cause of drug overdoses additionally in both united states and united kingdom it is most common cause of acute liver failure in england and wales an estimated 41 200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990 with a mortality of 0 40 it is estimated that 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur as a result of poisoning each year in england and wales paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in us than overdose of any other pharmacological substance accounting for more than 100 000 calls as well as 56 000 emergency room visits 2 600 hospitalizations and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year a study of cases of acute liver failure between november 2000 and october 2004 by centers for disease control and prevention in usa found that paracetamol was cause of 41 of all cases in adults and 25 of cases in children references external links category hepatotoxins category poisoning by drugs medicaments and
