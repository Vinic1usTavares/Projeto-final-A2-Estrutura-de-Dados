troops in vicinity of charleston south carolina where state officials prepared to take possession of fort sumter beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack fort within fort issue was not of niceties of geopolitical posturing but of survival they would be out of food on 15th small union garrison had but half a dozen officers and 127 soldiers under major robert anderson famously this included baseball folk hero captain later major general abner doubleday more improbable yet was a union officer who had name of jefferson c davis he would spend war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to northern cause newly installed president lincoln not wishing to initiate hostilities informed south carolina governor pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from navy yard in new york to resupply but not re enforce fort pickens in florida and fort sumter u s president did not inform csa president davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel for lincoln davis as leader of an insurrection was without legal standing in u s affairs to deal with him would be to give legitimacy to rebellion fact that sumter was property of sovereign united states was reason for maintaining garrison on island fort he informed pickens that resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon as it turned out just as supply ships approached charleston harbor bombardment would begin and flotilla watched spectacle from at sea davis faced most important decision of his career to prevent reinforcement at fort sumter or to let it take place he and his cabinet decided to demand that federal garrison surrender and if this was refused to use military force to prevent reinforcement before fleet arrived anderson did not surrender with davis s endorsement beauregard began bombarding of fort in early dawn of april 12 confederates continued their artillery attack on fort sumter until it surrendered on april 14 no one was killed in artillery

north s population was almost entirely white south had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color while latter were free becoming a soldier was seen as prerogative of white men only many southerners were terrified at idea of a black man with a gun excluding old men and boys white males available for confederate service were less than two million there was also additional burden that near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between owner and owned north had vastly greater industrial capacity built nearly all locomotives steamships and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system nearly all munitions facilities were in north while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in south thumb left jefferson davis on csa postage stamps much of railroad track that existed in confederacy was of simple railway design just meant to carry large bales of cotton to local river ports in harvest season these often did not connect to other rail lines making internal shipments of goods difficult at best while union had a large navy new confederate navy had only a few captured warships or newly built vessels these did surprisingly well but ultimately were sunk or abandoned as union navy controlled more rivers and ports rebel raiders loosed on northern ships on atlantic did tremendous damage and sent yankee ships into safe harbors as insurance rates soared union blockade of south however made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive somewhat awkwardly these runners didn t bring significant amounts of war materials that were so desperately needed but rather european luxuries sought as a relief from war s horrifying conditions mcpherson 1989 pp 313 19 in june 1862 davis was forced to assign general robert e lee to replace wounded joseph e johnston to command of army of northern virginia main confederate army in eastern theater that december davis made a tour of confederate armies in west of country he had a very small circle of military advisers he largely made main strategic decisions on his own though he had special respect for lee s views given confederacy s limited resources compared with union davis decided that confederacy would have to fight mostly on strategic defensive he maintained this outlook throughout war paying special attention to defense of his national capital at richmond he approved lee s strategic offensives when he felt that military success would both shake northern self confidence and strengthen peace movements there however several campaigns invading north were met with defeat a bloody battle at antietam in maryland as well as ride into kentucky confederate heartland offensive both in 1862 cooper 2000 pp 401 02 drained irreplaceable men and talented officers a final offense led to three day bloodletting at gettysburg in pennsylvania 1863 crippling south still further status of techniques and munitions made defensive side much more likely to endure an expensive lesson vindicating davis s initial belief administration and cabinet thumb left original confederate cabinet l r judah p benjamin stephen mallory christopher memminger alexander h stephens leroy pope walker jefferson davis john h reagan and robert toombs as provisional president in 1861 davis formed his first cabinet robert toombs of georgia was first secretary of state and christopher memminger of south carolina became secretary of treasury leroy pope walker of alabama was made secretary of war after being recommended for this post by clement clay and william yancey both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves john reagan of texas became postmaster general judah p benjamin of louisiana became attorney general although stephen mallory was not put forward by delegation from his state of florida davis insisted that he was best man for job of secretary of navy and he was eventually confirmed patrick 1944 p 51 since confederacy was founded among other things on states rights one important factor in davis s choice of cabinet members was representation from various states he depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people this helped maintain good relations between executive and legislative branches this also led to complaints as more states joined confederacy however because there were more states than cabinet positions patrick 1944 pp 49 50 56 as war progressed this dissatisfaction increased and there were frequent changes to cabinet toombs who had wished to be president himself was frustrated as an advisor and resigned within a few months of his appointment to join army robert hunter of virginia replaced him as secretary of state on july 25 1861 patrick 1944 pp 53 89 on september 17 walker resigned as secretary of war due to a conflict with davis who had questioned his management of war department and had suggested he consider a different position walker requested and was given command of troops in alabama benjamin left attorney general position to replace him and thomas bragg of north carolina brother of general braxton bragg took benjamin s place as attorney general patrick 1944 p 53 116 17 thumb davis was first depicted on 1862 50 csa note issued between april and december 1862 following november 1861 election davis announced permanent cabinet in march 1862 benjamin moved again to secretary of state george w randolph of virginia had been made secretary of war mallory continued as secretary of navy and reagan as postmaster general both kept their positions throughout war memminger remained secretary of treasury while thomas hill watts of alabama was made attorney general patrick 1944 pp 55 57 in 1862 randolph resigned from war department and james seddon of virginia was appointed to replace him in late 1863 watts resigned as attorney general to take office as governor of alabama and george davis of north carolina took his place in 1864 memminger withdrew from treasury post due to congressional opposition and was replaced by george of south carolina in 1865 congressional opposition likewise caused seddon to withdraw and he was replaced by john c breckinridge of kentucky patrick 1944 p 57 cotton was south s primary export and basis of its economy and system of production south used was dependent upon slave labor at outset of civil war davis realized that intervention from european powers would be vital if confederacy was to stand against union administration sent repeated delegations to european nations but several factors prevented southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy union blockade of confederacy led european powers to remain neutral contrary to southern belief that a blockade would cut off supply of cotton to britain and other european nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of south many european countries objected to slavery britain had abolished it in 1830s and lincoln s emancipation proclamation of 1863 made support for south even less appealing in europe finally as war progressed and south s military prospects dwindled foreign powers were not convinced that confederacy had strength to become independent in end not a single foreign nation recognized confederate states of america strategic failures thumb left davis in 1859 most historians sharply

davis was loathed by much of his military congress and public even before confederacy died on his watch and general beauregard wrote in a letter if he were to die today whole country would rejoice at it on january 31 1865 lee assumed this role but it was far too late davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all southern territory with ostensibly equal effort this diluted limited resources of south and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by union into vital western theater e g capture of new orleans in early 1862 he made other controversial strategic choices such as
