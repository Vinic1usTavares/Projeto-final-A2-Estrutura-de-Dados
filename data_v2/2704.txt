eadbald was king of kent from 616 until his death in 640 he was son of king aethelberht and his wife bertha a daughter of merovingian king s e kelly eadbald oxford online dictionary of national biography 2004 aethelberht made kent dominant force in england during his reign and became first anglo saxon king to convert to christianity from anglo saxon paganism eadbald s accession was a significant setback for growth of church since he retained his people s paganism and did not convert to christianity for at least a year and perhaps for as much as eight years he was ultimately converted by either laurentius or justus and separated from his first wife who had been his stepmother at insistence of church eadbald s second wife was emma who may have been a frankish princess she bore him two sons eormenred and eorcenberht and a daughter eanswith eadbald s influence was less than his father s but kent was powerful enough to be omitted from list of kingdoms dominated by edwin of northumbria edwin s marriage to eadbald s sister aethelburg established a good relationship between kent and northumbria which appears to have continued into oswald s reign when aethelburg fled to kent on edwin s death in about 633 she sent her children to francia for safety fearing intrigues of both eadbald and oswald kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over succeeding years including marriage of eanflaed eadbald s niece to oswiu and of eorcenberht to seaxburh daughter of king anna of east anglia eadbald died in 640 and was buried in church of st mary which he had built in precincts of monastery of st peter and st paul in canterbury a church later incorporated within norman edifice of st augustine s at that time his relics were translated for reburial in south

accurately kirby earliest english kings pp 31 33 provides an extended discussion of chronology of aethelberht s reign aethelberht was recorded by early chronicler bede as having overlordship or imperium over other anglo saxon kingdoms bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 5 p 111 this dominance led to wealth in form of tribute and kent was a powerful kingdom at time of aethelberht s death in 616 with trade well established with european mainland roman britain had become fully christianized but anglo saxons retained their native faith in 597 augustine was sent by pope gregory i to england to convert them to christianity augustine landed in eastern kent and soon managed to convert aethelberht who gave augustine land in canterbury two other rulers saeberht king of essex and raedwald king of east anglia were converted through aethelberht s influence bede ecclesiastical history bk i ch 25 p 74 kirby earliest english kings pp 30 37 an important source for this period in kentish history is ecclesiastical history of english people written in 731 by bede a benedictine monk from northumbria bede was primarily interested in christianization of england but he also provides substantial information about secular history including reigns of aethelberht and eadbald one of bede s correspondents was albinus abbot of monastery of st peter and st paul subsequently renamed st augustine s in canterbury a series of related texts known as legend of st mildrith provides additional information about events in lives of eadbald s children and throws some light on eadbald himself anglo saxon chronicle a collection of annals assembled in about 890 in kingdom of wessex also provides information other sources include papal letters regnal lists of kings of kent and early charters charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to their followers or to church and they provide some of earliest documentary sources in england none survive in original form from eadbald s reign but some later copies exist yorke kings and kingdoms p 25 ancestry and immediate family thumb 300px left eadbald s ancestry and siblings ancestry of aethelberht eadbald s father is given by bede who states that he was descended from legendary founder of kent hengist however historians believe that hengist and his brother horsa were probably mythical figures barbara yorke kent kings of oxford online dictionary of national biography 2004 it is known that aethelberht married twice as eadbald married his step mother after his father s death to consternation of church s e kelly aethelberht i oxford online dictionary of national biography 2004 eadbald had a sister aethelburg who was probably also child of bertha aethelburg married edwin king of northumbria one of dominant anglo saxon kings of seventh century it is possible that there was another brother named aethelwald evidence for this is a papal letter to justus archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625 in which a king named aduluald is referred to and who is apparently different from which refers to eadbald there is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this aduluald might be intended as a representation of aethelwald and hence this may be an indication of another king perhaps a subking of west kent yorke kings and kingdoms pp 32 33 or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to eadbald kirby earliest english kings pp 37 42 archbishop laurence of canterbury persuaded eadbald to accept christianity and give up his wife he then remarried and his second wife according to kentish tradition recorded in kentish royal legend was a woman named ymme of frankish royal blood though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been daughter of mayor of palace in neustria western part of francia yorke kings and kingdoms p 29 rollason mildrith legend p 9 east and west kent surviving regnal lists show only one king reigning at a time in kent but subkingdoms were common among anglo saxons and from reign of hlothhere in late seventh century there is evidence that kent was usually ruled by two kings though often one is clearly dominant it is less clear that this is case before hlothhere forged charters preserve a tradition of eadbald ruling during his father s reign presumably as a subking over west kent papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating existence of aethelwald a brother of eadbald s refers to aethelwald as a king if he existed he would presumably have been a junior king to eadbald two kingdoms within kent were east and west kent western kent has fewer archaeological finds from earliest periods than east kent and eastern finds are somewhat distinct in character showing jutish and frankish influence archaeological evidence combined with known political division into two kingdoms makes it likely that origin of subkingdoms was conquest of western half by eastern which would have been first area settled by invaders yorke kings and kingdoms p 27 accession and pagan reaction eadbald came to throne on death of his father on 24 february 616 or possibly 618 although aethelberht had been christian since about 600 and his wife bertha was also christian eadbald was a pagan bertha died some time before eadbald s accession and aethelberht remarried name of aethelberht s second wife is not recorded but it seems likely that she was a pagan since on his death she married eadbald her stepson a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by church bede records that eadbald s repudiation of christianity was a severe setback to growth of church saeberht king of essex had become a christian under aethelberht s influence but on saeberht s death at about same time his sons expelled mellitus bishop of london according to bede eadbald was punished for his by frequent fits of insanity and possession by an evil spirit perhaps referring to epileptic fits yorke kings and kingdoms p 175 but was eventually persuaded to abandon paganism and give up his wife eadbald s second wife ymme was a frank and it is possible that kent s strong connections with francia were a factor in king s conversion missionaries in canterbury seem to have had frankish support in 620s eadbald s sister aethelburg came to kent but sent her children to court of king dagobert i in francia in addition to diplomatic connections trade with franks was important to kent it is thought likely that frankish pressure had been influential in persuading aethelberht to become christian and eadbald s conversion and marriage to ymme are likely to have been closely connected diplomatic decisions yorke kings and kingdoms p 39 two graves from a well preserved sixth and seventh century anglo saxon cemetery at finglesham have yielded a bronze pendant and a gilt buckle with designs that are related to each other and may be symbolic of religious activity involving germanic deity woden these objects probably date from period of pagan reaction commentary and images of both objects can be found in s chadwick hawkes finglesham a cemetery in east kent and archaeology of conversion cemeteries both in campbell anglo saxons pp 24 25 and 48 49 bede s account bede s account of eadbald s rejection of church and subsequent conversion is quite detailed but not without some internal inconsistency bede s version of events is laid out as follows 24 february 616 aethelberht dies and eadbald succeeds 616 eadbald leads a pagan reaction to christianity he marries his stepmother contrary to church law and refuses baptism at about this time mellitus bishop of london is expelled by sons of saeberht in essex and goes to kent 616 mellitus and justus bishop of rochester leave kent for francia 616 617 some time after mellitus and justus depart laurence archbishop of canterbury plans to leave for francia but has a vision in which st peter scourges him in morning he shows scars to eadbald who is converted to christianity as a result bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 6 p 113 617 justus and mellitus both return from francia year after they left justus is restored to rochester c 619 laurence dies and mellitus becomes archbishop of canterbury bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 7 p 114 619 624 eadbald builds a church which is consecrated by archbishop mellitus 24 april 624 mellitus dies and justus succeeds him as archbishop of canterbury 624 after justus s succession pope boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from king aduluald possibly a scribal error for eadbald of king s conversion to christianity boniface sends pallium with this letter adding that it is only to be worn when celebrating holy mysteries bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 8 p 116 by 625 edwin of deira king of northumbria asks for hand in marriage of aethelburg eadbald s sister edwin is told he must allow her to practice christianity and must consider baptism himself bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 9 p 117 21 july 625 justus consecrates paulinus bishop of york july or later in 625 edwin agrees to terms and aethelburg travels to northumbria accompanied by paulinus easter 626 aethelburg gives birth to a daughter eanflaed 626 edwin completes a military campaign against west saxons at about this time boniface writes to both edwin and aethelburg letter to edwin urges him to accept christianity and refers to conversion of eadbald letter to aethelburg mentions that pope has recently heard news of eadbald s conversion and encourages her to work for conversion of her husband edwin bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 10 p 120 alternative chronology although bede s narrative is widely accepted an alternative chronology has been proposed by d p kirby kirby points out that boniface s letter to aethelburg makes it clear that news of eadbald s conversion is recent and that it is unthinkable that boniface would not have been kept up to date on status of eadbald s conversion hence eadbald must have been converted by justus as is implied by boniface s letter to justus pallium accompanying that letter indicates justus was archbishop by that time and duration of mellitus s archiepiscopate means that even if bede s dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars eadbald was converted no earlier than 621 and no later than april 624 since mellitus consecrated a church for eadbald before his death in that month account of laurence s miraculous scourging by st peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of monastery of st augustine as mentioned above it has been suggested that king aduluald in letter to justus is a real king aethelwald perhaps a junior king of west kent in that case it would appear that laurence converted eadbald and justus converted aethelwald it has also been suggested that pallium did not indicate justus was archbishop since justus is told limited circumstances in which he may wear it however same phrasing occurs in letter conveying pallium to archbishop augustine also quoted in bede another possibility is that letter was originally two letters in this view bede has conflated letter conveying pallium with letter congratulating justus on conversion which according to bede s account was seven or so years earlier however grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition letter to aethelburg makes it clear that she was already married at time news of eadbald s conversion reached rome this is quite inconsistent with earlier date bede gives for eadbald s acceptance of christianity and it has been suggested in bede s defence that aethelburg married edwin substantially earlier and stayed in kent until 625 before travelling to rome and that letter was written while she was in kent however it would appear from boniface s letter that boniface thought of aethelburg as being at her husband s side it also appears that letter to justus was written after letters to edwin and aethelburg rather than before as bede has it boniface s letter to edwin and aethelburg indicates he had news from messengers but when he wrote to justus he had heard from king himself story of aethelburg s marriage being dependent on edwin allowing her to practice her faith has been questioned since revising chronology makes it likely though not certain that marriage was arranged before eadbald s conversion in this view it would have been church that objected to marriage and aethelburg would have been christian before eadbald s conversion story of paulinus s consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later which is after latest possible date for aethelburg s marriage however it may be that he traveled to northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop a revised chronology of some of these events follows taking above considerations into account 616 eadbald leads a pagan reaction to christianity 616 mellitus and justus bishop of rochester leave kent for francia c 619 laurence dies and mellitus becomes archbishop of canterbury early 624 justus converts eadbald messengers go to rome also at about this time aethelburg s marriage to edwin is arranged perhaps before conversion eadbald builds a church and mellitus consecrates it 24 april 624 mellitus dies and justus succeeds him as archbishop of canterbury mid 624 edwin agrees to marriage terms and aethelburg travels to northumbria accompanied by paulinus later 624 pope receives news of eadbald s conversion and writes to aethelburg and edwin still later 624 pope hears from eadbald of his conversion and also hears of mellitus s death he writes to justus to send him pallium 21 july 625 or 626 justus consecrates paulinus bishop of york this timeline extends duration of pagan reaction from less than a year in bede s narrative to about eight years this represents a more serious setback for church relations with other english kingdoms and church affairs thumb 300px right eadbald s children and their marriages eadbald s influence over other anglo saxon kingdoms was less than aethelberht s eadbald s reduced power is apparent in his inability to restore mellitus to see of london in bede s words his authority in essex was not so effective as that of his father however kentish power was still sufficient to make alliance with eadbald s relatives attractive to other kingdoms edwin s marriage to eadbald s sister aethelburg was probably also motivated by a desire to gain better access to communications with continent kirby earliest english kings p 61 relationship would have been valuable to eadbald too it may have been as a result of this alliance that edwin s overlordship of britain did not include kent yorke kings and kingdoms p 36 another factor in edwin s treatment of kent may have been location of archbishopric in canterbury edwin was well aware of importance of canterbury s metropolitan status and at one time planned to make york an archbishopric too with paulinus as planned first incumbent kirby earliest english kings p 79 paulinus eventually returned to kent where at eadbald s and archbishop honorius s request he became bishop of rochester and york was not made an archbishopric for another century bede ecclesiastical history bk ii ch 20 p 141 kirby earliest english kings p 80 within a year of edwin s death in 633 or 634 oswald took throne of northumbria and it seems likely that his relations with eadbald were modelled on edwin s oswald s successor oswiu married eanflaed who was edwin s daughter and eadbald s niece thereby gaining both deiran and kentish connections kirby earliest english kings p 88 kirby earliest english kings p 92 eadbald and ymme had a daughter eanswith who founded very first nunnery on english soil at folkestone 15 miles from canterbury and two sons eorcenberht and eormenred eormenred was older of two and may have held title of regulus perhaps implying that he held junior kingship of kent he appears to have died before his father leaving eorcenberht to inherit throne yorke kings and kingdoms p 35 an additional son ecgfrith is mentioned in a charter of eadbald s but charter is a forgery probably dating from eleventh century see charter itself can be seen at stenton anglo saxon england p 141 several of eadbald s near relatives were involved in diplomatic marriages king anna of east anglia married his daughter seaxburh to eorcenberht and their daughter eormenhild married wulfhere of mercia one of most powerful kings of his day eanflaed eadbald s niece married oswiu king of northumbria and last of northern angles bede listed as holding imperium over southern england eadbald s granddaughter eafe married king of kirby earliest english kings p 43 trade and connections to franks there is little documentary evidence about nature of trade in eadbald s reign it is known that kings of kent had established royal control of trade in late seventh century but it is not known how early this control began there is archaeological evidence that suggests that royal influence predates any of written sources and it may have been eadbald s father aethelberht who took control of trade away from aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly continental trade provided kent access to luxury goods which was an advantage in trading with other anglo saxon nations and revenue from trade was important in itself yorke kings and kingdoms p 40 kent traded locally made glass and jewelry to franks kentish goods have been found as far south as mouth of loire south of brittany there was probably also a flourishing slave trade wealth this commerce brought to kent may have been basis of continuing though diminished importance of kent in eadbald s reign campbell et al anglo saxons p 44 coins were probably first minted in kent in aethelberht s reign though none bear his name these early golden coins were probably shillings in old english that are mentioned in aethelberht s laws coins are also known to numismatists as thrymsas m a s blackburn coinage in lapidge encyclopedia of anglo saxon england pp 113 116 thrymsas are known from eadbald s reign but few are known that carry his name one such was minted at london and inscribed it has been suggested that kings did not have a monopoly on production of coinage at that time yorke kings and kingdoms pp 40 41 connections with francia went beyond trade and royal marriages aethelberht and eadbald made with frankish princesses eadbald s granddaughter became a nun at and his great granddaughter mildrith was a nun at when edwin was killed in about 632 aethelburg escorted by paulinus fled by sea to eadbald s court in kent but in a further sign of her family s ties across channel she sent her children to court of king dagobert i of franks to keep them safe from intrigues of eadbald and oswald of northumbria succession eadbald died in 640 and according to most versions of kentish royal legend was succeeded solely by his son eorcenberht however an early text caligula a xiv refers to eormenred as king suggesting either he was a junior king under eorcenberht or had a shared kingship one suggestion is that other version of events in legend which gives him no title may have been an attempt to discredit royal claimants from eormenred s line kirby earliest
