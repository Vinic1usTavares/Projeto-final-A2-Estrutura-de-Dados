game if a person plays alone sheva is controlled by game s artificial intelligence ai when game has been completed once there is an option to make sheva primary character two player mode is available online or split screen with a second player using same console a second player joining a split screen game in progress will make game reload last checkpoint point at which game was last saved second player joining an online game will have to wait until first player reaches next checkpoint or restarts previous one to play in split screen mode one player s viewpoint is presented in top half of screen and other in bottom half but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format rather than using full width of screen resulting in unused space to left and right of two windows if one player has critical health only their partner can resuscitate them and they will die if their partner cannot reach them at certain points players are deliberately separated players can trade items during gameplay although weapons cannot be traded with online players game s story line is linear and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut scenes a version of mercenaries minigame which

needed to be downloaded to access online multiplayer modes mercenaries is unlocked when game s story mode has been completed development thumb producer jun takeuchi pictured in 2010 supervised game s development alt a portrait shot of a middle aged asian man with short messy black hair glasses and a zip up sweatshirt resident evil 5 was developed by capcom and produced by jun takeuchi who directed onimusha warlords and produced lost planet extreme condition keiji inafune promotional producer for resident evil 2 and executive producer of playstation 2 version of resident evil 4 supervised project production began in 2005 and at its peak over 100 people were working on project in february 2007 some members of capcom s clover studio began working on resident evil 5 while others were working on resident evil umbrella chronicles which debuted for wii yasuhiro anpo who worked as a programmer on original resident evil directed resident evil 5 he was one of several staff members who worked on original game to be involved in resident evil 5 development game s scenario was written by haruo murata and yoshiaki hirabayashi based on a story idea by concept director kenichi ueda takeuchi announced that game would retain gameplay model introduced in resident evil 4 with thematic tastes from both resident evil 4 and original resident evil while previous resident evil games are mainly set at night events of resident evil 5 occur almost entirely during day decision for this was a combination of game being set in africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics on subject of changes to valentine and chris s appearance production director yasuhiro anpo explained that designers tried to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over passage of time their new designs retained character s signature colors green for chris and blue for valentine sheva was redesigned several times during production though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of feminine attraction and strength of a fighting woman majini were designed to be more violent than enemies in resident evil 4 decision for cooperative gameplay was made part way through development for a new experience in a resident evil game despite initial concern that a second player would dampen game s tension and horror it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued decision to retain wide screen proportions in two player mode was made to avoid having first player s screen directly on top of second which might be distracting and restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely takeuchi cited film black hawk down as an influence on setting of resident evil 5 and his experience working on lost planet extreme condition as an influence on its development when questioned as to why game was not being released on wii which was most popular gaming console at time takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision from a business perspective wii was not best choice in terms of power and visual quality concluding that he was happy with console choices they had made resident evil 5 runs on version 1 4 of capcom s mt framework engine and scenes were recorded by motion capture it was first video game to use a virtual camera system which allowed developers to see character movements in real time as motion capture actors recorded actors reuben langdon karen dyer and ken lally portrayed chris redfield sheva alomar and albert wesker respectively dyer also voiced sheva while chris s voice was performed by roger craig smith dyer s background training in circus skills helped her win role of sheva as capcom were searching for someone who could handle physical skills her motion capture required she performed her own stunts and worked in production on game for over a year sometimes working 14 hours a day all of human character motions were based on motion capture while non human characters in game were animated by hand kota suzuki was game s principal composer and additional music was contributed by hideki akihiko narita and seiko electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music recorded at newman scoring stage of 20th century fox studios in los angeles with 103 piece hollywood studio symphony other orchestral music and arrangements were by wataru who conducted orchestra capcom recorded in los angeles because they wanted a hollywood style soundtrack

generally favourable reviews according to review aggregator metacritic reviewers praised game s visuals and content corey cohen of official xbox magazine complimented game s fast pace and called graphics gorgeous it was praised by joe juba and mark miller of game informer who said that it had best graphics of any game to date and that music and voice acting helped bring characters to life and brian crecente of kotaku said it was one of most visually stunning games he had ever played adam sessler of x play said game s graphics were exceptional and edge praised gameplay as exhilarating and frantic for ign ryan geddes wrote that game had a surprisingly high replay value and gamezone louis bedigian said game was worth playing through twice in one weekend while still giving favorable reviews of game several reviewers considered it to be a departure from survival horror genre a decision they lamented chris hudak of game revolution considered game to be a full on action blockbuster and brian crecente said that about halfway through game it dropp ed all pretense of being a survival horror title and unmask ed itself as an action shooter title kristan reed of eurogamer said game morphs what was a survival horror adventure into a survival horror shooter and believed that this attempt to appeal to action gamers would upset some of series fans aspects of game s control scheme were viewed negatively by critics james mielke of 1up com criticized several inconsistencies in game such as only being able to take cover from enemy fire in very specific areas mielke also criticized its controls saying that aiming was too slow and noting inability to strafe away from or quickly jump back from enemies despite problems he found it was still a very fun game kristan reed also had criticism of some controls such as speed at which 180 degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory joe juba said that inability to move and shoot at same time seemed more like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension while praising some aspects of ai control of sheva ryan geddes thought that it also had its annoyances such as its tendency to recklessly expend ammunition and health supplies reception of downloadable content was favorable steven hopper of gamezone rated lost in nightmares dlc eight out of ten saying that despite episode s brevity it had high replay value and addition of new multiplayer elements made it a worthy investment for fans of original game samuel claiborn of ign rated desperate escape dlc seven out of ten despite desperate escape s well crafted action sequences i actually found myself missing unique vibe of lost in nightmares dynamic between jill and josh isn t particularly thrilling and one liners banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum allegations of racism resident evil 5s 2007 e3 trailer was criticized for depicting a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small african village according to newsweek editor n gai croal there was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery although he acknowledged that only preview had been released takeuchi said game s producers were completely surprised by complaints second trailer for game released on may 31 2008 revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and african bsaa agent sheva who assists protagonist critics felt that sheva s character was added to address issue of racism though karen dyer said character had been in development before first trailer was released takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering design of resident evil 5 he acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about trailer though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once game was released and people were able to play game and see what it is for themselves in a computer and video games interview producer also addressed issue we can t please everyone we re in entertainment business we re not here to state our political opinion or anything like that it s unfortunate that some people felt that way in eurogamer february 2009 preview of resident evil 5 dan whitehead expressed concern about controversy game might generate it plays so blatantly into old cliches of dangerous dark continent and primitive lust of its inhabitants that you d swear game was written in 1920s whitehead said that these issues became more outrageous and outdated as game progressed and that addition of light skinned sheva just made overall issue worse hilary goldstein from ign believed that game was not deliberately racist and though he did not personally find it offensive he felt that others would due to subjective nature of offensiveness chris hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as stupid karen dyer who is of jamaican descent also dismissed claims she said that in over a year of working on game s development she never encountered anything racially insensitive and would not have continued working there if she had wesley yin poole of videogamer com said that despite controversy game was attracting due to alleged racism no expert opinion had been sought he asked glenn bowman senior lecturer in social anthropology at university of kent whether he thought game was racist bowman considered racism accusations silly saying that game had an anti colonial theme and those complaining about game s racism might be expressing an inverted racism which says that you can t have scary people who are black it was reported that one cutscene in game scene showed black men dragging off a screaming white woman according to yin poole allegation was incorrect and single man dragging woman was not obviously black scene was submitted to british board of film classification for evaluation bbfc head of communications sue clark said there is only one man pulling blonde woman in from balcony and he is not black either as whole game is set in africa it is hardly surprising that some of characters are black we do take racism very seriously but in this case there is no issue around racism academic journals and conferences however have continued to comment on theme of race within game in 2011 andre brock from games and culture said that game drew from well established racial and gender stereotypes saying that african people were only ever depicted as savage even before transitioning into zombies writing for digital games research association in 2011 geyser and tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been intended by capcom though compared their depiction of africa to that of 1899 novel heart of darkness post colonial africa they opined was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself and at mercy of western influences writing for philosophy of computer games conference in 2015 harrer and considered resident evil 5 to be yet another moment in history of commodity racism which from late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter most intimate spaces of european homes authors state that africa is presented from a western gaze what is presented as authentic blackness conforms to projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience in 2016 paul martin from games and culture said that theme of game could be described as dark continent stating that it drew on imagery of european colonialism and depictions of blackness reminiscent of 19th century european theories on race sales playstation 3 version of
