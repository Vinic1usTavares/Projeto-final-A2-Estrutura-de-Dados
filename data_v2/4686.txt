leccinum holopus commonly known as white birch bolete white bog bolete or ghost bolete is a species of bolete fungus in family boletaceae found in northern asia europe and northeastern north america it associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or swampy areas often growing among sphagnum moss fruitbodies mushrooms of l holopus have convex caps measuring up to in diameter often pure white especially in young fruitbodies caps sometimes become flushed with buff or brownish tints whitish surface of stipe is covered with small stiff projecting scales scabers that become tan or darker in age some varieties of leccinum holopus have been described that vary in cap color or staining reaction but dna evidence suggests that most are same taxon although fruitbodies are edible opinions vary as to their culinary desirability taxonomy initially named as a species of boletus by german mycologist friedrich rostkovius in 1844 fungus was later transferred to leccinum by roy watling in 1960 synonyms resulting from transfer to different genera include krombholzia and k holopus both published by albert pilat in 1951 holopus josef sutara 1989 trachypus holopus paul konrad and andre 1952 and trachypus scaber f holopus henri romagnesi 1939 other synonyms according to index fungorum include leccinum described from france in 1994 and leccinum aerugineum 1991 leccinum holopus is classified in section scabra of genus leccinum a grouping that includes northern hemisphere species associating exclusively with birch specific epithet holopus is greek for with perfect stalk common names given to fungus include white birch bolete white bog bolete and ghost bolete several of leccinum holopus have been described in form aerugineum described by josef sutara in 2009 flesh discolors green after injury variety americanum described by alexander h smith and harry delbert thiers in 1971 from collections made in michigan injured flesh stains reddish lannoy described leccinum nucatum in 1993 a taxon that was later 2007 published as variety nucatum of l holopus no molecular evidence was found supporting existence of this as a distinct taxon and it is therefore placed into synonymy with l holopus leccinum holopus var majus described by rolf singer in 1966 originally published by singer as krombholzia scabra f majus is another historical variety without independent taxonomic significance description thumb left flesh of variety americanum stains reddish when cut fruitbodies of leccinum holopus have convex to flattened caps measuring in diameter with a narrow band of sterile tissue surrounding margin caps are initially whitish but can develop gray buff tan or pinkish tints during maturity color may also darken and become greenish with age cap surface is initially covered with very fine hairs but later becomes more or less smooth often with a sticky texture in age or in moist conditions flesh is white and lacks any distinct odor or taste it can have either little or no bruising color reaction with injury or may become light pink in variety americanum on cap underside is a porous surface comprising pores numbering 2 to 3 per millimeter each of which is end of a tube that extends to deep color of pore surface ranges from whitish to grayish to dingy brown and has little color reaction to injury although it may discolor yellowish or brownish there is a depression where pores meet stipe stipe measures long by wide its whitish surface is covered with scabers that darken in age to tan or darker stipe base often stains bluish leccinum holopus produces a brown spore print spores are somewhat fusoid spindle shaped and measure 14 20 by 5 6 5 um basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and measure 28 5 36 5 by 11 5 12 5 um cystidia on pores are flask shaped lageniform to fusiform and 39 0 45 5 by 7 5 9 0 um while those of stipe caulocystidia are fusiform club shaped or cylindrical measuring 39 0 54 5 x 9 1 13 5 um there are no clamp connections present in hyphae of l holopus cap cuticle is arranged in form of a cutis with hyphae that run parallel to cap surface several chemical tests can be used to help verify an identification of l holopus a drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns cap cuticle a pinkish color but has no reaction with flesh a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide koh has no reaction on cap surface and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with flesh application of iron ii sulphate solution does not have a reaction on cap surface and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on flesh similar species is similar in appearance to l holopus but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution l scabrum is a widely distributed lookalike that can be distinguished from l holopus by its larger size and generally darker colors edibility although commonly considered edible opinions vary on culinary appeal of leccinum holopus fruitbodies michael kuo writing in 100 edible mushrooms considers it a good edible peter roberts and shelley evans in book of fungi say it is edible but is said to be tasteless and pappy so is not recommended fruitbodies are optimally harvested when they are young before flesh becomes too spongy and before insect larvae establish themselves minimal cleaning is required in field mushroom has a mild somewhat sweet flavor that is enhanced after brief drying mushrooms enhances flavor but diminishes sweetness of fresh mushrooms habitat and distribution thumb right leccinum holopus often fruits among moss in wet areas leccinum holopus is a mycorrhizal species it fruits on ground often among sphagnum moss singly to scattered in wet areas like cedar swamps bogs or soggy forests like most leccinum species fungus is highly host specific and associates with birch betula in north america range of leccinum holopus extends from eastern canada to new york extending west to northern rocky mountains roughly coinciding with distribution of paper birch betula papyrifera in this range it is common and fruits from august to october l holopus var americanum is known only from north america fungus is rare in southern europe but more common in sphagnum swamps in north in asia it has been recorded from taiwan and qinghai china fruitbodies of l holopus are a source of food for fly species such as pegomya winthemi
