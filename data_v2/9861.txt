had been hunting in area and had become lost martinez initially told investigators that he had fired a shot from his rifle to draw attention and that shot had caused fire but he later recanted and admitted he started fire intentionally to signal rescuers after gathering sticks and brush together martinez lit brush and quickly lost control of fire because of heat low humidity and low moisture content of surrounding vegetation martinez was charged in federal court on october 7 2004 with setting fire and lying about it in november 2005 a federal judge sentenced martinez to six months in a work furlough program and ordered him to complete 960 hours 40 days of community service he also was sentenced to five years probation and to pay 9 000 in restitution as part of plea bargain prosecutors dropped charge of lying to investigators criticism of response outdated policies there were a number of controversies associated with cedar fire resulting in investigations lasting several years a report 2003 san diego county fire siege fire safety review 2003 san diego county fire siege fire safety review prepared in wake of fire and presented to governor s blue ribbon fire commission criticized overall response report stated that though fire conditions and severity should have been expected responsible agencies were not properly prepared when fire broke out and radio communications problems exacerbated problem report stated that disorganization inconsistent or outdated policies among agencies that grounded aircraft or caused other problems and planning or logistics in disarray also marked preliminary stages of difficult dangerous firefighting with multiple fires already burning in state many local crews were already headed north to fight other fires and could not be recalled to assist with cedar fire forest service issues turning away of sheriff s helicopters by u s forest service in fire s early stages came under severe criticism by public media and elected officials believing that an opportunity to prevent fire from becoming out of control had been lost federal government has an aviation assets cutoff policy which stated that aircraft planes or helicopters may not be dispatched so as to arrive at an incident no later than 30 minutes before sunset helicopter pilot later claimed he could have made multiple water drops in time he had before darkness however a study conducted by forest service concluded that even if helicopter had been able to drop multiple loads of water with direct hits on flames impact on fire would have been minimal cutoff also prevented two air tankers and a helicopter stationed at ramona airport from being dispatched to fire although tankers likely could not have been used anyway as pilots had just spent seven hours fighting another fire and faa regulations stipulated that they could not continue to fly roger hedgecock and cedar fire california chaparral institute including a san diego union tribune article from april 6 2006 and comments from following day s san diego am roger hedgecock show obtained august 31 2007 california department of forestry issues a contributing factor to initial lack of aviation resources to fight fire was california department of forestry s no divert policy which allows incident commanders to dedicate certain resources to a particular fire policy applied to both airborne aircraft as well as those on ground awaiting dispatch at time that cedar fire started there were already 11 other fires burning in region aviation resources in area were currently being held on ground under a no divert declaration in order to be available for structures protection on another fire however weather and visibility at other fire was precluding their use so aircraft sat idle despite fact that conditions were acceptable for their use on cedar fire both media and local elected officials were also critical of lack of use of military aviation assets located nearby at camp pendleton and miramar u s marine corps operates ch 46 sea knight and ch 53 sea stallion helicopters that can carry water dropping buckets but existing policies prohibited their use until all other civilian resources were used additionally military aircraft radios were not compatible with those used by most state and local fire agencies and military pilots had not received any training in fire specific operations making them a potential safety hazard both to firefighters on ground and other aircraft over fire fatalities fifteen people including one firefighter were killed by fire a survivor rudy reyes was burned over approximately 70 percent of his body many of those killed were trapped by flames which were driven by winds that propelled flames faster than residents could flee of those killed 13 died in first 24 hours of fire at least 10 people were trapped in their vehicles trying to outrun flames some of those killed were so badly burned their remains were identified based on dog tags of pets lying dead near them on october 29 fire overran an engine crew from novato fire district near town of julian engineer steven rucker sustained fatal injuries while three other members of crew were
