greece and played a major role in short lived kingdom of thessalonica in 1208 1209 he supported lombard rebellion against king demetrius of montferrat but by 1221 he was kingdom s regent bailli and was left to defend city against ruler of epirus theodore komnenos doukas left unsupported by latin empire and with a projected crusade to relieve city delayed he surrendered city in december 1224 belated arrival of crusade helped to save his own fief from falling to epirotes however and he was soon able to return there dying on or shortly after 1237 life guido hailed from a distinguished family of lombardy in northern italy that ruled over a series of fiefs in area between parma piacenza and cremona in 1203 guy joined fourth crusade according to william miller because at home every common man could hale him before courts early activity thumb 250px greek and latin states in southern greece in autumn 1204 following sack of constantinople by crusaders and division of byzantine empire among crusader leaders he accompanied boniface of montferrat as he went west to establish his kingdom of thessalonica during boniface s march south into greece guy was appointed warden of strategic pass of thermopylae guy made nearby settlement of bodonitsa modern his seat erecting a castle on ruins of an ancient acropolis probably that of which gave wide sight over coastal plain around malian gulf exact bounds of marquisate are unknown but it lay between northern boundaries of duchy of athens and town of zetouni modern lamia which was partially owned by guy chronicle of morea reports that boniface soon transferred suzerainty over bodonitsa to prince of achaea william of champlitte however report of marino sanudo that this only occurred under geoffrey ii of villehardouin is more likely to be correct according to chronicle guy participated in long siege of acrocorinth held by greek lord leo sgouros boniface of montferrat was killed fighting against bulgarians in 1207 leaving his infant son demetrius as his successor guy and his brother possibly named rubino became one of leaders of lombard revolt against demetrius and his mother margaret of hungary lombard barons favoured demetrius older half brother william vi marquess of montferrat but were opposed by latin emperor henry of flanders henry succeeded in them and in january 1208 crowned demetrius king but barons launched a rebellion across kingdom henry marched south overcoming opposition of barons one by one those he captured were treated leniently however and allowed to keep their fiefs guy was among last to hold out taking refuge in cadmeia of thebes rather than submit to imperial judgment at first parliament of ravennika emperor henry was forced to begin preparations for a siege of cadmeia before lombard barons agreed to surrender once again they were allowed to keep their fiefs but now as imperial vassals like most of latin lords of greece guy had a difficult relationship with church in his domains although he handed over zetouni to knights templar he confiscated property belonging to local bishopric of thermopylae and was negligent in payment of tithe to church although he most likely did not attend second parliament of ravennika in 1210 he ratified concordat that attempted to settle differences between church and latin lords fall of kingdom of thessalonica although suppressed lombard rebellion undermined foundations of latin rule in thessaly and macedonia many of lombard barons remained unreconciled to king demetrius and left greece for italy over following years thus kingdom of thessalonica quickly began crumbling under assault of greek principality of epirus epirote ruler michael i komnenos doukas and his brother and successor theodore komnenos doukas conquered most of thessaly and macedonia so that by 1221 22 thessalonica was surrounded on all sides by epirote territory and cut off from either latin empire in east or frankish states in southern greece in an attempt to gather support in west king demetrius left for italy in winter 1221 22 and guy was appointed as regent bailli for queen margaret and demetrius in this capacity he ratified another convention that recognized church s property rights as bailli guy was charged with defence of thessalonica against epirotes urgent calls for a crusade were made in west under leadership of william vi of montferrat but in event only a small vanguard under former regent count oberto ii of biandrate arrived at thessalonica in summer 1222 latin emperor robert of courtenay also promised aid and attacked serres in april 1224 but siege had to be abandoned following disastrous defeat of main latin army at hands of nicaean emperor john iii doukas vatatzes at battle of poimanenon left unsupported garrison of thessalonica surrendered in december 1224 theodore treated surrendered latins well and eventually released most of them including guy from captivity these events rendered guy s small fief into a true border march between latin states of southern greece and territories recovered by greeks to north bodonitsa had long provided shelter for latin refugees such as latin archbishop of larissa who was appointed to see of thermopylae in 1224 after fall of thessalonica pope honorius iii anxiously encouraged other latin rulers of southern greece to aid in holding bodonitsa left leaderless in guy s absence some aid was provided some 1300 hyperpyra were gathered by clergy alone but bodonitsa was saved more through her strong fortifications and belated arrival of crusade meant to relieve thessalonica latter only sailed in march 1225 and landed in thessaly at halmyros crusader army was soon decimated by disease however william of montferrat himself succumbed to it and remnants of army left greece if it failed in its original objective crusade probably saved bodonitsa and thereby halted theodore s southern advance into central greece which either way had never been theodore s main objective death and descendants on 2 may 1237 guy made his will his date of death is unknown but it is assumed that he probably died soon thereafter one of last living participants in fourth crusade he was succeeded by his son by burgundian sibylla a cousin of guy i of athens couple had also two daughters who married azzo vii d este marquess of ferrara and isabella who succeeded her brother as marchioness but died childless in 1286 leading to a dispute between her unnamed husband and thomas pallavicini who seized castle of bodonitsa and became new marquess references sources
