development of movement by 1880s first explicitly anarchist influence had manifested when jose c campos established links between cuba and spanish anarchists operating in barcelona by importing anarchist pamphlets and newspapers at same time many spanish anarchists emigrated to cuba and it became very common for workers to read anarchist literature aloud in tobacco factories thereby greatly helping dissemination of anarchist ideas amongst workers during 1880s and up through early 1890s cuban anarchists favored an anarcho collectivist method of organizing and action similar to that of spain s federacion de trabajadores de la region espanola workers federation of spanish region following an each to his contribution line as opposed to each to his need line of anarcho communists

initiated a series of strikes at three factories one of which lasted through to end of november later in summer of 1888 strikes by tobacco workers led to a lockout by factory owners in more than 100 factories circulo de trabajadores organized a collection drive to support locked out workers going so far as to send representatives to key west florida to solicit donations from american tobacco workers by october lockout was ended by factory owners agreeing to meet with workers in negotiations outcome of this situation was so favorable to alianza obrera that union saw its membership jump from 3 000 to 5 000 in subsequent six months making it most powerful union in cuba following year roig san martin died at age 46 just days after his release from jail by spanish colonial government his funeral was reportedly attended by 10 000 mourners just a few months later in response to a lockout strike in tobacco industry colonial head manuel salamanca y closed manufacturer s union alianza

reconfirmed its revolutionary syndicalist principles and expressing solidarity with women in working class a new idea for a predominantly male working class that felt competed against by women in workplace declaring it is an urgent necessity not to forget women who are beginning to fill workshops of several industries they are driven by necessity and by bourgeois greed to compete with us we cannot oppose it let us help them however outcome of this was government suppression of movement by means of deportation imprisonment suspension of right to free assembly and closing of organizations headquarters to quell organizing efforts during war of independence from spain anarchists joined others in labor movement in distributing propaganda to spanish soldiers urging them not to oppose separatists and to join anarchist cause a few years previously anarchists had embraced ideas espoused by spanish anarchists of organizing not just in unions but also forming specifically anarchist groups to educate people and commit violent anti state acts known as propaganda of deed which carried on into war of independence anarchists placed bombs that blew up bridges and gas pipelines and contributed to failed separatist attempt to assassinate colonial head captain general in 1896 this led to government further repressing of anarchists closing sociedad general de trabajadores which grew out of circulo mass deportations of activists and even forbidding of lectura in workplace early 20th century right thumb francesc ferrer i guardia a catalan anarchist whose educational theory

reorganized themselves under alianza de trabajadores worker s alliance by september of this year five of groups organizers had been arrested following a mason s strike which spread to all of

anarchist newspaper published from 1899 through 1915 putting out more than 600 issues writers denounced public school requirement to pay allegiance to cuban flag and encouraged teaching children that flag was a symbol of closed mindedness and divisiveness anarchists claimed that students enrolled in such schooling would become cannon fodder for a conflict of liberal and conservative party leaders in 1906 which caused us to intervene and occupy cuba through 1909 though anarchists had been running schools since that of circulo de trabajadores it wasn t until 1906 that schools began to take on a less traditional flavor in 1908 anarchists included a manifesto in issues of tierra and la voz del calling for establishment of schools modeled after francesc ferrer s escuela moderna modern school

obrero worker s center was forced to close following anarchist congress of 1920 in havana several bombings took place including that of teatro nacional while enrico caruso was performing earning 15 to 20 times yearly salary of an average cuban worker for single performance following year menocal lost control of government to alfredo zayas y alfonso leading to a proliferation of anarchist activity tierra group began to publish books and pamphlets and at least six other regular anarchist periodicals were publishing at this time anarcho syndicalists were still at head of labor movement in cuba however despite maritime railway restaurant and tobacco industries being controlled by organized anarchists it wasn t until 1925 that a major anarchist federation was successfully organized by workers similar to confederacion nacional del trabajo of spain non anarchist members of confederacion nacional obrera cubana national cuban workers confederation eventually formed communist party of cuba in august 1925 by this time many anarchists including alfredo lopez and carlos had become swept up in excitement about russian revolution and had become party to more authoritarian forms of organizing many strikes occurred in fall of 1925 and government once again under leadership of machado was quick to suppress labor movement several labor leaders were shot and several hundred spanish anarchists were deported in one month machado stated you are right i don t know what anarchism is what socialism is what communism is for me they are all same all bad patriots alfredo lopez then secretary general of cnoc was arrested first in october 1925 and encouraged to join government followed by a second arrest in july 1926 he was disappeared at this point only to have his body found in 1933 after

turned over to police still under control of machado many of spanish anarchists involved decided to go back to spain following new government s passage of a law dictating that at least half of an employer s employees be cuban born a large number of cuba s spanish born anarchists were forced by economic necessity to return to spain which greatly diminished clout of anarchist movement in cuba
