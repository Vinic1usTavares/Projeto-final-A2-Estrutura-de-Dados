chrysippus of soli chrysippus random house webster s unabridged dictionary was a greek stoic philosopher he was a native of soli cilicia but moved to athens as a young man where he became a pupil of cleanthes in stoic school when cleanthes died around 230 bc chrysippus became third head of school a prolific writer chrysippus expanded fundamental doctrines of zeno of citium founder of school which earned him title of second founder of stoicism chrysippus excelled in logic theory of knowledge ethics and physics he created an original system of propositional logic in order to better understand workings of universe and role of humanity within it he adhered to a deterministic view of fate but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action ethics he thought depended on understanding nature of universe and he taught a therapy of extirpating unruly passions which depress and crush soul he initiated success of stoicism as one of most influential philosophical movements for centuries in greek and roman world of his written works none have survived except as fragments recently segments of some of his works were discovered among herculaneum papyri first of chrysippus partially preserved two or three works is his logical questions contained in pherc 307 second work is his on providence preserved in pherc 1038 and 1421 a third work most likely by chrysippus is preserved in pherc 1020 life chrysippus son of apollonius of tarsus was born at soli cilicia citing diogenes laertius vii 179 galen protreptic 7 de 10 he was slight in stature diogenes laertius vii 182 and is reputed to have trained as a long distance runner diogenes laertius vii 179 while still young he lost his substantial inherited property when it was confiscated to king s treasury diogenes laertius vii 181 king is not named but cilicia was contested between ptolemy ii philadelphus and antiochus i soter during this period cf chrysippus moved to athens where he became disciple of cleanthes who was then head of stoic school diogenes laertius vii 179 claim that he studied under zeno is less likely because zeno died in 262 1 cf he is believed to have attended courses of and his successor in platonic academy diogenes laertius vii 184 chrysippus threw himself eagerly into study of stoic system his reputation for learning among his contemporaries was considerable he was noted for intellectual audacity and self confidence and his reliance on his own ability was shown among other things in request he is supposed to have made to cleanthes give me principles and i will find proofs myself he succeeded cleanthes as head of stoic school when cleanthes died in around 230 bc chrysippus was a prolific writer he is said to rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a laertius vii 181 and he composed more than 705 works diogenes laertius vii 180 his desire to be comprehensive meant that he would take both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with quotations of others diogenes laertius vii 181 x 26 7 he was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style but his abilities were highly regarded and he came to be seen as a preeminent authority for school thumb right final moments in life of chrysippus engraving from 1606 he died during 143rd olympiad 208 204 bc at age of 73 diogenes laertius gives two different accounts of his death diogenes laertius vii 185 in first account chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted wine at a feast and died soon after in second account he was watching a donkey eat some figs and cried out now give donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down figs whereupon he died in a fit of laughter his nephew erected a statue in his honour in plutarch de stoicorum repugnantiis diogenes laertius vii 183 chrysippus was succeeded as head of stoic school by his pupil zeno of tarsus eusebius praeparatio evangelica 15 18 diogenes laertius vii 35 of his written works none survived except as fragments quoted in works of later authors like cicero seneca galen plutarch and others recently segments from logical questions and on providence were discovered among herculaneum papyri a third work by chrysippus may also be among them philosophy chrysippus had a long and successful career of resisting attacks of academy chrysippus j o urmson jonathan ree concise encyclopedia of western philosophy 2005 pages 73 74 of 398 pages and hoped not simply to defend stoicism against assaults of past but also against all possible attack in future he took doctrines of zeno and cleanthes and crystallized them into what became definitive system of stoicism he elaborated physical doctrines of stoics and their theory of knowledge and he created much of their formal logic in short chrysippus made stoic system what it was it was said that without chrysippus there would have been no stoa diogenes laertius vii 183 logic chrysippus wrote much on subject of logic and created a system of propositional logic aristotle s term logic had been concerned with interrelations of terms such as socrates or man all men are mortal socrates is a man so socrates is mortal stoic logic on other hand was concerned with interrelations of propositions such as it is day if it is day it is light but it is day so it is light though earlier megarian diodorus cronus and philo had worked in this field and pupils of aristotle theophrastus and eudemus had investigated hypothetical syllogisms it was chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic propositions chrysippus defined a proposition as that which is capable of being denied or affirmed as it is in itself and gave examples of propositions such as it is day and dion is walking he distinguished between simple and non simple propositions which in modern terminology are known as atomic and molecular propositions a simple proposition is an elementary statement such as it is day simple propositions are linked together to form non simple propositions by use of logical connectives chrysippus enumerated five kinds of molecular propositions according to connective used logical connectives type example if if it is day it is light and it is day and it is light either or either it is day or it is night because because it is day it is light more less likely than more likely it is day than it is night thus several types of molecular propositions familiar to modern logic were listed by chrysippus including conjunction disjunction and conditional and chrysippus studied their criteria of truth closely conditional propositions first logicians to debate conditional statements were diodorus cronus and his pupil philo writing five hundred years later sextus empiricus refers to a debate between diodorus and philo sextus empiricus pyr hyp ii 110 112 adv math viii 112 117 philo regarded all as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent and this meant a proposition such as if it is day then i am talking is true unless it is day and i fall silent sextus empiricus pyr hyp ii 110 112 but diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion thus because proposition if it is day then i am talking can be false it is invalid however paradoxical propositions were still possible such as if atomic elements of things do not exist atomic elements exists chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions which made such paradoxes impossible when sextus empiricus reports different criteria offered by ancient philosophers for truth of conditional propositions he does not mention chrysippus by name but modern scholars believe that chrysippus authored or at least held this view see to him a conditional is true if denial of consequent is logically incompatible with antecedent this corresponds to modern day strict conditional syllogistic chrysippus developed a syllogistic or system of deduction in which he made use of five types of basic arguments or argument forms called syllogisms which played role of axioms and four inference rules called themata by means of which complex syllogisms could be reduced to these axioms susanne bobzien stoic syllogistic oxford studies in ancient philosophy 14 1996 pp 133 192

thema was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be reduced to simple syllogisms purpose of stoic syllogistic was not merely to create a formal system it was also understood as study of operations of reason divine reason logos which governs universe of which human beings are a part goal was to find valid rules of inference and forms of proof to help people find their way in life other logical work chrysippus analyzed speech and handling of names and terms he also devoted much effort in refuting fallacies and paradoxes according to diogenes laertius chrysippus wrote twelve works in 23 books on liar paradox seven works in 17 books on and another nine works in 26 books on other conundrums in all 28 works or 66 books were given over to puzzles or paradoxes chrysippus is first stoic for whom third of four stoic categories i e category somehow disposed is attested ref stephen menn stoic theory of categories in oxford studies in ancient philosophy volume xvii 1999 215 47 ref in surviving evidence chrysippus frequently makes use of categories of substance and quality but makes little use of other two stoic categories somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something it is not clear whether categories had any special significance for chrysippus and a clear doctrine of categories may be work of later stoics later reception chrysippus came to be renowned as one of foremost logicians of ancient greece when clement of alexandria wanted to mention one who was master among logicians as homer was master among poets it was chrysippus not aristotle he chose clement of alexandria stromata vii 16 diogenes laertius wrote if gods use dialectic they would use none other than that of chrysippus diogenes laertius vii 180 logical work by chrysippus came to be neglected and forgotten aristotle s logic prevailed partly because it was seen as more practical and partly because it was taken up by neoplatonists as recently as 19th century stoic logic was treated with contempt a barren formulaic system which was merely clothing logic of aristotle with new terminology it was not until 20th century with advances in logic and modern propositional calculus that it became clear that stoic logic constituted a significant achievement epistemology for stoics truth is distinguished from error by sage who possesses right reason chrysippus s theory of knowledge was empirical senses transmit messages from external world and their reports are controlled not by referring them to innate ideas but by comparing them to previous reports stored in mind zeno had defined impressions of sense as an impression in soul and this was interpreted literally by cleanthes who compared impression on soul to impression made by a seal on wax chrysippus preferred to regard it as an alteration or change in soul that is soul receives a modification from every external object that acts upon it just as air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at once in receipt of an impression soul is purely passive and impression reveals not only its own existence but that also of its cause just as light displays itself and elements that are in it power to name object resides in understanding first must come impression and understanding having power of utterance expresses in speech affection it receives from object true presentations are distinguished from those that are false by use of memory classification and comparison if sense organ and mind are healthy and provided that an external object can be really seen or heard presentation due to its and distinctness has power to extort assent that always lies in our power to give or to withhold in a context in which people are understood to be rational beings reason is developed out of these notions physics right thumb a partial marble bust of chrysippus that is a roman copy of a hellenistic original louvre museum chrysippus insisted on organic unity of universe as well as correlation and mutual interdependence of all of its parts cicero de natura deorum ii 19 he said universe is soul and guide of itself plutarch de stoicorum repugnantiis 41 following zeno chrysippus determined fiery breath or aether to be primitive substance of universe objects are made up of inert formless matter and an informing soul pneuma provides form to undifferentiated matter pneuma pervades all of substance and maintains unity of universe and constitutes soul of human being classical elements change into one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction fire first becomes solidified air then air into water and lastly water into earth process of dissolution takes place in reverse order earth being rarefied into water water into air and air into fire human soul was divided by chrysippus into eight faculties five senses power of reproduction power of speech and ruling part that is located in chest rather than head individual souls are perishable but according to view originated by chrysippus souls of wise people survive longer after their death no individual soul can however survive beyond periodic conflagration when universe is renewed fate for chrysippus all things happen according to fate what seems to be accidental has always some hidden cause unity of world consists in chain like dependence of cause upon cause nothing can take place without a sufficient cause according to chrysippus every proposition is either true or false and this must apply to future events as well if any motion exists without a cause then not every proposition will be either true or false for that which has not efficient causes is neither true nor false but every proposition is either true or false therefore there is no motion without a cause and if this is so then all effects owe their existence to prior causes and if this is so all things happen by fate it follows therefore that whatever happens happens by fate cicero on fate 20 21 stoic view of fate is entirely based on a view of universe as a whole individual things and persons only come into consideration as dependent parts of this whole everything is in every respect determined by this relation and is consequently subject to general order of world if his opponents objected that if everything is determined by destiny there is no individual responsibility since what has been once foreordained must happen come what may chrysippus replied that there is a distinction to be made between simple and complex predestination becoming ill may be fated whatever happens but if a person s recovery is linked to consulting a doctor then consulting doctor is fated to occur together with that person s recovery and this becomes a complex fact referencing cicero on fate 28 9 all human actions in fact our destiny are decided by our relation to things or as chrysippus put it events are co fated to occur non destruction of one s coat he says is not fated simply but co fated with its being taken care of and someone s being saved from his enemies is co fated with his fleeing those enemies and having children is co fated with being willing to lie with a woman for many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things since he says it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort but it will be in our power he says with what is in our power being included in fate in eusebius praeparatio evangelica vi 8 quoted in thus our actions are predetermined and are causally related to overarching network of fate but nevertheless moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own one all determining power is active everywhere working in each particular being according to its nature whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects every action is brought about by co operation of causes depending on nature of things and character of agent our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone without any co operation on part of our wills with external causes virtue and vice are set down as things in our power for which consequently we are responsible moral responsibility depends only on freedom of will and what emanates from our will is our own no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not this rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft determinism or divination right thumb cleromancy in ancient greece chrysippus accepted divination as part of causal chain of fate chrysippus also argued for existence of fate based on divination which he thought there was good evidence for it would not be possible for diviners to predict future if future itself was accidental omens and portents he believed are natural symptoms of certain occurrences there must be countless indications of course of providence for most part unobserved meaning of only a few having become known to humanity to those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained he replied that both divination and our behaviour under warnings which it affords are included in chain of causation god stoics believed that universe is god and chrysippus affirmed that universe itself is god and universal outpouring of its soul cicero de natura deorum i 15 it is guiding principle of universe operating in mind and reason together with common nature of things and totality which embraces all existence based on these beliefs physicist and philosopher max bernhard weinstein identified chrysippus as a pandeist max bernhard welt und aus religion philosophie und world and life views emerging from religion philosophy and nature 1910 page 233 dieser der von aus 280 208 v chr soll ist schon eine mit dem gott ist die welt als diese aus seiner substanz durch und ist und und er sich mit seiner substanz durch sie noch chrysippus sought to prove existence of god making use of a teleological argument if there is anything that humanity cannot produce being who produces it is better than humanity but humanity cannot produce things that are in universe heavenly bodies etc being therefore who produces them is superior to humanity but who is there that is superior to humanity except god therefore god exists cicero de natura deorum iii 10 cf ii 6 for fuller version of this argument chrysippus spoke of god and gods interchangeably he interpreted gods of traditional greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of one reality cicero tells us that he further maintained that aether is that which people call zeus and that air which permeates seas is poseidon and that earth is what is known by name of demeter and he treated in similar style names of other gods in addition universe exists for benefit of universal god we should infer in case of a beautiful dwelling place that it was built for its owners and not for mice we ought therefore in same way to regard universe as dwelling place of gods cicero de natura deorum iii 10 theodicy in response to question of how evil could exist in a good universe chrysippus replied evil cannot be removed nor is it well that it should be removed plutarch de stoicorum repugnantiis 1051 b firstly he argued following plato that it was impossible for good to exist without evil for justice could not be known without injustice courage without cowardice temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness aulus gellius vii 1 secondly apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature s goodness thus it was necessary for human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility but this superior utility meant that skull is vulnerable to blows thirdly evils are distributed according to rational will of zeus either to punish wicked or because they are important to world order as a whole plutarch de stoicorum repugnantiis 1050 e de communibus notitiis 1065 b thus evil is good under disguise and is ultimately conducive to best chrysippus compared evil to coarse jest in comedy for just as jest though offensive in itself improves piece as a whole so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself yet allow that taken with all else it has its use plutarch de communibus notitiis 1065 d mathematics thumb right puzzle of democritus if a cone is sliced horizontally are surfaces produced equal or unequal chrysippus regarded bodies surfaces lines places void and time as all being infinitely divisible he determined one of principal features of infinite set since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do universe and a man it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger nor that universe has more parts than a man chrysippus also responded to a problem first posed by democritus plutarch de communibus notitiis if a cone is divided by a plane parallel to its base are surfaces of segments equal or unequal if they are equal then cone becomes a cylinder if they are unequal then surface of cone must be stepped reply of chrysippus was that surfaces are both equal and unequal chrysippus was in effect negating law of excluded middle with respect to equal and unequal and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus namely limit and process of convergence towards a limit chrysippus was notable for claiming that one is a number one was not always considered a number by ancient greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are measured aristotle in his metaphysics wrote a measure is not things measured but measure or one is beginning of number chrysippus asserted that one had magnitude one iamblichus in ii 8f in kroll 140 9f although this was not generally accepted by greeks and iamblichus wrote that magnitude one was a contradiction in terms ethics right thumb greek amphora depicting euripides medea chrysippus regarded medea as a prime example of how bad judgments could give rise to irrational passions galen on doctrines of hippocrates and plato iii 3 13 22 iv 2 27 iv 6 19 27 see also epictetus discourses i 28 6 10 ii 17 19 23 for an example of this play being discussed in setting of a stoic school chrysippus taught that ethics depended on physics in his physical theses he stated for there is no other or more appropriate way of approaching subject of good and evil on virtues or happiness than from nature of all things and administration of universe goal of life said chrysippus is to live in accordance with one s experience of actual course of nature a person s individual nature is part of nature of whole universe diogenes laertius vii 87 and thus life should be lived in accordance with one s own human nature as well as that of universe diogenes laertius vii 88 human nature is ethical and humanity is akin to divine emanating from primal fire or aether which though material is embodiment of reason and people should conduct themselves accordingly people have freedom and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires lust riches position in life domination etc and in subjecting will to reason chrysippus laid greatest stress on worth and dignity of individual and on power of will stoics admitted between good and bad a third class of things indifferent of things morally indifferent best includes health and riches and honour and worst includes sickness and poverty chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to preferred indifferent things as good but wise person said chrysippus uses such things without requiring them practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in individual in other words there is such a thing as moral progress and character has to be built up on passions stoics sought to be free of unruly emotions which they regarded as being contrary to nature passions or emotions pathe are disturbing element in right judgment chrysippus wrote a whole book on passions concerning therapy of emotions passions are like diseases which depress and crush soul thus he sought to eradicate them wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own just as when one has started running it is difficult to stop one cannot hope to eradicate emotions when one is in heat of love or anger this can only be done when one is calm therefore one should prepare in advance and deal with emotions in mind as if they were present by applying reason to emotions such as greed pride or lust one can understand harm which they cause see also
