thumb 200px icon of photius from an image of a fresco in saint sophia s cathedral kiev photian schism was a four year 863 867 schism between episcopal sees of rome and constantinople issue centered around right of byzantine emperor to depose and appoint a patriarch without approval from papacy in 857 ignatius was deposed or compelled to resign as patriarch of constantinople under byzantine emperor michael iii for political reasons he was replaced following year by photius pope nicholas i despite previous disagreements with ignatius objected to what he considered improper deposition of ignatius and elevation of photius a layman in his place after his legates exceeded their instructions in 861 by certifying photius s elevation nicholas reversed their decision in 863 by condemning photius situation remained same until 867 west had been sending missionaries to bulgaria in 867 photius called a council and excommunicated nicholas and entire western church that same year high ranking courtier basil i usurped imperial throne from michael iii and reinstated ignatius as patriarch after ignatius died in 877 photius was brought back but an agreement between him and pope john viii prevented a second schism photius was deposed again in 886 and spent his years in retirement condemning west for its alleged heresy main problem was papal claim to jurisdiction in east not accusations of heresy schism arose largely as a struggle for ecclesiastical control of southern balkans and because of a personality clash between heads of two sees both of whom were elected in year 858 and both of whose reigns ended in 867 by death in case of pope by first of two depositions for patriarch photian schism thus differed from what occurred in 11th century when pope s authority as a first among equals was challenged on grounds of having lost that authority through heresy photian schism polarized east and west for centuries partially over a false but widespread belief in a second excommunication of photius this idea was finally debunked in 20th century which has helped rehabilitate photius to some degree in west background in years shortly before 858 byzantine empire emerged from a time of turmoil and entered into a period of relative stability following crisis over byzantine iconoclasm for nearly 120 years from 720 to 843 byzantines waged war with each other over legitimacy of religious art specifically whether that art constituted idol worship or merely legitimate veneration with only latter being acceptable according to christian standards emperors generally took side of iconoclasts who unlike believed that such images were idolatrous situation reached a high point in 832 when emperor theophilos issued a decree banning worship of idols in roman empire a number of people including monks and bishops were put in prison after they were discovered to have created sacred images or written in their defense in 842 theophilos died he was succeeded by his wife theodora who in 843 restored veneration of icons she was at first opposed to restoration but her mind was changed by eunuch theoktistos and his relative magister sergius period after iconoclasm was generally peaceful but not entirely tranquil patriarch methodius i accommodated former iconoclasts in church provided they renounce their heresy he was opposed by certain extremist monks particularly of stoudios monastery methodius excommunicated many of them before his death in 847 there was an intense struggle to succeed him election ended with selection of monk ignatius who took a hardline stance on officials in empire who had been or still were iconoclasts in one instance archbishop gregory asbestas visited new patriarch before his coronation to do him homage whereupon ignatius told gregory that because he a suspected iconoclast had not been formally cleared he could not attend coronation ceremony gregory stormed out and was subsequently excommunicated in a synod for heresy and disobedience he protested in 853 to pope leo iv for reasons unclear holy see allowed his case to continue into reign of leo s successor pope benedict iii furthermore gregory and several other bishops had been condemned for in a synod called by ignatius without papal consent previous patriarchs had consulted bishop of rome before calling a synod of bishops leo complained about this in a letter to patriarch another accusation made by ignatius s enemies was that because he had not been elected in a synod and subsequently confirmed by local emperor instead simply being appointed by theodora he was not a true patriarch lazarus ignatius s envoy to rome had struggled to refute charge which seemed to create papal interest in byzantine affairs beginning thumb left ignatius exile of ignatius schism was initially caused by problems in byzantine court michael iii became emperor in 847 at age of seven while his mother theodora served as regent blackwell dictionary 1999 p 382 his uncle bardas was an influential advisor church law forbade parodies of sacred liturgies but young emperor had them performed for his amusement former court officials testified at fourth council of constantinople 869 870 that they were forced to participate in these false ceremonies meanwhile bardas was credibly accused of committing incest with his daughter in law because of this accusation ignatius publicly denied him eucharist in hagia sophia main church structure of constantinople putting himself in open opposition to imperial court bardas intensified his attempts to consolidate power in 855 he ordered death of theoktistos not long after he conspiring with teenaged michael accused theodora of intrigue and as it was thought inappropriate to kill members of imperial family exiled her to a monastery theodora s deposition made him de facto ruler bardas asked or demanded that ignatius approve of theodora s exile ignatius had been appointed to his position by theodora and apparently out of loyalty to her refused to give his consent several supporters of ignatius organized a plot to murder bardas they were uncovered and beheaded in hippodrome after this took place a man named gebeon claimed that he was theodora s son and rightful king many partisans of ignatius rallied around him he was put on trial and ignatius unwisely undertook his defense he lost case and gebeon was executed ignatius was then arraigned for high treason and exiled to island in sea of marmara in july 857 there is a strong debate over whether or not ignatius resigned patriarchate had he done so his disposition would technically have been valid whereas this would not have been so had he refused contemporary sources provide some contradictions nicetas a contemporary and fierce partisan of ignatius insists that he did not resign he claims that his resignation was demanded of him several times but that each time he refused even when influential court official photius threatened his life at instigation of asbestas council of 869 in condemning photius supports his assertion another contemporary source known as life of st contradicts this in stating that ignatius did resign a decision in which he yielded partly to his on preference and partly to external pressure francis dvornik in his 1948 history of photian schism challenges long held western assertion that ignatius was deposed as evidence he points to fact that nicetas did not directly say that he was deposed only that he did not resign he does however say that pressure on him to do so must have been great election of photius a synod was held to decide on a replacement for ignatius asbestas was a likely candidate but was too partisan a figure to make for peace instead bishops decided on photius photius came from a prominent byzantine family with a reputation for orthodoxy his uncle tarasios was appointed patriarch by iconodule empress irene of athens serving from 784 to 806 tarasios convened second council of nicaea which condemned iconoclasm deciding not to become a monk and to pursue a lay career instead he was a powerful associate of bardas blackwell dictionary 1999 pp 381 382 he was a profound scholar with diverse interests and a wide range of knowledge photius was hurriedly tonsured a monk on december 20 858 and on following four days was successively ordained lector sub deacon deacon and priest he was made patriarch on christmas day this rapid elevation was contrary to western canonical rules but not without precedent in constantinople one of consecrating bishops was asbestas reign of photius and papal intervention reign of photius i was immediately beset by trouble when some bishops and most of monasteries most notably that of refused to recognize him photius held a synod in 859 that declared ignatius no longer patriarch he forbade anyone from taking part in demonstrations against emperor he allegedly arrested several bishops who had been loyal to ignatius supporters of ignatius sought aid of pope nicholas i despite difficulties papacy had experienced with ignatius pope strongly disapproved of what he considered to be irregular nature of his apparent deposition he at first hesitated but eventually sent a delegation to constantinople to assess matter it consisted of two legates bishops radoald of porto and zachary of anagni pope wrote to photius expressing satisfaction at his orthodox profession of faith he reproved his hurried uncanonical consecration but promising that if legates examination into conduct of ignatius supported accusations made he would accept photius as patriarch reserving judgement to himself legates attended a council which was held in may 861 bishops knew that their instructions were only to report their findings back to rome and not make any final decision nevertheless photius refused to reconvene council unless there would be a decision from legates on spot as to validity of his office they agreed supposedly through bribery to accept photius as patriarch exceeding their powers and perhaps under pressure from imperial court they disobeyed their instructions photius also seems to have made use of adulation in bringing them to their decision in one of his sermons supposedly delivered in legates presence he said byzantine theology tended to diminish role of pope at best it acknowledged pope as first among equals eastern christians rejected his ability to unilaterally define dogma or to have any greater material authority than other bishops dvornik notes that council marked first time that east acknowledged right of west to try a byzantine patriarch nevertheless nicholas i eventually disavowed their choice in 863 he held a synod of his own in rome which annulled proceedings of 861 synod in constantinople condemned photius and reinstated ignatius in doing so he asserted that no council or synod could be called without papal permission legates were summoned before pope to answer for their disobedience zachary confessed to pope that he had exceeded his powers and was forgiven radoald refused to appear before pope was condemned in 864 and was threatened with anathema should he ever again attempt to make contact with photius bulgaria and complication of rome thumb pope nicholas i after nicholas ruled against him photius refused to react he remained silent neither denouncing pope openly nor acting as if anything had happened michael sent nicholas a strongly worded letter attacking papal primacy and use of latin language in nicholas s response he strongly defends superiority of see of rome as only jurisdiction with immutable claims to apostolic tradition he then invited both ignatius and photius to come to rome to argue their cases or to send proxies for this purpose but rivalry erupted at this stage in relation to bulgars khan boris i fought byzantines in a short war that resulted in his capitulation and conversion to christianity and promise to convert his people on being refused a separate patriarch for these new christians by photius boris had invited latin missionaries delegation was led by bishop of porto future pope formosus who actively tried to convert population to latin christianity he denounced byzantine customs of clerical marriage use of leavened instead of unleavened bread in eucharist and omission of filioque in nicene creed mission was met with great success boris asked that formosus be made bulgarian archbishop however he was recalled to rome by nicholas formosus was still serving as bishop of porto canon law forbade anyone from serving as bishop of two diocese at once and nicholas was unwilling to relieve him of his lower duties and give him a promotion historian johann peter kirsch has suggested that he viewed formosus as a rival in 867 photius attacked these latin missionaries for adding filioque to creed he did not make this accusation against western church as whole still less against rome which at that time had not accepted this addition to creed only in late 13th century when filioque was central to byzantine polemics were his arguments adopted and few would refer to them until then filioque literally means and from son in context of nicene creed it was meant to state that holy spirit proceeds not only from father but from son as well west held that term was theologically sound and that pope as vicar of christ and successor to saint peter had right to add it to creed if he wished east rejected both views doctrinal question of relationship between three persons of holy trinity would eventually often find itself subordinated to more personal and politically important question of whether pope had right to add anything to creed at all without consent of other bishops khan boris i of bulgaria would further complicate relations between rome and constantinople by approaching pope nicholas photius was aware of boris s approaches and sought to ease his mind on how to be a christian leader by writing him a lengthy letter called on duties of a prince boris had also asked pope 115 questions which pope nicholas answered in responsa nicolai papae i ad consulta responses of pope nicholas i to questions of bulgars however due to pope s refusal to appoint formosus as archbishop of bulgaria khan once again turned to byzantium which granted bulgaria autocephalous status during fourth council of constantinople in 865 boris received baptism under name michael in honor of byzantine emperor further north than bulgaria in greater moravia slavic prince asked photius to send byzantine missionaries to his jurisdiction photius sent a delegation led by brothers cyril and methodius eventually they sided with west against photius after pope adrian ii authorized their use of slavonic liturgy which they had just invented in 866 michael conspired with basil i to kill bardas alleging that he had been plotting to take over as emperor basil was then installed as co emperor with approval of emperor who feared an advance of franks close to his capital photius invited patriarchs of alexandria antioch and jerusalem to meet in constantinople and pronounce on encroachment into bulgaria this 867 synod took grave step of condemning pope nicholas as a heretic and declaring him deposed he was excommunicated along with anyone who followed him which presumably meant whole church of west blackwell dictionary 1999 p 183 conclusion nicholas died in november 867 before news of this action reached rome in 867 basil assassinated michael and deposed photius replacing him at end of year with exiled ignatius ignatius did not formally reconcile with west but he did take action against photius in a manner to please west fourth council of constantinople held from 869 870 declared that photius never was a bishop thereby invalidating all of his acts he was condemned for his diabolical and fraudulent actions in synod of 867 as well as for his defamatory writings against pope council remembering how photius came to power declared that no man could be raised to rank of bishop without having spent at least ten years in a lower clerical state thumb left 200px pope john viii helped resolve photian schism ignatius upheld byzantine claims to bulgaria no less strongly than photius tensions between rome and constantinople remained ignatius suffering from a shortage of clergy wrote to adrian ii asking that penalties imposed on bishops who had supported photius be lifted adrian refused to oblige ignatius ruled until his death on october 23 877 before dying he had made a secret agreement with basil i and photius to restore former patriarch to throne this was duly carried out with photius retaking his former position as patriarch on october 26 this was witnessed in shock by papal legates paul and eugene they had received no instructions from pope john viii on what to do in such a course of events possibly remembering fate of radoald and zachary legates did nothing pope was probably satisfied with their cautious performance basil however was frustrated by delay and he wrote to john viii asking that he recognize photius and making it clear that photius s election had been accepted virtually unanimously as proof he forwarded letters of assent from three other eastern patriarchs simultaneously basil acknowledged pope to be head of universal church pope john was probably displeased by photius s elevation but understanding political realities proposed a compromise in his letter to basil he acknowledged with gratitude emperor s submission invoking biblical passage in which jesus instructed peter first pope to feed my sheep john released photius and his bishops from applied to them invoking his power to bind and loose he promised to accept photius as patriarch but demanded that he apologize before a synod of bishops for his past conduct this last request proved to be a major obstacle photius insisted that his actions in 867 were justified in midst of nicholas s interference in eastern church matters in any event he had been sufficiently punished by synod of 869 and had made peace with ignatius before his death this should be enough legates conceded to his demands and on their own authority absolved photius of fulfilling this request in return for an acknowledgement of papal supremacy in bulgaria rome was given nominal authority over bulgaria but actual jurisdiction was in hands of constantinople dvornik calls john s demand for an apology obnoxious arguing that it was entirely unnecessary and would have humiliated photius a council from 879 880 formally reconciled bishop of rome and patriarch of constantinople a letter from pope john viii to photius confirms his assent to actions of his legates aftermath photius served as patriarch for six more years a small group of refused to recognize him but it is unclear how much influence they had in 886 following death of basil leo vi wise became emperor almost immediately leo exacted a resignation from photius and replaced him with his brother stephen i photius was sent to live in a monastery where he spent remainder of his days unmolested sometime during his second exile photius composed on mystagogy of holy spirit in which he sharply criticized western tradition of using filioque in mystagogy he attacks those who accept impious and spurious doctrines that holy spirit is distant and mediated by believing that holy spirit proceeds not from father alone but also from son he says one alienate s holy spirit from father s hypostasis error is equivalent to polytheism because it creates three gods which are distinct from one another rather than being upon all those who believe and teach such doctrines he imposed an anathema overall relations between east and west remained relatively peaceful until shortly before east west schism in 1054 unlike photian schism this one had its primary roots not in politics but in accusations of heresy at time of photian schism pope was still widely recognized in byzantine empire as first among equals only later would it be alleged that he had lost that standing due to heresy legacy photius and schism associated with him have been viewed very differently by catholics and eastern orthodox christians throughout history west has looked upon him as a heretic and schismatic while east has seen him as a hero for his resistance to western encroachment part of reason for polarizing views on photius and events surrounding him was legend of a second excommunication in 880 it was alleged that john viii had changed his mind about recognizing photius around time of council in 880 and had in fact excommunicated him again supposedly this excommunication was maintained by john s successors widespread belief that photius was an arch heretic was challenged by some protestants in 17th century however it was not until 20th century that scholars particularly dvornik began to carefully analyze historical records surrounding events of late 9th century from their research they concluded that no second schism existed this has contributed to a partial rehabilitation of photius references bibliography primary
