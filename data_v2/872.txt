helped shape r e m s sound through reckoning after their debut album murmur 1983 received critical acclaim r e m quickly began working on their second album they wrote new material prodigiously lead guitarist peter buck recalled we were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week we just wanted to do it whenever we had a new batch of songs it was time to record fletcher p 100 because of many new songs band had buck unsuccessfully tried convincing everyone to make next album a double album notorious stuart brothers a date with peter buck bucketfull of brains december 1987 in november 1983 band recorded 22 songs during a session with neil young producer elliot mazer in san francisco fletcher p 99 while mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce band s next album r e m ultimately decided to team up again with murmur producers mitch easter and don dixon instead r e m started recording reckoning at reflection sound in charlotte north carolina on december 8 1983 black p 90 group recorded over two eight day stretches around christmas that year separated by two weeks of canceled studio time that allowed band to perform in greensboro north carolina go see a movie and shoot a video in studio black p p 100 01 while studio diary listed 16 days for recording album sleeve later claimed album was recorded in 14 days while in interviews buck sometimes stated that album was recorded in 11 days producers both disputed that sessions were that short dixon insisted that they were at studio for over 25 days during which he worked eighteen hour days while easter said when i read eleven days i thought what fuck it was twenty days which was still short but it s not eleven fletcher p 101 during recording there was pressure from i r s records to try making album more commercial label sent messages to dixon and easter which producers told band that they would ignore while producers respected i r s president jay boberg they expressed dismay at comments he made when he visited during last day of sessions dixon called boberg record company clueless while easter said i got along with jay boberg ok but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think holy shit because it would strike me as really teenage buck said he was grateful that dixon and easter acted as a buffer between band and its label he said that it got to point where as much as he respected guys at i r s they basically tried to record records so they wouldn t know they were recording them and explained that part of reason why r e m recorded album so quickly was that group wanted to finish before representatives from i r s showed up to listen to it buckley p 99 recording sessions were difficult for lead singer michael stipe who among band was particularly worn out by band s 1983 tour schedule getting usable vocal tracks from stipe was difficult dixon recalled that he and stipe would show up around noon each day before rest of band but that he was kind of shut down and it was difficult to get him to open up while recording song 7 chinese brothers stipe sang so quietly that dixon could not hear him on tape frustrated producer climbed a ladder to a spot above recording booth stipe was in and found a gospel record titled joy of knowing jesus by which he then handed to singer in an attempt to inspire him stipe began reciting liner notes from album audibly which enabled dixon to move on to recording vocal track to 7 chinese brothers p 99 100 initial recitation take was later released in 1987 as voice of harold on compilation dead letter office black p 92 music with reckoning dixon easter and band wanted to capture energy of r e m s live sound buckley p 100 dixon had not seen band perform live before working on murmur after he had done so he had a greater sense of band s strengths and weaknesses dixon wanted guitars to sound more like they did in concert but originally they met resistance from both band and label however by time r e m started recording dixon said group wanted to rock out a bit more buckley p 101 dixon was enamored of binaural recording technique and used it extensively on album easter recalled that dixon made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it to record group in easter s opinion method made drummer bill berry s parts fresher sounding binaural recording also allowed bassist mike mills backing vocals to be loud without obscuring stipe s lead vocals dixon explained mike mills was often singing 12 to 15 feet away from microphones that were recording his part but because it was in a studio binaural field we would tend to hear him as behind stipe buckley p 100 01 biographer david buckley wrote while music moved away from murmurs slightly airless feel subject matter was a little darker buckley p 102 buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in album peter buck of r e m east coast rocker november 30 1988 buckley interpreted that imagery as representing change presented by band s increasing success as well as changing music scene of group s athens georgia hometown song camera addressed death of a friend from athens who died in a car crash buckley p 103 easter said stipe s vocal was so exposed on that track and because of that it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch producer tried to get stipe to sing a better take but singer was more intent on getting feeling of song across and at one point refused to record further buckley p 104 while many of album s songs were new compositions some had been in r e m s show setlists for years particular songs pretty persuasion and don t go back to rockville had been played live as far back as october 1980 band was reluctant to record pretty persuasion as members considered it too old but dixon and easter convinced group to do so buckley p 111 r e m initially planned releasing don t go back to rockville as a non album single between reckoning and its next release when band recorded it for album group rearranged song from its live incarnation and gave it a country music like influence as tribute to its lawyer bertis downs iv who was a fan of country music buckley p 111 12 packaging for cover of reckoning stipe drew a picture of a two headed snake which he then gave to artist howard finster to fill in as a painting stipe stated that imagery was an attempt to define elements explaining part of it is rocks and part of it is sun and part of it sky end result was considered a disappointment as stipe had to work with finster on a long distance basis and reproduction of artwork for album sleeve was problematic fletcher p 106 spine of vinyl version of album features phrase file under water stipe told nme

commercial radio and mtv by that point instead of music industry standard of waiting for mainstream radio stations to pick up band s music i r s hoped to convince reluctant programmers to add group by

gold and platinum search results riaa com retrieved on march 3 2009 rolling stone gave reckoning a four out of five star rating reviewer christopher connelly wrote that in comparison to murmur overall sound is crisper lyrics far more comprehensible and while album may not mark any major strides forward for band r e m s considerable strengths buck s ceaselessly inventive strumming mike mills exceptional bass playing and stipe s evocatively gloomy baritone remain unchanged however connelly felt that stipe s erratic meanderings were an impediment to band that will prevent r e m from transcending cult status nonetheless he concluded r e m s music is able to involve listener on both an emotional and intellectual level joe sasfy of washington post felt that songs on album trump even
