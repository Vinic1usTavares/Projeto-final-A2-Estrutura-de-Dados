premier frederick w a g haultain in 1903 federal government at instigation of his brother who was now one of its ministers made arthur sifton chief justice of northwest territories when alberta was created out of a portion of northwest territories in 1905 sifton became its first chief justice in 1910 government of alberta premier alexander cameron rutherford was embroiled in alberta and great waterways railway scandal liberal lieutenant governor of alberta george bulyea determined that for sake of liberal party of alberta rutherford had to be pushed aside in favour of a new premier when other prominent liberals declined it position was offered to sifton as premier he smoothed over divisions in party that had caused and been exacerbated by railway scandal he made attempts to break with rutherford railway policy when these were rebuffed by courts he adopted a course similar to rutherford s he unsuccessfully pursued transfer of rights over alberta s natural resources from federal government which had retained them by terms of alberta s provincehood while sifton was premier united farmers of alberta rose as a political force sifton tried to accommodate many of their demands his government constructed agricultural colleges incorporated a farmer run grain elevator cooperative and implemented a municipal system of hail insurance outside of agriculture ufa was instrumental in sifton government s implementation of some direct democracy measures which resulted in prohibition and extension of vote to women during conscription crisis of 1917 sifton supported conservative prime minister robert borden in his attempt to impose conscription to help win first world war he backed creation of a union government composed of conservatives and pro conscription liberals in 1917 he left provincial politics and became a minister in this government over next three and a half years he served briefly in four different ministries and was a delegate to paris peace conference of 1919 he died in ottawa in january 1921 after a brief illness early life arthur sifton was born october 26 1858 in ontario to john wright sifton 1833 1912 and catherine kate watkins 1832 1909 perry craig 2006 p 243 hall p 20 he was older brother of politician clifford sifton he attended public schools across southern ontario culminating with a boys school in dundas and high school in london his father was a devout methodist and a staunch reformer and later liberal these allegiances permeated his home life sifton household was often visited by clergy laity businessmen lawyers and politicians in 1874 or 1875 john sifton won contracts for preliminary construction work on canadian pacific railway cpr and moved family to winnipeg where arthur completed high school at wesley college following his graduation he and clifford attended victoria college then located in cobourg ontario in 1880 he graduated with a bachelor of arts while in cobourg he was not a devoted student he skipped many classes and was judged by his classmates to be intellectually morally physically and erratically preeminent in virtue and otherwise especially otherwise thumb left sifton front row right as calgary s city solicitor graduation arthur sifton returned to winnipeg to article with albert monkman until 1881 when he followed his father to brandon hall p 21 john hoped to take advantage of a local real estate boom nominally arthur was running a brandon branch of monkman s law firm though he had not yet finished his articling and was accordingly unqualified to practise law on september 20 1882 he married mary deering of cobourg pair would have two children nellie louise sifton born august 1883 and lewis raymond st clair sifton born february 1898 in 1883 he wrote and passed his bar exam and joined clifford s brandon law firm now styled sifton and sifton university of alberta historian david hall describes next phase of sifton s life as shrouded in mystery for reasons that are not clear in 1885 sifton dissolved his partnership with his brother and moved his family to prince albert hall speculates that brothers had a falling out but notes that their later working relationship appears to have been amicable hall p 22 in 1885 prince albert s prospects did not appear bright as it had been bypassed by cpr line regardless sifton practised law and was in 1885 made a notary public three years later he earned a master of arts from victoria college and a bachelor of laws from university of toronto in 1889 he relocated again to calgary there is some suggestion that this move was for sake of his wife s health there he opened a law office worked in office of city solicitor and became a partner in firm of sifton short and stuart at one point he was a crown prosecutor in 1892 he was appointed queen s counsel early political career sifton s first foray into politics was in 1878 when he campaigned for introduction of prohibition under auspices of canada temperance act in manitoba electoral districts of lisgar and marquette his first bid for elected office took place in 1882 when he was elected to brandon s first city council he was re elected in 1883 and did not seek re election at conclusion of this second term though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected he also served on local school board when his brother clifford became wilfrid laurier s minister of interior in november 1896 sifton advised him on liberal party affairs in western canada this advice included suggested patronage appointments one of which was an unimplemented proposal that arthur himself be appointed chief justice of northwest territories a position that did not at time exist in 1898 sifton re entered politics hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship by challenging robert brett long time member of legislative assembly of northwest territories for banff in 1898 territorial election election day returns showed sifton with a plurality of thirty six votes but by time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for brett sifton successfully challenged this result in court and in ensuing by election he defeated brett by a comfortable margin one oft repeated anecdote from campaign involved a campaign forum for which brett was late after giving his own speech sifton offered to give still absent brett s speech as well since he had heard it so many times hall p 22 23 he did so and when brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to one sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by audience s amusement hall p 23 having defeated brett sifton was immediately one of area s most prominent liberals and was named president of district of alberta liberals shortly thereafter in 1901 clifford sifton appointed james hamilton ross northwest territories treasurer and minister of public works commissioner of yukon it fell to northwest territories premier frederick william gordon haultain to fill ensuing vacancy and to preserve delicate non partisan balance of his administration he had to pick a successor who was like ross a liberal role fell to sifton soon after his appointment clifford offered him his sought after position of northwest territories chief justice arthur declined on basis of his recently assumed ministerial duties but made it clear that he was still interested in receiving it eventually as minister sifton had to cope with increasing expenses and with grants from federal government that did not keep pace he dealt with this through support for territorial autonomy creation of one or more new provinces from northwest territories campaigning on this position he was re elected in 1902 territorial election months later however t h maguire retired as territorial chief justice and this time sifton accepted his brother s offer of position he resigned his political offices in january 1903 career as a jurist despite accusations of nepotism that greeted his appointment on january 3 1903 sifton fast became a well respected judge he served as chief justice of northwest territories until september 16 1907 when supreme court of alberta was established whereupon he headed this new court sitting in calgary as first chief justice of alberta he was notoriously difficult for barristers to read he generally heard arguments smoking a cigar and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long time nickname of sphinx for his in one trial he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides lengthy closing arguments and once they concluded immediately delivered his judgment hall p 24 bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments once sifton had left courtroom they found their answer in form of page after page covered with judge s signature he rarely recorded his ratio decidendi but despite this few of his decisions were overturned on appeal it has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons much of his work was in criminal law dealing especially with theft of livestock in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour severe by standards of day by end of his judicial career he had convicted as many americans as canadians his rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory based more on social morality than legal precedent and he did not establish any important precedents in 1907 sifton was one member of a three member commission assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators his colleagues were mining executive lewis and miners union executive william thomas p 48 miners demands included increased wages thomas p 47 a reduction in working hours to eight per day from ten posting of mine inspection reports isolated storage of explosives use of non freezing explosives and semi monthly rather than monthly pay mine operators objected to this last point on basis that many miners did not report to work day after payday and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum commission recommended that children under sixteen should not be allowed to work in mines that inspectors should post their reports that mine sites should have bath houses and that ventilation inspection should be improved it also recommended that albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during summer for winter use commission was silent on wages except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation operation of company stores a sore point among miners and incorporation of mine unions which was recommended by mines but opposed by unions thomas p 48 49 it made no recommendation about working hours but premier alexander rutherford s government legislated an eight hour day anyway thomas p 49 he resigned from bench on may 25 1910 to become premier premier ascension and cabinet building in 1910 liberal government of alexander cameron rutherford was embroiled in alberta and great waterways a gw railway scandal accusations of favouritism by government towards alberta and great waterways railway had split liberal party and rutherford s ability to remain at its head was in doubt lieutenant governor george bulyea a liberal who had reluctantly asked rutherford to form a government in 1905 saw his doubts about premier s leadership skills validated and quietly began looking for candidates to replace him and save liberal party thomas p 87 several possibilities including william henry cushing peter talbot and frank oliver were considered and either rejected or found to be uninterested in job thomas p 88 as early as march 14 bulyea had concluded that sifton might be only permanent solution though it was not until may that lieutenant governor was able to secure rutherford s agreement to resign and agreement of both major factions in liberal caucus to accept sifton as premier thomas p 89 even up until last minute members of legislative assembly mlas loyal to charles wilson cross province s attorney general and a staunch rutherford ally threatened to scuttle arrangement unless cross was kept on as attorney general to which sifton refused to agree thomas p 90 on may 26 rutherford resigned and arthur sifton became second premier of alberta hall p 25 thumb left sifton addressing a political meeting in august of his first challenges was to craft a cabinet satisfactory to all factions this he did by excluding leaders of all sides thomas p 91 he himself took portfolios of public works and provincial treasurer charles r mitchell who like sifton had been a judge during scandal and had accordingly played no part in it became minister of education and attorney general thomas p 90 91 archibald j mclean was named provincial secretary his support for insurgents though not as one of their leaders was offset by continuation of rutherford s agriculture minister duncan marshall who had played no particular role during scandal but had remained loyal to rutherford to consternation of opposition conservatives bulyea prorogued legislation before this new government s strength could be tested by a vote of confidence still its acceptance by liberal caucus can be measured by fact that only one member ezra riley resigned in protest thomas p 93 riley objected to exclusion from cabinet of insurgency leader w h cushing after his resignation he ran as an independent liberal in ensuing by election but was defeated by sifton supporter archibald j mcarthur thomas p 94 as time began to heal old wounds sifton expanded his cabinet to include several of old adversaries in february 1912 cross was re instated as attorney general and rebel leader john r boyle was made minister of education mitchell who had previously held both of these posts was transferred to public works portfolio thomas p 125 other new additions to cabinet malcolm mckenzie as provincial treasurer and charles stewart in new position of minister of municipal affairs had voted with rutherford government during scandal thomas p 113 thomas p 84 another early challenge for new premier was to win a seat in legislative assembly of alberta although he lived and worked in calgary his first cabinet was composed mostly of southern members mclean represented lethbridge district marshall represented olds and mitchell would soon be elected in medicine hat so sifton had archibald campbell resign his vermilion seat and sought election there sifton made few promises during campaign though he did identify as his priorities development of alberta s agricultural and mining resources and transportation facilities despite accusations by conservatives that liberals bought foreign vote with beer whiskey and tobacco he won a comfortable majority railway policy before resigning rutherford s government had called a royal commission into alberta and great waterways affair and this commission had not reported by time that sifton took office thomas p 95 between that and proroguing of legislature new premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until november 10 when legislature reconvened conservative leader edward michener attacked government s speech from throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked sifton for failing to call a general election or seek confidence of legislature during his first half year in office thomas p 107 108 in meantime sifton was facing a breach in his own party on railway question many liberals from south of province including sifton himself felt inclined to abandon construction of pioneer railways such as alberta and great waterways railway designed to hasten settlement of province s emptier areas and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres thomas p 109 members from north of province who comprised most of liberal caucus disagreed and were vehement in their insistence that a gw be built thomas p 110 111 even among this latter group there were divisions some liberals agreed with conservatives that railway should be directly built by government while others including cross favoured a partnership with a responsible company thomas p 111 these divisions were not calmed by release of commission s report whose majority condemned rutherford and cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour thomas p 106 it was against this backdrop that sifton announced his government s policy with respect to alberta and great waterways railway company because it had failed to meet its construction obligations sifton introduced legislation to confiscate proceeds of sale of government guaranteed bonds sold to finance railway s construction thomas p 110 he gave no indication of how money which was being held in trust by several banks would be used cross s faction of primarily northern liberals opposed bill on grounds that it did not commit government to using money to construct railway while conservatives opposed it as an unjustified confiscation of private property thomas p 111 112 as conservative r b bennett said bill is an act of confiscation an act such as never before has been carried out in british empire an act such as has few equals in pages of history similar acts have been carried out once in nicaragua and virginia and in south carolina and only in times of war or revolution in my opinion bargain was an improvident one but that does not justify confiscation i did not think new road would pay but it is a new doctrine that because a bargain did not pay it should be repudiated and one should become a of bargains and a of private rights thomas p 112 in speaking of a gw president william clarke an american bennett went on to say clarke i despise but clarke i am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if i know united states i do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of law conservatives however had not been expected to support legislation real question was whether sifton could command enough support among liberals to pass it after all during alberta and great waterways crisis only nine months earlier a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed rutherford government s handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty three votes to fifteen would sifton s bill effectively a repudiation of rutherford policy convince enough liberals to change sides answer came in december when bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty five votes to fourteen nine liberals had reversed themselves and saved sifton s government though both cross and rutherford were among those to vote against it thomas p 112 113 despite calls from clarke for federal government to use its power of reservation to stop legislation bulyea granted royal assent december 16 sifton in his capacity as provincial treasurer immediately tried to access money royal dominion and union banks where funds were deposited refused payment attorney general mitchell sued banks on november 4 1911 justice charles allan stuart of supreme court of alberta found in government s favour thomas p 121 royal bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned federal government to use its powers of disallowance to strike down provincial act hall p 27 in meantime sifton announced a new railway policy that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with assistance of provincial loan guarantees including several pioneer lines this policy in its resemblance to rutherford policy met with approval of cross faction and liberals were once more united thomas p 121 122 in 1912 justice stuart s ruling was upheld by supreme court of alberta en banc thomas p 127 again royal bank appealed and on january 31 1913 judicial committee of privy council which was at time canada s highest judicial authority found for royal bank ruling that provincial government did not have right to confiscate money raised outside of province thomas p 127 128 on september 22 sifton announced new management of ag w agreeable to bondholders government and banks thomas p 148 conservatives protested that other companies were prepared to construct railroad for less than sum agreed on with a gw to which sifton replied that privy council s ruling meant that government could not use money raised to deal with any other company thomas p 149 150 conservatives filibustered legislation and moved a series of amendments including one calling for scheme to be put to referendum but liberals voted unanimously in its favour thomas p 150 alberta and great waterways saga had reached its end and sifton s caucus was never more united natural resources when alberta and saskatchewan were made provinces in 1905 federal government retained control over their lands and natural resources which made new provinces unique in canada thomas p 8 rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs because terms of confederation had been drawn up by liberal government of sir wilfrid laurier it was natural for provincial liberal party to cast itself as their defender thomas p 25 26 in this capacity rutherford pointed to 375 000 per year that provincial government received from federal government as compensation babcock p 27 28 in 1910 however liberal mla alwyn bramley moore who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called alberta s first separatist by edmonton journal moved a resolution calling on sifton government to take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern thomas p 114 115 sifton responded that it was already intention of his government to begin negotiations with federal government to this end thomas p 115 he asserted i have always believed that we should administer our mines and timber question is not now whether we would like to control our natural resources but what is best way to get them hall p 30 thumb left upright sifton at coronation of george v of united kingdom after sifton made a trip east and spoke on subject of provincial resource control to canadian club of toronto where his points were well received in may 1910 sifton and saskatchewan premier walter scott met with laurier in ottawa where he was able to secure prime minister s agreement that if liberals were re elected in 1911 federal election they would transfer to alberta control over its resources this election was fought primarily on issue of reciprocity which was popular in alberta and sifton campaigned actively for laurier distinguishing himself from his brother who broke with laurier on reciprocity thomas p 120 121 despite winning six of alberta s seven seats liberals were defeated nationally by robert borden s conservatives thomas p 116 initially this did not appear to be a problem borden had long called for transfer of resource control to prairie provinces but when sifton and scott raised issue with new prime minister little action resulted borden stalled for some time and it emerged that he did not wish to buoy fortunes of provincial liberal parties by giving them political victory that would result from transfer of resource control upon outbreak of first world war issue fell out of public prominence and it was not until 1930 that alberta would achieve this long time objective agricultural policy sifton s time as premier corresponded with rise of united farmers of alberta ufa as a political force formed in 1909 by merger of society of equity and alberta farmers association rennie p 34 35 ufa would later become a political party and govern alberta from 1921 until 1935 during sifton s tenure however its entry into direct politics was still several years away and it confined itself to advocating for farmers interests rennie p 89 in a province in which 50 004 people voted in 1909 provincial election ufa claimed an initial membership of 2 100 which climbed to 9 400 in 1913 rennie p 51 moreover these figures did not include many farmers who were active in organization without paying dues ufa was a force to be reckoned with and sifton took notice ufa s first provincial victory took place in 1910 and involved construction of agricultural colleges hall p 31 premier alexander rutherford always a stalwart ally of university of alberta approved a plan to locate alberta s first agricultural college on university s campus in rutherford s home town of strathcona at 1910 ufa convention a resolution proposed putting college in southern alberta though it was supplanted by an edward michener motion calling for ufa s leadership to consult with province on a mutually amenable location rennie p 37 after consultation with ufa sifton agreed that in addition to college agricultural schools would be built around province and that farmers would be guaranteed representation on college s board rennie p 38 in fact sifton held off on establishment of college all together in favour of creation of seven demonstration farms in different regions of province in 1912 government announced creation of agricultural colleges in connection with three of these farms all of them in ridings of provincial cabinet ministers duncan marshall s olds in archibald mclean s lethbridge district and sifton s vermilion thomas p 134 another of ufa s policies called for a single tax on land to replace most other forms of taxation rennie p 42 farmers hoped that this tax would help replace tariffs which made it harder for them to export their produce and shift tax burden towards cities where land values were higher rennie p 44 they also called for a surtax on undeveloped land to curb land speculation and encourage sale of land to farmers on this demand too sifton acted in 1911 1912 he allowed municipalities to levy property taxes and required that rural municipalities tax only land and in 1914 he imposed a provincial tax on undeveloped land to discourage land speculation other ufa motivated acts by sifton s government included abandonment of a 1912 plan to privatize hail insurance it instead enacted a municipal insurance scheme and prohibition of contract clauses that allowed farm machinery companies to avoid responsibility for their products rennie p 45 46 perhaps most important piece of farm legislation passed by sifton s government was incorporation of alberta farmers co operative elevator company afcec thomas p 135 though ufa s first preference was for government ownership and operation of grain elevators which sifton refused rennie p 46 it gladly accepted afcec in which only farmers could hold shares and which was supported by provincial startup loans hall writes that sifton government in effect responded wholly or in part to practically every resolution from 1913 ufa convention related to provincial powers this rate could not sustain itself however especially once first world war began to occupy an increasing share of province s attention and resources during 1916 legislative session government acted on only two of ufa s twenty three demands of that year one to allow sale of gopher poison by ufa locals and one dealing with brand inspection rennie p 128 democratic and moral reform it was not only in agricultural policy that ufa spread its influence organization had a strong progressive bent and advocated direct democracy women s suffrage and prohibition in response to first of these sifton in 1913 introduced direct democracy act though it went somewhat less far than ufa would have liked for example it made no provision for recall of elected officials it did allow for albertans to call a referendum directly by submitting a petition including names of eligible voters totalling ten percent of votes cast in previous provincial election including at least eight percent in each of eighty five percent of province s ridings thomas p 136 conservatives were on record as supporting direct democracy and could therefore criticize bill only in detail thumb left sifton s official portrait by v a large number of signatures required beginning with 1913 election 9 399 signatures were required meant that only an issue capable of galvanizing much of province could lead to a referendum rennie p 126 prohibition was such an issue conservatives were advocates of such a referendum during 1st alberta legislative assembly conservative cornelius had advocated prohibition or failing that a government monopoly on alcohol sales but sifton and his liberals were less enthusiastic thomas p 138 139 they knew boon to government coffers that liquor sales represented and were not eager to alienate either ufa s moral reformers or province s hoteliers and saloonkeepers thomas p 139 once referendum legislation was in place however its advocates wasted no time in 1914 legislature accepted a petition bearing 23 656 names and duly called a referendum on subject thomas p 158 alberta prohibition referendum passed resoundingly and legislature passed prohibition act in spring of 1916 thomas p 159 160 initially new act appeared successful in 1917 there were 5 151 convictions for all crimes across alberta as compared to an annual average of 12 706 over preceding four years thomas p 163 by time province s enforcement of act was exposed as being either deliberately lax or merely futile depending on observer sifton had left office alberta s women especially those of ufa affiliated united farm women of alberta were active in province s moral reform movement rennie p 118 119 they were also active in seeking vote in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at legislature demanding vote sifton asked them did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for vote if you haven t you d better go home because you re not going to get any votes from me hall p 34 35 in october 1914 another delegation arrived bearing signatures of 40 000 people at that time premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of franchise were played out but expressed concern at increases that would result to cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of province s women actually wanted suffrage thomas p 164 in february 1915 a larger delegation arrived at legislature and occupied mlas seats hall p 35 demanding that franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in upcoming prohibition referendum an angry sifton refused and suggested to women that if they wanted vote they should contact their mlas and promise that they would use their votes to re elect them which is after all one of strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature as represented in legislature even so he committed to raising issue in legislature after referendum thomas p 165 on september 17 1915 he told ufa president james speakman that he had given instructions for preparation of a statute placing men and women in alberta on basis of absolute equality so far as provincial matters are concerned true to his word he introduced legislation in spring of 1916 giving women vote in all provincial and municipal elections conservatives supported it enthusiastically and only st albert mla lucien boudreau voted against it though liberal james gray turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader s legislation against his own convictions style and political success arthur sifton s political style was to remain aloof and detached and to say no more than necessary this cemented his reputation as sphinx hall p 38 he was authoritarian and while he inspired respect he was not loved historian l g thomas credits him with holding liberal party together through his strength but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions thomas p 180 sifton was originally selected as premier in hopes that he would lead liberal party to continued dominance of provincial politics in alberta his success in this regard was mixed although he led party to victory in 1913 and 1917 elections its majorities declined each time moreover his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics thomas p 137 142 in advance of 1913 election government sponsored redistribution legislation increased number of ridings from 41 to 56 and left them of unequal size only 103 votes were cast in clearwater in its first election mardon p 51 liberals argued that a model of straight representation by population was inappropriate in a province in which some districts were growing far more quickly than others thomas p 137 david hall has called bill a flagrant gerrymander and ensuing election election in alberta history hall p 33 there being few policy differences separating liberals from conservatives electoral battle was instead an organizational one with two sides accusing one another of bribing ethnic minorities with alcohol and importing elections workers from outside of province to bribe intimidate and mislead rural voters thomas p 142 conservatives also accused liberals of using government paid civil servants to campaign for their re election sifton not confident of victory in his own riding sought election both there and in macleod in event he was defeated there but retained his vermilion riding since 1917 election was held in throes of first world war it was unlikely to be an election as usual indeed conservatives favoured prolonging legislature until end of war thomas p 169 sifton was not willing to go that far but did introduce legislation to re elect by act of legislature twelve mlas who had enlisted in armed forces of these seven were liberals and five conservatives one of liberals joseph stauffer of was killed in action before legislation took effect conservatives supported this legislation though they later cast aspersions on it by suggesting that of liberals re elected two had never left canada a second piece of election legislation provided for two special mlas to be elected by 38 000 albertans serving overseas conservatives protested that two mlas was not sufficient for such a large number of voters especially since clearwater by this time had only 116 eligible voters after a sedate election that liberals won by a slightly reduced majority thomas p 178 179 sifton announced his resignation as premier to enter federal politics thomas p 179 sifton s 1917 victory would be liberals last his successor charles stewart would lose 1921 election to newly political ufa thomas p 204 in thomas s estimation sifton would have faced a similar fate in 1917 if ufa had run candidates then thomas p 207 federal politics thumb right sifton as a federal cabinet conscription crisis of 1917 divided liberal party of canada and this division extended into provincial camp federal liberal leader laurier opposed prime minister borden s proposal to implement wartime conscription a stand which many liberals especially those outside quebec denounced as unpatriotic borden reached out to these liberals to propose a coalition government to be led by him and to include conservatives and pro conscription liberals clifford sifton was a major broker of resulting deal and when question of a suitable alberta representative in cabinet came up arthur sifton was a natural choice thomas p 170 in 1914 he had announced alberta s willingness to sacrifice its last dollar and its last man and was a staunch supporter of conscription hall p 36 he had agreed by august 1917 to join unionist government and resigned as premier in october although he was only 58 at time of joining government his health was suffering he was short of energy and required a car to transport him even several hundred metres from his ottawa residence to house of commons of canada because of this he was given relatively undemanding portfolios minister of customs and inland revenue minister of public works and secretary of state hall has called him among least visible of borden s ministers because of his health and his short tenure in each position he made very little impact despite this sifton was highly regarded by his colleagues borden himself later stated there was no one in whose judgment i placed firmer reliance hall p 37 sifton was appointed to imperial privy council in 1920 new year honours entitling him to style right honourable sifton was one of four canadian delegates to paris peace conference of 1919 along with borden charles doherty and george foster there he acted as vice chair of commission on ports waterways and railways and served on commission on aerial navigation in these capacities he argued for canada to be treated as an independent state at a time when its foreign policy was still managed by united kingdom on june 28 1919 arthur sifton was one of two canadians to sign treaty of versailles death and legacy in january 1921 sifton became ill and took leave from his duties for a few days although his recovery seemed imminent his condition suddenly worsened he died at his home on january 21 at age of 62 borden mourned loss of a public servant of highest ability and of most conspicuous patriotism hall p 39 he was buried in ottawa s beechwood cemetery his public papers are in canadian archives with some legal papers in a legal collection in alberta and others mixed in with those of his brother clifford electoral record as party leader 1917
