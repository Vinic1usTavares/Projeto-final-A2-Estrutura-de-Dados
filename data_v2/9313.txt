which it was compiled annals of ulster reflect viewpoint of counties armagh fermanagh londonderry and northern part of province of connacht it was authored by cathal mac manus a 15th century diocesan

and ecclesiastical events relevant to monastery and environs of clonmacnoise in leinster lalor p 33 193 annals of innisfallen reflect munster viewpoint in particular monastery of in 1630s texts of these annals were compiled into a single enormous compendium known as annals of four masters in process authors sometimes modified chronology and content of some of materials and is thus chronologically untrustworthy however it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost and entry contains longest account of battle battle is also mentioned

medievalist donnchadh o corrain it influenced historiography medieval and modern out of all proportion to its true value o corrain p 200 however historians still recognise it as most important of

in any event engagement took place within an easy day s march of dublin as brian pressed on immediately afterwards to reach town on following day background in 997 at a royal meeting near clonfert brian boru king of munster met with his long time rival mael sechnaill mac domnaill o corrain p 123 who was at time high king of ireland although idea of high kingship is considered mainly an anachronistic invention it came into vogue in 10th century to denote a king who had enforced his power over external territories lalor p 684 mael sechnaill assumed irish high kingship after battle of tara in 980 lalor p 492 684 two kings made a truce by which brian was granted rule over southern half of ireland while mael sechnaill retained northern half and high kingship in honour of this arrangement mael sechnaill handed over to brian hostages he had taken from dublin and leinster and in 998 brian handed over to mael sechnaill hostages of connacht in same year brian and mael sechnaill began co operating against norse of dublin for first time late in 999 however leinstermen historically hostile to domination by either ui neill or king of munster allied themselves with norse of dublin and revolted against brian according to 17th century annals of four masters following prophecy had predicted battle of glenmama battle annals of four masters records that brian and mael sechnaill united their forces and according to annals of ulster they met leinster dublin army at glenmama on thursday 30 december 999 glenmama near lyons hill in county kildare was ancient stronghold of kings of leinster munster meath army defeated leinster dublin army later historians have also seen battle as decisive sources point to high mortality on both sides according to annals of innisfallen which represents a munster perspective gall best part of foreigners of ireland fell therein more partisan cogad gaedel re gallaib indulges in hyperbole jh todd 1867 ed cogad gaedel re

brian s side even cogadh acknowledges that there fell many multitudes of dal cais but no details are provided it says battle was bloody furious red valiant heroic manly rough cruel and heartless and that there had been no greater slaughter since seventh century battle of magh rath o corrain refers to it as a crushing defeat of leinster and dublin while dictionary of english history says battle effectively quelled desperate revolt of leinster and dublin dictionary of english history p 604 tradition records that son of king of danes harold olafsson was killed in retreat and was interred at now obscure cemetery of todd p cxlvi brian took mael morda of leinster prisoner and held him until he received hostages from leinstermen it was alleged that 7000 norse fell in battle macmanus p 276 this was at a time when warfare was fought on a very limited scale and raiding armies generally had between a hundred and two hundred men most importantly defeat left road to dublin free and unimpeded for victorious legions of brian and sack of dublin victory was followed up with an attack on city of dublin brian s forces marched quickly to dublin again confirming a ardclough location for battle reaching town on new year s eve 999 they entered its defences without any great resistance and annals of innisfallen say that on new year s day of january 1000 they burned both settlement itself and nearby sacred grove old irish thor s grove which apparently stood on north side of liffey plunder of town for second time in ten years is described in considerable detail in jh todd 1867 ed cogad gaedel re gallaib london p68 12th century cogadh gaedhil re gallaibh gives two accounts of occupation that brian remained in dublin from christmas day until epiphany 6 january or from christmas day until st brigid s day 1 february later annals of ulster gives a date of 30 december for battle of glenmama while annals of inisfallen dates brian s capture of city two days later to 1 january 1000 hudson p 86 87 according to much more reliable annals of four masters and chronicon scotorum dublin was only occupied for a week by munster forces in any case in 1000 brian plundered city burned norse fortress and expelled its ruler king sigtrygg silkbeard ailbhe mac shamhrain wrote allowance must be made here for poetic license but event itself some picture can be obtained of wealth of trading centre that was dublin alfred p smyth 1975 9 scandinavian york and dublin 2 vols totowa nj dublin ii 209 242 according to account brian having plundered dun fortress entered market area and here seized greatest wealth meanwhile on approach of munster forces king sitriuc had fled northward hoping to obtain asylum among ulstermen his ally mael morda of ui was captured in ignominious circumstances according to cogad gaedel re gallaib jh todd 1867 ed cogad gaedel re gallaib aftermath kingship of leinster was bestowed upon ui candidate dunchad son of who retained this status until he was deposed in 1003 sigtrygg silkbeard returned having found no asylum in north annal accounts concur that he too yielded hostages to brian while annals of innisfallen add that brian in a suitable magnanimous gesture gave fort dun to foreigners ailbhe mac shamhrain wrote implications here is that from this time onwards hiberno scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his munster overlord brian at this stage aspired to an even tighter dominance of dublin that than secured by his rival mael sechnaill mac domnaill ten years earlier there seems to be little doubt that longer term beneficiary of glenn mama was brian alone with renewed confidence he again moved against mael sechnaill mael sechnaill mac domnaill even if his initiatives of 1000 1001 resulted in setbacks one expedition into brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by ui neill another foray was reversed in mide co westmeath and dal cais river fleet was impeded by king of tara and his connachta allies having constructed a barrier across shannon brian however found a way of circumventing hit and early in 1002 brought a large army through to athlone and took hostages of connacht according to cogadh gaedhil re gallaibh sigtrygg s flight from city brought him north first to ulaid and then to aed of cenel neogain hudson p 87 since sigtrygg could find no refuge in ireland he eventually returned submitted to brian gave hostages and was restored to dublin this was three months after brian ended his occupation in february hudson p 86 in meantime sigtrygg may have temporarily turned pirate and been responsible for a raid on st david s in wales brian gave his own daughter by his first wife in marriage to sigtrygg macmanus p 278 brian in turn took as his second wife sigtrygg s mother now thrice married gormflaith cessation of revolt was followed by over a decade of peace in dublin while sigtrygg s men served in armies of brian hudson p 95 however sigtrygg never forgot insult of ulaid and in 1002 he had his revenge when his soldiers served in brian s campaign against ulaid and ravaged their lands mael sechnaill found support of northern kings slipping jaski early irish kingship and succession dublin 2000 p227 felt obliged to submit and a new political order was created capitulation of king of tara left brian as most powerful king in ireland first non ui neill king to achieve such prominence ailbhe mac shamhrain wrote glenn mama gave brian a psychological advantage over king of tara and increased his readiness to break agreement of clonfert as a result of battle he had achieved domination in a meaningful sense of leinster and dublin through achieving effective dominance of dublin brian acquired a military aside from a psychological advantage over mael sechnaill which helped him in his endeavours to reach beyond lordship of leth moga his success in this regard was probably instrumental in tying dublin into sphere of leth moga for at least a century to follow see also battle of tara battle of clontarf notes harald olafsson is listed in annals of four masters as aralt son of and by james henthorn todd p146 as harold son of according to downham p
