siege of varazdin barracks also referred to locally as varazdin s days of war was blockade and capture of yugoslav people s army jna barracks and other facilities in and around city of varazdin during croatian war of independence blockade began on 14 september 1991 quickly escalated into fighting and ended on 22 september with surrender of jna garrison it was part of battle of barracks an effort by croatian armed forces to isolate jna units based at barracks in croatia or capture barracks to provide arms for croatia s nascent army besieging force outnumbered jna garrison in varazdin which was divided among several barracks storage depots and other facilities but jna possessed substantially greater firepower balance shifted in favour of croatian forces after smaller jna posts were captured in first few days of siege until only one barracks along with headquarters of jna 32nd corps remained under jna control at that point commander of 32nd corps major general vladimir trifunovic and civilian authorities in varazdin agreed that remaining jna forces in city would surrender but all those wishing to leave would be permitted to do so leaving their weapons behind capture of 32nd corps weapons was most significant achievement of battle of barracks and greatly augmented capabilities of croatian military after he left croatia trifunovic was indicted for war crimes by croatia tried in absentia and convicted for combat deaths of six croatian soldiers and wounding of dozens of croatian citizens before and during siege he was also prosecuted by yugoslav authorities for treason but subsequently pardoned in 2013 he requested a re trial on his croatian war crimes conviction but died before proceedings could commence background in 1990 ethnic tensions between serbs and croats worsened after electoral defeat of government of socialist republic of croatia by croatian democratic union hdz yugoslav people s army jna confiscated croatia s territorial defence to weapons to minimize resistance on 17 august tensions escalated into an open revolt of croatian serbs centred on predominantly serb populated areas of dalmatian hinterland around knin approximately north east of split parts of lika kordun banovina and eastern croatia in january 1991 serbia supported by montenegro and serbia s provinces of vojvodina and kosovo unsuccessfully tried to obtain yugoslav presidency s approval for a jna operation to disarm croatian security forces request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between serb insurgents and croatian special police in march prompted jna itself to ask federal presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency even though request was backed by serbia and its allies jna request was refused on 15 march serbian president slobodan milosevic preferring a campaign to expand serbia rather than to preserve yugoslavia with croatia as a federal unit publicly threatened to replace jna with a serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized authority of federal presidency threat caused jna to abandon plans to preserve yugoslavia in favour of expansion of serbia as jna came under milosevic s control by end of march conflict had escalated with first fatalities in early april leaders of serb revolt in croatia declared their intention to amalgamate areas under their control with serbia these were viewed by government of croatia as breakaway regions at beginning of 1991 croatia had no regular army to bolster its defence croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 000 most effective part of croatian police force was 3 000 strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines there were also 9 000 10 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies but they lacked weapons in response to deteriorating situation croatian government established croatian national guard zng in may by expanding special police battalions into four all professional guards brigades under ministry of defence control and commanded by retired jna general martin spegelj four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 000 troops reserve police also expanded to 40 000 was attached to zng and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions guards brigades were only units of zng that were fully equipped with small arms throughout zng there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above brigade level shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that zng resorted to using world war ii weapons taken from museums and film studios at time croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 000 previously owned by police to replace personnel lost to guards brigades a new 10 000 strong special police was established prelude views of croatian leadership on how to deal with jna s role in croatian serb revolt gradually evolved between january and september 1991 croatian president franjo tudman s initial plan was to win european community ec and united states support so he dismissed advice to seize jna barracks and storage facilities in country this course of action was first advocated by spegelj in late 1990 he again urged tudman to act while jna fought slovenia s to in ten day war in june july 1991 spegelj s calls were echoed by sime dodan who succeeded spegelj as defence minister in july spegelj remained in command of zng tudman s initial stance was based on his belief that croatia could not win a war against jna zng was therefore limited to defensive operations even though actions of jna appeared to be coordinated with croatian serb forces this impression was reinforced by buffer zones established by jna after fighting between croatian serb militia and zng jna often intervened after zng had lost territory leaving croatian serbs in control of areas they had captured before jna stepped in jna provided some weapons to croatian serbs although most of their weaponry was sourced from serbia s to and serbian ministry of internal affairs in july 1991 spegelj and dodan s advice was supported by a number of croatian parliament members in response tudman dismissed dodan same month he was appointed defence minister and spegelj resigned his command of zng on 3 august deteriorating situation in eastern croatia including jna expulsion of zng troops from baranja intermittent fighting around osijek vukovar and vinkovci increasing losses and growing conviction that jna were actively supporting croatian serb revolt forced tudman to act on 22 august he issued an ultimatum to federal yugoslav authorities demanding withdrawal of jna to its barracks by end of month ultimatum stated that if jna failed to comply croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action on 1 september ec proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by yugoslav presidency and by tudman despite his earlier ultimatum conference started on 7 september but only four days later croatian member and chair of presidency stjepan mesic ordered jna to return to its barracks within 48 hours this order was motivated by tudman s concern that conference would drag on while zng lost territory even though order was opposed by other members of presidency it gave croatia justification to openly confront jna prime minister franjo greguric advised tudman to implement spegelj s plan according to general anton tus tudman ordered zng to capture jna barracks on 12 september but rescinded order next day order was reinstated on 14 september after tus pleaded with tudman to re authorize action arguing that zng was running out of time same day zng and croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all jna facilities it had access to beginning battle of barracks this action comprised blockades of 33 large jna garrisons in croatia and numerous smaller facilities including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots order of battle varazdin was garrison
