thumb 300px gospel of jesus wife recto gospel of jesus wife is a papyrus fragment with coptic text that includes words jesus said to them my wife text received widespread attention when first publicized in 2012 for implication that some early christians believed that jesus was married fragment was first presented by harvard divinity school professor karen l king who suggested that papyrus contained a fourth century coptic translation of a gospel likely composed in greek in late second century following an investigative atlantic article by ariel sabar published online in june 2016 king conceded that evidence now presses in direction of forgery radiocarbon dating determined that papyrus is medieval and further analysis of language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from gospel of thomas fragment s provenance and similarity to another fragment from same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval papyrus publication after professor karen king s announcement of existence of a papyrus fragment featuring words jesus said to them my wife at international congress of coptic studies in rome on september 18 2012 scholarly publication of text with commentary was slated for harvard theological review in january 2013 on january 3 2013 king and dodgson director of communications for harvard divinity school confirmed to cnn that publication was being delayed pending results of in dodgson s words further testing and analysis of fragment including testing by independent laboratories with resources and specific expertise necessary to produce and interpret reliable results a revised version of article appeared in harvard theological review in april 2014 together with several scientific reports on testing of papyrus in response to ariel sabar s article in atlantic harvard theological review issued a statement saying that it had never committed itself to authenticity of papyrus and refused to print a retraction of king s article retraction watch called journal s decision a cop out of biblical proportions text one side of fragmentary text reads word for word not to me my mother gave me life disciples said to jesus deny mary is not worthy of it jesus said to them my wife she is able to be my disciple let wicked people swell up as for me i am with her in order to an image opposite side of text reads word for word my moth er three forth next two lines of this side feature illegible ink traces features fragment is rectangular approximately according to reports fragment has eight incomplete lines of writing on one side and is badly damaged on other side with only three faded words and a few letters of ink that are visible even with use of infrared photography and computer aided enhancement king and annemarie luijendijk an associate professor of religion at princeton university named fragment gospel of jesus s wife for reference purposes but have since acknowledged that name was inflammatory asked about her handling of public disclosure of fragment king admitted that she had misjudged just how inflammatory that title would turn out to be according to tom bartlett of chronicle of higher education she s been asking around for ideas on a new less exciting name they further suggested text was written by egyptian christians before ad 400 it is in language they believed was used by those people at that time they considered that papyrus fragment comes from a codex rather than a scroll as text appears on both sides king has stated that fragment should not be taken as proof that historical jesus got married testing has dated papyrus itself to somewhere between seventh and ninth centuries and professor christian askeland of indiana wesleyan university has shown that text is written in lycopolitan a coptic dialect that fell out of use during or prior to sixth century with reference to speculative source of text on fragment king and luijendijk used term gospel in a capacious sense as it includes all early christian writings about jesus career initial interpretations of text king told international congress of coptic studies that text does not prove that jesus had a wife she noted that even as a translation of a 2nd century ad greek text it would still have been written more than 100 years after death of jesus according to king earliest and most reliable information about jesus is silent on question of his marital status king also said that text which she suggested is a fragment from a non canonical gospel showed that some early christians believed that jesus was married a harvard news office article reported that king dated speculative greek original to second half of second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time particularly gospel of thomas gospel of mary and gospel of philip king later in a 2012 television documentary commented on possible implication of papyrus fragment ben witherington professor of new testament interpretation at asbury theological seminary said that while text might contribute to study of gnosticism in 2nd or 4th century it should not be considered significant for those studying jesus in a 1st century historical context he further explained that during rise of monastic movement you had quite a lot of monk type folks and evangelists who travelled in company of a sister wife and that term wife was open to interpretation father henry echoed same sentiments daniel b wallace of dallas theological seminary and others have suggested that fragment appears to have been intentionally cut most likely in modern times they further suggest that this leads to possibility that in context jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife links to conspiracy theories modern idea that jesus was married is largely attributable to holy blood and holy grail a book by baigent leigh and lincoln that is considered a work of pseudohistory that relies on conspiracy theories its thesis was that jesus had been married to mary magdalene and that legends of holy grail were symbolic accounts of his bloodline in europe this thesis became much more widely circulated after it was made center of plot of da vinci code a best selling 2003 novel by author dan brown king rejected any link between da vinci code and gospel of jesus wife other text fragment also includes line she will be able to be my disciple new york times states that debates over whether jesus married mary magdalene or another woman as well as debates over whether or not he had female disciples can be traced to early centuries of christianity king however contends that prior to recently published papyrus fragment no texts exist which claim that jesus was married but that canonical gospels clearly imply that jesus had female disciples provenance until june 2016 nothing definite was known about provenance of papyrus before appearance of ariel sabar s article it was reported that an anonymous owner had acquired fragment in 1997 as part of a cache of papyri and other documents this cache was said to have been purchased from a german american collector who in turn had acquired it in 1960s in east germany among other documents in that cache were a a type written letter dated july 15 1982 addressed to one hans ulrich laukamp from prof dr peter munro seminar freie universitat berlin which only mentions one of papyri reporting that a colleague prof fecht had identified it as a 2nd 4th century ad fragment of gospel of john in coptic and giving recommendations as to its preservation and b an undated and unsigned hand written note in german and seemingly referring to gospel of jesus wife fragment according to this note professor fecht believed it to be only instance of a text in which jesus uses direct speech to refer to a wife professor gerhard fecht was on faculty of egyptology at free university of berlin laukamp died in 2001 fecht in 2006 and munro in 2009 in june 2016 ariel sabar published an article in atlantic which identified previous owner of papyrus as walter fritz rather than laukamp and provided further evidence for supposing that papyrus was a forgery fritz initially denied being papyrus owner but later admitted to it fritz was a former egyptology student who left his job at a german museum after items from museum went missing for several years he ran pornography websites featuring his wife who believes that she can channel god and michael archangel she had even published a book of sayings that she believes god transmitted through her atlantic speculated that fritz may have been motivated to forge text by financial issues fritz had recently been unable to sell his house or a desire to make da vinci code a reality he denies having any financial problems but had seen da vinci codes film adaptation sabar had found that fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts fritz denied that he or anyone else forged gospel of jesus wife but admitted that he might have been able to do so had he tried fritz also stressed to sabar that he never once claimed that gospel of jesus wife was a genuinely ancient text authenticity initial evaluations before king published discovery of fragment she asked annemarie luijendijk and fellow papyrologist roger s bagnall of institute for study of ancient world at new york university to review fragment they determined that it was likely authentic both because of skills which would have been required to forge fragment and because papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced luijendijk and bagnall both doubted that text was forged giovanni maria vian editor of l osservatore romano vatican s official newspaper dismissed fragment as fake in a television documentary about fragment that was presented on smithsonian channel in september 2012 professor alberto of sapienza university of rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic immediately after king s presentation of fragment in rome doubts began to be expressed about its authenticity further investigation of language and script and comparison with clearly forged gospel of john belonging to same group of papyri corroborated initial doubts by end of 2014 there was a general consensus that papyrus was a fake eventually ariel sabar s tracing of provenance to walter fritz in 2016 provided final proof and king conceded that evidence presse d in direction of forgery others noted that handwriting grammar shape of papyrus and ink s color and quality made it suspect professor francis watson of durham university published a paper on papyrus fragment suggesting that text was a patchwork of texts from gospel of thomas which had been copied and assembled in a different order in summer 2015 professor watson edited and introduced six articles in journal new testament studies all arguing against authenticity of text these articles have been put online by professor mark goodacre of duke university in defense of text s authenticity ariel shisha halevy professor of linguistics at hebrew university of jerusalem and a leading expert on coptic language concluded that language itself offered no evidence of forgery king also found examples from a new discovery in egypt that has same kind of grammar showing that at least one unusual case is not unique while some experts continue to disagree about other case king notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of coptic language radiocarbon dating a radiocarbon dating analysis of papyrus by arizona accelerator mass spectrometry laboratory in 2013 dated papyrus to between 404 and 209 bc however cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve fragment a second analysis was performed by harvard university and woods hole oceanographic institution found a mean date of ad 741 a raman spectroscopy analysis at columbia university found that ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 bc to ad 700 800 these analyses suggest that fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern analysis of text however while papyrus itself is medieval in origin further analysis has suggested that text itself includes additional errors that suggest it is not authentic in october 2012 andrew bernhard observed that there is a close resemblance between grondin s interlinear of gospel of thomas and text that forger appeared to have used to compose text of gospel karen king has now made available interlinear translation provided to her by owner of papyrus and bernhard has shown that every line shows evidence of copying from grondin s interlinear leo depuydt of brown university found it ridiculous that in gospel of jesus wife word my in phrase my wife is written in bold as if to stress idea that jesus was married depuydt also said that he had never seen bold writing used in a single coptic text before he wrote effect is something like my wife get it my wife you heard that right papyrus fragment seems ripe for a monty python sketch if forger had used italics in addition one might be in danger of losing one s composure christian askeland s linguistic analysis of text shows that it is in a dialect which fell out of use well before ad 741 he concluded that text must have been written on a fragment of medieval papyrus by a modern forger dr askeland also found it suspicious that author of fragment wrote same letter in different ways in addition askeland showed that fragment is a match for a papyrus fragment that is clearly a forgery this second fragment containing part of gospel of john belongs to same anonymous owner and is now overwhelmingly considered a fake this is because that fragment of gospel of john appeared to have been copied from every second line of an online translation of john s gospel in an ancient coptic dialect called lycopolitan also lycopolitan language died out prior to sixth century and john fragment was carbon dated to somewhere between seventh and ninth centuries askeland argues that john fragment was written by same person in same ink and with same instrument as gospel of jesus wife professor king felt that these concerns were legitimate but that there was still a chance that gospel was authentic atlantic reported that despite king s reservations text was widely considered a fake king later conceded saying that evidence suggests that gospel of jesus wife is a forgery see also jesus bloodline list of gospels references external links official announcement
