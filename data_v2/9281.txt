time was constructed from a new type of molded steel reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than alternatives it was said to be first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete before completion of millennium park in 2004 it was considered most important installation in chicago park district time is one of several chicago works of art funded by benjamin ferguson s trust fund time has undergone several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements during late 1990s and first few years of 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected many of problems caused by these earlier restorations although extensive renovation of sculpture was completed as recently as 2005 supporters of time continue to seek resources for additional lighting and national trust for historic preservation has nominated it for further funding planning time taft p 35 along with many other public works in chicago was funded by benjamin ferguson s 1905 gift of 1 million million today to a charitable trust formed to memorialize events in american history lorado taft initially conceived a sculpture carved from granite an alternative plan was to have it chiseled out of georgia marble which it is estimated would have cost 30 000 a year for five years planned work was intended as part of a midway beautification which was to include a stream lagoons and a series of bridges a bridge of arts at woodlawn avenue a bridge of religion at intersection of ellis avenue and a bridge of science at dorchester avenue formerly madison avenue as part of plan two ends of midway were to be connected by a canal in deep depressions linking lagoons in jackson and washington parks garvey p 142 in 1907 taft had won first commission from ferguson fund to create fountain of great lakes at art institute of chicago immediately afterwards inspired by daniel burnham s make no little plans quote he begin lobbying for a grand midway beautification plan in 1912 art institute trustee frank g logan formally presented taft s plans to fund s administrators at art institute of chicago garvey pp 142 144 taft s proposed midway plaisance beautification plan included two possible commemoration themes his first choice was to honor memory of world s columbian exposition that had been held in jackson park in 1893 his alternative was to commemorate centennial of 1814 treaty of ghent marking a century of perfect understanding between england and america since other plans to commemorate exposition were under way second theme choice was adopted as justification for a second taft commission from ferguson fund garvey pp 144 145 contemporary newspaper accounts anticipated that taft s entire midway beautification plan would be approved easily garvey pp 146 149 thumb right taft with a model of fountain of creation 1910 taft s initial commission from trust was limited to creation of a full sized plaster model of fountain of time under a five year 10 000 annual installment contract signed on february 6 1913 this would enable model to be evaluated in 1918 taft first created a quarter scale model which received trustees approval in may 1915 garvey p 166 he eventually produced his full scale plaster model in width peaking in center with an equestrian warrior and a robed model of father time with a height of garvey p 146 installation of this model near its intended location was delayed by taft s world war i service with y m c a in france as part of a corps of entertainers and lecturers taft p 62 but was completed in 1920 taft p 36 however taft s wider vision of a chicago school of sculpture analogous to other philosophical chicago schools such as contemporaneous chicago school of architecture style garvey p 140 had lost momentum after 1913 dedication of his fountain of great lakes garvey pp 149 150 beaux arts style had become dated taft p 38 instead of funding taft s large scale midway plaisance beautification plan and providing originally planned granite bronze or georgia marble materials trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture location and installation time is in chicago park district in washington park community area on chicago s south side near midway plaisance this location adjoining university of chicago campus directly to east makes sculpture a contributing structure to washington park federal registered historic district listed on national register of historic places time is considered to be most important piece of monumental art in park district which hosts over 100 art works its importance stems from its sculptor its message era in which it was created and design of its reflecting pool by howard van doren shaw robert jones director of design and construction for art institute of chicago at time stated in 1999 that time was first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete sculpture is located a few blocks from taft s studio lorado taft midway studios now a chicago landmark and national historic landmark located at 60th street and ingleside avenue other notable sculptures nearby include henry moore s national historic landmark nuclear energy which is on site of first self sustaining nuclear reaction at university of chicago jackson park connected to washington park and time by midway plaisance hosts chicago landmark statue of republic at one time midway plaisance jackson park and washington park were jointly known as south park there is little agreement on dimensions of time with various sources describing it as between long one of few precise estimates describes it as long wide and tall sources are often unclear about whether they are describing width of reflecting pool from exterior wall to exterior wall width of water within reflecting pool s interior walls width of base of sculpted mass of humanity width of sculpted masses themselves or width of parcel of land upon which time is built water began running in completed sculpture on september 1 1920 although it was not dedicated to city until november 15 1922 university of chicago president harry pratt judson delivered an address at dedication ceremony at midway plaisance before contributions from taft president of b f ferguson trust charles hutchinson and john barton payne president of south park board design and realization sculpture is made of a form of hollow cast concrete reinforced with steel it was cast in a 4 500 piece mold using of a material described as concrete like which incorporated pebbles from potomac river this composite material was an innovation at time for years john joseph earley of washington dc had used pebbles that seemed durable in face of elements such as weather and urban soot and grime he had determined that by adding crushed pebbles he could create a new concrete mixture more durable than limestone but cheaper than marble or bronze reflection from silica of crushed stones complemented durability with artistic beauty same material was used at chicago s fine arts building sculpture depicts a hooded father time carrying a scythe and watching over a parade of 100 figures arranged in an ellipse with an overall pyramidal geometry allegorical procession depicts entire spectrum of humanity at various stages of life contemporary 1920s chicago daily tribune described figures as heroic and that choice of adjective has stayed with piece figures are said to be passing in review as they rush through stages of life and include soldiers frolicking children and kissing couples father time is described in various newspaper articles as huge weird and dominant other tribune critics described time as a pet atrocity of taft in large part due to its ugliness one critic described white figures as reminiscent of false teeth smiling across end of midway garvey p 173 time commemorates first 100 years of peace between united states and great britain after treaty of ghent concluded war of 1812 on december 24 1814 design was inspired by poem paradox of time by henry austin dobson time goes you say ah no alas time stays we go time s theme has been compared to shakespeare s all world s a stage monologue in as you like it which describes seven ages of man infant schoolboy lover soldier justice old age and dementia taft s figures represent birth struggle for existence love family life religion poetry and war although most of figures are generic representations of human forms in various walks and stages of life taft included himself with one of his assistants following him along west side of sculpture he is portrayed wearing a smock with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back his daughters served as models for some of figures taft is remembered for his books such as history of american sculpture 1903 regarded as first comprehensive work on subject and was well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture of which fountain of time is a prime example it was produced in period following his assignment to design sculptures for william le baron jenney s 1893 horticultural building for world s columbian exposition during this period he designed several large scale public works including fountain of great lakes taft resided in illinois for most of his life and worked in midway studios starting in 1906 taft p 28 restoration designed without expansion joints time is one of a small number of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble concrete aggregate few of which have been created since 1930s in 1936 times weather related cracks were repaired further work occurred in 1955 sculpture s subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966 although sculpture received regular maintenance early repair crews often did more harm than good by using techniques such as and patching cracks with rigid materials by 1980s sculpture was crumbling cracks had developed details of figures had worn away and moisture had eroded internal structure in wintertime fountain had to be protected by a tarp weather air pollution and vandalism meant that hundreds of thousands of dollars were now needed for restoration chicago park district university of chicago and art institute of chicago conservators all sponsored restoration work including drying out cavity of hollow sculpture removal of deteriorated substructure a newly designed ventilation system within piece a protective exterior coating and repairs to reflecting pool in 1989 chicago park district allocated 150 000 to repair project which amount was matched by ferguson fund by end of 1991 park district had collected 320 000 of 520 000 estimated repair costs from public and private funds although in 1994 sculpture still awaited repair by early 1997 after almost two decades of activity only repairs completed were phase one of air ventilation system to hollow base drainage pipes and a new inner roof plans now included erection of a temporary two story metal building to protect all but giant father time from harsh winters and to facilitate year round repair reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions replacement of inconsistent patches substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks and finally hand brushed concrete temporary building was budgeted at 270 000 city spent a total of 450 000 on repairs approved by park district that year on april 19 1999 1 6 million two year phase two restoration began scheduled for completion by may 2001 five workers began repairing cracks killing biological growth removing calcium deposits and pollution blackened gypsum and coating surface with a combination of lime putty adobe cement and sand inoperable reflecting pool was not repaired in this phase although this phase was completed in 2001 its effects were not visible until following year when temporary protective structure was unveiled repairs were expected to sustain sculpture for about 30 50 years before any further repairs would be necessary in 2003 national endowment for arts committed 250 000 to park district for conservation and restoration of reflecting pool in 2004 university of chicago contributed 100 000 and park district board 845 000 to repair pool and its water circulation system this work was carried out in summer of 2005 at a slightly reduced budget and fountain was filled with water for first time in over fifty years in 2007 efforts began to add lighting that same year sculpture was nominated by partners in preservation a fund for preservation of historic sites backed by national trust for historic preservation and american express in a widely publicized contest that included open house events where public could tour and learn about competing historic sites 1 million was available for preservation efforts in chicago metropolitan area but fountain was not one of 15 winning candidates gallery fountain of creation time was intended to be matched by a sister fountain fountain of creation on opposite end of midway work was begun but was never completed finished portions of fountain of creation depicting figures from greek legend of of earth after great flood are considered taft s final work and were given to university of illinois at urbana champaign his alma mater four surviving elements are figures ranging in height from and are collectively named sons and daughters
