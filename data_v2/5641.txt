battle of bita paka 11 september 1914 was fought south of kabakaul on island of new britain and was a part of invasion and subsequent occupation of german new guinea by australian naval and military expeditionary force an mef shortly after outbreak of first world war similar to new zealand s operation against german samoa in august main target of operation was a strategically important wireless station one of several used by german east asiatic squadron which australians believed to be located in area powerful german naval fleet threatened british interests and its elimination was an early priority of british and australian governments during war after an unopposed landing a mixed force of german reservists and half trained melanesian police mounted a stout resistance and forced australians to fight their way to objective after a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties australian forces captured wireless station at bita paka battle was australia s first major military engagement of war and only significant action of campaign in its aftermath remaining german forces on new britain fled inland to toma following a brief siege there german garrison

was kaiser wilhelmsland in north eastern new guinea islands to east were known as bismarck archipelago and consisted of neu pommern now new britain and neu mecklenburg now new ireland with exception of german samoa all german islands in pacific were administratively part of german new guinea german solomon islands buka bougainville and several smaller islands carolines palau marianas except for guam marshall islands and nauru although a relatively minor colony it covered an extensive land area totalling around while western half of new guinea had been administered by netherlands since 1828 eastern half was not annexed by any european power until 1880s in 1883 fearful of growing foreign influence particularly influence of germany british colony of queensland annexed south eastern part of new guinea against wishes of british government this initiated german interest in remaining third of island and on 3 november 1884 german flag was raised over kaiser wilhelmsland bismarck archipelago formerly new britain and german solomon islands on 17 may 1885 german emperor granted an imperial charter to newly founded neuguinea kompanie new guinea company for this annexation which was further extended to solomon islands on 13 november 1886 on 1 april 1899 german government took formal control establishing a protectorate a treaty with spain signed on 30 july ensured german control over several other island groups in pacific and these were added to protectorate of german new guinea economic life of german new guinea s small population of european and asian settlers as well as that of its melanesian population relied heavily on export of copra and import of goods and services it remained a modest outpost and by august 1914 only 1 273 europeans lived in colony while there was also a

australia and other members of british empire were automatically involved with prime minister joseph cook stating on 5 august that when empire is at war so also is australia within days brigadier general william bridges and his staff officer major cyril brudenell white had completed plans for creation of australian imperial force aif white proposed an expeditionary force of 18 000 men including 12 000 australians and 6 000 new zealanders cook subsequently approved proposal although he increased offer to 20 000 men to serve in any destination desired by british government on 6 august 1914 london cabled its acceptance of force and asked that it be sent as soon as possible recruiting offices opened on 10 august and by end of 1914 52 561 volunteers had been accepted despite strict physical fitness guidelines meanwhile after an additional british request for assistance on 6 august 1914 australian government hurriedly prepared another expeditionary force to destroy german wireless stations at yap in caroline islands nauru and rabaul in new britain as with new zealand military operation against german samoa which was completed in late august targets were strategically important wireless stations used by german east asiatic squadron under command of count maximilian von spee existence of powerful german fleet including modern cruisers sms scharnhorst and sms gneisenau in pacific at outbreak of war worried british admiralty and australian government and elimination of its radio network was a key priority although location of german fleet was unknown it was suspected they may have been hiding in excellent natural harbour at rabaul while australian naval and military expeditionary force an mef was being raised for this task as a prelude to an amphibious landing on gazelle peninsula in new britain ships of australian squadron conducted a reconnaissance of area subsequently entering blanche bay on 12 august while several destroyers also entered simpson harbour landing parties went ashore to demolish telephones in post offices in rabaul and at german gubernatorial capital of herbertshohe present day kokopo located to south east enquiries were also made about location of radio station although no information was forthcoming after threatening to bombard nearby settlements if radio station continued to transmit australian warships withdrew opposing forces thumb left alt soldiers marching through jungle a platoon of german reservists shortly before arrival of an mef an mef comprised one battalion of infantry of 1 000 men hurriedly enlisted in sydney plus 500 naval reservists and ex sailors who would serve as infantry 1st battalion an mef was commanded by lieutenant colonel russell watson while naval reservists were formed into six companies under commander joseph beresford also included were two machine gun sections a signals section and a medical detachment another battalion of militia from queensland based kennedy regiment which had been dispatched to garrison thursday island also contributed 500 volunteers recruitment began on 11 august with very few of infantry having had previous military experience under overall command of colonel william holmes force departed sydney on 19 august aboard hmas berrima and halted at palm island off townsville until a new zealand force escorted by battlecruiser hmas australia cruiser hmas melbourne and french cruiser montcalm occupied samoa on 30 august an mef then moved to port moresby where it met queensland contingent already aboard transport kanowna force sailed for german new guinea on 7 september although kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work militia were also left in port moresby after holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped to be committed to anticipated fighting at outbreak of war german new guinea was only lightly defended even after all available reservists had reported for duty and melanesian police had been armed total strength was only 61 german officers and non commissioned officers and about 240 melanesian police to compound defenders problems most of germans were reservists with either limited experience or who had served in military many years earlier bita paka radio station itself was occupied by eight germans and 60 melanesians under command of hauptmann captain hans wuchert wuchert s force was assigned to defend against any hostile landing at a point near coast and was authorised to withdraw halfway between toma and bita paka to if necessary but only after demolishing radio station a company of 10 germans and 140 melanesians was also stationed at herbertshohe commanded by leutnant lieutenant mayer while a squad of melanesians at toma under leutnant robert von blumenthal lord bob was charged with digging in and improving defences section outposts were established at various locations and monitored coast from st george s channel to rabaul despite limits of manpower such arrangements proved effective and reconnaissance of australian squadron on 12 august had been quickly detected with german forces subsequently directed towards coast to repel

of german forces sydney and destroyer hmas warrego landed small parties of naval reservists at settlements of kabakaul and at herbertshohe these parties were reinforced firstly by sailors from warrego and later by infantry from berrima two parties were subsequently landed one under sub lieutenant c webber and other commanded by lieutenant commander j f finlayson in accordance with german plans australians encountered no opposition at herbertshohe with german company stationed there having withdrawn to between herbertshohe and kabakaul in early morning at 07 00 australians raised union jack over settlement australians believed there were probably two radio stations one under construction directly inland from herbertshohe and other directly inland from kabakaul at bita paka finlayson remained at herbertshohe to guard stores being landed from sydney while webber s party began an advance from herbertshohe inland along toma road another party under lieutenant rowland bowen would advance towards bita paka to south bowen s force consisting of two officers and 25 naval reservists was subsequently landed at kabakaul also included were about 15 other personnel to provide medical support and maintain communications advance inland advance inland began along fringe of dense jungle edged road to radio station with australians attempting to avoid road wherever possible by 09 00 they had penetrated about and with scrub becoming denser scouts pushed away from road to work their way around obstacle they suddenly surprised a group of about 20 melanesian soldiers led by three german reservists who were apparently laying an ambush on road for advancing australians they opened fire wounding one german in hand and capturing him and scattering melanesians by means of a ruse wuchert and mayer were also captured depriving defenders of two important commanders while several significant maps also fell into australian hands at this time realising that his advance was going to be contested bowen requested reinforcements consequently as an interim measure 59 men from warrego and yarra were landed under lieutenant g a hill until infantry could arrive from berrima which was still steaming towards kabakaul from bay meanwhile bowen pushed on and australians were again fired upon by well concealed germans and their melanesian troops as well as by snipers in treetops by 09 30 situation had become grave and australians suffered their first casualty of war with able seaman billy williams mortally wounded also among casualties was medical officer captain brian who died of his wounds in afternoon after being evacuated to berrima thumb upright left australian soldiers dig up a german pipe mine on bita paka road alt soldiers digging up a long pipe like object that has

more than when they encountered a strongly held german trench dug across road working together hill and bowen attempted to outflank germans during which bowen was shot and badly wounded by a sniper leaving hill in command berrima subsequently landed reinforcements including a half battalion commanded by lieutenant commander charles elwell as well as a machine gun section and medical detachment among reinforcements was battalion commander beresford and intelligence officer fighting for wireless station elwell advanced inland rapidly and was soon also engaged losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish during advance australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire these mines had been laid beneath road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key at bottom of a lookout tree by 13 00 however hill s position was reached and australians now under elwell s overall command launched another flanking attack on main trench blocking road despite suffering casualties they pressed their attack forcing defenders to surrender after charging trench with fixed bayonets a german officer and 20 melanesians were captured four australians were killed including elwell who died leading charge with his sword drawn and another five were wounded now under command of hill and accompanied by two german prisoners acting as interpreters australians proceeded down road under a flag of truce and persuaded garrisons of two more trenches to surrender but not before another skirmish in which germans counter attacked wounding three more australians one fatally during firefight australians killed one of unarmed german interpreters and several of melanesians advance continued and another group of defenders was encountered and disarmed by nightfall by 19 00 australians reached radio station which was found abandoned mast had been dismantled although instruments and machinery remained intact surviving defenders had abandoned defences and withdrawn aftermath casualties thumb upright right colonel holmes and two unidentified officers at wireless station at bita paka after its capture alt three men in uniform two sitting and one standing outside a number of buildings and earthworks during fighting at bita paka seven australians were killed and five wounded while casualties among defenders included one german and about 30 melanesians killed and one german and 10 melanesians wounded 19 germans and 56 melanesians were captured later it was alleged that heavy losses among melanesian troops were result of australians bayoneting a number that they had captured while casualties suffered by australians were light in context of later operations they were disproportionately heavy given modest territorial and strategic gains and were further compounded by disappearance of submarine ae1 during a patrol off rabaul on 14 september with all 35 men aboard after their defeat remaining german forces and civil administration withdrew inland to toma believing they would have time to regroup before australians arrived german governor eduard haber continued to hold out for several days hoping that german east asiatic squadron would arrive to relieve them unknown to germans however an australian advanced party consisting of a half battalion of 200 men and a 12 pounder naval field gun had followed them moving along toma road australians surrounded town and proceeded to bombard it meanwhile arrived on station and fired several shells at a ridge nearby this show of firepower scattered melanesian police and was sufficient to start negotiations with toma subsequently occupied haber visited holmes in herbertshohe on 15 september signing terms two days later all military resistance subsequently ceased and remaining 40 german soldiers and 110 melanesians surrendered on 21 september leaving no effective opposition to australian occupation of territory capture of german new guinea german colony at madang on kaiser wilhelmsland new guinea mainland was occupied on 24 september although german armed merchant raider sms cormoran which was lurking nearby escaped undetected over next two months remaining outposts were also occupied meanwhile german east asiatic squadron steamed across pacific before surprising and sinking a british force off coronel on 1 november after rounding cape horn into atlantic and attempting a raid on stanley naval station squadron was itself destroyed by a more powerful british force during battle of falkland islands on 8 december 1914 later it was alleged that widespread looting and destruction of civilian property by australian troops occurred during this period indeed ill discipline among australian force appears to have been an issue perhaps due to haste with which an mef had been raised and poor character of some of those that were enlisted claims in australian media of criminal behaviour caused considerable controversy at time and later led to a parliamentary enquiry in end a number of soldiers were court martialled and imprisoned for looting and theft although more serious allegations including rape also arose thumb left raising australian flag in 16 december 1914 alt soldiers standing at attention in front of a long house and palm trees following capture of remaining german possessions in region an mef provided occupation forces for duration of war holmes subsequently established a military government which continued until 1921 after which australia received a mandate from league of nations to govern territory australian military administration continued exploitative economic policies of previous german colonial administration and official policy was to continue status quo including use of indentured melanesian labour on plantations levy of native head tax and official floggings or corporal punishment equally despite previously being protected by german colonial administration in 1914 hunting of native bird of paradise crowned pigeon and white heron for lucrative trade in their feathers and skin was officially condoned and a custom tax levied on their export under terms of german surrender haber was allowed to return to germany while german civilians could remain as long as they swore an oath of neutrality those who refused were later transported to australia where they could freely travel back to germany on 9 january 1915 holmes handed over command of an mef to brigadier general sir samuel pethebridge former secretary of department of defence holmes returned to australia and re enlisted in aif as did most of his men they were replaced by 3rd battalion an mef which was known as tropical force because it had been specially enlisted for service in tropics pethebridge established administrative structures that remained through period of military occupation although required by international law to follow german forms of government territory gradually acquired appearance of a british colony as a result of peace settlement under treaty of versailles in 1919 germany lost all of its colonial possessions including german new guinea colony became territory of new guinea a league of nations mandate territory under australian administration in 1921 it remained as such until 1949 when it was merged with australian territory of papua to become territory of papua and new guinea which eventually became modern papua new guinea although interrupted by japanese occupation during new guinea campaign 1942 45 in second world war australian administration over territory lasted until 1975 when papua new guinea gained its independence assessment thumb right alt a submarine sailing on surface of ocean while in background is a large warship and a smaller vessel ae1 off rossel island on 9 september 1914 ultimately australian operation on new britain achieved its objectives with an mef destroying wireless station before seizing colony reducing a strategic german possession in pacific and thereby denying its use to support their naval forces in region although successful it had not been well managed and australians had been effectively delayed by a few reserve officers and an under trained melanesian police force they finally prevailed because of their unexpected ability to fight in close terrain while their ability to outflank german positions had unnerved their opponents battle of bita paka was australia s first major military engagement of war but it soon became little more than a sideshow in a conflict which grew to assume much greater proportions many men of an mef later volunteered for aif and served in egypt gallipoli sinai and palestine and on western front a large number became casualties including holmes who was killed in action in 1917 apart from very real human suffering of melanesian troops killed or wounded at bita paka reduction in german prestige due to capture of german new guinea and economic and property losses experienced by some german colonists during occupation battle ultimately held little strategic significance for germany fighting yielded few tactical lessons given very different nature of fighting there to that of mass industrialised warfare which both germans and australians experienced in europe just as many australians felt that real war was in europe most germans were less concerned with battles in colonies and more focused on war at home see also battle of rabaul 1942 notes references citations sources further reading category conflicts in 1914
