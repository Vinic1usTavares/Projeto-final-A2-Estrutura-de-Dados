dead end terminal station in subway system that does not have an island platform it was built with two side platforms and two tracks to allow for a planned but ultimately unbuilt extension of irt nostrand avenue line extension proposed in 1929 would have brought line south towards voorhies avenue in sheepshead bay these plans were revisited in 1939 1946 1951 and 1968 in 1968 as part of program for action mta gave consideration to extending nostrand avenue line approximately beyond station to provide room for turnaround facilities this would eliminate operational restrictions caused by current layout however a ballot measure for funding much of program was voted down in 1971 delaying this plan indefinitely this plan was again considered in 1989 in 1981 mta listed station among 69 most deteriorated stations in subway system starting in december 1993 station was renovated at cost of 6 million an elevator was installed and 1920s style flatbush avenue name tablets containing red
