portion of state highway north of bel air has seen limited improvements since 1930s highway south of bel air has been fully relocated in some places multiple times and expanded to a divided highway for much of its length original construction and early improvements md 24 was one of original state numbered highways designated in 1927 state highway originally began at md 23 in forest hill and followed its current course along rocks road north to bush s corner then followed pylesville road which later became md 165 through pylesville to pennsylvania state line at cardiff portion of pylesville road between graceton road now md 624 and village of pylesville was paved with macadam by 1910 md 24 from just north of forest hill to graceton road was built with a wide concrete surface in four sections with construction underway by 1917 and completed by 1921 state highway just north of forest hill and highway from pylesville northeast to state line were completed with a macadam surface by 1923 thumb left md 24 northbound past md 23 in forest hill md 24 from bush s corner toward fawn grove began construction in 1926 concrete highway was completed to st marys road by 1927 and to five forks in 1928 third section from five forks to about south of state line was started in 1929 and completed in 1930 final section to state line at fawn grove was started in 1930 and completed by 1933 around time highway was completed md 24 was switched from pylesville road to rocks road north of bush s corner md 165 was extended from bush s corner to cardiff in md 24 s stead md 24 received a new bridge over deer creek within rocks state park in 1934 since 1930s only notable improvement to original length of md 24 was construction of roundabout at md 24 md 165 intersection in 2000 construction on what became md 24 between van bibber and bel air got underway with construction of a section of macadam road from ring factory road south to plumtree road near emmorton between 1925

into state system in 1933 two remaining portions of md 24 corridor to be built were completed through edgewood and north of bel air in 1930s in 1930 edgewood road was built as a concrete road from us 40 just west of van bibber south to its entrance to aberdeen proving ground at its pennsylvania railroad crossing now amtrak edgewood road which was originally designated md 408 was constructed with a

and md 24 northbound on bel air bypass first post war project on md 24 was reconstruction of highway from norris corner to van bibber starting in 1950 by time project to resurface highway in bituminous concrete ended in 1952 md 24 was extended south through edgewood replacing md 408 from md 7 to aberdeen proving ground md 24 was widened and resurfaced with bituminous concrete from norris corner to bel air starting in 1954 and from bel air to forest hill beginning in 1956 norris corner bel air project included highway s first relocation at emmorton leaving behind old emmorton road another relocation occurred in 1956 to remove md 24 s staggered intersections at md 7 in van bibber edgewood road was extended north to tie into emmorton road just south of interchange with i 95 this project bypassed van bibber road md 24 was relocated again near van bibber when highway s interchange with i 95 was constructed in 1963 this relocation left behind roadways now marked as walton road and woodside road in southeast and northeast quadrants respectively of original diamond interchange next relocation in edgewood area occurred in two sections starting in 1967 md 24 was moved to its present alignment from just south of i 95 interchange to edgewood road south of us 40 in 1970 bypass included a bridge over us 40 access between two highways was provided by edgewood road which was designated md 755 new alignment of md 24 was extended south to a new entrance to aberdeen proving ground in 1974 md 755 was extended south along md 24 s old alignment to pre existing entrance next to edgewood marc station md 24 from i 95 to md 755 was expanded to a divided highway around 1997 this project included construction of a two way ramp between md 24 and us 40 to add direct access that had not been provided in 1970 md 24 s interchange with us 1 north of bel air was constructed in 1964 along with rest of bel air bypass interchange was originally a diamond interchange a loop ramp was added from northbound us 1 to northbound md 24 in 1983 construction of vietnam veterans memorial highway from i 95 to us 1 in bel air began in 1986 four lane divided highway was completed in 1987 md 24 was also expanded to a divided highway through i 95 interchange which was transformed into its modern partial cloverleaf original alignment of md 24 between i 95 and bel air was planned to become another section of md 755 in 1986 but was designated md 924 in 1987 in december 2008 maryland transportation authority began a project to replace md 24 s intersection with md 924 and tollgate road just north of md 24 i 95 interchange intersection was replaced with a diamond interchange in october 2011 as part of project md 24 i 95 interchange had several ramps altered to separate i 95 traffic heading for md 24 and md 924 maryland state highway administration has long term plans to expand bel air bypass to a divided highway from winters run to us 1 business south of hickory bel air bypass is already a four lane divided highway between md 147 and winters run and around hickory but is a three to four lane undivided highway from winters run to us 1 business south of hickory bel air bypass would be expanded to a four lane divided highway from winters run to md 24 and a six lane divided highway along us 1 md 24 concurrency us 1 md 24 intersection would be reconstructed as a trumpet interchange planning phase of project was completed in 2001 but engineering right of way acquisition and actual construction are on hold until funding becomes available maryland state highway administration plans to rebuild portion of md 24 that passes through rocks state park which has been undermined by adjacent deer creek project was originally proposed in late 2009 and initially called for route to be relocated further from creek project was put on hold due to opposition from area residents and environmentalists maryland state highway administration later proposed reconstructing road along its current alignment while stabilizing creek work on this project which is projected to cost 13 3 million is expected to start as soon as may 2014 and will require closing road junction
