typhoon billie was first typhoon officially monitored by joint typhoon warning center storm brought floods to several east asian countries in july 1959 billie developed from a tropical disturbance west of kiribati on july 12 situated within favorable conditions system quickly reached tropical storm intensity before strengthening further to typhoon status a day after formation intensification continued until billie reached its peak intensity on july 14 east of taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 mbar hpa 28 64 inhg slight weakening occurred before typhoon made landfall on zhejiang in china on july 16 after tracking inland billie curved northward and moved over yellow sea before making a final landfall on north korea on july 17 storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards before dissipating over sea of japan a day later rainbands of billie brought severe flooding to philippines and japan even while typhoon s center was well removed from those locations in philippines one person was killed and flood damage totaled us 500 000 floods were particularly destructive in japan where they destroyed 603 homes in western portion of country swaths of crops were inundated by floodwaters and 44 people were killed extensive flooding occurred in taiwan and china and seven deaths occurred in former in busan south korea billie s effects forced evacuation of thousands of people through tight corridors from a stadium causing indirect deaths of 61 people meteorological history beginning on july 9 joint typhoon warning center jtwc began dispatching aircraft reconnaissance to investigate an area of thunderstorms between yap state and koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone tracking westward there were few signs of organization or intensification until july 12 when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within disturbance signifying that a tropical depression had developed jtwc bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly upon development observations indicated that system was quickly developing in favorable conditions with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160 km 100 mi in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression twelve hours later jtwc upgraded cyclone to tropical storm status assigning name billie at 1200 utc on july 13 jtwc upgraded billie further to typhoon status making billie first tropical cyclone to be monitored by jtwc since its inception earlier in 1959 now tracking steadily towards northwest typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200 utc next day with maximum sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph according to jtwc and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by japan meteorological agency jma at 970 mbar hpa 28 64 inhg by this time billie s eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50 km 30 mi in diameter at 0900 utc on july 15 billie passed just 30 km 20 mi north of taiwan fifteen hours later typhoon made landfall north of fuzhou china in zhejiang with winds estimated at 120 km h 75 mph upon tracking inland on july 16 interaction with china s mountainous terrain disrupted organization of billie weakening it down to tropical storm intensity however tropical cyclone s stint over land was short lived as system quickly curved northward into yellow sea by july 17 despite moving back over water billie continued to weaken and made landfall on western coast of north korea with winds of 75 km h 40 mph over korean peninsula billie began to intake cold air from a polar front enabling system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 utc that day these remnants tracked eastward across sea of japan before they were last noted just off of hokkaido on july 18 impact as billie tracked to east of philippines outer rainbands of tropical cyclone produced heavy rainfall to archipelago ryukyu islands and main islands of japan in philippines rains triggered floods that led to death of one person and us 500 000 in damage about 100 people were displaced on islands due to rainfall japanese freighter maru was grounded on a reef off of ishigaki island due to rough surf and winds caused by passing typhoon necessitating a rescue operation by three united states navy ships on island 16 homes were destroyed and 49 were heavily damaged inundation of crops was prevalent flooding from billie was highly destructive in areas of japan west of chubu region destroying 603 homes and inundating 77 288 others roughly 325 km2 125 mi2 of farmland was impacted by rains across japan 44 people were killed and 77 were injured in northern taiwan billie caused widespread flash flooding displacing thousands of people and resulting in extensive damage approximately one third of taipei was inundated by floodwaters and hospital patients were forced to evacuate to okinawa after a military assistance advisory group compound was impacted by heavy rains over 10 000 people were rendered homeless in taipei alone after city s shanty type dwellings along with well built residences were destroyed in total effects of billie in taiwan killed seven people extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern china inundating rice fields in order to avoid storm thousands of fishermen sought shelter in local harbors cleanup and relief operations quickly ensued following storm s passage storms accompanying billie and its remnants brought heavy rains and strong winds to south korea knocking out police telephone lines in busan sudden onslaught of these storms caused a stampede of roughly 70 000 people out of a stadium resulting in indirect deaths of 68 people including 51 children around 125 people were injured and 40 were hospitalized after mass evacuation see also typhoon norris 1980
