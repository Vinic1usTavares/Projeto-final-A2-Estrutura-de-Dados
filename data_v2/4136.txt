1999 sydney hailstorm was costliest natural disaster in australian insurance history causing extensive damage along east coast of new south wales storm developed south of sydney on afternoon of wednesday 14 april 1999 and struck city s eastern suburbs including central business district later that evening zillman 1999 19 storm dropped an estimated 500 000 tonnes of hailstones in its path et al 1999 2 henri 1999 16 insured damages caused by storm were over a 1 7 billion schuster et al 2005 1 with total damage bill including uninsured damages estimated to be around a 2 3 billion emergency management australia 2006 coenraads 2006 229 it was costliest in australian history in insured damages surpassing a 1 1 billion in insured damages caused by 1989 newcastle earthquake lightning also claimed one life during storm and event caused approximately 50 injuries bureau of meteorology 2007 emergency management australia 2003 61 storm was classified as a supercell following further analysis of its erratic nature and extreme attributes during event bureau of meteorology was constantly surprised by frequent changes in direction as well as severity of hail and duration of storm event was also surprising as neither time of year time of day nor general meteorological conditions in region were seen as conducive for extreme storm cell formation zillman 1999 29 conditions and climatology conditions around sydney on wednesday 14 april were calm although a slight instability in atmospheric conditions was recorded by bureau of meteorology in region two instability events had been identified in greater sydney area but both were considered minor by meteorological agencies a weak cold front was moving north along coast and moderate precipitation was falling over blue mountains southwest of city meteorological reports and figures however suggested that general atmospheric conditions were not conducive to support formation of a major thunderstorm in region whitaker 2005 99 historical records show that formation of severe thunderstorms for time of day and year had been rare and it was improbable that they would maintain their intensity and cause significant damage zillman 1999 i leigh 1999 this long standing belief contributed to bureau of meteorology s decision not to issue warnings in early part of storm s development 1999 event was only second time in recorded history that hail larger than had fallen in sydney metropolitan area in month of april bureau of meteorology 1999 and only fifth hailstorm to strike sydney during april in 200 years of meteorological records for city collings et al 2000 hailstorms have had a history of significant damage in australia since records on insured losses by insurance disaster response organisation began in 1967 three other hailstorms sydney in 1986 and 1990 as well as brisbane in 1985 feature on top ten list of most insured damages caused by a single natural disaster in addition to 1999 storm hailstorms have caused more than 30 of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in australia during this period and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in new south wales development of storm formation and southern sydney thumb path of storm from formation and in southern regions of sydney storm cell formed at 4 25 pm aest to north of nowra roughly south southwest of sydney after forming it initially headed towards coast in a northeasterly direction cell passed just to west of kiama at around 5 15 pm and gained a severe classification from bureau of meteorology at same time zillman 1999 17 severe is a classification used by bureau of meteorology for thunderstorms which meet a specific criteria namely producing hailstones with a diameter of or more wind gusts of or greater and flash flooding or tornadoes this classification is also used by bureau to classify attributes of a storm at any given time during its life zillman 1999 6 storm continued to move in a northeasterly direction crossing coast just north of kiama at 5 25 pm it was downgraded from a severe thunderstorm and proceeded to move further off coast for another 15 minutes while gaining speed to around storm then veered northward at 5 40 pm and continued parallel to coast around 6 00 pm directly east of wollongong storm changed direction again this time to north northeast and continued parallel to coastline moderate hailstones were recorded falling in wollongong as western edge of storm passed over area and storm was reclassified as severe storm moved parallel to coast in a north northeasterly direction for next fifty minutes it maintained a severe classification though did not impact heavily on coastal suburbs because it was entirely offshore western edge of storm however recrossed coastline just east of helensburgh south southwest of sydney at about 7 00 pm ten minutes later direction of storm veered slightly more northward and centre of storm crossed back onto land at at around 7 20 pm zillman 1999 18 immediate sydney region thumb path of storm over eastern suburbs area of sydney bureau of meteorology had not issued warnings for sydney airport located on northern shore of botany bay or rest of eastern suburbs to prepare for large hail they were not expecting storm to veer northward again but rather to continue to head further out into tasman sea in a consistent north northeasterly direction department of environment and heritage 1999 iii after crossing coast storm continued to move northward crossing botany bay at 7 40 pm and reaching airport five minutes later it travelled across eastern suburbs between botany bay and sydney harbour between 7 45 pm and 8 05 pm dropping massive hailstones on both houses and businesses in eastern suburbs district and central business district some of largest hailstones ever to be recorded in sydney region fell on eastern suburbs during this storm there were reports of diameter hailstones in eastern suburbs although largest confirmed hailstone was in diameter zillman 1999 iii it was first time in 52 years that stones greater than had fallen in sydney with last reported event being 1947 hailstorm storm continued across sydney harbour and changed direction slightly to be heading north it weakened after travelling over harbour and was downgraded from a severe storm at 8 15 pm bureau of meteorology had concluded that storm would weaken after heading across sydney harbour believing it was dissipating and would therefore not produce any more substantial hail as it moved northward therefore it did not issue warnings for northern suburbs northern suburbs and dissipation thumb path of storm after crossing sydney harbour until dissipating storm then continued north for twenty minutes over north shore suburbs of sydney before regaining strength and veering north northwest again redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics storm s redevelopment again caught bureau of meteorology off guard who had expected storm to dissipate and move out to sea without causing further substantial damage it proceeded to drop large amounts of hail on northern beach suburbs of mona vale and palm beach around 8 50 pm and centre of storm again crossed coast and back out to sea just after 9 00 pm storm maintained its intensity however and continued to move in a northwesterly direction across broken bay western edge of storm had a minor impact on southern suburbs of central coast between 9 15 pm and 9 30 pm storm moved entirely off coastline and into open water at around 9 45 pm it then dissipated rapidly around 9 55 pm directly east of gosford it was subsequently downgraded from severe status and storm cell had faded completely by 10 00 pm aftermath secondary storm cell thumb 250px bureau of meteorology radar image from 8 10 pm showing first cell directly over sydney central business district and second cell approximately south along coastline a second far smaller storm cell passed along a similar route to first later in evening of 14 april this cell was never given classification of severe by bureau of meteorology nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor whitaker 2005 97 therefore route of second cell was more direct and predictable than first following general movement of cold front see conditions and climatology and bureau of meteorology issued warnings to all residents in second cell s projected path to expect further storm activity whitaker 2005 101 secondary cell passed through sydney two hours later than first just after 10 00 pm having been approximately south of sydney when supercell struck it dropped hail up to in diameter as well as producing heavy rainfall damage caused by second cell was mostly due to rain coming in through roofs already damaged by hail from first cell hail from second cell also contributed to damage whitaker 2005 103 4 damage caused downpour of an estimated 500 000 tonnes of hail across sydney suburbia resulted in widespread damage on coastal suburbs in its path insured losses due to disaster reached roughly a 1 7 billion with total costs estimated to be around a 2 3 billion storm was costliest natural disaster ever to hit australia in terms of insured losses surpassing 1989 newcastle earthquake by around a 600 million areas that incurred most damage were between lilli and darling point located apart on coastline of sydney nsw state emergency service 2005 vast majority of damage was done by hail and rain approximately 24 000 houses were significantly damaged with many suffering water damage through holes in roofs that large hailstones created stones were estimated as travelling at up to in some periods of storm causing indentation damage to around 70 000 vehicles schuster et al 2005 2 twenty three aeroplanes and helicopters at sydney airport were reported as having incurred notable damage from hail caused by inability to place them under hangars in time to avoid storm this has been significantly attributed to a lack of warnings from bureau of meteorology who had expected storm to continue moving further out into tasman sea in north northeasterly direction in which it had previously been travelling most significant insurance costs were in areas of residential property damage with 31 8 of total payments motor vehicle damage with 28 6 and for properties which service commercial and industrial sectors at 27 5 damage to aviation property mainly planes at vulnerable sydney airport amounted to 5 9 of claims while 5 8 of all insurance payments were made for business interruption and 0 4 for damage to boats as well as other miscellaneous claims storm caused one fatality a 45 year old man who was fishing about from north shore of bay in port hacking estuary was killed when his boat was struck by lightning fifty injuries were recorded caused by flying objects road accidents due to poor visibility and smashed windscreens and other factors emergency response thumb 250px aftermath of storm on a suburban sydney street owing to magnitude of storm state emergency service were aided by new south wales rural fire service new south wales fire brigades and australian capital territory emergency service in recovery work within hours of storm striking city all affected areas were declared as disaster zones and new south wales government under premier bob carr invoked a state of emergency which gave control and co ordination of response to state emergency service emergency management australia 2004 in days following storm john moore minister for defence approved a request for 300 australian defence force personnel to assist recovery operations although their assistance was only for one week while resources were stretched government one week later unexpectedly removed complete control from state emergency service and placed certain suburbs and areas under control of rural fire service and fire brigade head 1999 in five hours following storm striking sydney state emergency service received 2 000 emergency calls to 1 092 separate incidents wilson n d in total state emergency service received 25 301 calls for assistance to 15 007 incidents with new south wales rural fire service also receiving 19 437 geoscience australia n d recovery and clean up mission used an estimated a 10 million worth of tarpaulin covers while waiting for permanent repairs after nine days approximately 3 000 buildings out of a total of 127 947 initially damaged were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows while a similar number still required assistance a further week later as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective one month after disaster main priority of emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place as sydney suffered further adverse weather in period immediately following storm a study of a sample taken of affected areas suggested that roughly 62 of buildings in affected areas suffered damage to roofs around 34 to windows and 53 to vehicles construction of infrastructure for 2000 sydney olympics in city s west at time meant there was a deficiency of tradespeople who could be contracted to repair roofs and windows estimates put between 45 000 and 50 000 tradespeople in sydney at time of storm yet owing to high demand companies were quoting householders a 14 000 or more for roof repairs which would normally cost 3 000 situation led to a warning from minister for fair trade john watkins on day following storm urging homeowners to ensure that tradespeople working to repair homes were fully qualified and legitimate australian associated press 1999 see also emergency management list of disasters in australia
