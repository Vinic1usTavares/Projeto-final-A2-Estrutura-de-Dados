n eddy produced series on a dare alt cool looking animator danny antonucci although cartoonist danny antonucci began his career by working as an animator on various children s series for hanna barbera his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences he gained notoriety with 1987 short film lupo butcher and then after founding his own production studio a k a cartoon in 1994 created series brothers grunt for mtv it was quickly cancelled however upon being met with generally poor reviews on a dare antonucci then decided that he would try producing a children s animated series of his own while designing a commercial he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with growing excited over their potential he named them ed edd and eddy and spent following months developing a show around them he faxed a one page concept sheet to cartoon network and nickelodeon in 1996 both studios quickly responded cartoon network in only 20 minutes and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more they each demanded creative control however and antonucci refused after cartoon network agreed to let antonucci have control of show conversations between antonucci and studio continued vice president of programming and production of cartoon network mike lazzo showed high interest in series and requested a show bible which came through by fax a few pages at a time over a period of next few months after an affirmative response from cartoon network president betty cohen legal paperwork and deal making began followed by a start up meeting at chateau marmont hotel in los angeles a deal was made that antonucci s studio a k a cartoon would produce ed edd n eddy first cartoon network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than cartoon network s hanna barbera series also entered production and bypassed a seven minute short this marked first time that one of studio s original series had ever done this according to antonucci he based characters on real people in his life personalities of ed double d and eddy are based on his own traits as well as activities of his two sons while cul de sac children and kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with rolf is based on antonucci and his cousins since he was part of an italian immigrant family and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living compared to those born in canada jimmy is based on one of his cousins who was rather feminine and spent most of his time playing with girls rather than with boys jonny and plank are inspired by one of antonucci s childhood friends a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket he stated that he believed it was important to add plank a board of wood to show and that he thought it would be really cool to do show with plank taking on a character of his own and to cause jonny to do things he would usually never do some wanted plank to be able to talk smile and blink as if he was alive but antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood brought to life by jonny s imagination casting matt hill samuel vincent and tony sampson were respectively cast as ed double d and eddy david paul buck grove and keenan christensen played parts of jonny 2x4 and jimmy respectively while sarah was voiced by janyse jaud peter kelamis voiced rolf while kathleen barr was cast as kevin nazz was voiced by tabitha st germain in season 1 jenn forgie in season 3 and erin fitzgerald in seasons 2 4 5 and 6 fitzgerald also played part of may one of kanker sisters except in season 3 when she was voiced by jenn forgie other two kanker sisters marie and lee were voiced by kathleen barr and janyse jaud eddy s adult brother is mentioned frequently throughout series but does not appear until ed edd n eddy s big picture show where he is voiced by series voice director terry klassen credits of all ed edd n eddy episodes and big picture show animation antonucci an advocate of hand drawn animation wanted to ensure ed edd n eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from 1940s to 1970s as a result series was last major animated series to use traditional cel animation cels were shipped to korea for creating initial animation and then later edited back at antonucci s a k a cartoon studio first four seasons were produced traditionally starting with ed edd n eddy s jingle jingle jangle in 2004 series switched to digital ink and paint to give impression of movement ed edd n eddy uses boiling lines or shimmering outlines which antonucci likens it to cartoons of 1930s ign has compared to and animation world magazine wrote that way line varies and shakes gives animation a distinctive and spontaneous feeling as if it were drawn by children boiling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper antonucci explained that he felt it helps keep characters alive and that he wanted to depart from other cartoon network series and pay homage to classic cartoon era all children have multicolored tongues antonucci said that idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard characters went through a number of walking cycles a process used to determine how each character should walk or run turn around blink etc before crew came up with final product music and title sequence antonucci showed theme song to studios when first pitching series thinking it would be better than only looking at drawings it was inspired by bob crosby and big cats song big noise from winnetka which was whistled something antonucci enjoyed doing as a child composed by patric caird who created all music in series antonucci performed whistling himself theme song was featured on compilation album cartoon medley title sequence was created by paul boyd broadcast although ed edd n eddy was originally set to premiere on november 7 1998
