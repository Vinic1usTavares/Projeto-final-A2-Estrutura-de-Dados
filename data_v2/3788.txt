intense tropical cyclone hondo jtwc designation 16s was strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during 2007 08 south west indian ocean cyclone season third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of season hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early february about 1 020 km 635 mi east southeast of diego garcia disturbance quickly strengthened becoming a moderate tropical storm on february 4 and a severe tropical storm following day after a brief period of slower intensification hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km h 130 mph 10 minute winds on february 7 cyclone gradually weakened over next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures on february 12 hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over following week remnant low traveled in a general west northwest direction with no development on february 20 about 2 780 km 1 725 mi northeast of where final advisories were issued storm began to regenerate next day advisories were issued on tropical disturbance ex hondo which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression however according to joint typhoon warning center hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km h 60 mph 1 minute winds before passing directly over reunion interaction with island caused storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more storm dissipated on february 29 after executing a counterclockwise loop meteorological history on february 2 regional specialized meteorological centre for southwest indian ocean meteo france and joint typhoon warning center jtwc began monitoring a tropical disturbance located in western portion of meteo france s area of responsibility however it was not operationally classified as a disturbance for another two days traveling generally towards southwest disturbance slowly strengthened at 0300 utc on february 4 jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for system as deep convection and outer bands developed around center located within a narrow area of low to moderate wind shear system traveled towards west southwest at 15 km h 9 mph shortly after meteo france began issuing advisories on tropical disturbance 10 while it was located about 1 020 km 635 mi east southeast of diego garcia a buoy located just to south of small circulation recording decreasing atmospheric pressure having lowered by 4 hpa mbar in past 24 hours with weak steering currents provided by an area of high pressure to north disturbance slowly moved towards east southeast at 1500 utc jtwc began issuing advisories on disturbance which they designated as tropical cyclone 16s with high oceanic heat content low wind shear and good divergence aloft significant strengthening was likely early next day meteo france upgraded disturbance to a tropical depression as winds increased to 55 km h 35 mph 10 minute winds however in post season analysis meteo france determined that system had become a depression about 12 hours earlier and was already a moderate tropical storm by time of operation upgrade at 0600 utc meteo france classified depression as a moderate tropical storm and was given name hondo a name submitted to world meteorological organization by zimbabwe it was later determined that hondo was already a severe tropical storm by time it was named operationally thumb right cyclone hondo strengthening on february 5 hondo continued to quickly strengthen becoming a tropical cyclone equivalent of a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale that same day after maintaining its through early hours of february 6 a pinhole eye began to develop signifying that hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification during this intensification phase storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in ridge which was previously steering cyclone towards east later that day hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175 km h 110 mph 10 minute winds after becoming an intense tropical cyclone wind shear began to increase causing eye to become slightly disorganized temporarily slowed intensification later in day eye became better defined allowing hondo to intensify further operationally hondo was upgraded to a very intense tropical cyclone with winds of 220 km h 140 mph 10 minute winds with a minimum pressure of 906 hpa mbar however after reanalysis it was found that hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215 km h 130 mph 10 minute winds with a minimum pressure of 915 hpa mbar thumb left cyclone hondo on february 9 around same time that meteo france assessed hondo to have peaked jtwc reported that storm had attained winds of 230 km h 145 mph 1 minute winds equivalent to a strong category 4 hurricane shortly after reaching peak intensity cloud tops around eye began to warm meaning that storm was beginning to weaken hondo also turned towards southwest and kept a steady pace as two subtropical highs began influencing its movement storm continued to weaken as cloud tops warmed but remained an intense tropical cyclone as its eye was still well defined hondo briefly re intensified later on february 8 despite structure of storm deteriorating cyclone maintained intense tropical cyclone status through february 10 due to formation of a large eye which helped maintain storms structure hondo gradually began to weaken due to a combination of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing forward motion on february 10 hondo started a gradual curving path due to a trough located to south and strengthening high pressure systems to north at 0600 utc storm was downgraded to a tropical cyclone as winds decreased to 155 km h 100 mph continued weakened led to storm being downgraded to a severe tropical storm early on february 11 as it tracked towards southeast after spending several hours over cold waters most of convection associated with hondo dissipated due to lack of energy and storm was further downgraded to a moderate tropical storm later that day no convection remained around storm as it weakened to a tropical depression jtwc issued their final advisory on february 12 as storm showed no signs of convective activity hondo degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as meteo france issued their final advisory at 1200 utc for next week remnant low traveled in a general west northwestward direction with little or no development on february 20 about 2 780 km 1 725 mi northeast of where final advisories were issued low began to develop weak convection around northern edge of center of circulation thumb right ex hondo near mauritius and reunion on february 23 on february 21 meteo france began to issue advisories on tropical disturbance ex hondo which presented a well defined circulation later that day deep convection redeveloped around center as low entered an area favorable for development at 0830 utc jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert stating that hondo was likely to regenerate into a tropical cyclone later that day hondo became almost stationary and was upgraded to a tropical depression as it continued to develop next day hondo was downgraded to a tropical disturbance as wind shear constrained convective development and caused system to weaken however early on february 23 jtwc began issuing advisories on hondo as they estimated winds to have reached 65 km h 40 mph once more at 0600 utc hondo attained winds of 95 km h 60 mph 1 minute winds near mauritius and reunion due to proximity to islands convection associated with storm became disorganized and it began to weaken jtwc issued their final advisory early on february 24 as system significantly weakened with center devoid of convection meteo france issued their final advisory several hours later remnants of hondo persisted for another five days executing a counterclockwise loop before dissipating on february 29 preparations and impact as hondo began to regenerate mauritius and reunion were placed under a state of alert residents in reunion were advised to stay up to date with latest warnings on storm not go hiking in mountains ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked stay away from shore and know locations of nearest shelters initially residents in madagascar feared that hondo would make landfall in country after being struck by cyclone ivan on february 16 however storm turn towards southwest away from madagascar on february 23 ex hondo tracked just offshore mauritius before passing directly over reunion just short of moderate tropical storm status sustained winds of 50 km h 31 mph with gusts up to 76 km h 47 mph were recorded on mauritius while sustained winds of 55 km h 35 mph with gusts up to 99 km h 61 mph were recorded on reunion highest rainfall total was recorded at totaling to 750 mm 29 5 in up to 760 000 people were affected on reunion and overall damage was minimal see also tropical cyclones in mascarene islands references external links joint typhoon warning center jtwc meteo france rsmc la reunion category
