dvulikiaspis is a genus of chasmataspidid a group of extinct aquatic arthropods fossils of single and type species d menneri have been discovered in deposits of early devonian period lochkovian epoch in krasnoyarsk krai siberia russia name of genus is composed by russian word dvulikii dvulikij meaning two faced and ancient greek word aspis aspis meaning shield species name honors discoverer of holotype of dvulikiaspis vladimir vasilyevich menner its prosoma head was subquadrate almost square to parabolic nearly u shaped with bean shaped to subovate nearly oval eyes and by a marginal rim abdomen was composed by a fused buckler and a postabdomen that occupied most of body length appendages limbs were uniform sixth and last pair of them had a paddle like shape and was placed in front of midpoint of prosoma largest specimen was 2 64 centimetres 1 04 inches long first fossil was described in 1959 as a new species of eurypterid stylonurus while other two were discovered in 1974 it would not be until 2014 when d menneri was recognized as a chasmataspidid genus being placed in family diploaspididae however dvulikiaspis was similar to loganamaraspis and especially hoplitaspis with which it could form a new separate family of chasmataspidids description left thumb restoration of d menneri like other chasmataspidids d menneri was a small arthropod biggest specimen pin 5116 1 reached a total length of 2 64 centimetres 1 04 inches this size is however notable among diploaspidids prosoma head was subquadrate almost square to parabolic nearly u shaped with a carapace dorsal plate of prosoma rather vaulted and somewhat rounded anteriorly and laterally and flat and posteriorly it was surrounded by a marginal rim that tapered backwards to sides largest preserved prosoma had a length of 0 5 cm 2 in eyes were large and reniform bean shaped to subovate nearly oval placed between sides and middle of carapace ocelli simple eye like sensory organs were positioned in center of prosoma as in rest of chasmataspidids its opisthosoma abdomen was composed of a preabdomen segments 1 to 4 and a postabdomen segments 5 to 13 in dvulikiaspis with very slight first order differentiation that is both parts little separated from each other segments in general were wide rectangles with almost straight boundaries narrowing slightly posteriorly short first tergite dorsal half of segment was conformed to posterior margin of prosoma second to fourth segments were merged into a weakly expressed buckler which was wide rectangular with rounded lateral edges and narrow angled shoulders extensions of buckler in postabdomen segments 11 to 13 were somewhat longer than previous ones each tergite carried an articular surface joint on its front interpreted to represent membranes plane joints which were a smooth and flattened facet with a slight posterior ridge these joints are identical to those of eurypterids and arachnids and are considered homologous telson tail was small and semicircular measuring 0 09 cm 0 036 in in length appendages limbs were almost parallel and of a similar length being uniform and foot like there was a small progressive increase in length until marginally shorter fifth pair podomeres segments of appendages were differentiated by a straight line and narrowed towards distal end second and third pair of appendages had five distal podomeres podomeres that were not underneath prosoma while fourth and fifth four sixth and last pair of appendages of dvulikiaspis are among best known in chasmataspidida they were modified into a paddle in front of midsection of prosoma although only five podomeres are known it is possible that sixth appendage of dvulikiaspis had eight chelicerae first pair of appendages are not known history of research thumb size comparison of d menneri dvulikiaspis was originally described in 1959 as a species of eurypterid genus stylonurus s menneri based on one single nearly complete specimen pin 1271 2 housed at paleontological institute of russian academy of sciences moscow it was found in deposits near imangda river at southwest of peninsula near norilsk krasnoyarsk krai russia then soviet union specific name menneri honors russian paleontologist and geologist vladimir vasilyevich menner who discovered fossil in 1956 he sent it to russian paleontologist nestor ivanovich novojilov who erected species to date his description is considered inaccurate and based only on best preserved material novojilov reported presence of paired tubercles in center of second and fourth to sixth tergites of s menneri and he compared this new species with scottish eurypterid then also part of stylonurus based on these tubercles novojilov would later assign s menneri to eurypterid genus tylopterella with whom it shared this characteristic paired tubercles however were doubtfully present in holotype two new specimens pin 5116 1 a nearly complete opisthosoma and pin 5116 3 a poorly preserved dorsal fossil were found in 1974 on an expedition by yu n but they were not described they were found in upper zub formation lower kureika formation in krasnoyarsk krai in 2011 british geologist and james c lamsdell noted that by presence of a paddle like sixth appendage three segmented fused buckler and nine segmented postabdomen t menneri could in fact represent a chasmataspidid questioning position of t menneri in tylopterella and eurypterida in 2014 paleontologists david j marshall lamsdell evgeniy s shpinev and simon j braddy recognized t menneri as a new separate genus of chasmataspidid due to its body size and position of prosomal appendages specially sixth appendage in anterior half of prosoma they also described two specimens collected in 1974 determining that all known material of this genus was subject to taphonomic distortion that is defects product of fossilization of organism they named it dvulikiaspis which is composed of russian word dvulikii dvulikij two faced referring to long lasting misidentification of d menneri and ancient greek suffix aspis aspis shield being translated as two faced shield they also noted that features such as almost straight segment boundaries were shared with another chasmataspidid loganamaraspis although latter probably did not have a paddle like sixth appendage classification 250px thumb restoration of related chasmataspidid hoplitaspis hiawathai dvulikiaspis is classified as part of family diploaspididae one of two families in order chasmataspidida it includes one only species d menneri from early devonian of siberia russia d menneri was originally recognized as a species of stylonurus in 1959 being moved to tylopterella in 1962 due to apparent presence of paired tubercles in tergites both conclusions done by novojilov have been criticized lamsdell already commented possibility that d menneri could represent a chasmataspidid in 2011 this was demonstrated in 2014 when it was redescribed as a new genus of chasmataspidid and removed from eurypterida noting its distinction with other diploaspidids and suggesting a relationship with loganamaraspis in 2019 during description of new ordovician chasmataspidid hoplitaspis hiawathai it was suggested that dvulikiaspis hoplitaspis and loganamaraspis could represent a new family separated from diploaspididae these genera share proportionality of body postabdomen comprises majority of body length a poorly differentiated buckler and a paddle projecting in front of midpoint of prosoma although this is not certain in loganamaraspis however creation of a new family was not considered correct at moment and all three genera currently remain in diploaspididae which is considered pending a more extensive revision cladogram below is based on a larger study simplified to only show chasmataspidids from 2015 carried out by paleontologists paul a selden lamsdell and liu qi expanded to include species diploaspis praecursor described in 2017 it showcases phylogenetic relationships within chasmataspidida paleoecology fossils of dvulikiaspis have been discovered in early devonian lochkovian deposits of in siberia russia d menneri has been found alongside specimens of chasmataspidids heteroaspis and andersoni as well as possible and indeterminate species of eurypterids like acutiramus lithography physical characteristics of rocks of place near imangda river has been described as gypsiferous with gypsum dolomitic with dolomite and with dark gray marl fossils were collected 60 metres below early devonian middle devonian boundary lithography of upper zub formation lower kureika formation was not much different also containing dolomitic marl with gypsum chasmataspidids remains were collected at between 307 m and 308 m here d menneri has been found with fossils of s andersoni and eurypterids pterygotus and parahughmilleria hefteri references category diploaspididae category early devonian first appearances category
