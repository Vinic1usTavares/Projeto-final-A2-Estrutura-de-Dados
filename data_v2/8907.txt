manchester bolton bury canal is a disused canal in greater manchester england built to link bolton and bury with manchester canal when fully opened was 15 miles 1 furlong 24 3 km long it was accessed via a junction with river irwell in salford seventeen locks were required to climb to summit as it passed through pendleton heading northwest to prestolee before it split northwest to bolton and northeast to bury between bolton and bury canal was level and required no locks six aqueducts were built to allow canal to cross rivers irwell and tonge and several minor roads canal was commissioned in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808 during golden age of canal building at a cost of ps127 700 ps today two acts of parliament allowed company to raise ps47 000 and ps80 000 respectively originally designed for narrow gauge boats during its construction canal was altered into a broad gauge canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with leeds and liverpool canal canal company later converted into a railway company and built a railway line close to canal s path which required modifications to salford arm of canal most of freight carried was coal from local collieries but as mines reached end of their working lives sections of canal fell into disuse and disrepair and it was officially abandoned in 1961 in 1987 a society was formed with aim of restoring canal for leisure use and in 2006 restoration began in area around junction with river irwell in salford canal is currently navigable as far as oldfield road salford history proposal local geology of irwell valley which included steep sided valleys with fast flowing rivers subject to rapid flooding and dry seasons confined local river transport to mersey and irwell navigation west of manchester financial unrest and british involvement in american revolutionary war restricted local transport investment to road improvements with arrival of more favourable conditions including end of war a proposal for a canal to link towns of manchester bolton and bury was mooted matthew fletcher had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed route of proposed canal but first public notice came from manchester on 4 september 1790 initial proposal probably came from a group in bolton with support of mersey and irwell navigation company a meeting was intended to be holden at house of mr shawe bull s head in manchester aforesaid on monday twentieth day of this instant september at eleven o clock in forenoon where surveys plans levels estimates and proposals would be presented a further meeting on 16 september held in bolton appointed a committee of six chaired by lord grey de wilton to attend at manchester a series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of route and authorised necessary actions to bring plan into fruition which included petitioning of parliament for required bill hugh henshall was asked to survey proposed route of canal for local industries along route of proposed canal whose operations relied on water from local rivers and brooks which canal might also use its construction was a controversial idea at a meeting in bolton on 4 october 1790 it was resolved that proper clauses be inserted in bill to prevent injury to owners of mills a meeting in bury at eagle child public house on 29 september 1790 secured an agreement that utility of this scheme nevertheless cannot with propriety be ascertained until such time as it has been certified from whence and in what proportion proprietors of intended navigation expect to draw their resources of water at another meeting in bury on 13 october 1790 hugh henshall gave a written report on canal and stated that his plan would not require water from river in times of drought but that floods and rivulets would supply his reservoirs he suggested that mill owners could be protected by a suitable clause in bill and such a clause was duly obtained by robert peel businesses in bolton were concerned with location of canal terminus and proposed construction of a tunnel to allow terminus to be built closer to town centre ralph fletcher spokesman for those concerned reported on this proposal to committee although no tunnel was built subscribers and funding notable names listed in this table are in order they appear on original document many other names

per ps100 share was initially paid with an additional ps10 call made by 10 august 1791 similar share calls were made at regular intervals over following years first dividend of 4 was paid in july 1812 with regular payments following thereafter work begins following a parliamentary survey of route by charles mcniven bill received royal assent on 13 may 1791 and became an act of parliament for construction of canal by which proprietors were empowered to purchase land for a breadth of 26 yards on level ground and wider where required for cuttings or embankments act allowed company to raise ps47 000 with shares of ps100 intention was that at prestolee route would divide into two branches arms with one branch towards bolton and other to bury but it would not however join river irwell proprietors were entitled to take water from any brooks within of canal or within of canal summits at bolton and bury at a meeting in manchester on 30 june 1791 at house of alexander patten a committee was formed with following members lord grey de wilton heaton house lancashire sir john heathcote longton newcastle staffordshire thomas butterworth bayley esq hope salford robert andrews esq rivington james wareing gentleman knowsley matthew fletcher mine owner clifton peter wright gentleman manchester william marsden merchant manchester charles mcniven gentleman manchester hugh henshall staffordshire john pilkington merchant manchester meeting secured a resolution that matthew fletcher and mr mcniven shall dispatch or procure 100 wheelbarrows and as many planks as they shall think necessary for use and accommodation of canal navigation further meetings took place from 26 29 july matthew fletcher was ordered to meet with land owners to discuss purchase of any land along route of canal and with this in mind on 30 july 1791 john seddon of sandy lane was ordered to survey line of canal beginning within estate of john heathcote and ending at southern extremity of reverend s estate fletcher and henshall were ordered to contact people and companies in building trade to discuss construction at a meeting on 16 august 1791 several persons attended and made offers for contract to build canal a mr john seddon of little hulton a labourer agreed to a contract on matthew fletcher s terms for a certain part of canal five other persons were rejected their proposals not receiving approbation of committee with news of planned rochdale canal link into manchester construction of rochdale canal did not reach manchester until 1804 company proposed to extend canal from bury through and to connect with rochdale canal at sladen new route known as bury and sladen canal was intended as a rival scheme to proposed rochdale link into manchester a survey was also carried out on a proposed extension from sladen to sowerby bridge company also considered links to leeds and liverpool canal and mersey and irwell navigation these plans would have substantially increased trans pennine traffic using company s canal and caused a potential loss of traffic and revenue on nearby bridgewater canal with this in mind owner of bridgewater canal duke of bridgewater agreed to allow rochdale canal company to connect to his canal at manchester despite persistence of canal company rochdale canal plan won day and in 1797 company abandoned bury and sladen canal plan left thumb map of canal showing features and sections with without water after several years of construction on 9 january 1794 an agreement was reached with leeds and liverpool canal company to create a link from bolton arm of canal to leeds and liverpool canal at red moss near horwich this agreement required significant design changes to allow canal to carry wider boats used on broad gauge leeds and liverpool canal which included a change to broad locks benjamin outram was employed to inspect works and reported on cost of this conversion as being ps26 924 although necessary changes were implemented route of leeds and liverpool canal was altered and link was not built in same year haslingden canal link to leeds and liverpool canal was proposed from bury arm of canal although authorised by an act of parliament it too was never built canal company remained hopeful of a link between two canals but all hope of this was lost when on 21 june 1819 an act of parliament was enacted to create a link between leigh extension of bridgewater canal and leeds and liverpool canal a report entitled a statement of situation of works of manchester bolton and bury canal on eighteenth of december 1795 gives details of progress of works including details of bridges cuttings raised and aqueducts much of document details work required to convert canal to broad gauge a length between oldfield lane in salford and giants seat locks in outwood was navigable with 3 ft 8 in 1 12 m of water remaining work included strengthening work to banks an increase of water depth to and gravelling of half of towpath between giants seat locks and ringley bridge two locks had been erected with a small section of canal to be broadened before becoming navigable from ringley bridge to prestolee aqueduct one lock had been erected nob end locks were still under construction but mostly complete although basin at bottom had not yet been dug stretch to bolton had at this time been widened with several bridges requiring further work incomplete embankments construction of a weir and gravelling of towpath on bury arm almost entire length had been dug and walls to support canal along bank of irwell had been built some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken none of towpath had been gravelled and no fences had been erected along towpath significant parts of canal were completed by 1796 including stretch up to bury in october of that year with completion of bolton arm in following year much of canal opened for business connection to fletcher s canal was completed in 1800 but with failure of scheme to connect bolton arm of canal to leeds and liverpool canal canal remained isolated from any other navigable waterway one proposed remedy involved construction of an aqueduct over river irwell in manchester to connect directly to rochdale canal between castlefield and piccadilly a bill was proposed in 1799 but after strong objections from mersey and irwell navigation company they eventually gave up and subsequently over following seven years canal company purchased enough land to build a canal link directly to irwell during construction company having spent all of money allowed in 1791 act of parliament incurred a debt of ps31 345 they therefore applied for a further act to enable company of proprietors of canal navigation from manchester to bolton and to bury to raise money to complete same to raise more money this act granted in 1805 allowed them to raise an additional ps80 000 this allowed them to repay debt and continue work to finish canal an inspection in june 1808 reported that by november 1808 canal would be complete throughout a connection to rochdale canal was eventually built in 1839 via manchester and salford junction canal which was funded in part by proprietors of mb b canal traffic most of traffic along canal transported coal from many collieries that existed along its length such as outwood colliery and ladyshore colliery some of these pits were linked to canal by road and some by short tramlines in late 19th century as much as of coal and of other materials retrieved on 29 june 2008 including night soil and fruit were transported annually canal also enabled transport of salt from cheshire to many bleach and dye works in its area hence name of salt wharf on bolton arm of canal tolls were easily calculated as milestones were placed along towpath at 1 4 mile 400 m intervals this was important as journeys were often quite short collieries being so close to industry along canal s length right thumb ladyshore colliery in 1968 boats used to transport coal were short and narrow and each contained a row of boxes used for carrying coal each box had a base of two halves hinged and held closed with chains these boxes would be lifted out of boats positioned by crane over a bunker or cart and emptied by releasing chains on base this design helped keep canal competitive as it increased speed with which loading and unloading of boats could be performed canal would often freeze in winter so an icebreaker was used to ensure canal remained navigable during cold weather named sarah lansdale and owned by james crompton it was towed by a team of horses while crew stood astride deck secured to handrails rocking boat from side to side and breaking ice in process often ice would be encountered that was so thick boat would rise up onto surface of ice this boat did once reside at boat museum in ellesmere port dock but was later destroyed by fire food and drink was made available to those using canal in several places including margaret barlow s tea gardens kilcoby cottage and rhodes lock a camping ground was also available at kilcoby cottage nearby giant s seat house was for some time home of canal manager canal also carried packet services with passengers facing a three hour journey between bolton and manchester first passenger boat to bolton was launched in 1796 from windsor castle public house and in 1798 a new packet boat was built for use of company fares were initially fixed by canal company although from 1805 contracted out and based upon service required a passenger using state cabin from bolton to manchester would be charged one shilling six pence and a single shilling on return journey passengers would change boats at prestolee to avoid delays at lock flight and also to save water and a purpose built covered walkway length of road was constructed for their benefit another passenger service ran along two arms from bolton to bury and over 60 000 passengers per year travelled on canal between july 1833 and june 1834 21 060 made journey from bolton to manchester 21 212 people travelled from manchester to bolton and 20 818 intermediary passengers hopped on and off boats en route in 1834 bolton to manchester service earned ps1 177 and bolton to bury service earned ps75 service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board this caused a tragedy in 1818 however when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize boat and a number of passengers including two children were drowned several fatal incidents combined with general passenger concern caused canal company to improve passenger safety in 1802 a wall was built at wharf at oldfield lane in salford and in 1833 a gas lamp was installed at ringley wharf a parcel service was also offered although this proved unpopular as it was unreliable railway proposal right thumb seal of manchester bolton bury canal navigation railway company in march 1829 idea of building a branch railway line from oldfield road terminus in salford to new liverpool and manchester railway was mooted but nothing was built in 1830 canal company led by chairman sir john tobin began to promote a proposal to build a railway along line of canal from salford to bolton alexander nimmo was employed to report on proposal and told that it was possible so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of canal shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from bolton to manchester and on 23 august 1831 obtained an act of parliament to become company of proprietors of manchester bolton and bury canal navigation and railway company they were empowered to build a line from manchester to bolton and bury upon or near line of canal and a branch from clifton aqueduct through to great lever in 1832 this company obtained an act that allowed it to build railway due mainly to objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to canal and supplies and would not have had branch railways built for them company agreed to an amending bill which would keep canal and allow new railway to be constructed alongside it due to technical and financial constraints branch to bury was never built canal therefore survived although locks 4 and 5 in salford were moved and combined into a two rise staircase with a second tunnel built underneath line which became known as manchester and bolton railway line opened on 28 may 1838 and company had purchased four locomotives from bury curtis and kennedy two from george forrester and company and two from william fairbairn sons between opening date and 9 january 1839 railway carried 228 799 passengers far more than had been carried on canal shortly thereafter passenger services on canal ceased and boats were sold off in 1846 company was taken over by manchester and leeds railway which itself became lancashire and yorkshire railway l yr following year in 1890 l yr widened line through salford locks 4 5 and 6 were moved slightly to north and tunnel under railway was replaced by a bridge although it is still referred to as a tunnel in 1922 l yr amalgamated into london and north western railway and in 1923 this company amalgamated into london midland and scottish railway this company was nationalised in 1948 under transport act 1947 and became part of british railways decline by 1924 bolton arm had experienced a significant fall in traffic although until 1930s when colliery closures reduced traffic even further coal trade remained brisk by 1935 fletcher s canal had fallen into disuse burst banks alongside irwell and croal rivers caused largely by subsidence from mining activities were common a major breach occurred in 1936 and was never repaired of land around this breach was purchased from british transport commission by cream s paper mill who subsequently built over part of canal on 2 march 1937 london midland and scottish railway held a special general meeting during which they proposed to abandon canal from clifton aqueduct to bailey bridge from bailey bridge to bury and entire bolton arm from nob end locks to bolton retrieved on 29 june 2008 proposal was not carried but four years later under london midland and scottish railway act of 1941 they abandoned of canal including a section from prestolee to clifton and entire bolton arm in 1939 during second world war ministry of transport ordered a half mile section in agecroft piped to reduce risk of german bomb damage damaging adjacent magnesium elektron company s site although it continued to generate revenue from sale of water tolls produced only a small proportion of canal s income in 1946 against expenses of ps12 500 it earned a total of ps7 296 of which only was from tolls in 1951 total income was ps8 815 against a total expenditure of ps9 574 in same year canal carried of coal and no other materials a british transport commission report of 1955 included canal in its list of waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation following an act of parliament in 1961 canal was abandoned retrieved on 1 july 2008 a single coal delivery service between sion street and bury moors continued until 1968 but this was last commercial traffic to use canal features thumb left nob end locks in operation there are several notable features along canal including prestolee aqueduct and clifton aqueduct both of which are grade ii listed structures retrieved on 27 june 2008 retrieved on 27 june 2008 nob end locks sometimes referred to as prestolee locks sit at junction of three arms of canal at nob end they comprise two sets of three staircase locks separated by a passing basin these locks served to lower level of canal by over a distance of upper staircase is still visible but most of lower staircase was filled in at some point in 1950s and much of stonework was removed a major breach of canal along bury arm revealed scale of engineering used in construction of retaining wall railway rails which were used to increase strength of walls are still clearly visible at site of breach mount sion steam crane a depiction of which is used as logo of manchester bolton bury canal society sits rusting and unused at mount sion on bury arm one of earliest surviving cranes in england it was built some time about 1875 1884 for mount sion bleach works by thomas smith sons of rodley and was used to unload coal boxes from barges into yard below canal it was granted grade ii listed status in 2011 design and construction right thumb upright reinforcements along bury arm help keep canal bank from sliding down valley canal was originally supplied by river irwell in bury at weddell brook tributary this proved insufficient for local industry and in 1842 elton reservoir at bury was built to become canal s principal supply although bury and bolton arms are on one level salford arm used seventeen broad locks including some in staircases nob end for example to descend over from summit level to lowest point at salford robert fulton had proposed an inclined plane at nob end but this design was rejected connection with fletcher s canal near clifton aqueduct was made by a single lock long by wide with a drop of although canal was originally designed to be a narrow canal with narrow locks for boats wide in 1794 an agreement was reached with leeds and liverpool canal company to create a link near red moss near horwich so broad locks were built to accommodate wide boats using that canal this meant removing some of narrow locks that had already been built an extension to original canal feeder was built at weddell brook in bury alongside river irwell route of leeds and liverpool canal was changed however and planned link never materialised design changes to canal were not completely without merit since they allowed two narrowboats to use each lock simultaneously saving passage time and water much of bury arm of canal runs alongside river irwell through irwell valley and eventually required construction of huge retaining walls to prevent canal bank from sliding down hill similar strengthening although on a smaller scale was required on bolton arm where it ran alongside river croal through these sections towpath is normally on side of canal closest to river left thumb prestolee aqueduct six aqueducts were required to allow canal to cross river irwell river tonge and four roads on bolton arm these were hall lane aqueduct fogg s aqueduct and larger damside aqueduct all of which have since been demolished hall lane aqueduct was damaged by mining subsidence and replaced in 1884 1885 it was demolished in 1950 salford arm flowed over prestolee aqueduct then clifton aqueduct and finally smaller lumn s lane aqueduct since demolished many bridges were also constructed along length of canal most were of small design allowing access to farmland although many are wide enough for a horse and cart in places where canal crossed important thoroughfares such as water street in radcliffe radcliffe road in darcy lever and agecroft road in pendlebury larger bridges were constructed cranes were used along many wharfs on canal to offload cargo one of these a steam crane at mount sion still exists albeit in poor condition at bury wharf a traversing steam crane positioned between two arms of terminus would offload cargo to be loaded into waiting lorries and a similar system was used at radcliffe wharf costs in 1795 costs of construction were detailed

breach at nob end canal has suffered several major breaches throughout its history as early as 1799 a flood carried away large sections of lower banks and on 15 october 1853 two boats were swept through a breach near bottom of nob end locks no injuries were reported three breaches were reported from 1878 1879 in little lever and darcy lever latter near burnden chemical works subsidence caused by mining activity prompted a breach near agecroft in 1881 as a result of such incidents from 1881 to 1888 engineer edwin muir was employed to reduce subsidence caused by mining activity similar work was undertaken throughout 1920s maps from 1880s show that by then to safeguard against further subsidence canal company had purchased areas of coal beneath canal in 1884 canal s owners lancashire and yorkshire railway successfully sued colliery owners knowles sons for losses incurred from damage caused by subsidence following this judgement railway company settled out of court with other colliery owners constant repairs were made particularly through pendleton where embankment was periodically raised some bridges were lifted far above their original supports while others sank as low as above head height one of most serious breaches occurred on 6 july 1936 near nob end close to junction of canal s three arms reported by manchester evening news following day it was never repaired and although canal saw continued use between ladyshore colliery and bury it eventually closed in 1961 current status thumb right canal north of agecroft road in water at this point towpath here was cleared of overgrowth in 2007 thumb right an aerial view of 1936 breach at nob end 2018 almost 60 of canal s original length is no longer in water bury wharf is now covered by an industrial estate a

irwell in salford has recently been restored and made navigable bolton arm of canal is interrupted by absence of hall lane aqueduct at little lever which was demolished in 1950 to make way for widening of hall lane in darcy lever damside aqueduct which crossed radcliffe road and tonge river is also missing having been demolished in june 1965 route of st peter s way has almost entirely destroyed a significant section of canal as it heads into centre of bolton and church wharf no longer exists last section of bolton arm of canal still in water is currently used for fishing entire

restoration thumb an aerial view of nob end locks showing first bolton bridge dug out and a dam being built across bury arm to help secure canal s future in 1987 manchester bolton bury canal society was formed to protect canal and campaign for restoration despite aforementioned problems on 21 october 2005 british waterways announced funding from european objective two funding northwest regional development agency and salford city council for a restoration scheme at newly named middlewood locks in salford which began in september 2006 restoration was halted briefly by discovery of what was initially thought to be a second world war bomb but which proved to be a wartime american mortar with no explosive content pilings for tunnel under manchester to preston line were completed in 2008 missing irwell towpath bridge known as bloody bridge which once crossed canal s entrance was replaced with an arched timber structure incorporating elements of old lock 1 much of canal s existing
