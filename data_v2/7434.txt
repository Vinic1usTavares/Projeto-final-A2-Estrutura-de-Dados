in practice within constraints of convention and precedent british monarchy traces its origins from petty kingdoms of early medieval scotland and anglo saxon england which consolidated into kingdoms of england and scotland by 10th century england was conquered by normans in 1066 after which wales too gradually came under control of anglo normans process was completed in 13th century when principality of wales became a client state of english kingdom meanwhile magna carta began a process of reducing english monarch s political powers from 1603 english and scottish kingdoms were ruled by a single sovereign from 1649 to 1660 tradition of monarchy was broken by republican commonwealth of england which followed wars of three kingdoms act of settlement 1701 excluded roman catholics or those who married them from succession to english throne in 1707 kingdoms of england and scotland were merged to create kingdom of great britain and in 1801 kingdom of ireland joined to create united kingdom of great britain and ireland british monarch was nominal head of vast british empire which covered a quarter of world s surface at its greatest extent in 1921 in early 1920s balfour declaration recognised evolution of dominions of empire into separate self governing countries within a commonwealth of nations after second world war vast majority of british colonies and territories became independent effectively bringing empire to an end george vi and his successor elizabeth ii adopted title head of commonwealth as a symbol of free association of its independent member states

judicial power is vested in various judiciaries of united kingdom who by constitution and constitutional reform act 2005 have judicial independence of government church of england of which monarch is head has its own legislative judicial and executive structures powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or statutory instrument such as an order in council royal commission or otherwise sovereign s role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non partisan functions such as granting honours this role has been recognised since 19th century constitutional writer walter bagehot identified monarchy in 1867 as dignified part rather than efficient part of government bagehot p 9 left thumb english bill of rights of 1689 curtailed monarch s governmental power appointment of prime minister whenever necessary monarch is responsible for appointing a new prime minister who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other minister of crown and thereby constitutes and controls government in accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions sovereign must appoint an individual who commands support of house of commons usually leader of party or coalition that has a majority in that house prime minister takes office by attending monarch in private audience and after kissing hands that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument brazier p 312 in a hung parliament where no party or coalition holds a majority monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing individual likely to command most support though it would usually be leader of largest party waldron pp 59 60 since 1945 there have only been three hung parliaments first followed february 1974 general election when harold wilson was appointed prime minister after edward heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition although wilson s labour party did not have a majority they were largest party second followed may 2010 general election in which conservatives largest party and liberal democrats third largest party agreed to form first coalition government since world war ii third occurred shortly thereafter in june 2017 when conservative party lost its majority in a snap election though party remained in power as a minority government dissolution of parliament in 1950 king s private secretary sir alan tommy lascelles writing pseudonymously to times newspaper asserted a constitutional convention according to lascelles principles if a minority government asked to dissolve parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position monarch could refuse and would do so under three conditions when harold wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974 queen granted his request as heath had already failed to form a coalition resulting general election gave wilson a small majority monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss prime minister but in practice prime minister s term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat death or resignation last monarch to remove prime minister was william iv who dismissed lord melbourne in 1834 brock michael september 2004 online edition january 2008 william iv 1765 1837 oxford dictionary of national biography oxford university press retrieved 10 october 2008 subscription required fixed term parliaments act 2011 removed monarch s authority to dissolve parliament however act specifically retained monarch s power of prorogation which is a regular feature of parliamentary calendar royal prerogative some of government s executive authority is theoretically and nominally vested in sovereign and is known as royal prerogative monarch acts within constraints of convention and precedent exercising prerogative only on advice of ministers responsible to parliament often through prime minister or privy council in practice prerogative powers are exercised only on prime minister s advice prime minister and not sovereign has control monarch holds a weekly audience with prime minister no records of these audiences are taken and proceedings remain fully confidential monarch may express his or her views but as a constitutional ruler must ultimately accept decisions of prime minister and cabinet providing they command support of house in bagehot s words sovereign has under a constitutional monarchy three rights right to be consulted right to encourage right to warn bagehot p 75 although royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise it is limited many crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to parliament for example monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes such an action requires authorisation of an act of parliament according to a parliamentary report crown cannot invent new prerogative powers and parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation royal prerogative includes powers to appoint and dismiss ministers regulate civil service issue passports declare war make peace direct actions of military and negotiate and ratify treaties alliances and international agreements however a treaty cannot alter domestic laws of united kingdom an act of parliament is necessary in such cases monarch is head of armed forces royal navy british army and royal air force and accredits british high commissioners and ambassadors and receives heads of missions from foreign states it is prerogative of monarch to summon and prorogue parliament each parliamentary session begins with monarch s summons new parliamentary session is marked by state opening of parliament during which sovereign reads speech from throne in chamber of house of lords outlining government s legislative agenda prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins and formally concludes session dissolution ends a parliamentary term and is followed by a general election for all seats in house of commons a general election is normally held five years after previous one under fixed term parliaments act 2011 but can be held sooner if prime minister loses a motion of confidence or if two thirds of members of house of commons vote to hold an early election before a bill passed by legislative houses can become law royal assent monarch s approval is required crabbe p 17 in theory assent can either be granted making bill law or withheld vetoing bill but since 1707 assent has always been granted monarch has a similar relationship with devolved governments of scotland wales and northern ireland sovereign appoints first minister of scotland on nomination of scottish parliament and first minister of wales on nomination of national assembly for wales in scottish matters sovereign acts on advice of scottish government however as devolution is more limited in wales in welsh matters sovereign acts on advice of prime minister and cabinet of united kingdom sovereign can veto any law passed by northern ireland assembly if it is deemed unconstitutional by secretary of state for northern ireland sovereign is deemed fount of justice although sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases judicial functions are performed in his or her name for instance prosecutions are brought on monarch s behalf and courts derive their authority from crown common law holds that sovereign can do no wrong monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences crown proceedings act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against crown in its public capacity that is lawsuits against government but not lawsuits against monarch personally sovereign exercises prerogative of mercy which is used to pardon convicted offenders or reduce sentences monarch is fount of honour source of all honours and dignities in united kingdom crown creates all peerages appoints members of orders of chivalry grants knighthoods and awards other honours although peerages and most other honours are granted on advice of prime minister some honours are within personal gift of sovereign and are not granted on ministerial advice monarch alone appoints members of order of garter order of

grandson aethelstan was first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to present borders of england though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities 11th century saw england become more stable despite a number of wars with danes which resulted in a danish monarchy for one generation cannon and griffiths pp 13 17 conquest of england in 1066 by william duke of normandy was crucial in terms of both political and social change new monarch continued centralisation of power begun in anglo saxon period while feudal system continued to develop cannon and griffiths pp 102 127 william was succeeded by two of his sons william ii then henry i henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter matilda his only surviving child as his heir following henry s death in 1135 one of william i s grandsons stephen laid claim to throne and took power with support of most of barons matilda challenged his reign as a result england descended into a period of disorder known as anarchy stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which matilda s son henry would succeed him henry accordingly became first angevin king of england and first monarch of plantagenet dynasty as henry ii in 1154 fraser pp 30 46 reigns of most of angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between monarch and nobility henry ii faced rebellions from his own sons future monarchs richard i and john nevertheless henry managed to expand his kingdom forming what is retrospectively known as angevin empire upon henry s death his elder son richard succeeded to throne he was absent from england for most of his reign as he left to fight in crusades he was killed besieging a castle and john succeeded him john s reign was marked by conflict with barons particularly over limits of royal power in 1215 barons coerced king into issuing magna carta latin for great charter to guarantee rights and liberties of nobility soon afterwards further disagreements plunged england into a civil war known as first barons war war came to an abrupt end after john died in 1216 leaving crown to his nine year old son henry iii fraser pp 54 74 later in henry s reign simon de montfort led barons in another rebellion beginning second barons war war ended in a clear royalist victory and in death of many rebels but not before king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265 fraser pp 77 78 next monarch edward longshanks was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for conquest of wales he attempted to establish english domination of scotland however gains in scotland were reversed during reign of his successor edward ii who also faced conflict with nobility fraser pp 79 93 in 1311 edward ii was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of baronial ordainers however military victories helped him regain control in 1322 ashley pp 595 597 nevertheless in 1327 edward was deposed by his wife isabella his 14 year old son became edward iii edward iii claimed french crown setting off hundred years war between england and france his campaigns conquered much french territory but by 1374 all gains had been lost edward s reign was also marked by further development of parliament which came to be divided into two houses in 1377 edward iii died leaving crown to his 10 year old grandson richard ii like many of his predecessors richard ii conflicted with nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands in 1399 while he was campaigning in ireland his cousin henry bolingbroke seized power richard was deposed imprisoned and eventually murdered probably by starvation and henry became king as henry iv fraser pp 96 115 henry iv was grandson of edward iii and son of john of gaunt duke of lancaster hence his dynasty was known as house of lancaster for most of his reign henry iv was forced to fight off plots and rebellions his success was partly due to military skill of his son future henry v henry v s own reign which began in 1413 was largely free from domestic strife leaving king free to pursue hundred years war in france although he was victorious his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son henry vi on throne and gave french an opportunity to overthrow english rule fraser pp 118 130 unpopularity of henry vi s counsellors and his belligerent consort margaret of anjou as well as his own ineffectual leadership led to weakening of house of lancaster lancastrians faced a challenge from house of york so called because its head a descendant of edward iii was richard duke of york although duke of york died in battle in 1460 his eldest son edward iv led yorkists to victory in 1461 wars of roses nevertheless continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son edward v and brother richard iii edward v disappeared presumably murdered by richard ultimately conflict culminated in success for lancastrian branch led by henry tudor in 1485 when richard iii was killed in battle of bosworth field fraser pp 133 165 now king henry vii he neutralised remaining yorkist forces partly by marrying elizabeth of york a yorkist heir through skill and ability henry re established absolute supremacy in realm and conflicts with nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end cannon and griffiths p 295 fraser pp 168 176 reign of second tudor king henry viii was one of great political change religious upheaval and disputes with pope led monarch to break from roman catholic church and to establish church of england anglican church fraser pp 179 189 wales which had been conquered centuries earlier but had remained a separate dominion was annexed to england under laws in wales acts 1535 and 1542 cannon and griffiths pp 194 265 309 henry viii s son and successor young edward vi continued with further religious reforms but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis he was wary of allowing his catholic elder half sister mary i to succeed and therefore drew up a will designating lady jane grey as his heiress jane s reign however lasted only nine days with tremendous popular support mary deposed her and declared herself lawful sovereign mary i married philip of spain who was declared king and co ruler pursued disastrous wars in france and attempted to return england to roman catholicism burning protestants at stake as heretics in process upon her death in 1558 pair were succeeded by her protestant half sister elizabeth i england returned to protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring new world ashley pp 636 647 and fraser pp 190 211 scottish monarchy in scotland as in england monarchies emerged after withdrawal of roman empire from britain in early fifth century three groups that lived in scotland at this time were picts in north east britons in south including kingdom of strathclyde and gaels or scotti who would later give their name to scotland of irish petty kingdom of dal riata in west kenneth macalpin is traditionally viewed as first king of a united scotland known as scotia to writers in latin or alba to scots cannon and griffiths pp 1 12 35 expansion of scottish dominions continued over next two centuries as other territories such as strathclyde were absorbed early scottish monarchs did not inherit crown directly instead custom of tanistry was followed where monarchy alternated between different branches of house of alpin as a result however rival dynastic lines clashed often violently from 942 to 1005 seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle weir pp 164 177 in 1005 malcolm ii ascended throne having killed many rivals he continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson duncan i instead of a cousin as had been usual in 1040 duncan suffered defeat in battle at hands of macbeth who was killed himself in 1057 by duncan s son malcolm following year after killing macbeth s stepson lulach malcolm ascended throne as malcolm iii ashley pp 390 395 with a further series of battles and five of malcolm s sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king eventually crown came to his youngest son david i david was succeeded by his grandsons malcolm iv and then by william lion longest reigning king of scots before union of crowns ashley pp 400 407 and weir pp 185 198 william participated in a rebellion against king henry ii of england but when rebellion failed william was captured by english in exchange for his release william was forced to acknowledge henry as his feudal overlord english king richard i agreed to terminate arrangement in 1189 in return for a large sum of money needed for crusades cannon and griffiths p 170 william died in 1214 and was succeeded by his son alexander ii alexander ii as well as his successor alexander iii attempted to take over western isles which were still under overlordship of norway during reign of alexander iii norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of scotland ensuing treaty of perth recognised scottish control of western isles and other disputed areas ashley pp 407 409 and cannon and griffiths pp 187 196 alexander iii s unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis scottish leaders appealed to king edward i of england for help in determining who was rightful heir edward chose alexander s three year old norwegian granddaughter margaret on her way to scotland in 1290 however margaret died at sea and edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to throne a court was set up and after two years of deliberation it pronounced john balliol to be king edward proceeded to treat balliol as a vassal and tried to exert influence over scotland in 1295 when balliol renounced his allegiance to england edward i invaded during first ten years of ensuing wars of scottish independence scotland had no monarch until robert bruce declared himself king in 1306 ashley pp 409 412 robert s efforts to control scotland culminated in success and scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328 however only one year later robert died and was succeeded by his five year old son david ii on pretext of restoring john balliol s rightful heir edward balliol english again invaded in 1332 during next four years balliol was crowned deposed restored deposed restored and deposed until he eventually settled in england and david remained king for next 35 years ashley pp 549 552 david ii died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew robert ii of house of stuart reigns of both robert ii and his successor robert iii were marked by a general decline in royal power when robert iii died in 1406 regents had to rule country monarch robert iii s son james i had been taken captive by english having paid a large ransom james returned to scotland in 1424 to restore his authority he used ruthless measures including execution of several of his enemies he was assassinated by a group of nobles james ii continued his father s policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at age of thirty and a council of regents again assumed power james iii was defeated in a battle against rebellious scottish earls in 1488 leading to another boy king james iv ashley pp 552 565 in 1513 james iv launched an invasion of england attempting to take advantage of absence of english king henry viii his forces met with disaster at flodden field king many senior noblemen and hundreds of soldiers were killed as his son and successor james v was an infant government was again taken over by regents james v led another disastrous war with english in 1542 and his death in same year left crown in hands of his six day old daughter mary i once again a regency was established mary a roman catholic reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in scotland as a result of efforts of reformers such as john knox a protestant ascendancy was established mary caused alarm by marrying her catholic cousin lord darnley in 1565 after lord darnley s assassination in 1567 mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with earl of bothwell who was widely suspected of darnley s murder nobility rebelled against queen forcing her to abdicate she fled to england and crown went to her infant son james vi who was brought up as a protestant mary was imprisoned and later executed by english queen elizabeth i ashley pp 567 575 personal union and republican phase thumb right in 1603 james vi and i became first monarch to rule over england scotland and ireland together elizabeth i s death in 1603 ended tudor rule in england since she had no children she was succeeded by scottish monarch james vi who was great grandson of henry viii s older sister and hence elizabeth s first cousin twice removed james vi ruled in england as james i after what was known as union of crowns although england and scotland were in personal union under one monarch james i became first monarch to style himself king of great britain in arms styles and titles of great britain westminster 20 october 1604 they remained two separate kingdoms james i s successor charles i experienced frequent conflicts with english parliament related to issue of royal and parliamentary powers especially power to impose taxes he provoked opposition by ruling without parliament from 1629 to 1640 unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies many of which were offensive to scottish presbyterians and english puritans his attempt to enforce anglicanism led to organised rebellion in scotland bishops wars and ignited wars of three kingdoms in 1642 conflict between king and english parliament reached its climax and english civil war began fraser pp 214 231 civil war culminated in execution of king in 1649 overthrow of english monarchy and establishment of commonwealth of england charles i s son charles ii was proclaimed king of great britain in scotland but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded england and was defeated at battle of worcester in 1653 oliver cromwell most prominent military and political leader in nation seized power and declared himself lord protector effectively becoming a military dictator but refusing title of king cromwell ruled until his death in 1658 when he was succeeded by his son richard new lord protector had little interest in governing he soon resigned cannon and griffiths pp 393 400 lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest and for a popular desire to restore monarchy in 1660 monarchy was restored and charles ii returned to britain fraser p 232 charles ii s reign was marked by development of first modern political parties in england charles had no legitimate children and was due to be succeeded by his roman catholic brother james duke of york a parliamentary effort to exclude james from line of succession arose petitioners who supported exclusion became whig party whereas abhorrers who opposed exclusion became tory party exclusion bill failed on several occasions charles ii dissolved parliament because he feared that bill might pass after dissolution of parliament of 1681 charles ruled without a parliament until his death in 1685 when james succeeded charles he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to roman catholics thereby drawing ire of many of his protestant subjects many opposed james s decisions to maintain a large standing army to appoint roman catholics to high political and military offices and to imprison church of england clerics who challenged his policies as a result a group of protestants known as immortal seven invited james ii s daughter mary and her husband william iii of orange to depose king william obliged arriving in england on 5 november 1688 to great public support faced with defection of many of his protestant officials james fled realm and william and mary rather than james ii s catholic son were declared joint sovereigns of england scotland and ireland fraser pp 242 245 james s overthrow known as glorious revolution was one of most important events in long evolution of parliamentary power bill of rights 1689 affirmed parliamentary supremacy and declared that english people held certain rights including freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent bill of rights required future monarchs to be protestants and provided that after any children of william and mary mary s sister anne would inherit crown mary died childless in 1694 leaving william as sole monarch by 1700 a political crisis arose as all of anne s children had died leaving her as only individual left in line of succession parliament was afraid that former james ii or his supporters known as jacobites might attempt to reclaim throne parliament passed act of settlement 1701 which excluded james and his catholic relations from succession and made william s nearest protestant relations family of sophia electress of hanover next in line to throne after his sister in law anne cannon and griffiths pp 439 440 soon after passage of act william iii died leaving crown to anne after 1707 acts of union thumb right england and scotland were united as great britain under queen anne in 1707 after anne s accession problem of succession re emerged

scotland parliament of england retaliated with alien act 1705 threatening to devastate scottish economy by restricting trade scottish and english parliaments negotiated acts of union 1707 under which england and scotland were united into a single kingdom of great britain with succession under rules prescribed by act of settlement cannon and griffiths pp 447 448 in 1714 queen anne was succeeded by her second cousin and sophia s son george i elector of hanover who consolidated his position by defeating jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719 new monarch was less active in government than many of his british predecessors but retained control over his german kingdoms with which britain was now in personal union cannon and griffiths pp 460 469 power shifted towards george s ministers especially to sir robert walpole who is often considered first british prime minister although title was not then in use next monarch george ii witnessed final end of jacobite threat in 1746 when catholic stuarts were completely defeated during long reign of his grandson george iii britain s american colonies were lost former colonies having formed united states of america but british influence elsewhere in world continued to grow and united kingdom of great britain and ireland was created by acts of union 1800 ashley pp 677 680 right thumb union of great britain and ireland into united kingdom occurred in 1801 during reign of king george iii from 1811 to 1820 george iii suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be porphyria an illness rendering him incapable of ruling his son future george iv ruled in his stead as prince regent during regency and his own reign power of monarchy declined and by time of his successor william iv monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power in 1834 william dismissed whig prime minister william lamb 2nd viscount melbourne and appointed a tory sir robert peel in ensuing elections however peel lost king had no choice but to recall lord melbourne during william iv s reign reform act 1832 which reformed parliamentary representation was passed together with others passed later in century act led to an expansion of electoral franchise and rise of house of commons as most important branch of parliament cannon and griffiths pp 530 550 final transition to a constitutional monarchy was made during long reign of william iv s successor victoria as a woman victoria could not rule hanover which only permitted succession in male line so personal union of united kingdom and hanover came to an end victorian era was marked by great cultural change technological progress and establishment of united kingdom as one of world s foremost powers in recognition of british rule over india victoria was declared empress of india in 1876 however her reign was also marked by increased support for republican movement due in part to victoria s permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following death of her husband in 1861 fraser pp 305 306 victoria s son edward vii became first monarch of house of saxe coburg and gotha in 1901 in 1917 next monarch george v changed saxe coburg and gotha to

dominion of india became a republic in 1950 it would no longer share in a common monarchy instead british monarch was acknowledged as head of commonwealth in all commonwealth member states whether they were realms or republics position is purely ceremonial and is not inherited by british monarch as of right but is vested in an individual chosen by commonwealth heads of government member states of commonwealth that share same person as monarch are informally known as commonwealth realms monarchy in ireland in 1155 only english pope adrian iv authorised king henry ii of england to take possession of ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship pope wanted english monarch to annex ireland and bring irish church into line with rome despite this process already underway in ireland by 1155 subscription required an all island kingship of ireland had been created in 854 by mael sechnaill mac his last successor was ua who had become king of ireland in early 1166 and exiled diarmait mac murchada king of leinster diarmait asked henry ii for help gaining a group of anglo norman aristocrats and adventurers led by richard de clare 2nd earl of pembroke to help him regain his throne diarmait and his anglo norman allies succeeded and he became king of leinster again de clare married diarmait s daughter and when diarmait died in 1171 de clare became king of leinster subscription required henry was afraid that de clare would make ireland a rival norman kingdom so he took advantage of papal bull and invaded forcing de clare and other anglo norman aristocrats in ireland and major irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord subscription required english lords came close to colonising entire island but a gaelic resurgence from 1260s resulted in island divided between gaelic irish and anglo irish lords by 1400 many of latter became completely gaelicised and did not recognise england s kings except perhaps nominally some such as manus o donnell and conn o neill 1st earl of tyrone were kings themselves by 1541 king henry viii of england had broken with church of rome and declared himself supreme head of church of england pope s grant of ireland to english monarch became invalid so henry summoned a meeting of irish parliament to change his title from lord of ireland to king of ireland subscription required however much of island was beyond english control resulting in extended tudor conquest of ireland that only made kingdom of ireland a reality in 1603 at conclusion of nine years war ireland nevertheless ireland retained its own parliament becoming an independent state in 1642 1649 confederate ireland and again in 1688 91 only warfare such as williamite war in ireland and subsequent occupation enabled english crown from 1692 and successive british states from 1707 to retain country in 1800 as a result of irish rebellion of 1798 act of union merged kingdom of great britain and kingdom of ireland into united kingdom of great britain and ireland whole island of ireland continued to be a part of united kingdom until 1922 when what is now republic of ireland won independence as irish free state a separate dominion within commonwealth irish free state was renamed eire or ireland in 1937 and in 1949 declared itself a republic left commonwealth and severed all ties with monarchy northern ireland remained within union in 1927 united kingdom changed its name to united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland while monarch s style for next twenty years became of great britain ireland and british dominions beyond seas king defender of faith emperor of india modern status in 1990s republicanism in united kingdom grew partly on account of negative publicity associated with royal family for instance immediately following death of diana princess of wales however polls from 2002 to 2007 showed that around 70 80 of british public supported continuation of monarchy religious role sovereign is supreme governor of established church of england archbishops and bishops are appointed by monarch on advice of prime minister who chooses appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a church commission crown s role in church of england is titular most senior clergyman archbishop of canterbury is spiritual leader of church and of worldwide anglican communion monarch takes an oath to preserve church of scotland and he or she holds power to appoint lord high commissioner to church s general assembly but otherwise plays no part in its governance and exerts no powers over it sovereign plays no formal role in disestablished church in wales or church of ireland succession relationship between commonwealth realms is such that any change to laws governing succession to shared throne requires unanimous consent of all realms succession is governed by statutes such as bill of rights 1689 act of settlement 1701 and acts of union 1707 rules of succession may only be changed by an act of parliament it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession act of settlement restricts succession to legitimate protestant descendants of sophia of hanover 1630 1714 a granddaughter of james i upon death of a sovereign their heir immediately and automatically succeeds hence phrase king is dead long live king and accession of new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an accession council that meets at st james s palace upon their accession a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths accession declaration as first required by bill of rights and an oath that they will maintain and preserve church of scotland settlement as required by act of union monarch is usually crowned in westminster abbey normally by archbishop of canterbury a coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign indeed ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning when an individual ascends to throne it is expected they will reign until death only voluntary abdication that of edward viii had to be authorised by a special act of parliament his majesty s declaration of abdication act 1936 last monarch involuntarily removed from power was james vii and ii who fled into exile in 1688 during glorious revolution restrictions by gender and religion succession was largely governed by male preference cognatic primogeniture under which sons inherit before daughters and elder children inherit before younger ones of same gender prime minister of united kingdom david cameron announced at commonwealth heads of government meeting 2011 that all 16 commonwealth realms including united kingdom had agreed to abolish gender preference rule for anyone born after date of meeting 28 october 2011 they also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a roman catholic a law which dated from act of settlement 1701 however since monarch is also supreme governor of church of england law which prohibits a roman catholic from acceding to throne remains necessary uk legislation making changes received royal assent on 25 april 2013 and was brought into force in march 2015 after equivalent legislation was approved in all other commonwealth realms though catholics are prohibited from succeeding and are deemed naturally dead for succession purposes disqualification does not extend to individual s legitimate protestant descendants regency regency acts allow for regencies in event of a monarch who is a minor or who is physically or mentally incapacitated when a regency is necessary next qualified individual in line of succession automatically becomes regent unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated special provisions were made for queen elizabeth ii by regency act 1953 which stated that duke of edinburgh queen s husband could act as regent in these circumstances since reaching adulthood in november 1966 charles prince of wales has been first in line for regency during a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from kingdom sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her

grant in aid paid for travel civil list covered most expenses including those for staffing state visits public engagements and official entertainment its size was fixed by parliament every 10 years any money saved was carried forward to next 10 year period from 2012 until 2020 civil list and grants in aid are to be replaced with a single sovereign grant which will be set at 15 of revenues generated by crown estate crown estate is one of largest property owners in united kingdom with holdings of ps7 3 billion in 2011 it is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by sovereign in a private capacity in modern times profits surrendered from crown estate to treasury have exceeded civil list and grants in aid for example crown estate produced ps200 million in financial year 2007 8

treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure republicans estimate that real cost of monarchy including security and potential income not claimed by state such as profits from duchies of lancaster and cornwall and rent of buckingham palace and windsor castle is ps334 million a year estimates of queen s wealth vary depending on whether assets owned by her personally or held in trust

used a particular name no ordinal is used for example queen victoria is not known as victoria i and ordinals are not used for english monarchs who reigned before norman conquest of england question of whether numbering for british monarchs is based on previous english or scottish monarchs was raised in 1953 when scottish nationalists challenged queen s use of elizabeth ii on grounds that there had never been an elizabeth i in scotland in maccormick v lord advocate scottish court of session ruled against plaintiffs finding that queen s title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative home secretary told house of commons that monarchs since acts of union had consistently used higher of english and scottish ordinals which in applicable four cases has been english ordinal royal titles
