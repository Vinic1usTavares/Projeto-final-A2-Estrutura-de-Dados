phallus indusiatus commonly called bamboo mushrooms bamboo pith long net stinkhorn crinoline stinkhorn or veiled lady is a fungus in family phallaceae or stinkhorns it has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical areas and is found in southern asia africa americas and australia where it grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well rotted woody material fruit body of fungus is characterised by a conical to bell shaped cap on a stalk and a delicate lacy skirt or indusium that hangs from beneath cap and reaches nearly to ground first described scientifically in 1798 by french botanist etienne pierre ventenat species has often been referred to a separate genus dictyophora along with other phallus species featuring an indusium p indusiatus can be distinguished from other similar species by differences in distribution size color and indusium length mature fruit bodies are up to tall with a conical to bell shaped cap that is wide cap is covered with a greenish brown spore containing slime which attracts flies and other insects that eat spores and disperse them an edible mushroom featured as an ingredient in chinese haute cuisine it is used in stir frys and chicken soups mushroom grown commercially and commonly sold in asian markets is rich in protein carbohydrates and dietary fiber mushroom also contains various bioactive compounds and has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties phallus indusiatus has a recorded history of use in chinese medicine extending back to 7th century ad and features in nigerian folklore taxonomic history phallus indusiatus was initially described by french naturalist etienne pierre ventenat in 1798 and sanctioned under that name by christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 one author anonymously gave his impressions of ventenat s discovery in an 1800 publication this beautiful species which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish it from every other individual of class is copiously produced in dutch guiana about 300 paces from sea and nearly as far from left bank of river of surinam it was communicated to me by elder vaillant father of more famous francois levaillant explorer and ornithologist elder levaillant was a merchant of metz who served as french consul in dutch guiana until 1763 who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by highest tides and is formed of a very fine white sand covered with a thin stratum of earth prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at same time very different periods of their expansion brilliancy and varied shades of their colours present a prospect truly picturesque fungus was later placed in a new genus dictyophora in 1809 by nicaise auguste desvaux it was then known for many years as dictyophora indusiata christian gottfried daniel nees von esenbeck placed species in hymenophallus in 1817 as h indusiatus both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of phallus and species is now known again by its original name curtis gates lloyd described variety rochesterensis in 1909 originally as a new species phallus rochesterensis it was found in kew australia a form with a pink coloured indusium was reported by vincenzo de in 1879 as hymenophallus roseus and later called dictyophora indusiata f rosea by in 1965 it is synonymous with phallus cinnabarinus a taxon described in 1936 as dictyophora lutea and variously known for years as dictyophora indusiata f lutea d indusiata f aurantiaca or phallus indusiatus f citrinus was formally transferred to phallus in 2008 as a distinct species phallus luteus specific epithet is latin adjective indusiatus wearing an undergarment former generic name dictyophora is derived from ancient greek words net and phero to bear hence bearing a net phallus indusiatus has many common names based on its appearance including long net stinkhorn crinoline stinkhorn hall 2003 p 19 basket stinkhorn bridal veil fungus and veiled lady japanese name derived from word kinugasa refers to wide brimmed hats that featured a hanging silk veil to hide and protect wearer s face a chinese common name that alludes to its typical growth habitat is bamboo mushroom description thumb left dictyophora indusiata found in cooktown australia lacy skirt under cap is indusium immature fruit bodies of p indusiatus are initially enclosed in an egg shaped to roughly spherical subterranean structure encased in a peridium egg ranges in color from whitish to buff to reddish brown measures up to in diameter and usually has a thick mycelial cord attached at bottom as mushroom matures pressure caused by enlargement of internal structures cause peridium to tear and fruit body rapidly emerges from egg mature mushroom is up to tall and girded with a net like structure called indusium or less technically a skirt that hangs down from conical to bell shaped cap netlike openings of indusium may be polygonal or round in shape well developed specimens have an indusium that reaches to volva and flares out somewhat before collapsing on stalk cap is wide and its reticulated pitted and ridged surface is covered with a layer of greenish brown and foul smelling slime gleba which initially partially obscures reticulations top of cap has a small hole stalk is long chang miles 2004 p 344 and thick hollow stalk is white roughly equal in width throughout its length sometimes curved and spongy ruptured peridium remains as a loose volva at base of stalk fruit bodies develop during night and require 10 15 hours to fully develop after emerging from peridium chang miles 2004 p 348 they are short lived typically lasting no more than a few days at that point slime has usually been removed by insects leaving pale off white bare cap surface exposed spores of p indusiatus are thin walled smooth elliptical or slightly curved hyaline translucent and measure 2 3 by 1 1 5 mm similar species phallus multicolor is similar in overall appearance but it has a more brightly coloured cap stem and indusium and it is usually smaller it is found in australia guam sumatra java borneo papua new guinea zaire and tobago as well as hawaii cap of indo pacific species p merulinus appears smooth when covered with gleba and is pale and wrinkled once gleba has worn off in contrast cap surface of p indusiatus tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under gleba also indusium of p merulinus is more delicate and shorter than that of p indusiatus and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight common in eastern north america and japan and widely recorded in europe species p duplicatus has a smaller indusium that hangs from bottom of cap and sometimes collapses against stalk found in asia australia hawaii southern mexico and central and south america p cinnabarinus grows to tall and has a more offensive odor than p indusiatus it attracts flies from genus lucilia family rather than house flies of genus musca that visit p indusiatus p described from china in 1988 is closely related to p indusiatus but can be distinguished by its volva that has a spiky echinulate surface and its higher preferred growth temperature of p luteus originally considered a form of p indusiatus has a yellowish reticulate cap a yellow indusium and a pale pink to reddish purple peridium and rhizomorphs it is found in asia and mexico ecology and distribution thumb p indusiatus from india range of phallus indusiatus is tropical including africa congo nigeria uganda and zaire south america brazil guyana and venezuela central america costa rica and tobago in north america its range is restricted to mexico asian localities include indonesia nepal malaysia india southern china japan and taiwan it has also been collected in australia like all phallus species p indusiatus is saprobic deriving nutrients from breaking down wood and plant organic matter fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips in asia it grows among bamboo forests and typically fruits after heavy rains hall 2003 p 247 method of reproduction for stinkhorns including p indusiatus is different from most agaric mushrooms which forcibly eject their spores stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp sickly sweet odor of carrion chang miles 2004 p 346 cloying stink of mature fruit bodies detectable from a considerable distance is attractive to certain insects species recorded visiting fungus include stingless bees of genus and flies of families drosophilidae and muscidae insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere although function of indusium is not known definitively it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by odour and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach gleba edibility and cultivation thumb left fungus is sold dried and is usually rehydrated before cooking thumb left tom is a thai soup made with this fungus in eastern asia p indusiatus is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac previously only collected in wild where it is not abundant it was difficult to procure mushroom s scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions in time of china s qing dynasty species was collected in yunnan province and sent to imperial palaces to satisfy appetite of empress dowager cixi who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi hu 2005 pp 94 5 it was one of eight featured ingredients of bird s nest eight immortals soup served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday this dish served by descendants of confucius family in celebrations and longevity banquets contained ingredients that were all precious food delicacies from land and sea fresh tender and crisp appropriately sweet and salty hu 2005 p 96 another notable use was a state banquet held for american diplomat henry kissinger on his visit to china to reestablish diplomatic relations in early 1970s chang miles 2004 p 343 one source writes of mushroom it has a fine and tender texture fragrance and is attractive beautiful in shape fresh and crispy in taste hu 2005 p 110 dried fungus commonly sold in asian markets is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender sometimes used in stir frys it is traditionally used as a component of rich chicken soups rehydrated mushroom can also be stuffed and cooked phallus indusiatus has been cultivated on a commercial scale in china since 1979 in fujian province of china known for a thriving mushroom industry that cultivates 45 species of edible fungi p indusiatus is produced in counties of and ningde advances in cultivation have made fungus cheaper and more widely available in 1998 about were produced in china hong kong price for a kilogram of dried mushrooms reached around us 770 in 1982 but had dropped to us 100 200 by 1988 additional advances led to it dropping further to us 10 20 by 2000 fungus is grown on agricultural wastes bamboo trash sawdust covered with a thin layer of non sterilised soil optimal temperature for growth of mushroom spawn and fruit bodies is about with a relative humidity of 90 95 other substrates that can be used for cultivation of fungus include bamboo leaves and small stems soybean pods or stems corn stems and willow leaves a nutritional analysis of p indusiatus based on specimens collected from nigeria determined that egg stage of fungus contains per 100 g of fungus dry weight 33 6 g of crude protein 1 66 g of fat and 3 98 g of carbohydrates egg stage was also measured to comprise 20 9 g dietary fibre and 88 76 moisture high levels of protein and fibre which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables respectively suggest that egg form of p indusiatus is a good food source concentration of several mineral elements including potassium sodium and iron was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables although mineral composition in fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in soil in which they grow folklore according to ethnomycologist r gordon wasson p indusiatus was consumed in mexican divinatory ceremonies on account of its suggestive shape on other side of globe new guinea natives consider mushroom sacred in nigeria mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given name by yoruba people name is derived from a combination of yoruba words ku die fun for ode hunter and wa search and refers to how mushroom s stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal yoruba have been reported to have used it as a component of a charm to make hunters less visible in times of danger in other parts of nigeria they have been used in preparation of harmful charms by ethnic groups such as and people igbo people of east central nigeria called stinkhorns ero mma from igbo words for mushroom and beauty bioactive properties medicinal properties have been ascribed to phallus indusiatus from time of chinese tang dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia fungus was used to treat many inflammatory stomach and neural diseases southern china s miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions including injuries and pains cough dysentery enteritis leukemia and feebleness and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis fever and low urine output diarrhea hypertension cough hyperlipidemia and in anticancer therapy modern science has probed biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits fruit bodies of fungus contain biologically active polysaccharides a b d glucan called t 5 n and prepared from alkaline extracts has been shown to have anti inflammatory properties its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of a 1 3 linked d residues with traces of 1 6 linked d residues polysaccharide has tumour suppressing activity against subcutaneously implanted sarcoma 180 a non connective tissue tumour often used in research in mice another chemical of interest found in p indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor tyrosinase catalyzes initial steps of in mammals and is responsible for undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post harvest handling and processing and its inhibitors are of interest to medical cosmetics and food industries hydroxymethylfurfural which occurs naturally in several foods is not associated with serious health risks p indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease an enzyme that cuts rna into smaller components possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom two novel sesquiterpenes a and b have been identified from fruit bodies of fungus these compounds based on eudesmane skeleton a common structure found in plant derived flavours and fragrances are first eudesmane derivatives isolated from fungi and were found to promote synthesis of nerve growth factor in cells related compounds isolated and identified from fungus include three derivatives a class of compounds rare in nature a b and c these chemicals were shown in laboratory tests to have a protective effect on cultured mouse neurons that had been exposed to neurotoxins a total synthesis for was reported in 2007 fungus has long been recognised to have antibacterial properties addition of fungus to soup broth was known to prevent it from spoiling for several days experiments have shown that extracts of p indusiatus have antioxidant in addition to antimicrobial properties mushroom extracts were tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi pathogenic to humans and in some cases had antimicrobial activity comparable to antibiotics tetracycline and one of responsible antibiotics was isolated in 2011 it is a that was already known from soil bacterium streptomyces antioxidant effect of fungus is due to presence of polyphenols whose role in reducing cellular damage from oxidative stress is well known a 2001 publication in international journal of medicinal mushrooms attempted to determine its efficacy as an aphrodisiac in trial involving sixteen women six self reported experience of a mild orgasm while smelling fruit body and other ten who received smaller doses self reported an increased heart rate all of twenty men tested considered smell displeasing study used fruit bodies found in hawaii not edible variety cultivated in china study has received criticism a way to achieve instant orgasms would be expected to gain much attention and many attempts to reproduce effect but none has succeeded no major science journal has published study and there are no studies where results have been reproduced expedition ecstasy sniffing out truth
