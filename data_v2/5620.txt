games should miss despite overall positive reception some reviewers thought that game had too many redundancies in cases and left too little control to player leading to game being boring at times although 1up gave it a perfect score they also warned that extended cut scenes in game could make some players feel they lost control of action gametrailers concluded that game s repetition dragged down but that it was still an overall positive experience that focused more on characters than other games responding to criticism that accused characters bodies of being lifeless despite game s use of motion capture brendan mcnamara game s director and writer defended game in an interview with eurogamer mcnamara felt that people were responding to realism in faces and it made bodies look lifeless by comparison because of lack of animation on characters clothing in same interview mcnamara also noted that phelps responds aggressively to certain prompts because game was originally written as coax force and lie when game came out it was changed to truth doubt or lie which made phelps commonly take awkward stances from what player expected at 2012 bafta video game awards l a
