wholly within christian drama incapable of denying its truth but equally incapable of living that truth he accuses eliot of animating of jew acknowledging his obsolescence essentially employing a tired characterisation of a jewish figure as a voice attesting that jews have no role in christian future julius compares simeon to moses stating that he is fated to see promised land but not to enter it witness to its truth but denied its redemptive power jew stands solemnly humbly outside christianity s gates further julius draws on a quote from eliot s earlier poem gerontion to say that in this christian future jews may find a ledge there to squat on julius view is considered extreme by many critics comparatively julius tempered his harsh criticism by claiming that eliot s anti semitism does not detract from poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to eliot s art literary critic and professor christopher ricks agreed citing wit and commentary of eliot s
