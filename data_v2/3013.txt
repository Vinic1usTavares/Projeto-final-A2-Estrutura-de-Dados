thumb right high mass air well of belgian engineer achille knapen in trans en provence an air well or aerial well is a structure or device that collects water by promoting condensation of moisture from air designs for air wells are many and varied but simplest designs are completely passive require no external energy source and have few if any moving parts three principal designs are used for air wells designated as high mass radiative and active high mass air wells used in early 20th century but approach failed low mass radiative collectors developed in late 20th century onwards proved to be much more successful active collectors these collect water in same way as a although designs work well they require an energy source making them uneconomical except in special circumstances new innovative designs seek to minimise energy requirements of active condensers or make use of renewable energy resources background thumb right global atmospheric water vapor for 30 january 2005 northern hemisphere winter and southern hemisphere summer all air well designs incorporate a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms dew is a form of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate it is distinct from fog in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in air condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue an air well requires moisture from air everywhere on earth even in deserts surrounding atmosphere contains at least some water according to beysens and atmosphere contains of fresh water composed of 98 percent water vapour and 2 percent condensed water clouds a figure comparable to renewable liquid water resources of inhabited lands quantity of water vapour contained within air is commonly reported as a relative humidity and this depends on temperature warmer air can contain more water vapour than cooler air when air is cooled to dew point it becomes saturated and moisture will condense on a suitable surface for instance dew temperature of air at and 80 percent relative humidity is dew temperature falls to if relative humidity is 50 percent a related but quite distinct technique of obtaining atmospheric moisture is fog fence an air well should not be confused with a dew pond a dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock name dew pond sometimes cloud pond or mist pond derives from widely held belief that pond was filled by moisture from air oxford english dictionary dew pond in fact dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater a stone mulch can significantly increase crop yields in arid areas this is most notably case in canary islands on island of lanzarote there is about of rain each year and there are no permanent rivers despite this substantial crops can be grown by using a mulch of volcanic stones a trick discovered after volcanic eruptions in 1730 some credit stone mulch with promoting dew although idea has inspired some thinkers it seems unlikely that effect is significant rather plants are able to absorb dew directly from their leaves and main benefit of a stone mulch is to reduce water loss from soil and to eliminate competition from weeds history beginning in early 20th century a number of inventors experimented with high mass collectors notable investigators were russian engineer friedrich zibold sometimes given as friedrich siebold french leon chaptal german australian researcher wolf klaphake and belgian inventor achille knapen zibold s collector thumb upright 1 25 a section through zibold s dew condenser a is a truncated cone of beach pebbles in diameter at base and in diameter at top b is a concrete bowl a pipe not shown leads away from base of bowl to a collecting point c is ground level and d is natural limestone base based on diagram by nikolayev et all 1996 in 1900 near site of ancient byzantine city of theodosia thirteen large piles of stones were discovered by zibold who was a forester and engineer in charge of this area each stone pile covered just over and was about tall finds were associated with remains of terracotta pipes that apparently led to wells and fountains in city zibold concluded that stacks of stone were condensers that supplied theodosia with water and calculated that each air well produced more than each day to verify his hypothesis zibold constructed a stone pile condenser at an altitude of on mount tepe oba near ancient site of theodosia zibold s condenser was surrounded by a wall high wide around a bowl shaped collection area with drainage he used sea stones in diameter piled high in a truncated cone that was in diameter across top shape of stone pile allowed a good air flow with only minimal thermal contact between stones zibold s condenser began to operate in 1912 with a maximum daily production that was later estimated to have been zibold made no public record of his results at time base developed leaks that forced experiment to end in 1915 and site was partially dismantled before being abandoned site was rediscovered in 1993 and cleaned up zibold s condenser was approximately same size as ancient stone piles that had been found and although yield was very much less than yield zibold had calculated for original structures experiment was an inspiration for later developers chaptal s collector inspired by zibold s work chaptal built a small air well near montpellier in 1929 chaptal s condenser was a pyramidal concrete structure square and high it was filled with of limestone pieces being about in diameter small vent holes ringed top and bottom of pyramid these holes could be closed or opened as required to control flow of air structure was allowed to cool during night and then warm moist air was let in during day dew formed on limestone pieces and collected in a reservoir below ground level amount of water obtained varied from to per day depending on atmospheric conditions chaptal did not consider his experiment a success when he retired in 1946 he put condenser out of order possibly because he did not want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells klaphake s collectors wolf klaphake was a successful chemist working in berlin during 1920s and 1930s during that time he tested several forms of air wells in yugoslavia and on vis island in adriatic sea klaphake s work was inspired by zibold and by works of maimonides a known jewish scholar who wrote in arabic about 1 000 years ago and who mentioned use of water condensers in palestine klaphake experimented with a very simple design an area of mountain slope was cleared and smoothed with a watertight surface it was shaded by a simple canopy supported by pillars or ridges sides of structure were closed but top and bottom edges were left open at night mountain slope would cool and in day moisture would collect on and run down smoothed surface although system apparently worked it was expensive and klaphake finally adopted a more compact design based on a masonry structure this design was a sugarloaf shaped building about high with walls at least thick with holes on top and at bottom outer wall was made of concrete to give a high thermal capacity and inner surface was made of a porous material such as sandstone according to klaphake traces of klaphake s condensers have been tentatively identified in 1935 wolf klaphake and his wife maria emigrated to australia decision to emigrate was probably primarily result of maria s encounters with nazi authorities their decision to settle in australia rather than say in britain was influenced by wolf s desire to develop a dew condenser as a dry continent australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water and premier of south australia whom he had met in london had expressed an interest klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at small town of cook where there was no supply of potable water at cook railway company had previously installed a large coal powered active condenser but it was prohibitively expensive to run and it was cheaper to simply transport water however australian government turned down klaphake s proposal and he lost interest in project knapen s aerial well knapen who had previously worked on systems for removing moisture from buildings prevention of damp in buildings manchester guardian 27 february 1930 p 6 column f was in turn inspired by chaptal s work and he set about building an ambitiously large puits aerial well on a high hill at trans en provence in france beginning in 1930 knapen s dew tower took 18 months to build it still stands today albeit in dilapidated condition at time of its construction condenser excited some public interest air well waters parched farms popular science march 1933 tower is high and has massive masonry walls about thick with a number of apertures to let in air inside there is a massive column made of concrete at night whole structure is allowed to cool and during day warm moist air enters structure via high apertures cools descends and leaves building by lower apertures knapen s intention was that water should condense on cool inner column in keeping with chaptal s finding that condensing surface must be rough and surface tension must be sufficiently low that condensed water can drip central column s outer surface was studded with projecting plates of slate slates were placed nearly vertically to encourage dripping down to a collecting basin at bottom of structure unfortunately aerial well never achieved anything like its hoped for performance and produced no more than a few litres of water each day international organisation for dew utilization thumb left alt big opur dew condenser in corsica big opur dew condenser in corsica thumb left a radiative dew condenser test site at village in north west india near arabian sea coast by end of twentieth century mechanics of how dew condenses were much better understood key insight was that low mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best a number of researchers worked on this method in early 1960s dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in israel to irrigate plants saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than control group planted without such aids they all dried up over summer in 1986 in new mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings in 1992 a party of french academics attended a condensed matter conference in ukraine where physicist daniel beysens introduced them to story of how ancient theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers they were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves they concluded that mounds that zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds a part of necropolis of ancient theodosia and that pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with construction of mounds they found remains of zibold s condenser which they tidied up and examined closely zibold s condenser had apparently performed reasonably well but in fact his exact results are not at all clear and it is possible that collector was intercepting fog which added significantly to yield if zibold s condenser worked at all this was probably due to fact that a few stones near surface of mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from ground however it could never have produced yield that zibold envisaged fired with enthusiasm party returned to france and set up international organisation for dew utilization opur with specific objective of making dew available as an alternative source of water opur began a study of dew condensation under laboratory conditions they developed a special hydrophobic film and experimented with trial installations including a collector in corsica vital insights included idea that mass of condensing surface should be as low as possible so that it cannot easily retain heat that it should be protected from unwanted thermal radiation by a layer of insulation and that it should be hydrophobic so as to shed condensed moisture readily by time they were ready for their first practical installation they heard that one of their members sharan had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in india in april 2001 sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on roof of a cottage at beach resort in arid coastal region of kutch where he was briefly staying following year he investigated phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people financed by gujarat energy development agency and world bank sharan and his team went on to develop passive radiative condensers for use in arid coastal region of kutch active commercialisation began in 2006 sharan tested a wide range of materials and got good results from galvanised iron and aluminium sheets but found that sheets of special plastic developed by opur just thick generally worked even better than metal sheets and were less expensive plastic film known as opur foil is hydrophilic and is made from polyethylene mixed with titanium dioxide and barium sulphate types there are three principal approaches to design of heat sinks that collect moisture in air wells high mass radiative and active early in twentieth century there was interest in high mass air wells but despite much experimentation including construction of massive structures this approach proved to be a failure from late twentieth century onwards there has been much investigation of low mass radiative collectors these have proved to be much more successful high mass high mass air well design attempts to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering structure due to breezes or natural convection in day warmth of sun results in increased atmospheric humidity when moist daytime air enters air well it condenses on presumably cool masonry none of high mass collectors performed well knapen s aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example problem with high mass collectors was that they could not get rid of sufficient heat during night despite design features intended to ensure that this would happen while some thinkers have believed that zibold might have been correct after all an article in journal of arid environments discusses why high mass condenser designs of this type cannot yield useful amounts of water although ancient air wells are mentioned in some sources there is scant evidence for them and persistent belief in their existence has character of a modern myth radiative thumb right diagram of a radiative collector a radiating condensing surface b collecting gutter c backing insulation d stand a radiative air well is designed to cool a substrate by radiating heat to night sky substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat and it is thermally isolated from any mass including ground a typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30deg from horizontal condensing surface is backed by a thick layer of insulating material such as polystyrene foam and supported above ground level such condensers may be conveniently installed on ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame although other heights do not typically work quite so well it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two story building thumb left alt condenser at in india consists of eleven ridges ridges are trapezoidal in section top 50 cm base 200 cm two sides sloping 30 degree from horizontal height 100 cm and each is 20 m long ridges are built over gently sloping ground all ridges drain into a common pipe at lower and leading to storage below ground water for use is withdrawn by a hand pump system was commissioned in early april 2007 total cost of installation was rs 117 000 a radiative condenser in northwest india a radiative condenser illustrated to left is built near ground in area of northwest india where it is installed dew occurs for 8 months a year and installation collects about of dew water over season with nearly 100 dew nights in a year it provides a total of about of potable water for school which owns and operates site thumb right structures with metal roofing such as this one can be used to harvest dew water simply by adding gutters and for increased output a layer of insulation underside without insulation output is nearly half of that from plastic condensers although flat designs have benefit of simplicity other designs such as inverted pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective this is probably because designs shield condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by lower atmosphere and being symmetrical they are not sensitive to wind direction new materials may make even better collectors one such material is inspired by namib desert beetle which survives only on moisture it extracts from atmosphere it has been found that its back is coated with microscopic projections peaks are hydrophilic and troughs are hydrophobic researchers at massachusetts institute of technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials active thumb upright 0 55 left a commercial atmospheric water generator intended for residential use thumb right an example of a condenser on roof installation condenser made of plastic film with special properties with insulation layer between film and concrete roof surface this installation is on school buildings at kutch india unlike metal roofs concrete roofs do not attract condensation without any treatment hence need for an external condenser output from such condensers is nearly two times higher than from a bare metal roof all else remaining constant active atmospheric water collectors have been in use since commercialisation of mechanical refrigeration essentially all that is required is to cool a heat exchanger below dew point and water will be produced such water production may take place as a by product possibly unwanted of dehumidification air conditioning system of burj khalifa in dubai for example produces an estimated of water each year that is used for irrigating tower s landscape plantings because mechanical refrigeration is energy intensive active collectors are typically restricted to places where there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical such circumstances are uncommon and even then large installations such as that tried in 1930s at cook in south australia failed because of cost of running installation it was cheaper to transport water over large distances in case of small installations convenience may outweigh cost there is a wide range of small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from atmosphere however there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than atmosphere for example in 1930s american designers added condenser systems to airships in this case air was that emitted by exhaust of engines and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for loss of weight as fuel was consumed by collecting ballast in this way airship s buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas which was both expensive and in limited supply more recently on international space station zvezda module includes a humidity control system water it collects is usually used to supply elektron system that water into hydrogen and oxygen but it can be used for drinking in an emergency there are a number of designs that minimise energy requirements of active condensers one method is to use ground as a heat sink by drawing air through underground pipes this is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground coupled heat exchanger also known as earth tubes wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem a major problem with such designs is that underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean designs of this type require air to be drawn through pipes by a fan but power required may be provided or supplemented by a wind turbine cold seawater is used in seawater greenhouse to both cool and interior of greenhouse like structure cooling can be so effective that not only do plants inside benefit from reduced transpiration but dew collects on outside of structure and can easily be collected by gutters another type of atmospheric water collector makes use of desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature this makes it possible to extract moisture even when relative humidity is as low as 14 percent systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water for regeneration desiccant needs to be heated in some designs regeneration energy is supplied by sun air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb water vapour during day premises are closed greenhouse effect increases temperature and as in solar desalination pools water vapour is partially condenses on a cold part and is collected nanotechnology is improving these types of collectors as well one such adsorption based device collected 0 25 l
