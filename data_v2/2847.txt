pluton was a fast minelaying cruiser built for french navy in late 1920s she was also able to carry 1 000 troops on her mine deck as a fast troop transport shortly after completion she was modified and became a gunnery training ship replacing elderly armored cruiser shortly before beginning of world war ii she reverted to her original role and most of gunnery training equipment was removed she was sent to casablanca in french morocco when war began to lay a minefield but order was cancelled a day later and she was ordered to disembark her naval mines she exploded while landing her still fuzed mines on 13 september 1939 design marine nationale decided to build a fast minelayer as part of its 1925 naval programme after british made her debut in early 1920s pluton was similar in many respects also being armed with four single destroyer caliber guns but was smaller and faster she could also be used as a fast transport for up to 1 000 troops sides of mine deck were normally open to weather but metal panels could be used to close it off when carrying troops guiglini moreau pp 153 155 general characteristics pluton was long overall she had a beam of and a draft of her longitudinally framed hull was subdivided by 15 transverse watertight bulkheads duralumin was extensively used in superstructure to save weight but this resulted in corrosion problems and strength issues she was fitted with a single counterbalanced rudder powered by an electric motor that was too weak for job her turning circle was with 25deg of rudder at larger than that of light cruiser which was longer she was totally unarmored and relied upon her watertight subdivision for survival jordan pp 21 22 propulsion pluton had a two shaft unit machinery layout with alternating boiler and engine rooms her breguet single reduction impulse geared steam turbines were designed for but made on trials four du temple boilers powered turbines at a pressure of jordan p 22 an auxiliary boiler was fitted to heat or cool ship s magazines and provide drinking water each propeller shaft drove a three bladed bronze propeller for a designed speed of but she achieved on trials guiglini moreau pp 155 158 of fuel oil was carried which was originally calculated to provide an endurance of at but it was revised downwards to once she entered service because demands of her auxiliary machinery had been seriously underestimated a pair of turbo generators provided electricity at 235 volts two diesel generators were mounted in aft engine room to provide power while in harbor and a third was installed in a special compartment on first deck for emergency use jordan pp 22 23 armament pluton was originally intended to carry two single turrets one each fore and aft with guns four anti aircraft aa guns and four light aa guns however four guns were substituted for 203 mm guns before construction began and six more 37 mm guns were added in lieu of 75 mm guns during construction although for 75 mm guns were retained for future use guiglini moreau p 153 four 138 mm 40 caliber guns were on mounts with gun shields two guns each were fore and aft in superfiring positions on centerline their elevation limits were 10deg to 35deg and they had a 270deg arc of fire their rate of fire was a nominal eight to nine rounds per minute but proved to be considerably less in service they had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of 150 rounds were provided for each gun one powder and one shell magazine served each pair of guns each of which had their own individual hoist jordan p 23 ten 37 mm 50 cal semi automatic aa guns were carried by pluton two were fitted on foredeck six amidships between funnels and two on a platform at stern 10 000 rounds were carried with 144 rounds in ready use boxes near each gun guns could depress 15deg and elevate to 80deg they fired shells at a muzzle velocity of their effective anti aircraft range was less than all of these guns except for pair on stern were removed shortly after pluton was commissioned in 1932 guiglini moreau pp 160 166 twelve obsolete hotchkiss machine guns were carried in six twin mounts two mounts were on top of bridge two atop after boiler room ventilator housing and two just forward of tripod mainmast 48 000 rounds were provided for them they were removed shortly after pluton was commissioned in 1932 pluton was designed to carry 220 sautter harle mines but had space for 30 extra for a total of 250 they were carried on first deck or mine deck using a system of four rails along sides of ship and moved via chain drives each pair of rails converged on a turntable at forward end of rails and a transverse spur connected two turntables spur facilitated loading mines from one side of ship and allowed mines to be moved to each of rails rails ended in four ramps at stern of ship that sloped down at a 30deg angle to minimize shock of impact when mines were released from chain drive up to 270 of smaller breguet b4 mines could be carried guiglini moreau pp 160 61 service she entered service with french mediterranean fleet in 1932 pluton experienced many teething problems particularly with machinery shortly after she was commissioned navy decided to give her an extra role as a gunnery training ship and she entered toulon dockyard for necessary modifications on 24 october 1932 quarters for 40 men were added on mine deck most of 37 mm aa guns and all of 8 mm machine guns were replaced by four 50 caliber 75 mm canon de 75 mm mle 22 or 24 aa guns and 12 hotchkiss machine guns on six twin mounts two mounts where 37 mm guns had been mounted on foredeck and four between funnels guiglini moreau pp 166 171 75 mm guns had a maximum depression of 10deg and a maximum elevation of 90deg they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 8 18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of hotchkiss guns had a cyclic rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute but practical rate was between 200 and 250 rounds per minute to allow for reloading its 30 round magazines they had a theoretical ceiling of a simple fire control director was added for 138 mm guns and 15 additional rangefinders were installed for use by rangefinding school guiglini moreau p 171 pluton spent much of 1933 1935 in dockyard hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 april 1933 she was refitted four times during this period to add more gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects these included reinforcement of her superstructure where it had been damaged by muzzle blast from her 138 mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones a high angle fire control director for her 75 mm guns was added two of her 75 mm gun were converted to powered remotely controlled mounts gun shields were added to 75 mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck thumb wreckage of pluton at casablanca in 1936 an experimental twin 13 2 mm gun mount with a gun shield was added between starboard 75 mm guns and more rangefinders were added to bring her total up to 31 her boilers and condensers were repaired in a refit between 25 november 1936 and 13 march 1937 later that year pluton had a major refit that involved repair of her turbines replacement of her 138 mm fire control director by one of type used by light cruisers and transfer of foredeck 13 2 mm machine guns to positions on forward her last refit from 15 november 1938 15 february 1939 two boilers enclosed aa director to protect it from weather improved remote control of 138 mm guns and added gun shields to each of twin 13 2 mm mounts guiglini moreau p 172 pluton was transferred to lorient on 10 may 1939 when french navy formed 5e escadre there which controlled all training ships and planned to convert her into a full time training ship as consort to training cruiser on 1 june 1940 jordan p 28 she would have been renamed la tour d auvergne at that time as name pluton was reserved for mine warfare ships in french navy as war approached it was decided to retain her as a minelayer and most of extra fire control equipment was removed she was transferred to brest as part of reorganization of 5e escadre she sailed for casablanca french morocco on 2 september with 125 breguet mines embarked she was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 september but this order was rescinded next day after mines had already been fuzed and ship was ordered to disembark mines while landing mines on 13 september one of them exploded destroying ship and killing 186 people a further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris one gun and some armor was salvaged during war but demolition work did not begin until october 1952 and was completed by july 1953 guiglini moreau p 232 notes bibliography category cruisers of french navy category ships
