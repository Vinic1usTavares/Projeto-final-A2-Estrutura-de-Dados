performed two sets that night and it is second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound bootleggers had collaborated to record stones shows across united states recording them on two track sony recorders for months prior to release of album at least one source claims that recordings initially came from rock promoter bill graham s staff who used tapes for broadcast on ksan and released their edit on lurch records in early 1970 recording was made available about one month after concert and it became popular enough to spur speculation that stones released ya ya s as a
