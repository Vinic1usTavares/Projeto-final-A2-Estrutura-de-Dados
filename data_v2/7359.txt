sully historic site more commonly known as sully plantation is both a virginia landmark and nationally registered historic place in chantilly virginia earliest recorded claim to land was made by doeg later lee family of virginia owned land from 1725 to 1839 richard bland lee did not build main house until 1794 following purchase by william swartwort in 1838 sully was used as a home a working farm or both by a series of private owners then in 1958 sully was acquired by federal government as a part of area to be used for construction of dulles airport today fairfax county park authority operates site with a specific focus on lee family history pre lee period land that would become part of sully was likely controlled by several groups before doeg claimed area english settlers encountered algonquian language speaking members of doeg in modern day northern virginia doeg are most well known for their raid in july 1675 that became a part of bacon s rebellion english colonists settling in modern northern virginia came into conflict with doeg from 1661 to 1664 when diplomatic attempts failed governor sent rappahannock county militia in june 1666 specifics of that military action are unclear but later land grants to english settlers are not disputed suggesting english gained control of area english presumptively took control after a violent conflict with doeg in 1666 little is recorded about disposition of this land from time when english gained control of it until land is patented by lee family of virginia lee period originally acquired in 1725 by richard bland lee s grandfather henry lee i sully was inherited by richard s father henry lee ii of at his death in 1787 land was divided between richard and his younger brother theodorick lee being older of two richard was given more alluvial northern half having resided there as manager of property since approximately 1781 during this period predominant crop grown was tobacco richard bland lee richard severely curtailed tobacco production in favor of more sustainable crops including wheat corn rye and barley this reduced soil depletion inherent to tobacco production and allowed for practice of crop rotation he also planted fruit orchards including peach and apple trees which he used to produce spirits in 1801 richard constructed a dairy which ran primarily under supervision of his wife elizabeth collins lee after his election to united states congress in 1789 and for most of next five years richard turned day to day management of his estate over to his brother theodorick who supervised spring planting and fall harvest theodorick also managed collection of rent from tenant farmers and construction of large house richard had planned for estate on which construction had begun in 1794 before he left for congress in 1789 richard had chosen name sully for his estate by 1811 having been drawn into heavy debt trying to aid his brothers henry lee iii and charles lee extricate themselves from severe financial difficulties richard bland lee decided he could no longer sustain ownership of sully accordingly he decided to sell plantation to raise cash to pay some of debt he sold sully for 18 000 to his second cousin francis lightfoot lee ii son of richard henry lee francis lightfoot lee ii for several years after his purchase of sully francis lightfoot lee ii called f l by his family was able to realize an annual profit of 1 500 to 2 500 at least part of that success was due to judicious system of husbandry employed by f l s wife jane fitzgerald lee then in 1816 due to complications during delivery of their fifth child frances ann lee jane fitzgerald lee died four years later in 1820 f l had either a nervous breakdown or stroke unable to care for himself he was committed to pennsylvania hospital in philadelphia in 1825 following breakdown sully was placed under administrative care of f l s nephew richard henry lee ii richard henry lee ii s management was marked by negligence and apparent apathy towards dishonesty of managers who were embezzling money from estate mismanagement having allowed an estate clear of debt well stocked well arranged under a good system as it had been for years according to universal belief and opinion of all friends connections and neighbors to be wasted and debts lost colonel w c b butler replaced richard henry lee as committee for estate on january 1 1827 but butler also proved unsatisfactory on june 23 1830 county court ordered his removal and for safekeeping and good management of estate control of sully was next placed in hands of colonel george washington hunter in 1830 gamble claims in no hands would sully fare as well as when it had been assiduously maintained by a single devoted industrious proprietor after their father s move to pennsylvania hospital during summer of 1825 f l s children with exception of samuel philips lee who had entered navy were under care of william brent jr and winifred brent brents were relatives who had moved to sully to care for lee children and to start at sully a select seminary for boys and girls during subsequent years as lee children grew older they began to leave sully samuel phillps lee had entered navy and john lee went to west point arthur lee moved west to ohio country while his oldest daughter jane elizabeth lee married henry tazewell harrison in a sunrise ceremony at sully on february 6 1834 with his brothers in law absent from estate harrison took over representing their interests with appointed administrator colonel hunter whom he replaced on july 18 1836 finally in 1838 after a bizarre period in which estate had ostensibly been sold to a buyer who was arrested in england prior to completing purchase sully was sold to merchant william swartwort post lee period starting in 1838 sully was used as a home working farm or both by swartwort then haight haight barlow shear shear miller poston thurston then nolting federal government acquired property in 1958 to construct dulles airport a campaign to save site began almost immediately afterwards those involved included previous owners of property lee descendants and a neighbor eddie wagstaff who later endowed sully foundation that still provides support for site this campaign ended in 1959 when president dwight d eisenhower signed legislation making sully a national historic site fairfax county
