to break apart questions his leadership abilities and also prays for guidance rick shane and rick s son carl chandler riggs go hunting for food and spot a deer nearby as carl goes up closer a gunshot rings out and carl finds he has been shot in stomach falling over to rick s shock production background an early concept for season premiere by frank darabont never materialized allegedly as a result of budget cuts this initial idea would have been an episode long flashback illustrating fall of atlanta and centering on mission of a doomed soldier who loses his team darabont was influenced by american war film black hawk down 2001 all they have to do is travel maybe a dozen blocks he said a simple journey but what starts as a no brainer scenario goes from city is being secured to holy shit we ve lost control world is ending episode would have introduced several characters including andrea dale and amy emma bell concluding scene would have tied into pilot episode days gone bye darabont says that episode shows a soldier dying hidden in a tank after which there is a shot for shot reprise from first episode of first season idea was to tell soldier s story because every zombie has a story samuel witwer who was cast as soldier in pilot for this backstory that would eventually unfold was frustrated by story s rejection and questioned need for such a budget cut ultimately premiere written and filmed would begin after events of season 1 although a brief flashback scene of shane and lori witnessing fall of atlanta from a distance would appear during season filming thumb left upright filming occurred in several locations throughout atlanta metropolitan area including cobb energy performing arts centre in smyrna georgia at paleyfest 2011 it was announced that second season of walking dead would mainly be produced outside city limits of atlanta georgia most of principal photography for what lies ahead took place in unincorporated henry county georgia on june 5 9 2011 using a stretch of georgia state route 20 that was closed to traffic for purpose on june 8 2011 first promotional image was released darabont described scene at this moment i m standing on a stretch of post apocalypse interstate in georgia littered with abandoned cars principal photography for episode resumed at cobb energy performing arts centre in smyrna georgia which was depicted as headquarters of cdc several neighboring roads were closed for 4 hours for it production then moved to a nearby office park where it commenced over a period of sixteen hours scene was later cut from season premiere prior to its broadcast in an interview with entertainment weekly series creator robert kirkman said that after editing there were certain things that just got left on cutting room floor editing what lies ahead is an extended premiere result of a decision to combine what were originally designed to be first two episodes of season this led to much of original first episode titled miles behind us to be discarded and is also reason that premiere contains dual credits for both writer and director miles behind us which was written by then showrunner frank darabont and directed by gwyneth horder payton an alumnus from first season began immediately where season 1 finale left off with group departing destroyed cdc soon after shane finds himself left behind when one of tires of his jeep is punctured frantically trying to catch up on foot he is nearly overrun by a multitude of walkers when he is rescued in nick of time by rest of group daryl having noticed shane s absence in convoy shane reveals to rick that despite their slow gait walkers do not seem to ever tire knowledge that informs rick s fateful decision to temporarily leave sophia group decides to look for refuge with guillermo s gang at atlanta nursing home last encountered in episode vatos but arrive to find location overrun with walkers and entire group dead after clearing out area to spend night group observes that people were not killed by walkers but execution style by human in what was likely intended to be foreshadowing of governor resolving that they will never again let their guard down group decides that they will try to reach fort benning alternative to cdc proposed by shane in prior season as in final version of episode a narration scene with rick speaking to morgan on walkie talkie was included but was re shot with modified dialog that served to replace above material allowing premiere to begin with group putting atlanta behind them rick sports his full sheriff s wardrobe in reshoot whereas in original version he is wearing white undershirt he was wearing in season 1 finale miles behind us was likely meant to end with rick returning to highway to break news to carol that sophia went missing while in final version group is informed by implication with a search in woods underway following a commercial break it is estimated that only about fifteen minutes of original first episode appears in final cut with balance of premiere consisting of second episode that was written by robert kirkman and directed by ernest dickerson many of deleted scenes from miles behind us appear as bonus material on season 2 dvd though it does not include events leading up to shane s rescue nor original rooftop walkie talkie monologue footage can also be seen in comic con trailer original title was seen on early marketing material for season before decision was made to cannibalize original premiere into what would become what lies ahead following in tradition established by pilot miles behind us was taken from title of first issue of second volume of graphic novel in season 2 dvd commentary robert kirkman and glen described decision to retool premiere in such a dramatic way as an amicable decision agreed upon between both producers and amc to make premiere more of an event as well as to push story forward however reports at time had suggested that situation was result of strife between frank darabont and amc who deemed footage from first episode unusable with some speculating that network was looking for a pretense to oust darabont due to its ongoing conflict with showrunner over budget cuts darabont was ultimately fired from show only a few episodes into production ardeth bey as he is credited as co writer on premiere is a pseudonym and horder payton has directed no further episodes of series not knowing at time that he would be referring to deleted scenes andrew lincoln told entertainment weekly i remember going on set for season premiere and seeing a couple of prop guys and they just looked at me as they gave me my gun and they went you know in this episode we kill more zombies than in whole of season 1 they actually counted kills and when it came time for taking of courtyard scene that was just carnage he added it really wasn t that well plotted we just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing so it was a bit touch and go from time to time lincoln andrew this was year that i killed a crazy number of zombies entertainment weekly december 28 2012 p 20 similarly neil brown jr actor who played guillermo gave an interview where he obliquely referred to possible participation in season 2 premiere this ultimately never made it to screen marketing thumb right episode was screened at nokia theatre in los
