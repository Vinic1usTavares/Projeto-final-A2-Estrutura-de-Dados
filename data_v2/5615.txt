bat out of hell iii monster is loose is ninth studio album by meat loaf and third and final album in bat out of hell trilogy it was released in ireland on october 20 2006 29 years after bat out of hell 1977 and 13 years after bat out of hell ii back into hell 1993 it was released in uk on october 23 2006 and in us on october 31 2006 produced by desmond child it is only bat album not involving jim steinman in its production album was subject to a legal dispute between meat loaf and steinman who had registered phrase bat out of hell as a trademark and attempted to prevent album using phrase in end seven songs that steinman wrote for various other projects were included as with its predecessors album received mixed reviews a tour named seize night tour followed release concentrating upon songs from bat albums history according to a reuters report meat loaf and steinman started working on an album in 2001 during concerts in his hair of dog tour meat loaf made a point to mention that he and steinman were putting out a new album composer suffered some health setbacks around 2004 meat loaf says that lawyers worked for over a year putting together a contract for steinman to do bat out of hell iii it was one of best producer s contracts in history of record business ultimately according to singer steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project and made what he calls selfish decision to go ahead without him in promotional interviews he said that he did not want to wait a year and a half just to find out that steinman was still unfit describing himself as a really loyal person meat loaf says that decision not to use steinman has taken its toll on me however in 2006 david sonenberg steinman s manager said jim s health is excellent that s not reason he didn t participate in bat iii he had some meaningful health problems about four years ago but he s been totally healthy last couple of years his health in no way impacted on his involvement in bat out of hell project development problems and confusion over steinman s involvement is a result of a dispute of trademark bat out of hell which steinman registered in 1995 meat loaf sued steinman and his manager in a complaint filed may 28 2006 in federal district court in los angeles california for 50 million and to prevent further use by writer producer meat loaf has stated that he contributed lyrics to bat out of hell he had used phrase extensively for tours to which steinman had never objected until a recent falling out steinman and his representatives approached meat loaf s labels universal and virgin asserting trademark ownership and threatening litigation to prevent album s release an agreement was reached in summer 2006 according to virgin two came to an amicable agreement that ensured that jim steinman s music would be a continuing part of bat out of hell legacy in promotional interviews meat loaf has played down dispute with steinman pointing out that it was over in three weeks and was purely for sake of business i consider him to be one of my best friends but real thing is about managers i think steinman s manager is devil and steinman feels same way about my manager so we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for recording of bat out of hell iii without a hitch so really i didn t sue jim steinman i sued his manager despite fact that steinman was not involved in recording or production album does include seven of his songs five of which are covers of previously released songs other two were covers of steinman s demos intended for musical theater projects at time unreleased agreement enabled steinman to work on a musical theatre project based on all of songs from bat out of hell describing project as cirque du soleil on acid in september 2007 he expected it to open in london in 2010 production meat loaf had announced that michael beinhorn was producing record but desmond child took helm singer reports that child would say things that made him think he was sitting next to steinman child began recording sessions by playing slipknot cds to get assembled musicians in mood in addition to musicians from his touring band neverland express several guest players contributed to album meat loaf says i didn t just want to bring in rock players i wanted to go to extreme rock people resulting in an album that has all touches of other two bats but it s much more of a rock album child says that one of most memorable experiences working on album was working with brian may who played on bad for good album also featured guest performances by john 5 steve vai and john shanks meat loaf says that he does not enjoy recording in studios he compares process to going to dentist and having root canal everyday whereas you really have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show in a studio every nuance is under a microscope and i m a perfectionist who knows that there s no such thing as perfection but i try to get as close as i can todd rundgren who produced first album and arranged all of background vocals for bat ii arranged background vocals for three tracks in a promotional interview for album rundgren has said continuity is an important thing however in another interview he said that his contribution was considerably less than on some earlier meat loaf albums and by time they got it all organized and figured out there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on so i came into l a for a couple of days and kasim came in as was routine and we did maybe three songs just so that i d have a few fingerprints on record i think someone maybe meat loaf said that to keep everything covered i had to be in there somewhere but not necessarily running whole thing so my involvement was pretty much peripheral album features three duets norwegian vocalist marion raven duets on it s all coming back to me now what about love features patti russo who has toured with meat loaf for over thirteen years finally jennifer hudson performs on future ain t what it used to be compositions album opens with title track monster is loose is highly influenced by gothic style of john 5 who plays main guitar parts song is very heavy and continues meat loaf s association with major league baseball established with phil rizzuto s commentary on paradise by dashboard light blind as a bat written by desmond child tells about how one is thankful for love another has given him even after he has done deeds to suggest that he does not deserve such love blind as a bat written by desmond child according to steinman it s all coming back to me now was inspired by wuthering heights and was an attempt to write most passionate romantic song he could ever create in interviews meat loaf has said that in his mind song was always meant to be a duet norwegian artist marion raven who had been working on her solo album with child was chosen because timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to meat loaf s bad for good was one of many songs written by steinman under inspiration of peter pan and lost boys who never grow up this is reflected in lyrics such as you know i m gonna be like this forever i m never gonna be what i should song was written to appear on follow up to bat out of hell but which steinman recorded himself because of this meat loaf was aware that there is a core of fans that know that song so he had that under microscope more than any other on album cry over me is according to meat loaf a timeless song dealing with relationships of all kinds in a 2007 interview he says that it can be about your first or last loves or dealing with your boss at work partially quoting lyrics singer posits that there are times when you want him to feel exactly like i felt when he said that to me guardian says in land of pig butcher is king is five olympian minutes crying out for a full production at glyndebourne guitarist steve vai describes it as very gothic almost terrifying it is about intense power over subordinates can t you hear choir now listen to animals sing can t you hear slaughterhouse bells in land of pigs butcher is king monstro is a bombastic orchestral piece layered with that lead into piano introduction to alive meat loaf decided to hire desmond child when he revealed that he had written alive especially for album song refers to how singer has overcome difficult periods in his life what about love a piano based duet with patti russo is a sexually charged song that echoes paradise by dashboard light from 1977 album here though singers are singing about love throughout not bitterness final verse contains most explicit lyrics about their first sexual encounter boy i can t forget feeling of your sweat upon my skin and tremble of your body on day you let me in girl on a s surrender with nothing to lose you were scared and so was i when i gave myself to you seize night has a strong orchestral foundation underneath lead vocals and a choir a duet with jennifer hudson future ain t what it used to be is a pessimistic song based upon myth that pandora closed her jar before allowing hope to escape song first appeared on only album performed by female group pandora s box lyrics reveal hopelessness of past were there ever any stars in sky and future there s nothing so sad as a tomorrow gone bad final song of bat trilogy is a short one written by steinman a few lyrics of cry to heaven begin rather sweet but turning rather bitter cry baby cry cry cry to heaven if that doesn t do it for you go ahead and cry like hell two parts are bridged by an instrumental dominated by an irish flute cover and booklet cover follows style of previous two albums called bat out of hell julie bell designed cover and artwork that appears alongside lyrics in booklet she also supplied art for it s all coming back to me now single cover features biker from first two covers about to slay giant bat from second cover while angel from same cover takes cover behind a destroyed pillar like first two bat albums steinman s songwriting is credited on cover this time shared with desmond child booklet contains all of lyrics to songs each page featuring a small illustration cd liner contains a dedication for thirty years of friendship and inspiration bat out of hell iii is dedicated to jim steinman reception album debuted at 8 on billboard 200 and sold about 81 000 copies in its opening week his best since bat out of hell ii back into hell however it slipped to 60 after three weeks album also reached 3 in uk charts but quickly fell off q gave album a positive review calling it second best album to bear bat name and saying that child did an impressive recreation of steinman s andrew lloyd webber on steroids approach while album was overblown frequently ridiculous and largely devoid of irony they were unimpressed with title track suggesting that whoever decided it would be a good idea for meat loaf to tackle nu metal should be tarred and feathered q did however praise operatic vocals and may s fabulously hysterical guitar on track bad for good q october 2006 village voice named it as album of year this week calling it absurdist righteous majesty some reviews lamented steinman s absence according to allmusic this bat is quite obviously a patchwork pieced together from things borrowed and recreated never quite gelling way either of previous bats did they criticized monster is loose as a disarming a grindingly metallic riff rocker that sits very uncomfortably next to steinman s it s all coming back to me now and child as a professional who is playing a game without bothering to learn rules on other hand review commended meat loaf s voice he sings his heart out as he valiantly tries to make this bat a worthy successor to originals singles and music videos alt head and shoulders photo of a short haired stock man with a frown on his face a woman is wailing
