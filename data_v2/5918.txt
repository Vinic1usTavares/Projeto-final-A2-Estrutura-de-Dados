sitatunga or tragelaphus spekii is a swamp dwelling antelope found throughout central africa centering on democratic republic of congo cameroon parts of southern sudan ghana botswana zambia gabon tanzania uganda and kenya sitatunga is confined to swampy and marshy habitats here they occur in tall and dense vegetation as well as seasonal swamps marshy clearings in forests riparian thickets and mangrove swamps thumb in chester zoo england taxonomy and genetics scientific name of sitatunga is tragelaphus spekii species was first described by english explorer john hanning speke in 1863 speke first observed sitatunga at a lake named little windermere now lake located in kagera tanzania in his book journal of discovery of source of nile speke called animal kiswahili name for animal or water boc due to its resemblance to waterbuck scientific name has often been misstated as t and either speke or sclater is referred to as binomial authority speke had stated in a footnote in his book that species had been named tragelaphus spekii by english zoologist philip sclater however according to international code of zoological nomenclature article 50 1 1 and international commission on zoological nomenclature that acknowledge person who first described species simply declaring sclater as authority in a footnote is insufficient to recognise him as author hence speke was recognised as correct authority and t spekii where spekii is genitive of latinised was considered correct name for species sitatunga is placed under genus tragelaphus and in family bovidae in 2005 sandi willows munro of university of kwazulu natal durban carried out a mitochondrial analysis of nine tragelaphus species mtdna and ndna data were compared results showed that sitatunga plus bongo t form a monophyletic clade with mountain nyala t and kewel t scriptus greater kudu t split from this clade approximately 8 6 million years ago within tragelaphus kewel bongo sitatunga and nyala t are particularly close relatives bushbuck that includes both t sylvaticus and kewel and sitatunga are genetically similar enough to hybridise hybrids between bongo and sitatunga have proved to be fertile sitatunga is more variable in its general characters than any other member of tribe that consists of genera taurotragus elands and tragelaphus probably because of their confinement to swampy and marshy habitats on basis of physical characteristics such as hair texture coat colour and coat stripes up to ten subspecies of sitatunga have been described however these factors may not be reliable since hair texture could vary with climate while pelage colour and markings vary greatly among individuals moreover coat might darken and stripes and spots on it might fade with age especially in males species might even be monotypic however based on different drainage systems three distinct subspecies are currently recognised t s spekii speke 1863 nile sitatunga or east african sitatunga

africa description sitatunga is a medium sized antelope it is sexually dimorphic with males considerably larger than females head and body length is typically between in males and in females males reach approximately at shoulder while females reach males typically weigh while females weigh tail is long saucer shaped ears are long only males possess horns these are spiral in shape have one or two twists and are long sitatunga is almost indistinguishable from nyala except in pelage and spoor speke pointed out that though closely allied to waterbuck sitatunga lacks stripes and is spotted instead coat colour varies geographically but in general is a rufous red in juveniles and chestnut in females there are white facial markings as well as several stripes and spots all over though they are only faintly visible white patches can be seen on throat near head and chest a pair of inguinal scent glands are present coats of males darken with age becoming gray to dark brown males develop a rough and mane usually brown in colour and a white dorsal stripe there is a chevron between eyes of males body and legs of this antelope are specially adapted to its swampy habitat hooves of male are elongated and widely splayed rubbery shaggy water repellent coat is minimally affected by slimy and muddy vegetation wedge like shape and lowering of head coupled with backward bend of horns in males provides for easy navigation through dense vegetation pasterns are flexible and hooves banana like in shape can reach a length of up to in hindlegs and in forelegs pointed toes allow it to walk slowly and almost through water moreover colour of coat provides an excellent camouflage hearing is acute and ears are so structured that animal can accurately determine direction from where a sound has originated this adaptation is of profound use in habitats where long sight is of very little value due to density and darkness of environment ecology and behaviour thumbnail sitatunga standing in water sitatunga are active mainly during early hours after dawn last one or two hours before dusk and at night and spend a large part of this time feeding basically sedentary they rest in flat areas and reed beds especially during hotter part of day they seldom leave their swamp habitat during daytime though sitatunga commonly form pairs or remain solitary larger groups have also been observed a study in kenya recorded a herd of as many as nine individuals comprising an adult male four females and four juveniles loose groups may be formed but interaction among individuals is very low individuals generally associate only with their own sex sitatunga is not territorial males may engage in locking horns with other males and attacking vegetation using their horns they may perform feinting by raising their forelegs with hindlegs rooted in ground as a threat display sitatunga interact with each other by first touching their noses which may be followed by licking each other and nibbling alarmed animals may stand motionless with head held high and one leg raised sitatunga may occasionally emit a series of coughs or barks usually at night which may cause other animals to join in and these sounds can be heard across swamp this barking may be used by females to warn off other females males often utter a low bellow on coming across a female or a herd of females in mating season a low pitched squeak may be uttered while feeding mothers communicate with their calves by bleats sitatunga can feed or rest close to southern lechwe herds but do not interact with them they often attract yellow billed oxpeckers african and great egrets sitatunga are good swimmers but limit themselves to water with profuse vegetation in order to escape crocodiles in some cases for instance when troubled by flies or pursued by predators sitatunga might fully submerge themselves in water except for nose and eyes which they keep slightly above water surface due to its close association with water sitatunga are often described as aquatic antelopes like waterbuck they often dry themselves under sun after feeding in water predators of sitatunga include lions wild dogs crocodiles and leopards diet sitatunga are selective and mixed feeders they feed mainly on new foliage fresh grasses sedges and browse preferred plants include typha sedges cyperus aquatic grasses echinochloa pennisetum acroceras and panicum species in and acanthaceae are preferred in saiwa swamp national park kenya and fabaceae species are preferred in bangweulu and busanga in kafue national park they feed mostly in wetland fringes diet preferences may vary seasonally in swamps where water levels change notably like gerenuk sitatunga may stand on its hindlegs to reach higher branches of trees or even use its horns to pull down branches a study recorded forty major species eaten by animal majority of which were herbs sweet potato was most preferred crop study predicted an increase in preference for crops due to seasonal food variations another study showed that annual floods affect seasonal movement and diet of species these floods force animals out of reed beds onto flooded grasslands when water levels are high at low water levels cattle take over flooded plains and send sitatunga back to their original place reproduction thumbnail left juvenile sitatunga in salzburg zoo austria females are sexually mature by one year of age while males take one and a half year before they mature breeding occurs throughout year when females gather males compete among each other for right to mate showing polygyny in males rutting male approaches female in a lower bending posture sniffing her vulva female may move slowly or react nervously even if female flees male continues pursuing her steadily without showing any sign of hurry a receptive female will raise her head with her mouth wide open following which male will begin attempts at mounting at time of mounting female lowers her head while male first bends and then straightens his forelegs and rests his head and neck on her back two remain together for one or two days during which time male ensures that no other male can approach female gestation lasts for nearly eight months after which generally a single calf is born parturition occurs throughout year though a peak may occur in dry season calves are hidden and brought out of cover only in presence of many other sitatunga mother gazes and nods at calf to summon it for nursing a calf follows its mother about even after she has given birth to another calf mother suckles and licks her calf for about six months calf takes time to master specialised gait of sitatunga and thus often loses its balance and falls in water males and even some females have been observed to leave their herds even before reaching sexual maturity due to intrasexual competition lifespan recorded in captivity averages 22 to 23 years habitat and distribution sitatunga is an amphibious antelope meaning it can live on both land and water confined to swampy and marshy habitats they occur in tall and dense vegetation of perennial as well as seasonal swamps marshy clearings in forests riparian thickets and mangrove swamps sitatunga move along clearly marked tracks in their swampy habitat often leading to reed beds these tracks up to wide can lead to feeding grounds and nearby riverine forests sitatunga hold small home ranges near water bodies in savannas they are typically found in stands of papyrus and reeds phragmites species and echinochloa pyramidalis they share their habitat with nile lechwe in swamps and with southern lechwe in angola botswana and zambia sitatunga is native to angola benin botswana burundi cameroon central african republic chad democratic republic of congo equatorial guinea gabon gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau kenya mozambique namibia nigeria rwanda senegal south sudan tanzania uganda zambia and zimbabwe it is extinct in niger where it formerly occurred in lake chad region and is feared to be extinct in togo where its habitat has been taken over by dense human settlements while it is localised and sporadic in western africa sitatunga is still common in forests of central africa and certain swampy regions in central eastern and southern africa threats and conservation habitat loss is most severe threat to survival of sitatunga other threats include increasing loss of wetlands that has isolated populations and long term changes in water level that affects nearby vegetation and thus bears upon their diet vast areas of bangweulu and busanga are burnt every year placing animals like sitatunga at grave risk given of swamps sitatunga has been classified under least concern category by international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn and under appendix iii ghana of washington convention cites in senegal intensive hunting for meat and habitat degradation have made sitatunga very rare formerly it was common throughout gambia but now it is confined to a few inaccessible swamps a population has been introduced in nature reserve on other hand though animal is hunted by locals primarily for food botswana still supports a large portion of total population species is of great economic significance for northern botswana that produces some of world s biggest sitatunga trophies its status is unclear in chad ghana guinea burundi and mozambique and zimbabwe significant populations still exist in countries such as cameroon central african republic democratic republic of congo equatorial guinea gabon tanzania and zambia inaccessibility of its habitat has rendered population estimates very difficult in 1999 rod east of iucn ssc antelope specialist group estimated a total population of 170 000 but this is likely to be an overestimate its numbers are decreasing in areas of heavy human settlement but are stable elsewhere around 40 percent of populations based on overestimate of 170 000 occurs in protected areas mainly in okavango delta and and chobe swamps botswana dja faunal reserve and national park cameroon central african republic national park lake tele
