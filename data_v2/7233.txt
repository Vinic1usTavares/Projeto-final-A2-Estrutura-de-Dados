thumb upright 2 principle of motion camouflage by mimicking optic flow of background an attacker flies towards a target choosing its path so that it remains on a line between target and a real point behind attacker this path differs from classical pursuit and is often shorter as illustrated here attacker looms larger as it closes on target but does not otherwise appear to move thumb animals such as frogs are very good at detecting motion making motion camouflage a priority for predators motion camouflage is camouflage which provides a degree of concealment for a moving object given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines principal form of motion camouflage and type generally meant by term involves an attacker s mimicking optic flow of background as seen by its target this enables attacker to approach target while appearing to remain stationary from target s perspective unlike in classical pursuit where attacker moves straight towards target at all times and often appears to target to move sideways attacker chooses its flight path so as to remain on line between target and some landmark point target therefore does not see attacker move from landmark point only visible evidence that attacker is moving is its looming change in size as attacker approaches motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies including swaying to mimic plant movements in wind or ocean currents first discovered in hoverflies in 1995 motion camouflage by minimising optic flow has been demonstrated in another insect order dragonflies as well as in two groups of vertebrates falcons and echolocating bats since bats hunting at night cannot be using strategy for camouflage it has been named describing its mechanism as constant absolute target direction this is an efficient homing strategy and it has been suggested that anti aircraft missiles could benefit from similar techniques camouflage is sometimes facilitated by motion as in leafy sea dragon and some stick insects these animals complement their passive camouflage by swaying like plants delaying their recognition by predators camouflage of approach motion many animals are highly sensitive to motion for example frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones therefore motion signals can be used to defeat camouflage moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than objects especially if other similar objects are nearby even though they are detected so motion does not completely break camouflage all same conspicuousness of motion raises question of whether and how motion itself could be camouflaged several mechanisms are possible thumb predators such as tigers stalk prey very slowly to minimise motion cues stealthy movements one strategy is to minimise actual motion as when predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving very slowly and stealthily this strategy effectively avoids need to camouflage motion minimising motion signal when movement is required one strategy is to minimise motion signal for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by prey from straight ahead cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes at right angles to their front back axis minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying pattern as they swim disrupting perception of motion disrupting attacker s perception of target s motion was main intended purpose of dazzle camouflage as used on ships in first world war though its effectiveness is disputed this type of dazzle does not appear to be used by animals mimicking optic flow of background thumb left australian emperor dragonfly mimics optic flow of its background using real point motion camouflage to enable it to approach rivals some animals mimic optic flow of background so that attacker does not appear to move when seen by target this is main focus of work on motion camouflage and is often treated as synonymous with it pursuit strategies an attacker can mimic background s optic flow by choosing its flight path so as to remain on line between target and either some real landmark point or a point at infinite distance giving different pursuit algorithms it therefore does not move from landmark point as seen by target though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches this is not same as moving straight towards target classical pursuit that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from background strategy works whether background is plain or textured this motion camouflage strategy was discovered and modelled as algorithms in 1995 by m v srinivasan and m davey while they were studying mating behaviour in hoverflies male hoverfly appeared to be using tracking technique to approach prospective mates motion camouflage has been observed in high speed territorial battles between dragonflies where males of australian emperor dragonfly papuensis were seen to choose their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals in 6 of 15 encounters they made use of both real point and infinity point strategies thumb upright falcons use infinite point motion camouflage to close on their prey strategy appears to work equally well in insects and in vertebrates simulations show that motion camouflage results in a more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit i e motion camouflage path is shorter whether target flies in a straight line or chooses a chaotic path further where classical pursuit requires attacker to fly faster than target motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture target despite flying more slowly than it in sailing it has long been known that if bearing from target to pursuer remains constant known as constant bearing decreasing range cbdr equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance two vessels are on a collision course both travelling in straight lines in a simulation this is readily observed as lines between two remain parallel at all times thumb upright 1 5 insect hunting bats and some missiles follow an infinity point pursuit path keeping parallel to target parallel navigation for its efficiency rather than for camouflage echolocating bats follow an infinity point path when hunting insects in dark this is not for camouflage but for efficiency of resulting path so strategy is generally called constant absolute target direction catd it is equivalent to cbdr but allowing for target to manoeuvre erratically a 2014 study of falcons of different species saker falcon and peregrine falcon used video cameras mounted on their heads or backs to track their approaches to prey comparison of observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with catd missile guidance strategy of pure proportional navigation guidance closely resembles catd strategy used by bats biologists andrew anderson and peter have suggested that anti aircraft missiles could exploit motion camouflage to reduce their chances of being detected they tested their ideas on people playing a computerised war game steering laws to achieve motion camouflage have been analysed mathematically resulting paths turn out to be extremely efficient often better than classical pursuit motion camouflage pursuit may therefore be adopted both by predators and missile engineers as parallel navigation for an infinity point algorithm for its performance advantages attack strategies strategy description camouflage effect used by species classical pursuit move straight towards current position of target at all times simplest strategy none target sees pursuer moving against background honey bees flies tiger beetles real point motion camouflage move towards target keeping between it and a point near pursuer s start at all times pursuer remains stationary against background but looms larger dragonflies hoverflies infinity point motion camouflage parallel navigation move towards target keeping line to target parallel to line between pursuer s start and target at start pursuer remains at a constant direction in sky dogs humans hoverflies teleost fish bats falcons camouflage by motion thumb cryptic stick insect extatosoma tiaratum sways in wind like foliage swaying motion crypsis or masquerade swaying behaviour is practised by highly cryptic animals such as leafy sea dragon and stick insect extatosoma tiaratum these animals resemble vegetation with their coloration strikingly disruptive body outlines with appendages and ability to sway effectively like plants that they mimic e tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in wind this behaviour may represent motion crypsis preventing detection by predators or motion masquerade promoting misclassification as something other than prey or a combination of two and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage references external links category behavior category camouflage
