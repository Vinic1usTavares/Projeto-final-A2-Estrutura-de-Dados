title her name is nicole however release of four singles including whatever u like featuring t i and baby love featuring will i am all failed to significantly impact on us charts baby love was moderately successful reaching top twenty in europe after a number of entire project was scrapped at request of scherzinger in may 2010 rap up reported that scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an empowering ballad called nobody can change me song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of u s reality competition dancing with stars and was mastered on may 23 2010 ready for its premiere on ryan seacrest s kiis fm radio show following day idolator was unimpressed with treacly pop tune saying that lack of sexiness uninspiring message and squeaky vocals did scherzinger no favors however amos barshad of new york magazine actually liked song stating that there s none of pussycat doll s forced sexiness here instead it sounds like something that could have just missed final cut on a kelly clarkson album that is sort of supposed to be a compliment yeah ref cite magazine url http nymag com daily entertainment 2010 05 can

one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers like fast food one from mcdonald s one from burger king and so on it tasted good but it wasn t consistent her new record people are really going to go crazy about it because it s real her scherzinger s boyfriend lewis hamilton selected poison as album s first single it debuted on her official youtube account on october 14 2010 composition poison is an uptempo dance pop song produced by redone beatgeek and jimmy joker it was written by scherzinger bilal hajji kinda hamid novel jannusi jannusi redone in musical key of a minor with a guitar driven melody poison uses a pulsating and toxic beat throughout which is similar to that used in britney spears song toxic lyrics were also compared to toxic and said to have similar themes according to bbc music blogger fraser mcalpine a reviewer from rap up spoke of song s overall theme lead pussycat doll has thoughts of using a deadly elixir on dance floor singing through a fuzzy filter over bombastic synthesizers they described song as a toxic pop gem according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by sony atv music publishing song has a time signature set in common time with a tempo of 124 beats per minute melody is mainly composed with piano and guitar instruments critical reception bridget daley of hollyscoop was impressed with song saying it s super beat and now we understand what redone meant when he told hollyscoop how much we were going to love nicole s new sound however becky bain of idolator thought pulsating dance song was underwhelming we have to admit we re not bowled over by this one which pretty much follows a standard predictable dance pop formula from double shout out at start to ing fade out finish however bain also pointed out that current trends on us billboard hot 100 were unpredictable then again since when has hot 100 away from generic pop tunes we ve heard over and over again this one could go either way folks fraser mcalpine of bbc music stated that he thought song was not as good as toxic by britney spears but was incredibly similar after dubbing it a weaker version of toxic he said and that just leaves us here with a song poison which is all stomp and huff a dramatic bang of a thing which seeks to drag all bad girls to dancefloor so they can holler their evil intentions to into faces of nervous men it s a song which makes most of nicole s unwholesome sexiness as opposed to wholesome you understand i m not saying there s anything gross about her and has drama and fury on its side nick levine of digital spy agreed saying that scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an ahem debut single he described song s busy production as having a whiff of that is a racket in best possible way levine also praised scherzinger for her conviction on song awarding it five out of five stars he gave poison a better reception than he awarded scherzinger s previous attempt baby love 2007 which he only awarded three out of five stars stating that it was wrong single to launch career of a world class superstar chart performance following scherzinger s performance on series seven of x factor official charts company
