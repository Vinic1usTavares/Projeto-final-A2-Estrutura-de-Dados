underground station of same name and is adjacent to waterloo east station on south eastern main line station is terminus of south western main line to via southampton west of england main line to exeter via portsmouth direct line to and isle of wight and several commuter services around west and south west london surrey hampshire and berkshire many services stop at and station was first opened in 1848 by london and south western railway and replaced earlier as it was closer to west end it was never designed to be a terminus as original intention was to continue line towards city of london and consequently station developed in a haphazard fashion leading to difficulty finding correct platform station was rebuilt in early 20th century opening in 1922 and included victory arch over main entrance which commemorated world war i waterloo was last london terminus to provide steam powered services which ended in 1967 station was london terminus for eurostar international trains from 1994 until 2007 when they were transferred to st pancras international waterloo is busiest railway station in uk with nearly a hundred million entries exits from station every year it is also country s largest station in terms of floor space and has greatest number of platforms location station s formal name is london waterloo and appears as such on all official documentation it has station code wat it is in london borough of lambeth on south bank of river thames close to waterloo bridge and northeast of westminster bridge main entrance is to south of junction of waterloo road and york road it is named after eponymous bridge which itself was named after battle of waterloo a battle that occurred exactly two years prior to opening ceremony for bridge several london bus routes including 1 26 59 68 139 172 176 188 507 and 521 all stop at waterloo some buses call at stops by side of station on waterloo road others at tenison way a short distance from victory arch history background thumb left original waterloo station in 1848 waterloo was built by london and south western railway l swr it was not designed to be a terminus but simply a stop on an extension towards city it replaced earlier which had opened on 21 may 1838 and connected london to southampton since 11 may 1840 by mid 1840s commuter services to wandsworth kingston upon thames and had become an important part of l swr traffic so company began to look for a terminus closer to central london and west end an act of parliament was granted in 1845 to extend line towards a site on york road close to waterloo bridge extension past nine elms involved demolishing 700 houses and most of it was carried on a brick viaduct to minimise disruption longest bridge was long and took line over westminster bridge road approach to new station carried four tracks with expectation that other companies would use it station was designed by william tite and opened on 11 july 1848 as waterloo bridge station nine elms closed for regular services at same time but queen victoria was fond of privacy afforded by old station so it was kept open for her and a replacement private station built on wandsworth road in 1854 waterloo bridge was originally laid out as a through station as it was expected that services would eventually continue towards city of london l swr purchased several properties along route before plans were cancelled owing to financial crisis following panic of 1847 in october 1882 waterloo bridge station was officially renamed waterloo reflecting long standing common usage even in some l swr timetables expansion thumb left upright plan of waterloo station in 1888 l swr s aim throughout much of 19th century was to extend its main line eastward beyond waterloo into city of london given this it was reluctant to construct a dedicated grand terminus at waterloo consequently waterloo had none of usual facilities expected of a terminus until 1853 when a small block was built on far east side of station in 1854 london necropolis national mausoleum company opened a private station inside waterloo that provided services to brookwood cemetery station was demolished and replaced with a dedicated building in 1902 as part of reconstruction of waterloo in early 20th century traffic and passengers to waterloo increased throughout century and waterloo was extended in an ad hoc manner to accommodate this in 1860 new platforms were added on northwest side of station these were known as windsor station after its intended destination an additional dock siding of main station opened on 17 march 1869 a link to south eastern railway ser line from to opened in july 1865 it was diverted from london bridge to on 1 february 1867 before being withdrawn following year ser opened waterloo junction station on 1 january 1869 as a replacement that allowed lswr passengers to change and access services to cannon street a further extension on southeastern side of waterloo to provide more services opened on 16 december 1878 a further extension to north beyond windsor station opened in november 1885 for each extension long term plan was that expansion was temporary until line was extended past waterloo and therefore these additions were simply added alongside and around existing structure rather than as part of an overall architectural plan this resulted in station becoming increasingly ramshackle platform numbering had grown in an ad hoc manner resulting in confusing situation of no 1 being in middle of station complex where it had been since 1848 original station became known as central station as other platforms were added new platform sets were known by nicknames two platforms added for suburban services in 1878 were cyprus station and six built in 1885 for use by trains on windsor line became khartoum each of these stations within a station had its own booking office taxi stand and public entrances from street as well as often poorly marked and confusing access to rest of station by 1899 waterloo had 16 platforms but only 10 numbers allocated in different sections of station or on different levels some numbers were duplicated this complexity and confusion became butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics for many years in late 19th century including jerome k jerome in three men in a boat it was criticised and satirised in several punch cartoons rebuilding thumb victory arch station s main entrance was constructed by james robb scott and commemorates britain s involvement in world war i l swr spent 1880s and 90s trying to finalise plans to continue line beyond waterloo and city an overhead line was proposed in 1882 and again in 1891 but both times was rejected due to cost in 1893 an act was passed for a tube railway on 8 august 1898 company opened waterloo city line a deep level underground railway that ran directly between waterloo and bank monument station in city this gave company direct commuter service it had long desired albeit with need to change from surface to underground lines at waterloo with waterloo now destined to remain a terminus station and with old station becoming a source of increasingly bad will and publicity amongst travelling public l swr decided on total rebuilding in a project they called great transformation legal powers to carry out work were granted in 1899 and 1900 about of land was purchased to accommodate new building which included six streets and part of two others along with all saints church l swr built six blocks of flats to rehouse around 1 750 people as compensation for those displaced extensive groundwork and slum clearance were carried out before construction on terminus proper began including several rundown buildings that had been extensively used for prostitution by 1903 land had been cleared for work to start thumb left early 20th century reconstruction of waterloo included a stained glass window with london and south western railway s crest new station was opened in stages it was partially ready in 1909 with main booking hall opening on 11 june 1911 a vehicular roadway to station opened on 18 december 1911 connection to waterloo junction was removed in march that year but a siding remained until 3 may 1925 bridge remained in place and was used as a walkway between two stations construction of main station continued sporadically throughout world war i and new station finally opened in 1922 with 21 platforms and a long concourse roof and platforms were initially designed by j w jacomb hood who travelled to us to look at station designs for inspiration following jacomb hood s death in 1914 work was taken over by alfred weeks szlumper it was built in an imperial baroque style out of portland stone james robb scott designed office range new station included a large stained glass window depicting l swr s company crest over main road entrance surrounded by a frieze listing counties served by railway latter still survives today these features were retained in design despite fact that by time station opened 1921 railway act had been passed which spelt end of l swr as an independent concern waterloo was a major terminal station for soldiers in world war i and for sailors travelling to southampton for british expeditionary force it also handled ambulance trains and mail from overseas a free buffet operated at station between december 1915 and april 1920 station itself saw little damage except for an explosion on one of lines on 29 september 1917 rebuilt station was formally opened on 21 march 1922 by queen mary main pedestrian entrance victory arch known as exit 5 was designed by scott and is a memorial to company staff who were killed during war upon opening it marked 585 employees who had been killed in world war i it was flanked by two sculptures featuring roman goddesses 1914 with bellona in armour with a sword and torch and 1918 showing pax goddess of peace sitting on earth southern railway lswr began to look at electrification of suburban services during 1910s using a 600 volt dc third rail mechanism first such service to wimbledon via east putney opened on 25 october 1915 with services to shepperton following on 30 january 1916 hounslow loop line on 12 march and on 18 june ownership of waterloo underwent a succession broadly typical of many british stations under 1923 grouping it passed to southern railway sr sr continued third rail electrification of lines from waterloo including a full service to guildford on 12 july 1925 and to windsor on 6 july 1930 a public address system first ran in waterloo on 9 march 1932 and by following decade was regularly broadcasting music around station in 1934 sr planned to invest ps500 000 ps million as of to improve signalling and track layout to allow better use of all platforms a full electric service to woking guildford and for isle of wight opened on 4 july 1937 as did connecting services to and on 1 january an electric service opened between waterloo and reading with a branch to and aldershot which was designed equally for anticipated increase in military traffic in area as well as commuters waterloo was bombed several times during world war ii on 7 september 1940 john street viaduct immediately outside station was destroyed by a bomb which prevented any services running for 12 days full services did not resume until 1 october which particularly affected mail traffic with over 5 000 unsorted bags piling up on station platform waterloo was closed again after bombing on 29 december 1940 it re opened on 5 january 1941 on same day that station offices on york road were destroyed by bombing station took heavy damage again after an overnight raid on 10 11 may 1941 with fires lasting for four days one bomb was not discovered until it was uncovered during building work along york road in 1959 british rail and privatisation following nationalisation in 1948 ownership of station transferred to british railways br as part of southern region under br more of network was electrified and boat train traffic declined in favour of air travel waterloo was last london terminus to run steam hauled trains final journey took place on 9 july 1967 and featured a large group of rail enthusiasts with cameras and recording equipment attempting to capture departure of final steam service to electrified service began next day station was managed by network southeast also under br following privatisation of british rail ownership and management passed to railtrack in april 1994 and finally in 2002 to network rail eurostar thumb farewell message from eurostar to erstwhile international station viewed from western side of main concourse december 2007 in 1994 platforms 20 and 21 were lost to waterloo international railway station site which was london terminus of eurostar international trains to gare du nord paris and an inaugural service left waterloo on 6 may for a joint opening ceremony with queen elizabeth ii and french president francois mitterrand regular services began on 14 november construction necessitated removal of decorative masonry forming two arches from that side of station

accidents at waterloo compared to other london terminal stations on 21 august 1896 an engine leaving locomotive yard overran its clearance point colliding with a departing passenger train five passengers were injured on 5 may 1904 a linesman accidentally stepped on a signal wire this gave a false clear signal to a goods van which collided with a passenger train killing one while on 25 october 1913 a collision between two passenger trains at waterloo junction killed three people on 13 april 1948 goods hoist to waterloo and city line began to sink while a m7 class tank engine was

used for spares on 3 june 1960 an empty stock train formed of two electric multiple units overran signals and was in a sidelong collision with a steam hauled passenger train that was departing for dorset a few people suffered slight injuries on 11 april following year an electric multiple unit overran signals and was in a head on collision with a steam locomotive one person was killed and fifteen were injured on 10 march 2000 a passenger train collided with an empty stock train in platform 5 due to driver error thirty five people were injured on 15 august 2017 a class 456 electric multiple unit collided with an engineers train at station passenger train was derailed causing disruption for remainder of day three people were checked for injuries but nobody was hospitalised cause was both a change to interlocking that failed to be accounted for in test regime and that a temporary connection for testing had not been removed probably added to overcome change to interlocking it was entirely undocumented and unapproved which meant that a set of points not correctly set was not detected this allowed a proceed signal to be shown when it should not have been possible to do so problem would have been indicated to signaller when a previous train ran through points and moved them had temporary connection been removed temporary connection prevented this detection by providing a false feed to detection relay rail accident investigation branch raib investigation into accident concluded that mistakes were made similar to those which caused clapham junction rail crash in 1988 raib expressed concerns that lessons learnt from that accident were being forgotten over time station facilities thumb waterloo station clock major transport interchange at waterloo comprises london

which would provide trains from waterloo to heathrow via same proposed spur from staines to heathrow but by diverting or splitting current services frequency of trains over existing level crossings would not increase baa s earlier plan had controversially proposed more trains over level crossings leading to concerns that they would be closed to motorists and pedestrians for too long crossrail 3
