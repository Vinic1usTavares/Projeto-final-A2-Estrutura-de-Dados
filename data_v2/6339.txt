typhoon ike was second deadliest tropical cyclone in 20th century in philippines where it was known as typhoon nitang ike originated from an area of disturbed weather southeast of guam on august 21 and five days later developed into a tropical depression following an increase in organization depression attained tropical storm intensity on august 27 initially tracking west southwest storm gradually gained strength as wind shear resulted relaxed and ike became a typhoon on august 30 continuing to rapidly intensity ike turned west and attained peak intensity on september 1 with japan meteorological agency estimating winds of at around 14 00 utc that day ike made landfall on northeastern tip of mindanao cyclone emerged into south china sea on september 3 as a tropical storm before re intensifying into a typhoon and moving onshore hainan ike then struck chinese mainland as a tropical storm in guangxi province and dissipated on september 6 during its formative stages ike brushed guam although its compact size reduced extent of damage typhoon ike also struck philippines a mere four days after tropical storm june inundated northern portion of philippines and also was suffering from nation s worst economic crisis since independence in 1946 it also left a path of destruction in philippines that at time was unparalleled in its modern history most of deaths were in province of

were lost elsewhere two people were killed and seven were listed missing in thailand due to flash flooding meteorological history origins of typhoon ike can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather first identified as part of region s monsoon trough southeast of guam on august 21 over next few days disturbance failed to develop as a result of inhibiting wind shear which remained over area however shear quickly abated on august 25 allowing for convection to build and persist over system s center of circulation this prompted japan meteorological agency jma to classify system at 06 00 utc on august 26 as a tropical depression later that day joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for system following a rapid increase in system s organization tracking generally northward it continued to improve in organization and became more compact allowing both jma and jtwc to upgrade system to tropical storm ike on august 27 ike s track northward brought it southwest of guam before tropical storm stalled and turned towards west southwest on august 28 as a result of a subtropical ridge to its north initially persistent wind shear limited intensification but data from jtwc suggested that ike briefly attained typhoon status on august 29 by august 30 an upper level anticyclone became established over system resulting in favorable conditions aloft and ike entered a second intensification phase at midday both jtwc and jma estimated that ike attained typhoon status on august 31 philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa also monitored storm and assigned it with local name nitang now assuming a more westerly bearing ike continued to rapidly strengthen at 12 00 utc on september 1 typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of 950 mbar hpa 28 05 inhg as analyzed by jma meanwhile jtwc estimated maximum intensity of with maximum intensity ike made landfall on northeastern tip of mindanao at around 14 00 utc on september 1 taking 30 hours to track across southern extent of philippines cyclone emerged into south china sea on september 3 but due to land interaction both jtwc and jma reported that ike had weakened to a tropical storm upon its emergence storm tracked northwestward across south china sea over next few days ike regained its former typhoon classification on september 3 according to jtwc and on september 4 according to jma several hours later data from a hurricane hunter aircraft indicated that ike had developed a wide eye jma estimated that it reached a secondary peak intensity on september 4 with winds of and a pressure of 955 mbar hpa 28 20 inhg only slightly weaker than its peak strength while jtwc estimated a secondary peak of combination of increased wind shear induced by a trough passing to storm s north and typhoon s proximity to land caused ike to weaken storm made a september 5 landfall on hainan as a minimal typhoon storm continued to weaken after crossing hainan with both jtwc and jma estimating that it moved into chinese mainland as a tropical storm while it was located southeast of nanning thereafter ike quickly weakened inland and dissipated on september 6 preparations prior to typhoon s first landfall a typhoon warning was issued by manila weather bureau for philippine provinces of surigao del norte agusan leyte samar camiguin bohol cebu misamis oriental and negros local authorities warned at risk residents via radio to flee to higher ground due to threat of destructive storm surge although
