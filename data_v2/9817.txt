2000 atlantic hurricane season was a fairly active hurricane season but featured latest first named storm in a hurricane season since 1992 hurricane season officially began on june 1 and ended on november 30 it was slightly above average due to a la nina weather pattern although most of storms were weak first cyclone tropical depression one developed in southern gulf of mexico on june 7 and dissipated after an uneventful duration however it would be almost two months before first named storm alberto formed near cape verde alberto also dissipated with no effects on land several other tropical cyclones tropical depression two tropical depression four chris ernesto nadine and an unnamed subtropical storm did not impact land five additional storms tropical depression nine florence isaac joyce and leslie minimally affected land areas most significant storm of season was hurricane keith which caused extensive damage in central america after remaining nearly stationary offshore keith moved inland over yucatan peninsula and later made a second landfall in mexico at hurricane intensity it caused 319 million 2000 usd in damage and 40 fatalities mostly in belize precursor to tropical storm leslie brought severe flooding to south florida which losses reaching 950 million 2000 usd hurricane gordon and tropical storm helene both caused moderate damage in southeastern united states mainly in florida tropical storm beryl caused minor damage in mexico and hurricane debby resulted in less than 1 million 2000 usd in damage in greater and lesser antilles hurricane michael brought widespread effects to atlantic canada though a specific damage toll is unknown seasonal forecasts pre season outlooks predictions of tropical activity in 2000 1950 2000 9 65 92 7 7 4 10 forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert dr william m gray and his associates at colorado state university csu and separately by forecasters with u s government s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa according to csu average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9 6 tropical storms 5 9 hurricanes and 2 3 major hurricanes storms exceeding category 3 on saffir simpson hurricane scale a normal season as defined by noaa has 9 to 12 named storms of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes noted hurricane expert dr william m gray on april 7 predicted eleven named storms with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of eight reaching category 3 strength prediction issued on june 7 was similar increasing named storms to twelve eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes on may 10 noaa issued a season outlook which gave indication of an above average season according to noaa global scale atmospheric circulation pattern which was taking place was conducive to an above average hurricane season however la nina was present it eastern pacific which was a factor in activity in season noaa issued a 75 chance of above average activity mid season outlooks after season started on june 1 csu issued a mid season forecast on august 4 which predicted 11 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes six days after csu prediction noaa also released a mid season outlook forecasting exactly same amount of activity 11 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes with a 75 chance of above average activity there was an elevated risk of landfalling hurricanes seasonal summary thumb right hurricanes isaac and joyce on september 27 2000 atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2000 it was an above average season in which 19 tropical cyclones formed fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status and eight of these attained hurricane status three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes season was above average most likely because of an ongoing la nina in pacific ocean three hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during season and caused 77 deaths and 1 2 billion in damage 2000 usd hurricane florence and isaac and tropical storm leslie also caused damage and fatalities though none of three made landfall last storm of season an unnamed subtropical storm dissipated on october 29 over a month before official end of hurricane season on november 30 tropical cyclogenesis first occurred in month of june with two tropical depressions developing in atlantic however no tropical cyclones developed in month of july first phenomenon since 1993 in august five tropical cyclones developed most notably hurricane alberto september was more active with seven named storms forming that month featured hurricane keith strongest system of 2000 atlantic hurricane season with seven named storms forming in september this made it most active september on record at time this record was surpassed two years later when eight storms formed in september in addition a quick succession of eight storms occurred in september and lasted into early october six tropical cyclones existed in october and one additional subtropical storm developed in last week of month following an active october no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in november which is final month of season season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 119 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones including unnamed storm as well as initial stages of florence leslie and michael are excluded from total systems tropical depression one a tropical wave exited west coast of africa on may 23 and tracked westward across atlantic ocean and caribbean sea system had entered into gulf of mexico on june 6 another tropical wave merged with system on june 7 and developed into a low pressure area in gulf of mexico later that day national hurricane center began classifying system as tropical depression one though depression was predicted to intensify into a tropical storm strong wind shear produced by an upper anticyclone prevented significant strengthening depression tracked slowly and erratically through gulf of mexico by late on june 8 a reconnaissance plane flight indicated that depression had degenerated into a low pressure area remnants of depression produced gusty winds and light to moderate rainfall along gulf coast of mexico some areas in state of tamaulipas reported precipitation amounts as high as in addition heavy precipitation was reported in south central texas tropical depression two a tropical wave emerged off coast of africa and quickly developed into tropical depression two on june 23 although it was well organized national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on depression until 1500 utc on june 24 since it operationally appeared that a surface circulation did not exist until then however depression was less organized after national hurricane center began advisories having formed at 19 8degw it was one of easternmost developing tropical cyclones in month of june even further east than tropical storm ana in 1979 and tropical depression two in 2003 though light wind shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures were in path of depression no significant intensification occurred as it tracked generally westward depression began encountering a stable air mass and degenerated back into a tropical wave on june 25 hurricane alberto a well developed tropical wave was observed in satellite imagery over central africa on july 30 system tracked westward and emerged into atlantic ocean on august 3 thereafter system rapidly organized and developed into tropical depression three at 1800 utc that day depression moved west northwestward and strengthened into tropical storm alberto early on august 4 while briefly turning westward on august 6 alberto reached hurricane status it tracked west northwestward and by early following day storm reached an initial peak with winds of 90 mph 150 km h shortly thereafter alberto re curved northwestward wind shear then increased which caused alberto to weaken to a tropical storm on august 9 however it quickly re strengthened and early on august 10 alberto was upgraded to a hurricane again due to a break in a subtropical ridge alberto gradually curved northward and north northeastward between august 11 and 12 while turning northeastward alberto strengthened into a category 3 hurricane becoming first major hurricane of season by 1200 utc on august 12 alberto attained its peak intensity with winds of increasing upper level westerlies caused alberto to weaken as it moved east northeastward with cyclone losing most of its convection early on august 14 alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm a westerly trough that had been guiding alberto outran storm and strong ridging developed to north and west as a result alberto turned southward on august 15 southwestward on august 16 and then to west on august 17 while curving northwestward and then northward alberto began to re strengthen and was upgraded to a hurricane for third occasion on august 18 alberto reached a third peak intensity as a category 2 hurricane with winds of on august 20 after weakening back to a category 1 hurricane alberto had completed a cyclonic loop which it had started on august 13 due to decreasing ocean temperatures alberto was again downgraded to a tropical storm on august 23 as it accelerated northeastward six hours later alberto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while centered about south southwest of reykjavik iceland tropical depression four an area of low pressure detached from a frontal zone on august 4 and moved southwestward after developing a minimal amount of deep convection an air force reserve command reconnaissance aircraft found a well defined low level circulation on august 8 depression then moved westward without intensifying for two days on august 10 depression was about east of cape canaveral florida when it abruptly turned northeastward in advance of a deep layer trough over eastern united states after minimal strengthening depression dissipated to north of bahamas on august 11 while a tropical cyclone a reconnaissance flight reported winds of at however it was not upgraded to a tropical storm since aforementioned wind speed did not represent intensity of depression tropical storm beryl a tropical wave emerged from coast of africa with a closed circulation on august 3 system split with northern portion developing into hurricane alberto while southern portion of wave continued westward minimal deep convection persisted until wave reached yucatan peninsula on august 12 after emerging into gulf of mexico on following day satellite imagery and a reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that system developed into tropical depression five at 1800 utc early on august 13 depression intensified into tropical storm beryl despite predictions for beryl to reach hurricane status it remained disorganized and peaked as a tropical storm by 0700 utc on august 15 beryl made landfall about north of la pesca in mexican state of tamaulipas with winds of beryl quickly weakened inland and was downgraded to a tropical depression five hours after moving inland shortly thereafter beryl dissipated while centered near monterrey in mexico beryl dropped light to moderate rainfall especially in tamaulipas which peaked at one person drowned due to flood waters in northeastern mexico damage was light totaling to 27 000 2000 usd in southern texas beryl brought light precipitation to some locations cloud cover and rainfall in brownsville area resulted in coldest maximum temperature recorded for city on date of august 15 tropical storm chris a tropical wave exited west coast of africa on august 12 although large amounts of deep convection accompanied system it was displaced from poorly defined center over next few days convection consolidated and by 1200 utc on august 17 system began as tropical depression six while centered about east of lesser antilles outflow was initially limited due to light wind shear though depression was forecast to become a strong tropical storm by august 20 it was highly surprising to national hurricane center that depression did not immediately begin to intensify despite warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear because of a burst in deep convection as well as satellite imagery estimating winds of 40 mph 65 km h depression strengthened into tropical storm chris at 1200 utc on august 18 upon becoming a tropical storm chris attained its peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of because wind shear was believed to be weak further intensification seemed very likely unexpectedly chris weakened back to a tropical depression by 1800 utc on august 18 after having been a tropical storm for only six hours however national hurricane center operationally held chris at tropical storm intensity until early on following day convection was nearly non existent early on august 19 though there were a few small bursts in convection later that day a reconnaissance aircraft flight into storm found no circulation while a quikscat pass indicated an open wave as a result chris dissipated while east of northernmost leeward islands at 1200 utc on august 19 hurricane debby a strong tropical wave exited west coast of africa on august 16 no development occurred until august 19 when convection began consolidating around a well defined low level circulation as a result system became tropical depression seven at 1800 utc on that same day while located about east of windward islands favorable conditions allowed depression to become tropical storm debby early on august 20 and further strengthening into a hurricane occurred 24 hours later at 1200 utc on august 21 sustained winds peaked at 85 mph 140 km h debby made three landfalls on august 22 in barbuda saint barthelemy and virgin gorda before re entering atlantic north of puerto rico as debby paralleled north coast of hispaniola late on august 23 it weakened to a tropical storm unexpectedly storm continued westward and weakened further instead of approaching florida and strengthening into a major hurricane while south of eastern cuba on august 24 debby was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours becoming completely dissipating light rainfall and gusty winds caused minor damage in barbuda saint martin and trinidad and tobago brief blackouts and damage reaching 200 000 was reported in united states virgin islands effects were most severe in puerto rico where some areas experienced more than of rainfall mudslides caused by flooding damaged roads bridges and houses at 406 homes on island were flooded which five suffering at least moderate damage in san juan slick roads caused several minor car accidents one indirectly fatality was attributed to storm after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish damage on island of puerto rico reached 501 000 according to civil defense force of dominican republic severe flooding in northern portions of that country caused evacuation of more than 700 people in haiti squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few rainfall in cuba brought relief to an eight month long drought in eastern cuba tropical storm ernesto a tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa on august 28 while tracking west northwestward satellite imagery indicated a developing low level circulation after significant deep convection formed system was classified as tropical depression eight at 1200 utc on september 1 because of potentially unfavorable wind shear only slight intensification was forecast depression tracked west northwestward under influence of a subtropical ridge to its north because of satellite intensity estimates of sustained winds of increased deep convection and improvements in outflow depression became tropical storm ernesto at 0600 utc on september 2 however nhc noted in its tropical cyclone report on ernesto that it may not have been a tropical cyclone at all as quikscat surface wind estimates indicated that there was no closed circulation although data was dismissed as inconclusive as it strengthened into a tropical storm ernesto attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of because of vertical shear low level circulation did not become well defined because convection was being sheared away from center national hurricane center noted possibility of ernesto weakening back to a tropical depression though forecasts indicated otherwise later that day no significant change in intensity was predicted as persistent wind shear seemed to be weakening ernesto though ships and gfdl computer models called for significant strengthening although deep convection re developed near center early on september 3 no intensification occurred at 1800 utc on september 3 ernesto weakened to a tropical depression six hours later ernesto dissipated to east northeast of leeward islands tropical depression nine a low level trough and a cluster of convection associated with a tropical wave interacted in gulf of mexico in early september 2000 a disorganized low level center developed and thus system was classified as tropical depression nine while located south of lake charles louisiana on september 7 due to proximity to land depression was unable to intensify into a tropical storm and attained a maximum wind speed of depression weakened slightly before making landfall near sabine pass texas on september 9 eight hours later depression dissipated while barely inland depression brought light to moderate rainfall to louisiana mississippi arkansas alabama and texas though it was generally less than a few areas in southern louisiana mississippi and alabama reported precipitation in excess of rainfall associated with depression peaked at in buras triumph louisiana however depression caused no damage or fatalities hurricane florence a cold front moved off continent of north america in early september system spawned a low pressure area that gradually developed into a subtropical depression at 1800 utc on september 10 while located about west southwest of bermuda it rapidly acquired tropical characteristics and became tropical depression ten at 0600 utc on september 11 thereafter depression strengthened into tropical storm florence at 1200 utc on that day and reached hurricane status only six hours later drier mid tropospheric air weaken florence to a tropical storm but re strengthen into a hurricane later on september 12 due to a combination of north northwesterly shear and lower sea surface temperatures florence again weakened on september 13 and was downgraded to a tropical storm after moving erratically for almost five days florence accelerated east northeastward in response to a short wave trough on september 15 storm soon began to re intensify becoming a hurricane early on september 16 shortly thereafter florence curved northeastward however colder sea surface temperatures weakened it to a tropical storm september 17 early on following day florence was absorbed by an extratropical low near newfoundland rip current along east coast of united states drowned three people in north carolina tropical storm force winds were reported in bermuda though no damage occurred hurricane gordon a tropical wave exited west coast of africa on september 4 and tracked westward across atlantic ocean with minimal organization for four days after slowly developing convection between september 8 and 14 an air force reserve reconnaissance aircraft reported a closed circulation as a result system was classified as tropical depression eleven just offshore quintana roo shortly thereafter depression made landfall in quintana roo on september 15 system emerged into gulf of mexico due to warm sea surface temperatures depression strengthened into tropical storm gordon on following day and further to hurricane intensity on september 17 while tracking northeastward however vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment weakened gordon to a tropical storm later that day at 0300 utc on september 18 gordon made landfall near cedar key florida with winds of gordon rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression when it was absorbed by a frontal system over georgia about 15 hours later while passing through lesser antilles precursor tropical wave caused locally heavy rainfall and wind gusts between shortly before developing into a tropical cyclone flooding in mountainous areas of guatemala caused 23 fatalities in its early stages gordon produced locally heavy rainfall in cuba and yucatan peninsula storm produced abnormally high tides along west coast of florida which caused widespread but minor coastal flooding at least 65 homes and businesses were flooded while numerous coastal roads including bayshore boulevard and courtney campbell causeway were closed due to water inundation one fatality occurred near pensacola after a surfer drowned in rough seas strong winds in state caused damage to houses businesses power lines and trees two tornadoes in southwest florida extensively damaged 2 condominiums and at least 24 houses a third tornado along east coast of central florida caused minimal damage to trees and roofs minor flooding occurred in some areas due to rainfall reaching in mayo in north carolina flooding caused two indirect fatalities when a car lost control and crashed into a tractor trailer in other states light rainfall caused mostly minor effects overall gordon was responsible for 10 8 million in damage tropical storm helene a tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa on september 10 and gradually developed into tropical depression twelve on september 15 while located more than east of leeward islands it did not intensify and degenerated to a tropical wave on following day remnants continued westward and crossed leeward islands on september 17 late on september 19 remnants redeveloped into tropical depression twelve near grand cayman around 1200 utc on september 20 depression crossed near western tip of cuba entering gulf of mexico depression began strengthening and became tropical storm helene at early on september 21 while tracking northward later that day helene peaked with winds of though due to increasing wind shear storm soon began to weaken at 1200 utc on september 22 helene made landfall near fort walton beach florida with winds of although storm weakened slightly inland it later began re strengthening and became a tropical storm over north carolina late on september 23 after re emerging into atlantic ocean helene re intensified to near hurricane status though storm was absorbed by a cold front on september 26 while east southeast of newfoundland remnant tropical wave produced strong winds and flooding in lesser antilles effects were worst in puerto rico where flash flooding and mudslides destroyed one houses and damaged at least 100 others in addition a bridge was also destroyed and many other roads were impassable due to flooding impact in cuba jamaica and hispaniola is unknown a combination of gusty winds locally heavy rainfall and a few tornadoes in florida panhandle caused about 5 000 power outages damaged more than 220 homes and destroyed two houses and four mobile homes heavy rainfall caused sopchoppy river to exceed its banks flooding nearby houses outside of florida effects were most severe in south carolina where rainfall in excess of fell and a tornado caused one fatality six injuries and damaged 12 houses other death in state occurred when a car and crashed into a tree which killed driver throughout its path helene caused slightly more than 16 million in damage hurricane isaac a well defined tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa on september 20 cloud pattern quickly became better defined and developed into tropical depression thirteen on september 21 while centered south of cape verde depression quickly intensified due to low wind shear and became tropical storm isaac early on september 22 as it headed west northwestward isaac continued to strengthen and was upgraded to a hurricane on september 23 after reaching a preliminary peak with winds of structure of storm became less organized possibly due to slightly colder ocean temperatures and increased wind shear by 1200 utc on september 26 isaac ceased weakening after winds dropped to storm began to re strengthen on september 27 after wind shear decreased on september 28 isaac peaked as a low end category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph 220 km h following its peak intensity isaac began to weaken immediately thereafter while turning north northwestward eventually storm turned northward before re curving north northeastward further weakening occurred after isaac moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures and dropped down to category 1 intensity by september 30 while accelerating northeastward on october 1 isaac was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before transitioning into extratropical later that same day extratropical remnants affected british isles between october 3 and 4 before being absorbed into another extratropical storm to north of scotland on october 4 minimal impact was reported from isaac one fatality occurred when a passenger drowned after his boat capsized due to large waves produced by isaac offshore long island new york hurricane joyce a poorly organized tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa on september 22 over next three days system tracked westward and slowly began to develop a closed circulation by september 25 national hurricane center initiated advisories convection became further organized and depression continued to intensity twelve hours after becoming a cyclone depression was upgraded to tropical storm joyce early on september 26 joyce continued to strengthen and became a hurricane by september 27 on following day a pinhole eye appeared and shortly thereafter joyce peaked as a strong category 1 hurricane with winds of on september 28 after peak intensity on september 28 wind shear and a possible intrusion of dry air caused joyce to become disorganized and weaken late on september 29 joyce was downgraded to a tropical storm while centered well east of lesser antilles though it was always predicted to re intensify joyce continued to weaken and became a tropical depression on october 1 while crossing through southern windward islands early on following day joyce unexpectedly degenerated back into an open tropical wave over southeast caribbean sea remnants were monitored for regeneration but never developed back into a tropical cyclone overall impact from joyce was minimal limited to mainly rainfall and near tropical storm force winds in trinidad and tobago and barbados remnants of joyce also caused similar effects on abc islands and dominican republic which resulted in minor damage hurricane keith a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa on september 16 system uneventfully crossed atlantic and caribbean before developing into tropical depression fifteen while near honduras on september 28 depression gradually strengthened and became tropical storm keith on following day as storm tracked westward it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on september 30 shortly thereafter keith began to rapidly deepen and peaked as a category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later keith then began to meander erratically offshore of belize which significantly weakened storm due to land interaction by late on october 2 keith made landfall in ambergris caye belize as a minimal hurricane it quickly weakened to a tropical storm before another landfall occurred near belize city early on following day while moving inland over yucatan peninsula keith weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into gulf of mexico on october 4 once in gulf of mexico keith began to re strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and a hurricane on following day by late on october 5 keith made its third and final landfall near tampico tamaulipas mexico as a moderately strong category 1 hurricane storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24 hours after landfall keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in central america which resulted in extensive flooding especially in belize and mexico in guatemala storm flooded 10 towns and caused one fatality similarly one fatality also occurred in el salvador and at least 300 people were affected by flooding in that country thirteen communities in nicaragua were completely isolated after keith made roads impassable twelve deaths were reported in nicaragua all of which were flood related five people were presumed dead in honduras after an aircraft disappeared near roatan one other fatality occurred due to flooding storm brought torrential rainfall to belize with many areas reporting at least of rain while highest reported amount of precipitation was in belize city in belize a village reported that only 12 houses remained while elsewhere in country at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged several houses in belize city suffered minor roof damage at least 19 people were killed in belize and damages totaled to 280 million 2000 usd heavy rainfall also occurred in mexico especially in states of nuevo leon and tamaulipas flooding by keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels throughout mexico at least 460 houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred in addition one person drowned due to heavy rainfall damages incurred in associated with keith in mexico totaled approximately 365 9 million 2000 mxn 38 7 million 2000 usd overall keith was responsible for 40 deaths and 319 million 2000 usd in damage tropical storm leslie a tropical wave which likely spawned hurricane isaac entered eastern caribbean sea on september 27 system slowly organized while tracking westward and later moved to north northwest around hurricane keith eventually system moved northward into gulf of mexico and straits of florida system interacted with a frontal boundary while crossing florida on october 3 and 4 which caused torrential rainfall satellite imagery indicated development of a circulation near orlando because of its structure system became a subtropical depression at 1200 utc on october 4 about six hours later subtropical depression emerged into atlantic and low level circulation gradually moved toward deep convection while tracking eastward by 1200 utc on october 5 subtropical depression was reclassified as tropical storm leslie while fully tropical leslie strengthened slightly and peaked with winds of however it soon began interacting with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 7 while located northwest of bermuda system dropped heavy rainfall in cuba peaking at in havana province while precursor crossed florida it produced torrential rainfall across southern florida especially in miami metropolitan area in miami dade county alone 1 005 houses were destroyed 1 358 were severely damaged and 3 443 had minor damage throughout state at least 93 000 homes were flooded electrical stations were also damaged by floods leaving more than 27 000 people without power extensive agricultural damage occurred with of farmland inundated by water overall precursor system of leslie resulted in about 950 million 2000 usd in damage slightly more than half of that figure was agriculture related additionally three fatalities occurred two of which due to drowning while third was a man that fell while attempting to unclog a roof drain remnants of leslie caused near tropical storm force winds and waves up to in newfoundland though damage in region was minimal hurricane michael a low pressure system developed after detaching from a cold front while between florida and bermuda low pressure area slowly formed a circulation and began to deepen on october 14 as it drifted north northeastward by october 15 system developed into a subtropical depression while centered about midway between florida and bermuda later that day satellite classifications using hebert technique indicated that subtropical depression had strengthened into a subtropical storm and it was upgraded at 0000 utc on october 16 due to sst s in excess of subtropical storm developed persistent convection near low level center and it slowly acquired tropical characteristics by 0000 utc on october 17 subtropical storm was re classified as tropical storm michael three hours later national hurricane center began advisories on michael though initially it was erroneously classified as tropical depression seventeen although michael was predicted to intensify only modestly it rapidly strengthened and became a hurricane later on october 17 michael fluctuated slightly in intensity while tracking over an area of decreasing sst s however another brief period of rapid intensification occurred due to baroclinic effects and michael peaked as a minimal category 2 hurricane shortly thereafter michael transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before making landfall near harbour breton newfoundland throughout newfoundland michael and remnant extratropical cyclone produced high winds which tore off roofs ripped off roof shingles caused sporadic power outages shattered windows and uprooted trees in a few communities precipitation produced by storm was light and peaked at in north mountain nova scotia michael also produced rainfall in maine and bermuda there were no damage figures available though damage was considered to be relatively light tropical storm nadine in mid october a strong upper level trough and a tropical wave interacted while located in central atlantic system moved slowly westward and convection began increasing by october 19 system became stationary and developed a surface circulation later that day tropical depression eighteen developed about southeast of bermuda initially depression lacked a well defined center though a broad circulation was evident depression tracked slowly northward and then northeastward around a subtropical ridge and ahead of a cold front as wind shear decreased convective activity became better organized on october 20 by 1200 utc on that day depression was upgraded to tropical storm nadine although it was strengthening quikscat suggested that low level circulation was falling apart as it appeared to be merging with cold front at 0000 utc on october 21 nadine attained its peak intensity with winds of 60 mph 95 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of around time of peak intensity a possible eye like feature and an impressive outflow were observed on satellite imagery as a result national hurricane center noted possibility but did not exclusively forecast nadine to strengthen into a hurricane however shortly thereafter wind shear increased and storm resembled a frontal wave and appeared to possibly be interacting with cold front cloud pattern then became ragged while low level circulation moved toward southern edge of deep convection by 0000 utc on october 22 nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and merged with a frontal low about 18 hours later unnamed subtropical storm on october 25 an extratropical low pressure system formed to east of turks and caicos islands it moved northwestward and gradually intensified and by 1800 utc system transitioned into a subtropical storm it turned to north and later to northeast a burst of convection near center allowed storm to attain peak winds of due to its forward motion it is possible surface winds reached as high as an approaching cold front caused storm to become extratropical on october 29 and later that day a larger extratropical storm absorbed previously subtropical storm near nova scotia marine prediction center issued some marine gale and storm warnings offshore while national weather service issued gale warnings for coastal north carolina it was not designated as a subtropical cyclone operationally storm produced tropical storm force winds in portions of atlantic canada although it was associated with larger extratropical storm at time several ships also recorded tropical storm force winds one of which recorded peak winds of storm names following names were used for system that attained at least tropical storm intensity within atlantic basin in year 2000 although this was same list used for 1994 atlantic hurricane season storms were named joyce leslie michael and nadine for first time in 2000 name joyce replaced joan after 1988 but was not used in 1994 names that were not assigned are marked in alberto beryl chris debby ernesto florence gordon helene isaac joyce keith leslie michael nadine retirement during meeting in spring of 2001 world meteorological organization retired name keith from list above due to its high impact and replaced with name kirk for use in 2006 atlantic hurricane season although name kirk was not used during 2006 instead it was used during 2012 season
