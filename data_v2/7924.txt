development online elements were removed due to rising costs with an offline single player version released in 2002 eventually due to development problems and profitability of online games online xbox version was cancelled in 2003 however developer atlus confirmed that they were creating an online version of nine for pc due to more lucrative market during its early development pc version of nine was renamed shin megami tensei imagine continuing development as a different entity for approximately three and a half years original music for title was composed by series newcomer kenichi yoshikawa tracks for earlier games by shoji meguro and tsukasa masuko were used in an arranged form after 2012 music composition was taken over by daisuke matsumoto when first revealed game was primarily developed by atlus with online infrastructure being developed by japanese company isao it was classified as an online role playing game which got round server based problems of mmorpgs by using a single server for all players by 2005 atlus had licensed its development to cave for game s development a new subsidiary called cave online was created made up of former atlus staff members this subsidiary merged back into cave by september 2006 during final year of work on game total length of time in which cave worked on title has been estimated as about 20 months game used a version of virtual community engine a middleware engine that enabled centralization of servers and networking aiming for a smooth and fast running experience for players an important part of development process for its designers was accurately translating kazuma kaneko s demon designs into 3d according to director hajime tanigawa its gameplay was based around prevalent south korean online role playing games for pc tanigawa joined when title shifted to being an mmorpg and he estimated development time in this form at ten months at beginning of development team decided to release a working form of game within a year this was managed by narrowing amount of time spent on early concept work instead taking inspiration directly from other titles including titles within megami tensei series tanigawa said that without this development might have lasted up to three years when closed beta began many of game s final functions had yet to be implemented a free to play model was adopted as team wanted to bring in maximum number of players into game while making game completely free and using in game advertising as a means of earning money was an option this had yet to become commercially viable in japan at time in early 2007 cave partnered with gung ho online entertainment a japanese company experienced with online games who could co manage game with cave according to tanigawa partnership with gung ho online opened up possibility of expansion into asian and western markets release imagine was first announced in july 2004 under title shin megami tensei online imagine with its first public

later game had a strong community and was ranked among japan s leading online games masashi oji writing for 4gamer net after official release of imagine praised multiple aspects of game including its story combat demon mechanics flexible character growth system and general sense of belonging within megami tensei series one recurring point raised by oji was that many features promised had yet to be added at that time which faulted experience slightly rob fahey of eurogamer greatly enjoyed experience echoing many of praises given by other journalists while finding graphics a little dated and said that some technical improvements would be positively met nick tylwalk of gamezebo praised combat for being much more engaging than other free to play games of its type enjoyed character customization and variety of demons and excellent story his main complaints were a steep learning curve points where narrative got lost and dated looking graphics and interface he finished his review by giving game a score of 3 5 out of 5 stars as part of a news article concerning game earnest cavalli of wired commented that game boasted interesting content despite his experiences being from closed beta version his opinion was that megami tensei fans would enjoy game while those more used to world of warcraft might see it as a hyper japanese phantasy star online clone gamesradar s tyler nagata listed game as among free mmorpgs for pc that were graphically superior to subscription based world of warcraft nagata also recommended game for its friendly community when compared to world of warcraft he said that usual mmo elitism amongst players doesn t seem as common in megaten from our experience it was always easy to find friendly and helpful players for groups at hubs in an article concerning some fresh time with game after a long absence hindman of joystiq said that he greatly enjoyed his time with imagine having become more familiar with combat but still found some aspects of game fairly obscure and greatly appreciating demon design and systems that went into them he recommended that players take their time with game notes references external links category 2007 video games category massively
