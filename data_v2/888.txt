right thumb vertical cross section through a supercell showing bwer bounded weak echo region also known as a bwer or a vault is a radar signature within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into and is surrounded by higher aloft this feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in inflow region of a thunderstorm it cannot be seen visually bwer has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole martin j murphy and nicholas w s an analysis of lightning holes in a dfw supercell storm using total lightning and radar information retrieved on 2008 01 08 description and attributes thumb right bwer associated with a tornadic supercell in 2006 as seen from different elevation angles lower angles upper left shows a weaker area of reflectivity but not at higher levels bwer is a nearly vertical channel of weak radar echo surrounded on sides and top by significantly stronger echoes bwer sometimes called a vault is related to strong updraft in a severe convective storm that carries newly formed atmospheric particulates called hydrometeors to high levels before they can grow to radar detectable sizes are typically found at mid levels of convective storms to above ground and are a few kilometers in horizontal diameter identifying location of updraft region is important because it is linked to locations where severe weather normally occurs advanced warning operations course ic 3 i b 1 storm interrogation retrieved on 2008 01 08 presence of a bwer has been part of a method to diagnose thunderstorm strength as part of lemon technique since 1977 leslie r lemon new severe thunderstorm radar identification techniques and warning criteria a preliminary report techniques development unit national severe storms forecast center kansas city missouri july 1977 updraft strength within bwer supports growth of large hailstones just above vault which can be displaced slightly into direction of motion of parent supercell storm william r cotton and roger a pielke human impacts on weather and climate retrieved on 2008 01 08 detection thumb left upright 0 75 radar schematics of bwer bounded weak echo region bwer is a region of low radar reflectivity bounded above by an area of higher radar reflectivity which shows evidence of a strong updraft within mesocyclones radar analysts have recognized this phenomenon since at least 1973 richard jason lynn ii supercell identification and assessment algorithm retrieved on 2008 01 08 using different elevation scans methods of objectively corroborating that a bwer is associated with a mesocyclone is done by using a weather radar with doppler effect to obtain precipitations velocities this have been available operationally in united states since 1997 with nexrad network kenneth falk and william parker rotational shear nomogram for tornadoes retrieved on 2008 03 08 when using lightning detection system lightning holes uncovered in 2004 correspond to where a bwer would be seen on radar a cross section of three dimensional reflectivity of a thunderstorm shows vault better algorithms were developed by j s marshall radar observatory of mcgill university in canada to locate overhang region in a thunderstorm by late 1980s its radar uses 24 angles giving it good vertical resolution in united states fewer scanning angles are made within wsr 88d radar which makes it more difficult to detect overhang advanced warning operations course 1 storm interrogation retrieved on 2008 03 08 rhonda scott randy m and rodger a brown new scanning strategies for wsr 88d retrieved on 2008 03 08 once overhang is located it is possible to make a cross section to view if it is related with a bwer leslie r lemon radar three body scatter spike an operational large hail signature retrieved on 2008 03 08 however since 1997 algorithms have been developed by national weather service to determine regions of reflectivity gradient in three dimensions and presence of bwer in convection bounded weak echo region algorithm retrieved on 2008 01 08 development of a pronounced bwer can lead to tropical cyclone like radar signatures over land when located with a low angle plan position indicator ppi storm prediction center north carolina tornadocane from 1999 retrieved on 2008 01 08 david m roth mcs with eye july 21 2003 retrieved on 2008 01 08 when using lightning detection system lightning holes uncovered in 2004 correspond to where a bwer would be seen on radar see also tornado and tornadogenesis hook echo hail spike convective storm detection references external links north carolina tornadocane from 1999 spc mcs with eye july 21 2003 hpc category severe weather and convection category radar meteorology
