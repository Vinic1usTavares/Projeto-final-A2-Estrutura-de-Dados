intelligence was clearly secondary to her attractiveness criticism of educational value new school has been criticized for its low educational content potential negative impacts on young viewers and dubious age appropriateness in light of regulations on children s television programming in united states according to filings made in accordance with fcc rules target age of new school is 811 years old series was criticized in a 2007 survey by children s media policy coalition cmpc an advocacy group made up of member organizations children now american academy of pediatrics benton foundation national pta and office of communication of united church of christ cmpc s survey of 25 shows identified new school as one of 17 that contained only social emotional messages without any academic or informational content report judged moral messages in new school to be unsuccessful as characters either fail to learn ostensible lessons or learn them only on a superficial level without any meaningful reason or corresponding character development while analyzing episode officer kronk cmpc noted that kuzco never has to face a personal conflict or find a resolution nor are there any real repercussions for kuzco s anti social behavior other than his eventual loneliness macbride mago timmerman 2007 p 8 fn 26 a reply from national association of broadcasters criticized cmpc s findings as unabashedly subjective macbride mago timmerman 2007 pp 78 in a 2008 report for children now by communication professor barbara wilson and her colleagues new school was among 30 television programs surveyed because they were supposed to contain educational or informational for preschoolers elementary school kids and teenagers as part of federal core educational programming requirements according to report characters in new school displayed some of highest levels of social aggression which report defined as any behavior designed to harm an animate being s self esteem or social status including derisive name calling socially someone gossiping and spreading hurtful rumors wilson kunkel drogos 2008 p 10 it was one of three series deemed to have high levels of social aggression alongside hannah montana and jacob two two wilson kunkel drogos 2008 pp wilson noted that in principle a children s series could highlight characters who exhibit socially aggressive behaviors in order to teach children to avoid such behavior however she doubted whether that message would be adequately conveyed by shows with repeated instances of social aggression which would be far more likely to feature such content for laughs and to entertain rather than to impart a moral lesson show s values as an educational resource has also been assessed in light of its historical setting common sense media found that it represented a missed opportunity because despite potentially interesting and educational setting an incan empire there s no learning about history or culture of these people conversely a review in a spanish journal of pedagogy found that series provided an opportunity to introduce students to topics like cultures and peoples of pre columbian era as well as subsequent period of european colonization of americas aliaga serrano 2008 p 57 awards and nominations new school received several awards and nominations for her performance of character yzma kitt won two annie awards for
