flekkefjord line is a abandoned branch line to sorland line it ran between sira and flekkefjord in vest agder norway only current activity on line is tourist draisines station buildings along line were designed by architect paul armin due these have all been demolished line opened in 1904 as a extension of narrow gauge jaeren line it was planned as first step of a main line along south coast at flekkefjord there was steam ship connection onwards to oslo in 1941 line was converted to standard gauge and in 1944 sorland line was completed western part of flekkefjord line was integrated into it while remaining section became branch line that kept name flekkefjord line during 1940s steam locomotive hauled trains were replaced by railcars following declining traffic in part due to slow speeds caused by line s narrow profile line was closed with last trains running in 1990 history construction first committee that looked into possibility of a railway to flekkefjord was created in 1875 after completion of jaeren line from stavanger to egersund in 1878 proposals were made to build an extension westwards along coast that eventually would reach oslo first part of what was named line was passed by parliament in 1894 and would run from egersund via sira to flekkefjord initial proposal proposed that line would eventually continue onwards via mandal to kristiansand decision to build line was taken by parliament of norway in 1894 aspenberg 1994 217 construction started in 1896 and was originally planned to be completed by 1902 however delays prevented line from being be brought into use before 1 november 1904 line was built by norwegian state railways nsb and was long coast between egersund and flekkefjord would give a very difficult route to build so it was decided to build a more inland line like jaeren line and most railways being built at time flekkefjord line was built in narrow gauge both telephone and telegraph cables were laid along line along section from sirnes to flekkefjord there were many vertical cliffs straight into fjord forcing or 38 percent of line to be built in tunnels of whole length from egersund to flekkefjord there are 46 tunnels totaling most prominent was tunnel which is long just before flekkefjord a bridge was built that crosses it was a reused bridge from voss line in total about 12 of line consisted of tunnels francis hagerup when delivering line s opening speech remarked that no other railway had until then been more difficult to construct all stations along line were designed by paul armin due with all but terminal station built in wood flekkefjord station was built as a three story brick building in art nouveau in addition there was construction a depot and a wharf at flekkefjord passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along south coast towards oslo pre war operations first part of line to open for temporary operation was between flekkefjord and moi on 1 october 1904 for official opening town of flekkefjord was adorned with norwegian flags a train departed to egersund on 31 october 1904 with several notable passengers prime minister francis hagerup state railways director elias sunde and board member sven director of traffic jens christian flekkefjord s mayor and city council as well as other mayors of district festivities continued on next day when train returned from egersund to flekkefjord initially there were four services in each direction each day with three services on holy days train that connected with steam ship would wait up to 45 minutes in case of delays to allow connection until 1927 routes remained same that year kragero line opened and it became possible to take a night train from oslo to kragero continue by bus to flekkefjord and be in stavanger following afternoon travel time was further reduced when sorland line was extended to arendal in 1935 initial rolling stock was from voss line and some of bridges and track was from that line too voss line was being upgraded to rail tracks and of track was used on flekkefjord line thumb left flekkefjord line at until 1927 all trains were operated with steam locomotives nsb introduced first diesel multiple unit with introduction of lightning trains that corresponded with coach services that connected with kragero line first were class 14 railcars these reduced travel time from flekkefjord to stavanger by 50 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes in addition to passengers major cargo were herring and lumber connecting coast in 1923 it was decided by parliament that sorland line that would connect oslo kristiansand and stavanger would follow an inner route section of flekkefjord line from egersund to sira would become part of that line while eastern from sira to flekkefjord would become a branch line retaining flekkefjord line name since sorland line needed to be built from east construction along flekkefjord line did not start until 1940 after german occupation of norway during world war ii german occupation forces were rebuilding narrow gauge railways to standard gauge in 1940 41 flekkefjord and jaeren lines were rebuilt to dual gauge not until 1944 was flekkefjord line only standard gauge due to limited funds and unlike rest of jaeren line profile of flekkefjord line was not changed during conversion of gauge this gave a speed limit of and creative solutions such as lowering height of ballast by route from egersund to sira received a better upgrade since it was to become part of main line through southern norway route between sira and sirnes was completely rebuilt this gave severe limits to use of section between flekkefjord and sirnes most classes of trains could not run on line as were freight trains aspenberg 1994 218 post war operations after line had been relegated to a branch line traffic fell considerably another factor was car traffic which did not exist in flekkefjord until 1918 but thereafter became widespread after war class 20 steam locomotives were used on line during 1940 several railcars of class 87 were taken into use and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units from 1956 to 1966 also class 86 units were used on line but narrow profile of tunnels made operations problematic class 87 remained in service until 1981 when used class 89 units were bought from sweden at first two y7 units were brought to norway on 23 january and taken into service on 24 february after they proved to work well nsb bought them for 95 000 swedish kronor plus freight two more units were bought in 1986 aspenberg 1994 45 closing line had major limitations on speed and also served wrong direction heading westwards into less populated areas instead of populated parts of agder in east major investments would be needed to upgrade line to a suitable speed and through 1970s this became an important issue of debate on other hand line had among highest ridership of branch lines with 120 000 passengers per year which was for instance 50 higher than arendal line which was not closed aspenberg 1994 219 however parliament decided to close line along with several other branch lines in 1988 with effect from 1990 last scheduled train ran on 31 december 1990 there were plans to establish private operations along line continental railway systems was established by rasmus company would be allowed to use rolling stock and infrastructure and two of trains were painted white however it was not possible for company to get necessary bank surety demanded by nsb and nothing came of plans line has been suggested preserved as a cultural heritage since it represents one of very few railways with original narrow gauge profile intact however all stations have been demolished flekkefjord in 1970 sirnes in 1977 and in 1988 organization friends of flekkefjord line offer rental of draisines for tourists since closure of line and a round trip from flekkefjord to just outside sira takes about three hours however norwegian national rail administration have since banned operation of draisines until line is fully fenced in see also narrow gauge railways in norway references bibliography notes further reading external
