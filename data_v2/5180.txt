organizations and marketed free labor goods to his fellow abolitionists though products provided him with little profit yannessa p 15 free labor proponents in east also wanted to create a similar organization in western states in 1840s members of salem free produce association approached coffin to see if he would be interested in managing proposed western free produce association at first he

owner purchase a cotton gin that greatly increased plantation s productivity and provided a steady supply of cotton for coffin s association cotton was shipped to cincinnati where it was spun into cloth and sold yannessa p 26 other trips to tennessee and virginia were less successful although he did succeed in spreading word about free labor goods movement yannessa p 27 despite his constant attention to business poor supply and insufficient supply of free labor products proved to be insurmountable making it impossible for coffin to find a replacement to run company so that he could return to indiana company remained in business primarily through financial support of wealthy benefactors coffin sold business in 1857 after deciding it would be impossible to maintain a profitable business yannessa p 28 cincinnati already had a large anti slavery movement who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents in years before coffin moved to city yannessa p 23 coffin purchased a new
