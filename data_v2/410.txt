stamens corona perianth narcissus is a genus of predominantly spring perennial plants of amaryllis family amaryllidaceae various common names including daffodil word daffodil is also applied to related genera such as sternbergia and fritillaria meleagris it has been suggested that word daffodil be restricted to wild species of british isles n pseudonarcissus narcissus and are used to describe all or some members of genus narcissus has conspicuous flowers with six petal like tepals surmounted by a cup or trumpet shaped corona flowers are generally white or yellow also orange or pink in garden varieties with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona narcissus were well known in ancient civilisation both medicinally and botanically but formally described by linnaeus in his species plantarum 1753 genus is generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately 50 species number of species has varied depending on how they are classified due to similarity between species and hybridisation genus arose some time in late oligocene to early miocene epochs in iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest europe exact origin of name narcissus is unknown but it is often linked to a greek word for intoxicated narcotic and myth of youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection english word daffodil appears to be derived from asphodel with which it was commonly compared species are native to meadows and woods in southern europe and north africa with a centre of diversity in western mediterranean particularly iberian peninsula both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely and were introduced into far east prior to tenth century narcissi tend to be long lived bulbs which propagate by division but are also insect pollinated known pests diseases and disorders include viruses fungi larvae of flies mites and nematodes some narcissus species have become extinct while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism historical accounts suggest narcissi have been cultivated from earliest times but became increasingly popular in europe after 16th century and by late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily in netherlands today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars for horticultural purposes narcissi are classified into divisions covering a wide range of shapes and colours like other members of their family narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids which provide some protection for plant but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested this property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in production of galantamine for treatment of alzheimer s dementia long celebrated in art and literature narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures ranging from death to good fortune and as symbols of spring daffodil is national flower of wales and symbol of cancer charities in many countries appearance of wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places description general narcissus is a genus of perennial herbaceous geophytes which die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb they regrow in following year from brown skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks and reach heights of 5 80 cm depending on species dwarf species such as n have a maximum height of 5 8 cm while narcissus tazetta may grow as tall as 80 cm plants are scapose having a single central leafless hollow flower stem scape several green or blue green narrow strap shaped leaves arise from bulb plant stem usually bears a solitary flower but occasionally a cluster of flowers umbel flowers which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow sometimes both or rarely green consist of a perianth of three parts closest to stem proximal is a floral tube above ovary then an outer ring composed of six tepals undifferentiated sepals and petals and a central disc to conical shaped corona flowers may hang down pendent or be erect there are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style ovary is inferior below floral parts consisting of three chambers trilocular fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits dehisces releasing numerous black seeds bulb lies dormant after leaves and flower stem die back and has contractile roots that pull it down further into soil flower stem and leaves form in bulb to emerge following season most species are dormant from summer to late winter flowering in spring though a few species are autumn flowering specific vegetative bulbs pale brown skinned ovoid bulbs have a membranous tunic and a corky stem base or basal plate from which arise adventitious root hairs in a ring around edge which grow up to 40 mm in length above stem plate is storage organ consisting of bulb scales surrounding previous flower stalk and terminal bud scales are of two types true storage organs and bases of foliage leaves these have a thicker tip and a scar from where leaf lamina became detached innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping flower stalk see hanks fig 1 3 bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases each bulb unit has a life of about four years once leaves die back in summer roots also wither after some years roots shorten pulling bulbs deeper into ground contractile roots bulbs develop from inside pushing older layers outwards which become brown and dry forming an outer shell tunic or skin up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species while plant appears dormant above ground flower stalk which will start to grow in following spring develops within bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths flower stem lies in axil of second true leaf stems single leafless stem or scape appearing from early to late spring depending on species bears from 1 to 20 blooms stem shape depends on species some are highly compressed with a visible seam while others are rounded stems are upright and located at centre of leaves in a few species such as n stem is oblique asymmetrical stem is hollow in upper portion but towards bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material leaves narcissus plants have one to several basal leaves which are linear or strap shaped long and narrow sometimes channelled to and may pedicellate or may not sessile have a petiole stalk leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at base and arise from bulb emerging plant generally has two leaves but mature plant usually three rarely four and they are covered with a containing cuticle giving them a waxy appearance leaf colour is light green to blue green in mature plant leaves extend higher than flower stem but in some species leaves are low hanging leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath after flowering leaves turn yellow and die back once seed pod fruit is ripe jonquils usually have dark green round rush like leaves reproductive inflorescence inflorescence is scapose single stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel with up to 20 blooms species bearing a solitary flower include section bulbocodium and most of section pseudonarcissus species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence unbranched with short floral stalks with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers such as n papyraceus see illustration left and n tazetta see table i flower arrangement on inflorescence may be either with pedicellate or without sessile floral stalks prior to opening flower buds are enveloped and protected in a thin dry papery or membranous scarious spathe spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed and which remains wrapped around base of open flower as bud grows spathe splits longitudinally are small or absent flowers flowers of narcissus are hermaphroditic bisexual have three parts tripartite and are sometimes fragrant see fragrances flower symmetry is actinomorphic radial to slightly zygomorphic bilateral due to declinate ascending stamens curving downwards then bent up at tip narcissus flowers are characterised by their usually conspicuous corona trumpet three major floral parts in all species except n cavanillesii in which corona is virtually absent table i section tapeinanthus are i proximal floral tube ii surrounding free tepals and iii more distal corona paraperigonium all three parts may be considered to be components of perianth perigonium perianth arises above apex of inferior ovary its base forming floral tube floral tube is formed by fusion of basal segments of tepals proximally connate its shape is from an inverted cone to funnel shaped funneliform or cylindrical and is surmounted by more distal corona floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections apodanthi and jonquilla to rudimentary n cavanillesii surrounding floral tube and corona and reflexed bent back from rest of perianth are six spreading tepals or floral leaves in two whorls which may be distally ascending reflexed folded back or lanceolate like many monocotyledons perianth is homochlamydeous that is undifferentiated into separate calyx sepals and corolla petals but rather has six tepals three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals and three inner segments petals transition point between floral tube and corona is marked by insertion of free tepals on fused perianth corona or is variously described as bell shaped funneliform trumpet bowl shaped crateriform cup shaped or disc shaped with margins that are often frilled and is free from stamens rarely corona is a simple callose hardened thickened ring corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure anthers becoming reduced at its base fragrances which attract pollinators are formed all species produce nectar at top of ovary coronal morphology varies from tiny pigmented disk of n serotinus see table i or rudimentary structure in n cavanillesii to elongated trumpets of section pseudonarcissus trumpet daffodils table i while perianth may point forwards in some species such as n cyclamineus it is folded back reflexed see illustration left while in some other species such as n bulbocodium table i it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona colour of perianth is white yellow or bicoloured with exception of night flowering n viridiflorus which is green in addition corona of n poeticus has a red crenulate margin see table i flower diameter varies from 12 mm n bulbocodium to over 125 mm n nobilis n pseudonarcissus nobilis flower orientation varies from pendent or hanging

cavanillesii n serotinus and n rupicola table i or intermediate between these positions patent flowers of narcissus demonstrate exceptional floral diversity and sexual polymorphism primarily by corona size and floral tube length associated with pollinator groups see for instance figs 1 and 2 in graham and barrett barrett and harder 2005 describe three separate floral patterns daffodil form paperwhite form triandrus form predominant patterns are daffodil and paperwhite forms while triandrus form is less common each corresponds to a different group of pollinators see pollination daffodil form which includes sections pseudonarcissus and bulbocodium has a relatively short broad or highly funnelform tube funnel like which grades into an elongated corona which is large and funnelform forming a broad cylindrical or trumpet shaped perianth section pseudonarcissus consists of relatively large flowers with a corolla length of around generally solitary but rarely in inflorescences of 2 4 flowers they have wide greenish floral tubes with funnel shaped bright yellow six tepals sometimes differ in colour from corona and may be cream coloured to pale yellow paperwhite form including sections jonquilla apodanthi and narcissus has a relatively long narrow tube and a short shallow flaring corona flower is horizontal and fragrant triandrus form is seen in only two species n albimarginatus a moroccan endemic and n triandrus it combines features of both daffodil and paperwhite forms with a well developed long narrow tube and an extended bell shaped corona of almost equal length flowers are pendent androecium there are six stamens in one to two rows whorls with filaments separate from corona attached at throat or base of tube often of two separate lengths straight or declinate ascending curving downwards then upwards anthers are basifixed attached at their base gynoecium ovary is inferior below floral parts and trilocular three chambered and there is a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and filiform thread like style which is often extending beyond tube fruit fruit consists of dehiscent loculicidal capsules splitting between locules that are ellipsoid to subglobose almost spherical in shape and are papery to leathery in texture seeds fruit contains numerous subglobose seeds which are round and swollen with a hard coat sometimes with an attached elaiosome testa is black and dry most species have 12 ovules and 36 seeds although some species such as n bulbocodium have more up to a maximum of 60 seeds take five to six weeks to mature seeds of sections jonquilla and bulbocodium are wedge shaped and matte black while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black a gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse mature seeds chromosomes chromosome numbers include 2n 14 22 26 with numerous and polyploid derivatives basic chromosome number is 7 with exception of n tazetta n elegans and n broussonetii in which it is 10 or 11 this subgenus hermione was in fact characterised by this characteristic polyploid species include n papyraceus 4x 22 and n dubius 6x 50 phytochemistry alkaloids as with all genera narcissus contains unique alkaloids first alkaloid to be identified was lycorine from n pseudonarcissus in 1877 these are considered a protective adaptation and are utilised in classification of species nearly 100 alkaloids have been identified in genus about a third of all known amaryllidaceae alkaloids although not all species have been tested of nine alkaloid ring types identified in family narcissus species most commonly demonstrate presence of alkaloids from within lycorine lycorine and homolycorine homolycorine groups narciclasine and galantamine alkaloids are also represented alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time location and developmental stage narcissus also contain and low molecular weight in leaves and plant stems fragrances fragrances are predominantly monoterpene with a small amount of benzenoids although n jonquilla has both equally represented another exception is n which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives basic monoterpene precursor is pyrophosphate and commonest are and trans b most benzenoids are non methoxylated while a few species contain methoxylated forms ethers e g n other ingredient include indole and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators and fall into three main groups see pollination taxonomy history early genus narcissus was well known to ancients in greek literature theophrastus and dioscorides described probably referring to n poeticus although exact species mentioned in classical literature cannot be accurately established pliny elder later introduced latin form narcissus these early writers were as much interested in plant s possible medicinal properties as they were its botanical features and their accounts remained influential until at least renaissance see also antiquity mediaeval and renaissance writers include albert magnus and william turner but it remained to linnaeus to formally describe and name narcissus as a genus in his species plantarum 1753 at which time there were six known species modern de jussieu 1789 grouped narcissus into a family which he called narcissi this was renamed by jaume saint hilaire in 1805 corresponding to modern amaryllidaceae for a while narcissus was considered part of liliaceae as in illustration seen here of narcissus candidissimus but then amaryllidaceae were split off from it thumb n candidissimus by pierre joseph 1808 various authors have adopted either narrow e g haworth salisbury or wide e g herbert spach interpretations of genus narrow view treated many of species as separate genera over time wider view prevailed with a major monograph on genus being published by baker 1875 one of more controversial genera was tapeinanthus but today it is included in narcissus eventual position of narcissus within amaryllidaceae family only became settled in this century with advent of phylogenetic analysis and angiosperm phylogeny group system within amaryllidaceae genus narcissus belongs to narcisseae tribe one of 13 within amaryllidoideae subfamily it is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in narcisseae being distinguished from sternbergia by presence of a paraperigonium and is monophyletic subdivision infrageneric phylogeny of narcissus still remains relatively unsettled taxonomy having proved complex and difficult to resolve due to diversity of wild species ease with which natural hybridization occurs and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation consequently number of accepted species has varied widely de candolle in first systematic taxonomy of narcissus arranged species into named groups and those names have largely endured for various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority situation was confused by inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties and it was not till work of baker that wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus narcissus a common classification system has been that of fernandes based on cytology as modified by blanchard 1990 and mathew 2002 another is that of meyer 1966 fernandes proposed two subgenera based on basal chromosome number and then subdivided these into ten sections as did blanchard other authors e g webb prioritised morphology over genetics abandoning subgenera although blanchard s system has been one of most influential while infrageneric groupings within narcissus have been relatively constant their status genera subgenera sections subsections series species has not most cited system is that of royal horticultural society

corresponding to fernandes subgenera but did not support monophyly of all sections a later extended analysis by ronsted et al 2008 with additional taxa confirmed this pattern a large molecular analysis by zonneveld 2008 sought to reduce some of paraphyly identified by graham and barrett this led to a revision of sectional structure while graham and barrett 2004 had determined that subgenus hermione was monophyletic santos et al 2011 did not if two species excluded in former study are removed from analysis studies are in agreement species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus narcissus some so called have been proposed to accommodate natural ancient hybrids species thumb n major n triandrus and n jonquilla encyclopaedia 1819 estimates of number of species in narcissus have varied widely from anywhere between 16 and almost 160 even in modern era linnaeus originally included six species in 1753 by 1784 there were fourteen by 1819 sixteen and by 1831 adrian haworth had described 150 species much of variation lies in definition of species thus a very wide view of each species such as webb s results in few species while a very narrow view such as that of fernandes results in a larger number another factor is status of hybrids with a distinction between ancient hybrids and recent hybrids term ancient hybrid refers to hybrids found growing over a large area and therefore now considered as separate species while recent hybrid refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents with a more restricted range fernandes 1951 originally accepted 22 species webb 1980 27 by 1968 fernandes had 63 species blanchard 1990 65 species and erhardt 1993 66 in 2006 royal horticultural society s rhs international daffodil register and classified list listed 87 species while zonneveld s genetic study 2008 resulted in only 36 world checklist of selected plant families accepts 52 species along with at least 60 hybrids while rhs has 81 accepted names in its october 2014 list evolution within narcisseae narcissus western mediterranean diverged from sternbergia eurasia some time in late oligocene to early miocene eras around 29 3 18 1 ma later genus divided into

stirpium 1576 thumb n poeticus matthias de l obel icones stirpium 1591 derivation of latin narcissus is unknown but may be connected with hell it is frequently linked to myth of narcissus who became so obsessed with his own reflection in water that he drowned and narcissus plant sprang from where he died there is no evidence for flower being named for youth narcissus poeticus which grows in greece has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating pliny wrote that plant was named for its fragrance narkao narkao i grow numb not youth furthermore there were accounts of narcissi growing long before story of narcissus appeared see greek culture prior here refers to poet pamphilus but it is likely he meant it has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams represent youth admiring his reflection linnaeus used latin name narcissus for plant but was preceded by others such as matthias de l obel 1591 and clusius 1576 name narcissus was not uncommon for men in roman times plural form of common name narcissus has caused some confusion dictionaries list narcissi and narcissus however texts on usage such as garner and fowler state that narcissi is preferred form common name narcissus should not be capitalised daffodil name daffodil is derived from a variant of asphodel narcissus was frequently referred to as asphodel see antiquity asphodel in turn appears to come from greek reason for introduction of initial d is not known from at least 16th century dilly and have appeared as alternative names other names include lent lily distribution and habitat distribution although family amaryllidaceae are predominantly tropical or subtropical as a whole narcissus occurs primarily in mediterranean region with a centre of diversity in iberian peninsula spain and portugal a few species extend range into southern france italy balkans n poeticus n serotinus n tazetta and eastern mediterranean n serotinus including israel n tazetta occurrence of n tazetta in western and central asia china and japan are considered introductions albeit ancient see eastern cultures while exact northern limit of natural range is unknown occurrences of wild n pseudonarcissus in great britain middle and northern europe are similarly considered ancient introductions while amaryllidaceae is not native to north america it grows well in usda hardiness zones 3b through 10 which encompass most of united states and canada n elegans occurs on north west african coast morocco and libya as well as coastline of corsica sardinia and italy and n bulbocodium between tangier and algiers and tangier to marrakech but also on iberian peninsula n serotinus is found along entire mediterranean coast n tazetta occurs as far east as iran and kashmir since this is one of oldest species found in cultivation it is likely to have been introduced into kashmir n poeticus and n pseudonarcissus have largest distribution ranges n poeticus ranges from pyrenees along romanian carpathians to black sea and along dalmatian coast to greece n pseudonarcissus ranges from iberian peninsula via vosges mountains to northern france and belgium and united kingdom where there are still wild stocks in southern scotland only occurrence in luxembourg is located near in municipality of in germany it is found mainly in nature reserve at perlenbach fuhrtsbachtal and eifel national park where in spring at monschau meadows are teeming with yellow blooms one of most easterly occurrences can be found at near nassau on lahn thumb n pseudonarcissus growing in perlenbach fuhrtsbachtal reserve in germany however unlike above examples most species have very restricted endemic ranges which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids for instance in vicinity of portuguese city of porto where both n pseudonarcissus and n triandrus occur there are found various intersections of two species while in a small area along part of portuguese mondego river are found intersectional hybrids between n scaberulus and n triandrus biogeography demonstrates a phylogenetic association for instance subgenus hermione having a lowland distribution but subgenus narcissus section apodanthi being montane and restricted to morocco spain and portugal remaining sections within subgenus narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats section pseudonarcissus although widely naturalised is endemic to ranges of southeastern iberian peninsula habitats their native habitats are very varied with different elevations areas and substrates being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures and including grassland scrub woods river banks and rocky crevices although requirements vary overall there is a preference for acidic soils although some species will grow on limestone narcissus scaberulus will grow on granite soils where it is moist in growing season but dry in summer while narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers pseudonarcissus group in their natural habitat prefer humid situations such as stream margins springs wet pastures clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils and moist hillsides these habitats tend to be discontinuous in mediterranean mountains producing discrete isolated populations in germany which has relatively little limestone narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir beech oak alder ash and birch trees with well drained soil ecology life cycle narcissus are long lived perennial geophytes with winter growing and summer dormant bulbs that are mainly leaves and flowers appearing at same time while most species flower in late winter to spring five species are autumn flowering n broussonetii n cavanillesii n elegans n serotinus n viridiflorus by contrast these species are leaves appear after flowering flower longevity varies by species and conditions ranging from 5 20 days after flowering leaf and root senescence sets in and plant appears to be dormant till next spring conserving moisture however dormant period is also one of considerable activity within bulb primordia it is also a period during which plant bulb may be susceptible to predators like many bulb plants from temperate regions a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin this protects plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from bulb early spring growth confers a number of advantages including relative lack of competition for pollinators and lack of deciduous shading exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is n tazetta plants may spread clonally through production of daughter bulbs and division producing clumps narcissus species hybridise readily although fertility of offspring will depend on parental relationship pollination flowers are insect pollinated major pollinators being bees butterflies flies and hawkmoths while highly scented night flowering n viridiflorus is pollinated by crepuscular moths pollination mechanism fall into three groups corresponding to floral morphology see description flowers daffodil form pollinated by bees seeking pollen from anthers within corona broad perianth allows bees bombus anthophora to completely enter flower in their search for nectar and or pollen in this type stigma lies in mouth of corona extending beyond six anthers whose single whorl lies well within corona bees come into contact with stigma before their legs thorax and abdomen contact anthers and this approach causes cross pollination paperwhite form these are adapted to long tongued lepidoptera particularly sphingid moths such as and nymphalidae but also some long tongued bees and flies all of which are primarily seeking nectar narrow tube admits only insect s proboscis while short corona serves as a funnel guiding tip of proboscis into mouth of perianth tube stigma is placed either in mouth of tube just above two whorls of three anthers or hidden well below anthers pollinators then carry pollen on their or faces long tongued bees cannot reach nectar at tube base and so collect just pollen triandrus form pollinated by long tongued solitary bees anthophora bombus which forage for both pollen and nectar large corona allows bees to crawl into perianth but then narrow tube prevents further progres causing them to probe deeply for nectar pendant flowers prevent pollination by lepidoptera in n albimarginatus there may be either a long stigma with short and mid length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers dimorphism in n triandrus there are three patterns of sexual organs but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position and length of lower anthers outcrossing on whole is enforced through a late acting ovarian self incompatibility system but some species such as n dubius and n longispathus are self compatible producing mixtures of and outcrossed seeds pests and diseases diseases of narcissus are of concern because of economic consequences of losses in commercial cultivation pests include viruses bacteria and fungi as well as arthropods and gastropods for control of pests see commercial uses viruses aphids such as can transmit viral diseases which affect colour and shape of leaves as can nematodes up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi these include narcissus common latent virus narcissus mottling associated virus this should not be confused with similarly named narcissus latent virus which is a narcissus latent virus narcissus mild mottle virus which causes green mottling near leaf tips narcissus degeneration virus ndv narcissus late season yellows virus which occurs after flowering streaking leaves and stems narcissus mosaic virus narcissus yellow stripe virus nysv narcissus yellow streak virus narcissus tip necrosis virus which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and narcissus white streak virus nwsv less host specific viruses include raspberry ringspot virus latent virus nelv narcissus virus mosaic virus armv broad bean wilt viruses cucumber mosaic virus tomato black ring virus tbrv tomato ringspot virus tomrsv and tobacco rattle virus trv of these viruses most serious and prevalent are ndv nysv and nwsv ndv is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in n tazetta infection with nysv produces light or grayish green or yellow stripes or on upper two thirds of leaf which may be roughened or twisted flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched nwsv produces greenish purple streaking on leaves and stem turning white to yellow and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield these viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage bacteria bacterial disease is uncommon in narcissus but includes pseudomonas bacterial streak and carotovorum sp carotovorum bacterial soft rot fungi more problematic for non commercial plants is fungus fusarium f sp narcissi which causes basal rot rotting of bulbs and yellowing of leaves this is most serious disease of narcissus since fungus can remain in soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible relatively resistant forms include n triandrus n tazetta and n jonquilla another fungus which attacks bulbs causing narcissus smoulder is botrytis narcissicola sclerotinia narcissicola and other species of botrytis including botrytis cinerea particularly if improperly stored copper sulfate is used to combat disease and infected bulbs are burned blue mould rot of bulbs may be caused by infection with species of penicillium if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites see below species of rhizopus e g rhizopus rhizopus nigricans cause bulb soft rot and sclerotinia black slime disease a combination of both peyronellaea curtisii curtisii and botrytis narcissicola causes neck rot in bulbs fungi affecting roots include a cause of root rot and causing white root rot while others affect root and bulb such as aspergillus niger black mold and species of including t and t t narcissi responsible for green mold other fungi affect remainder of plant another botrytis fungus botrytis polyblastis sclerotinia polyblastis causes brown spots on flower buds and stems narcissus fire especially in damp weather and is a threat to cut flower industry is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates causing narcissus white mould disease peyronellaea curtisii narcissus leaf scorch also affects leaves as does its narcissi leaf tip blight narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems animals arthropods that are narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack plants narcissus bulb fly equestris and two species of hoverflies lesser bulb flies eumerus and eumerus flies lay their eggs at end of june in ground around narcissi a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs hatching larvae then burrow through soil towards bulbs and consume their interiors they then overwinter in empty bulb shell emerging in april to pupate in soil from which adult fly emerges in may larvae of some moths such as common swift moth attack narcissus bulbs other arthropods include mites such as laticeps bulb scale mite and histiostoma infest mainly stored bulbs and multiply particularly at high ambient temperature but do not attack planted bulbs planted bulbs are susceptible to nematodes most serious of which is narcissus main cause of basal plate disease in which leaves turn yellow and become misshapen infested bulbs have to be destroyed where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years other nematodes include which penetrates roots causing basal plate disease and lesion nematode main cause of root rot in narcissi other nematodes such as spp or needle nematodes and spp or dagger nematodes and stubby root nematodes or spp and spp can also act as vectors of virus diseases such as tbrv and tomrsv in addition to causing stunting of roots gastropods such as snails and slugs also cause damage to growth conservation many of smallest species have become extinct requiring vigilance in conservation of wild species narcissi are increasingly under threat by over collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism n cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered and is protected iucn red list describes five species as endangered narcissus narcissus narcissus longispathus narcissus nevadensis narcissus in 1999 three species were considered endangered five as vulnerable and six as rare in response a number of species have been granted protected species status and protected areas meadows have been established such as daffodil meadow in romania or kempley daffodil meadow in uk these areas often host daffodil festivals in spring cultivation history early illustrations of all flowering plants bulbous have been most popular for cultivation of these narcissi are one of most important spring flowering bulb plants in world indigenous in europe wild populations of parent species had been known since antiquity narcissi have been cultivated from at least as early as sixteenth century in netherlands when large numbers of bulbs where imported from field particularly narcissus hispanicus which soon became nearly extinct in its native habitat of france and spain though still found in southern part of that country only large scale production at that time related to double narcissus van sion and cultivars of n tazetta imported in 1557 cultivation is also documented in britain at this time although contemporary accounts show it was well known as a favourite garden and wild flower long before that and was used in making garlands this was a period when development of exotic formal gardens and parks was becoming popular particularly in what is known as oriental period 1560 1620 in his hortus medicus 1588 first catalogue of a german garden s plants joachim camerarius younger states that nine different types of daffodils were represented in his garden in nuremberg after his death in 1598 his plants were moved by basilius besler to gardens they had designed at bishop s palace at eichstatt upper bavaria that garden is described in besler s hortus 1613 by which time there were 43 different types present another german source at this time was peter lauremberg who gives an account of species known to him and their cultivation in his apparatus de plantis et de plantis 1632 while shakespeare s daffodil is wild or true english daffodil n pseudonarcissus many other species were introduced some of which escaped and naturalised particularly n a hybrid in devon and west of england gerard in his extensive discussion of daffodils both wild and cultivated bastard daffodils described twenty four species in london gardens 1597 we have them all and every one of them in our london gardens in great abundance p 114 in early seventeenth century parkinson helped to ensure popularity of daffodil as a cultivated plant by describing a hundred different varieties in his paradisus terrestris 1629 and introducing great double yellow spanish daffodil pseudonarcissus aureus hispanicus flore or parkinson s daffodil see illustration to england although not achieving sensationalism of tulips daffodils and narcissi have been much celebrated in art and literature largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils n poeticus and n bulbocodium and istanbul became important in shipping of bulbs to western europe by early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were an important component of spring garden by 1739 a dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties a catalog of a dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties in 1757 hill gave an account of history and cultivation of daffodil in his edited version of works of thomas hale writing garden does not afford in its kind a prettier plant than this nor do we know one that has been so early or so honorably mention d by all kinds of writers see illustration interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available primarily bunch flowered multiple flower heads n tazetta narcissus however interest varied by country maddock 1792 does not include narcissi in his list of eight most important cultivated flowering plants in england whereas in netherlands van kampen 1760 stated that n tazetta narcisse a bouquet is fifth most important le narcisse a bouquet est la premiere fleur apres les les les et les anemones dont nous avons deja parle qui merite notre attention similarly philip miller in his gardeners dictionary 1731 1768 refers to cultivation in holland flanders and france but not england because it was too difficult a similar observation was made by sir james justice at this time however for most species of narcissus lauremberg s dictum magna cura non indigent narcissi was much cited narcissi became an important horticultural crop in western europe in latter part of nineteenth century beginning in england between 1835 and 1855 and end of century in netherlands by beginning of twentieth century 50 million bulbs of n tazetta paperwhite were being exported annually from netherlands to united states with production of such as golden spur in late nineteenth century and in beginning of twentieth century like king alfred 1899 industry was well established with trumpet daffodils dominating market royal horticultural society has been an important factor in promoting narcissi holding first daffodil conference in 1884 while daffodil society first organisation dedicated to cultivation of narcissi was founded in birmingham in 1898 other countries followed and american daffodil society which was founded in 1954 publishes daffodil journal quarterly a leading trade publication narcissi are now popular as ornamental plants for gardens parks and as cut flowers providing colour from end of winter to beginning of summer in temperate regions they are one of most popular spring flowers and one of major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than area of commercial production over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers they are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn they are one of most economically important ornamental plants plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double triple or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments many of breeding programs have concentrated on corona trumpet or cup in terms of its length shape and colour and surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from n poeticus a very reduced form in gardens while some wild narcissi are specific in terms of their ecological requirements most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from addition of sand to improve drainage optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid ph of 6 5 7 0 bulbs offered for sale are referred to as either round or double nose round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at base and produce two or more flower stems but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in axil of bulb scales leading to dying off of exterior scales to prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs they can be dug up every 5 7 years and daughters separated and replanted separately provided that a piece of basal plate where rootlets are formed is preserved for daffodils to flower at end of winter or early spring bulbs are planted in autumn september november this plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil daffodils like sun but also accept partial shade exposure narcissi are well suited for planting under small thickets of trees where they can be grouped as 6 12 bulbs they also grow well in perennial borders especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as narcissi flowers are fading a number of wild species and hybrids such as dutch master golden harvest carlton kings court and yellow sun naturalise well in lawns but it is important not to mow lawn till leaves start to fade since they are essential for nourishing bulb for next flowering season blue scilla and muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at same time as narcissus make an attractive contrast to yellow flowers of latter unlike tulips narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them propagation commonest form of commercial propagation is by twin scaling in which bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with two scales still connected by a small fragment of basal plate fragments are disinfected and placed on nutrient media some 25 35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years micropropagation methods are not used for commercial production but is used for establishing commercial stock breeding for commercial use varieties with a minimum stem length of 30 cm are sought making them ideal for cut flowers florists require blooms that only open when they reach retail outlet for garden plants objectives are to continually expand colour palette and to produce hardy forms and there is a particular demand for miniature varieties cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than wild types main species used in breeding are n bulbocodium n cyclamineus n jonquilla n poeticus n pseudonarcissus n serotinus and n tazetta n pseudonarcissus gave rise to trumpet cultivars with coloured tepals and corona while its subspecies n pseudonarcissus subsp bicolor was used for white varieties to produce large cupped varieties n pseudonarcissus was crossed with n poeticus and to produce small cupped varieties back crossed with n poeticus varieties often called are mainly hybrids of n poeticus and n tazetta classification thumb range of narcissus cultivars for horticultural purposes all narcissus cultivars are split into 13 divisions as first described by kington 1998 for royal horticultural society rhs based partly upon flower form shape and length of corona number of flowers per stem flowering period and partly upon genetic background division 13 which includes wild daffodils is exception to this scheme classification is a useful tool for planning planting most commercially available narcissi come from divisions 1 trumpet 2 large cupped and 8 tazetta growers register new daffodil cultivars by name and color with royal horticultural society which is international registration authority for genus their international daffodil register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable most recent supplement 2014 is sixth fifth was published in 2012 more than 27 000 names were registered as of 2008 and number has continued to grow registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 w w thalia in horticultural usage it is common to also find an unofficial division 14 miniatures which although drawn from other 13 divisions have their miniature size in common over 140 varieties have gained royal horticultural society s award of garden merit see list of award of garden merit narcissus colour code thumb right narcissus geranium 8 w o daffodil breeding has introduced a wide range of colours in both outer perianth tepal segment and inner corona in registry daffodils are coded by colours of each of these two parts thus geranium tazetta division 8 as illustrated here with a white outer perianth and orange corona is classified as 8 w o toxicity pharmacology all narcissus species contain alkaloid poison lycorine mostly in bulb but also in leaves members of monocot subfamily amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids alkaloids which are 4 derivatives combined with tyrosine they are responsible for poisonous properties of a number of species over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known of which 79 or more are known from narcissus alone toxic effects of ingesting narcissus products for both humans and animals such as cattle goats pigs and cats have long been recognised and they have been used in suicide attempts ingestion of n pseudonarcissus or n jonquilla is followed by salivation acute abdominal pains nausea vomiting and diarrhea then neurological and cardiac events including trembling convulsions and paralysis death may result if large quantities are consumed toxicity of narcissus varies with species n poeticus being more toxic than n pseudonarcissus for instance distribution of toxins within plant also varies for instance there is a five times higher concentration of alkaloid in stem of n papyraceus than in bulb making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume stem than bulb and is part of plant s defence mechanisms distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants including roses rice and cabbages inhibiting growth for instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens life of latter poisoning many cases of poisoning or death have occurred when narcissi bulbs have been mistaken for leeks or onions and cooked and eaten recovery is usually complete in a few hours without any specific intervention in more severe cases involving ingestion of large quantities of bulbs activated carbon salts and laxatives may be required and for severe symptoms intravenous atropine and emetics or stomach pumping may be indicated however ingestion of large quantities accidentally is unusual because of a strong unpleasant taste when narcissi were compared with a number of other plants not normally consumed by animals narcissi were most repellent specifically n pseudonarcissus consequently narcissus alkaloids have been used as repellents and may also discourage fungi molds and bacteria on 1 may 2009 a number of schoolchildren fell ill at primary school in martlesham heath suffolk england after a daffodil bulb was added to soup during a cookery class topical effects one of most common dermatitis problems for flower pickers packers florists and gardeners daffodil itch involves dryness fissures scaling and erythema in hands often accompanied by hyperkeratosis thickening of skin beneath nails it is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in sap either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction it has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others n pseudonarcissus and cultivars grande ornatus princeps and scilly white are known to do so if bulb extracts come into contact with wounds both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from n bulbocodium uses traditional medicine despite lethal potential of narcissus alkaloids they have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints including cancer plants thought to be n poeticus and n tazetta are described in bible in treatment for what is thought to be cancer in classical greek world hippocrates ca b c 460 370 recommended a prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors a practice continued by pedanius dioscorides ca a d 40 90 and soranus of ephesus a d 98 138 in first and second centuries a d while roman pliny elder a d 23 79 advocated topical use bulbs of n poeticus contain antineoplastic agent narciclasine this usage is also found in later arabian north african central american and chinese medicine during middle ages in china n tazetta var chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine these bulbs contain pretazettine an active antitumor compound narcissus products have received a variety of other uses roman physician aulus cornelius celsus listed narcissus root in de medicina among medical herbs described as emollient and powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of body n tazetta bulbs were used in turkey as a remedy for abscesses in belief they were and analgesic other uses include application to wounds strains painful joints and various local ailments as an ointment called powdered flowers have also been used medically as an emetic a decongestant and for relief of dysentery in form of a syrup or infusion french used flowers as an arabs oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac in eighteenth century irish herbal of john k recommended pounding roots in honey for use on burns bruises dislocations and freckles and for drawing out thorns and splinters n tazetta bulbs have also been used for contraception while flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy a homeopathic medicine made from bulbs was prescribed for bronchitis and whooping cough in traditional japanese medicine of kampo wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste plant however does not appear in modern kampo herb list there is also a long history of use of narcissus as a stimulant and to induce trance like states and hallucinations sophocles referred to narcissus as chaplet of infernal gods a statement frequently wrongly attributed to socrates see antiquity biological properties extracts of narcissus have demonstrated a number of potentially useful biological properties including antiviral induction antibacterial antifungal antimalarial insecticidal cytotoxic antitumor antiplatelet emetic acetylcholine esterase inhibitory pheromone plant growth inhibitor and allelopathic an ethanol extract of narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of para benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction but not in another hot plate test most of these properties are due to alkaloids but some are also due to binding lectins most studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine lycorine narciclasine and pretazettine it is likely that traditional use of narcissi for treatment of cancer was due to presence of constituents such as narciclasine and their congeners n poeticus contains about 0 of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs acetylcholine esterase inhibition has attracted most interest as a possible therapeutic intervention with activity varying by a between species and greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or rodent repellant properties of narcissus alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more vulnerable bulbs therapeutics thumb daffodils growing in wales of all alkaloids only galantamine has made it to therapeutic use in man as drug galantamine for alzheimer s disease galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses blood brain barrier and is active within central nervous system daffodils are grown commercially near brecon in powys wales to produce galantamine commercial uses throughout history scent of narcissi has been an important ingredient of perfumes a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids narcissi are also an important horticultural crop and source of cut flowers floriculture thumb daffodil production in netherlands netherlands which is most important source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production of 16 700 hectares ha under cultivation for flower bulbs narcissi account for about 1 800 hectares in 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million sixth in size after tulips gladioli irises crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third about two thirds of area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of most popular varieties in 2009 2010 season 470 cultivars were produced on 1578 ha by far largest area cultivated is for miniature tete a tete followed at some distance by carlton largest production cultivars are shown in table ii table ii area under cultivation in netherlands by cultivar cultivar ha tete a tete 6 carlton 2 large bridal crown 4 yellow 51 dutch master 1 jetfire 6 orange 42 ice follies 2 large cup carlton and ice follies division 2 large cup have a long history of cultivation together with dutch master and golden harvest 1 yellow carlton and golden harvest were introduced in 1927 and ice follies in 1953 carlton with over 9000 million bulbs 350 000 tons is among more numerous individual plants produced in world other major areas of production are united states israel which exported 25 million n tazetta cultivar bulbs in 2003 and united kingdom in united kingdom a total of 4100 ha were planted with bulbs of which 3800 ha were narcissi uk s most important bulb crop much of which is for export making this largest global production centre about half of total production area while some of production is for forcing most is for dry bulb production bulb production and forcing occurs in east while production in south west is mainly for outdoor flower production farm gate value was estimated at ps10m in 2007 thumb narcissi growing at keukenhof production of both bulbs and cut flowers takes place in open fields in beds or ridges often in same field allowing adaptation to changing market conditions narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates compared to united kingdom harsher winters in netherlands require covering fields with straw for protection areas with higher rainfall and temperatures are more susceptible to diseases that attack crops production is based on a 1 uk or 2 netherlands year cycle optimal soil ph is 6 0 7 5 prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place such as immersion at 44 4 degc for three hours bulbs are harvested for market in summer sorted stored for 2 3 weeks and then further disinfected by a hot 43 5 degc bath this eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes bulbs are then dried at a high temperature and then stored at 15 5 degc initiation of new flower development in bulb takes place in late spring before bulbs are lifted and is completed by mid summer while bulbs are in storage optimal temperature for initiation is 20 degc followed by cooling to 13 degc traditionally sales took place in daffodil fields prior to harvesting bulbs but today sales are handled by marketing boards although still before harvesting in netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display while individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail which are only available at wholesale usually at a minimum of several hundredweight most famous display is at keukenhof although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there forcing there is also a market for forced blooms both as cut flowers and potted flowers through winter from christmas to easter long season requiring special preparation by growers cut flowers for cut flowers bulbs larger than 12 cm in size are preferred to bloom in december bulbs are harvested in june to july dried stored for four days at 34 degc two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17 20 degc and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15 16 weeks bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13 degc 15 degc and blooms appear in 19 30 days potted flowers for potted flowers a lower temperature is used for precooling 5 degc for 15 weeks followed by 16 degc 18 degc in a greenhouse for later blooming mid and late forcing bulbs are harvested in july to august and higher temperatures are omitted being stored a 17 20 degc after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9 degc in september for 17 18 cut flowers or 14 16 potted flowers weeks bulbs can then be planted in cold frames and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements narcissus tazetta n tazetta and its cultivars are an exception to this rule requiring no cold period often harvested in october bulbs are lifted in may and dried and heated to 30 degc for three weeks then stored at 25 degc for 12 weeks and planted flowering can be delayed by storing at 5 degc 10 degc culture symbols thumb n triandrus thalia considered a grave flower daffodil is national flower of wales associated with saint david s day march 1 narcissus is also a national flower symbolising new year or in iranian culture in west narcissus is perceived as a symbol of vanity in east as a symbol of wealth and good fortune while in persian literature narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes in western countries daffodil is also associated with spring festivals such as lent and its successor easter in germany wild narcissus n pseudonarcissus is known as or easter bell in united kingdom daffodil is sometimes referred to as lenten lily rarely especially ecclesiastical usage as here or dialect particularly scottish although prized as an ornamental flower some people consider narcissi unlucky because they hang their heads implying misfortune white narcissi such as n triandrus thalia are especially associated with death and have been called grave flowers in ancient greece narcissi were planted near tombs and robert herrick describes them as portents of death an association which also appears in myth of persephone and underworld art antiquity thumb demeter and persephone surrounded by daffodils demeter rejoiced for her daughter was by her side decorative use of narcissi dates as far back as ancient egyptian tombs and frescoes at pompeii they are mentioned in king james version of bible as rose of sharon and make frequent appearances in classical literature greek culture narcissus appears in two graeco roman myths that of youth narcissus who was turned into flower of that name and of goddess persephone snatched into underworld by god hades while picking flowers narcissus is considered sacred to both hades and persephone and to grow along banks of river styx in underworld greek poet mentioned them in cypria amongst flowers of cyprus legend of persephone comes to us mainly in seventh century bc homeric hymn to demeter where author describes narcissus and its role as a lure to trap young persephone flower she recounts to her mother was last flower she reached for before being seized other greek authors making reference to narcissus include sophocles and plutarch sophocles in oedipus at utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner implying fertility allying it with cults of demeter and her daughter kore persephone and by extension a symbol of death jebb comments that it is flower of imminent death with its fragrance being narcotic emphasised by its pale white colour just as persephone reaching for flower heralded her doom youth narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death plutarch refers to this in his symposiacs as numbing nerves causing a heaviness in limbs he refers to sophocles crown of great goddesses which is source of english phrase chaplet of infernal gods incorrectly attributed to socrates a passage by describes fragrant narcissi homer in his odyssey described underworld as having elysian meadows carpeted with flowers thought to be narcissus as described by theophrastus asphodel of greek underworld has been variously associated with white asphodelus or yellow lutea previously classified as asphodelus luteus a similar account is provided by lucian describing flowers in underworld myth of youth narcissus is also taken up by pausanias he believed that myth of persephone long antedated that of narcissus and hence discounts idea flower was named after youth roman culture virgil first known roman writer to refer to narcissus does so in several places for instance twice in georgics virgil refers to cup shaped corona of narcissus flower allegedly containing tears of self loving youth narcissus milton makes a similar analogy and fill their cups with tears virgil also mentions narcissi three times in eclogues poet ovid also dealt with mythology of narcissus in his metamorphoses he recounts story of youth narcissus who after his death is turned into flower and it is also mentioned in book 5 of his poem fasti this theme of metamorphosis was broader than just narcissus for instance see crocus laurel and hyacinth western culture although there is no clear evidence that flower s name derives directly from greek myth this link between flower and myth became firmly part of western culture narcissus or daffodil is most loved of all english plants and appears frequently in english literature many english writers have referred to cultural and symbolic importance of narcissus no flower has received more poetic description except rose and lily with poems by authors from john gower shakespeare milton see roman culture above wordsworth shelley and keats frequently poems deal with self love derived from ovid s account gower s reference to yellow flower of legend has been assumed to be daffodil or narcissus though as with all references in older literature to flower that sprang from youth s death there is room for some debate as to exact species of flower indicated some preferring crocus spenser announces coming of daffodil in aprill of his shepheardes calender 1579 shakespeare who frequently uses flower imagery refers to daffodils twice in winter s tale and also two noble kinsmen robert herrick alludes to their association with death in a number of poems among english romantic movement writers none is better known than william wordsworth s short 1804 poem i wandered lonely as a cloud which has become linked in popular mind with daffodils that form its main image wordsworth also included daffodil in other poems yet description given of daffodils by his sister dorothy is just as poetic if not more so just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of first section of homeric hymn to demeter see greek culture above among their contemporaries keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing joy for ever more recently a e housman using one of daffodil s more symbolic names see symbols wrote lent lily in a shropshire lad describing traditional easter death of daffodil in black narcissus godden describes disorientation of english nuns in indian himalayas and gives plant name an unexpected twist alluding both to narcissism and effect of perfume narcisse noir caron on others novel was later adapted into 1947 british film of same name narcissus also appears in german literature such as that of paul gerhardt in visual arts narcissi are depicted in three different contexts mythological narcissus persephone floral art or landscapes narcissus story has been popular with painters and youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association persephone theme is also typified by waterhouse in his narcissus floral motif by van and landscape by van gogh s undergrowth narcissi first started to appear in western art in late middle ages in panel paintings particularly those depicting crucifixion for instance that of meister in koln in museum cologne where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in resurrection because they are perennial and bloom at easter eastern cultures in chinese culture narcissus tazetta subsp chinensis chinese sacred lilies which can be grown indoors is widely used as an ornamental plant it was probably introduced to china by arab traders travelling silk road prior to song dynasty for medicinal use spring flowering they became associated with chinese new year signifying good fortune prosperity and good luck and there are many legends in chinese culture associated with narcissus in contrast to west narcissi have not played a significant part in chinese garden art however zhao in southern song dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to japanese bonsai japanese novel contains many references to narcissus where main characters set out for famed narcissus fields on awaji island islamic culture narcissi are one of most popular garden plants in islamic culture prior to arab conquest of persia persian ruler khosrau i is said to have not been able to tolerate them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes an association that persists to this day

from dutch cars daf daffodil to swedish rock bands daffodils to slurs against homosexuals and cross dressers as in film j edgar when hoover s mother explains why real life cross dresser barton pinkus was called daffy short for daffodil and equivalent of a pansy and admonishes i d rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son festivals in some areas where narcissi are prevalent their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals for instance slopes around montreux switzerland and its associated riviera come alive with blooms each may may snow at annual narcissi festival festivals are also
