guadalcanal campaign also known as battle of guadalcanal and codenamed operation watchtower by american forces was a military campaign fought between 7 august 1942 and 9 february 1943 on and around island of guadalcanal in pacific theater of world war ii it was first major offensive by allied forces against empire of japan on 7 august 1942 allied forces predominantly united states marines landed on guadalcanal tulagi and florida in southern solomon islands with objective of denying their use by japanese to threaten allied supply and communication routes between united states australia and new zealand powerful american and australian naval forces supported these landings allies also intended to use guadalcanal and tulagi as bases in supporting a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize major japanese base at rabaul on new britain japanese defenders who had occupied those islands since may 1942 were outnumbered and overwhelmed by allies who captured tulagi and florida as well as airfield later named henderson field that was under construction on guadalcanal surprised by allied offensive japanese made several attempts between august and november to retake henderson field three major land battles seven large naval battles five nighttime surface actions and two carrier battles and almost daily aerial battles culminated in decisive naval battle of guadalcanal in early november with defeat of last japanese attempt to bombard henderson field from sea and to land enough troops to retake it in december japanese abandoned their efforts to retake guadalcanal and evacuated their remaining forces by 7 february 1943 in face of an offensive by u s army s xiv corps guadalcanal campaign was a significant strategic allied combined arms victory in pacific theater while battle of midway was a crushing defeat of imperial japanese navy it did not stop japanese offensives which continued both at sea and on ground victories at milne bay buna gona and guadalcanal marked allied transition from defensive operations to strategic initiative in theater leading to offensive campaigns in solomon islands new guinea and central pacific which resulted in surrender of japan ending

australia and hawaii or u s west coast those efforts were thwarted at naval battles of coral sea and midway respectively coral sea was a tactical stalemate but a strategic allied victory which became clear only much later midway was not only allies first clear major victory against japanese it significantly reduced offensive capability of japan s carrier forces but did not change their offensive mindset for several crucial months in which they compounded mistakes by moving ahead with brash even brazen decisions such as attempt to assault port moresby over kokoda trail up to this point allies

solomons as part of operation cartwheel after japanese withdrawal guadalcanal and tulagi were developed into major bases supporting allied advance further up solomon islands chain besides henderson field two additional fighter runways were constructed at lunga point and a bomber airfield was built at koli point extensive naval port and logistics facilities were established at guadalcanal tulagi and florida anchorage around tulagi became an important advanced base for allied warships and transport ships supporting solomon islands campaign major ground units were staged through large encampments and barracks on guadalcanal before deployment further up solomons u s navy building navy s bases in world war ii pp 246 256 after guadalcanal japanese were clearly on defensive in pacific constant pressure to reinforce guadalcanal had weakened japanese efforts in other theaters contributing to a successful australian and american counteroffensive in new guinea which culminated in capture of key bases of buna and gona in early 1943 allies had gained a strategic initiative which they never relinquished in june allies launched operation cartwheel which after modification in august 1943 formalized strategy of isolating rabaul and cutting its sea lines of communication subsequent successful neutralization of rabaul and forces centered there facilitated south west pacific campaign under general douglas macarthur and central pacific island hopping campaign under admiral chester nimitz with both efforts successfully advancing toward japan remaining japanese defenses in south pacific area were then either destroyed or bypassed by allied forces as war progressed hough p 374 zimmerman p 166 significance resources battle of guadalcanal was one of first prolonged campaigns in pacific ocean theater of world war ii it strained logistical capabilities of combatant nations for u s this need prompted development of effective combat air transport for first time a failure to achieve air supremacy forced japan to rely on reinforcement by barges destroyers and submarines with very uneven results early in campaign americans were hindered by a lack of resources as they suffered heavy losses in cruisers and carriers with replacements from ramped up shipbuilding programs still months away from materializing murray p 215 hough p 372 thumb left henderson field in august 1944 u s navy suffered such high personnel losses during campaign that it refused to publicly release total casualty figures for years however as campaign continued and american public became more and more aware of plight and perceived heroism of american forces on guadalcanal more forces were dispatched to area this spelled trouble for japan as its military industrial complex was unable to match output of american industry and manpower thus as campaign wore on japanese were losing irreplaceable units while americans were rapidly replacing and even augmenting their forces murray p 215 hough p 372 guadalcanal campaign was costly to japan strategically and in material losses and manpower roughly 30 000 personnel including 25 000 experienced ground troops died during campaign as many as three quarters of deaths were from non combat causes such as starvation and various tropical diseases drain on resources directly contributed to japan s failure to achieve its objectives in new guinea campaign japan also lost control of southern solomons and ability to interdict allied shipping to australia japan s major base at rabaul was now further directly threatened by allied air power most importantly scarce japanese land air and naval forces had disappeared forever into guadalcanal jungle and surrounding sea japanese could not replace aircraft and ships destroyed and sunk in this campaign as well as their highly trained and veteran crews especially naval aircrews nearly as quickly as allies hough p 350 strategy while battle of midway is viewed as a turning point in pacific war japan remained on offensive as shown by its advances down solomon islands only after allied victories in guadalcanal and new guinea at milne bay and buna gona dean 2013 p 236 keogh 1965 p 249 james

for defensive actions against japanese expansion in order to focus resources on defeating germany however admiral king s argument for guadalcanal invasion as well as its successful implementation convinced president franklin d roosevelt that pacific theater could be pursued offensively as well hornfischer neptune s inferno pp 11 15 by end of 1942 it was clear that japan had lost guadalcanal campaign a serious blow to japan s strategic plans for defense of their empire and an unanticipated defeat at hands of americans miller p 350 shaw p 52 alexander p 81 perhaps as important as military victory for allies was psychological victory on a level playing field allies had beaten japan s best land air and naval forces after guadalcanal allied personnel regarded japanese military with much less fear and awe than previously in addition allies viewed eventual outcome of pacific war with greatly increased optimism murray p express no longer has terminus on guadalcanal major general
