he renounces his obsessions and promises to live happily ever after with eva themes thumb upright cover of adventures of captain hatteras one of novels invoked in play play s most prominent thematic inspiration is verne s voyages extraordinaires series which it freely invokes and refers to in addition to plot elements taken from journey to center of earth twenty thousand leagues under sea from earth to moon and around moon character of doctor ox reappears from short story dr ox s experiment mr tartelet is derived from a character in school for robinsons and hero georges is described as son of captain hatteras from adventures of captain hatteras at same time plot of play sets it distinctly apart from rest of verne s work while his novels are based on meticulously researched facts and plausible conjectures and often end with an ultimate goal remaining unattainable play explores potential of letting a character go beyond all plausible limits and carry out adventures in a domain of pure fantasy like many of verne s novels play is deeply imbued with themes of initiation echoing traditional mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey in journey through impossible young georges initially trapped by obsessions similar to those that drove his father mad resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which ox and volsius compete as substitute father figures both father figures are highly symbolic ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science balancing guardian angel volsius play also features an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries but also warning that it can do immense harm when in hands of unethical or overambitious given these themes play is likely verne s most purely science fictional work structurally play evokes three part design of jacques offenbach s opera tales of hoffmann in which hero must choose between love and art in journey through impossible however choice is between positive ideals love goodness happiness and unbounded scientific ambitions of sinister doctor ox use of scientific themes mark play s position at a major turning point in verne s ideology in verne s earlier works knowledgeable heroes aim to use their skills to change world for better in his later novels by contrast scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects play by exploring science in both positive and negative lights shows verne in transition between two points of view production thumb verne and d ennery also dramatized michael strogoff poster pictured while writing journey through impossible since 1863 verne had been under contract with publisher pierre jules hetzel who published each of his novels beginning with five weeks in a balloon 1863 and journey to center of earth 1864 and continuing through rest of his books to form novel sequence hetzel called voyages extraordinaires arrangement gave verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability but under terms of contract verne s profits barely earned him a living wage verne s fortunes changed markedly in 1874 when stage adaptation of his novel around world in eighty days was a smash hit running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright adapted with collaboration of showman d ennery play invented and codified piece de grand spectacle an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in paris throughout last quarter of nineteenth century verne and d ennery went on to adapt two other verne novels children of captain grant and michael strogoff as similarly spectacular plays verne began playing with idea of bringing a mixed selection of voyages extraordinaires characters together on a new adventure in early 1875 when he considered writing a novel in which samuel fergusson from five weeks in a balloon pierre from twenty thousand leagues under sea phileas fogg from around world in eighty days dr from adventures of captain hatteras and other characters would go around world together in a heavier than air flying machine another novel featuring a similar trip around world in a flying machine alphonse brown s la conquete de l air was published later that year causing verne to put idea on hold idea in highly modified form finally reemerged five years later as journey through impossible verne went to d ennery with idea in february 1880 and they collaborated in antibes for several weeks on two projects simultaneously dramatization of michael strogoff and new play of their collaborations journey through impossible was first and would be only one not based directly on a pre existing verne novel modern scholarship has not been successful in determining how much of play each of collaborators wrote but verne scholar robert has suggested that play is clearly founded on verne s ideas and therefore can be treated as being mostly work of verne according to contemporary rumors verne and d ennery came to difficulties over treatment of science in play with d ennery wanting to condemn scientific research and verne advocating a more science friendly and hopeful approach verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of script and protested when d ennery had them reinserted for production journey through impossible would be their last collaboration play is also verne s only contribution to feerie genre joseph francois dailly first actor to play role of passepartout in around world in eighty days was cast as valdemar another cast member of around world augustin guillemet alexandre played opposite him as tartelet paul felix taillade who had appeared in children of captain grant was cast as doctor ox and marie a well known feerie actress who was also mistress and muse of charles baudelaire played eva production was directed by paul cleves born paul collin director of theatre de la porte saint martin from 1879 to 1883 oscar de a prolific composer and music director wrote music for play

une piece fantastique en trois actes premiered in paris at theatre de la porte saint martin on 25 november 1882 as with previous verne d ennery collaborations journey through impossible had a gala opening night play was a pronounced box office success however critical reception was mixed in 1882 edition of les annales du theatre et de la musique edouard noel and edmond stoullig criticized play for including reactionary mysticism which seeks to elicit tears of holy water from audience noel and stoullig suspected that d ennery was to blame for mystical overtones in le temps sarcey panned play with a brief notice claiming that all other plays running that week were far more interesting and entertaining he noted innovative verne d ennery idea of using human characters of volsius and ox to represent good and evil in fantasy rather than resorting to typical good fairy and bad fairy characters in such plays but added that he didn t quite see what we ve gained by substitution parisian critic arnold mortier in a long review of play described it as beautiful and elegant and highly praised dailly s performance as valdemar but believed staging lacked originality a great deal of money went into this production but very few ideas like sarcey he commented with some asperity on metaphorical use of volsius and ox as symbols of good and evil rather than attractive young women playing good and bad fairies is it not time perhaps to return to that practice an anonymous reviewer for new york times said of play i have never seen anything more incoherent or of which dialogue is more pretentious but predicted that it would be a success because of its spectacular production values reprinted in henri de bornier gave play a brief but highly positive notice in la nouvelle revue highlighting elegance of decor and commenting verne and d ennery had done humankind a true service by exploring impossible domains on stage charles in le monde illustre praised taillade and curious nature of voyages but found play as a whole tiresome reproduced online at german jules verne club s european jules verne portal accessed 25 november 2014 on other hand two other major illustrated

portal accessed 25 november 2014 reproduced online at german jules verne club s european jules verne portal accessed 25 november 2014 auguste gave play a largely positive review praising actors decor and use of verne s ideas but expressed doubts about wisdom of combining so many disparate styles dramatic realism scientific fiction and pure fantasy in one production anonymous reviewers in revue politique et and revue britannique as well as victor in le and arthur in chronique de l art all wrote similarly mixed reviews speaking highly of actors and of verne s characters and concepts but saying that d ennery s dramatizations and revisions were clumsy in his 1910 history of feerie paul hailed journey through impossible for introducing a scientific element to genre and for bringing characters from verne s books to stage but sharply criticized d ennery for putting furiously outdated sentiments in mouth of character volsius journey through impossible ran for 97 performances and contributed to ongoing fame of both verne and d ennery in 1904 pioneering director georges melies freely adapted play into a film impossible voyage rediscovery play was not published in verne s
