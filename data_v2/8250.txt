hurricane debby was strongest tropical cyclone of 1982 atlantic hurricane season with winds peaking at 130 mph 215 km h fourth named storm second hurricane and only major hurricane on season debby developed near north coast of hispaniola from a westward moving tropical wave on september 13 forming as a tropical depression it headed northwestward and eventually strengthened into tropical storm debby following day thereafter debby rapidly intensified into a hurricane early on september 15 hurricane then curved northeastward and grazed bermuda as a category 2 hurricane on september 16 it continued to strengthen and by september 18 debby briefly peaked as a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds at 130 mph 215 km h and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar hpa 28 05 inhg after reaching peak intensity debby slowly weakened and was between category 2 and 1 when it passed south of newfoundland early on september 19 thereafter storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60 mph 95 km h towards east debby was rapidly approaching british isles on september 20 shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone overall impact was minor in lesser antilles with only light to moderate rainfall in dominican republic puerto rico and united states virgin islands on bermuda high winds caused some power outages and knocked over trees though damage on island was minimal in addition debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on newfoundland meteorological history a weather system moved off coast of africa on september 3 disturbance was small and became unidentifiable within 24 hours of formation satellite imagery indicated that disturbance may have acquired a circulation on september 7 but circulation was gone by next day remaining tropical wave moved into lesser antilles on september 11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed aircraft found circulation however by next day only a strong wave was detected atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development yielding lower wind shear near hispaniola for several days system moved into this area as latest reconnaissance aircraft was deployed declaring it a tropical depression on september 13 near dominican republic next reconnaissance aircraft that investigated system discovered a minimal pressure of 1005 mbar 28 67 inhg and winds of 45 mph 70 km h in depression s center prompting an upgrade to tropical storm debby on morning of september 14 uncertainty arose as to whether debby would interact with an approaching trough or enter influence of a ridge over southeastern united states storm was later picked up by trough moving away from land and moved to north debby strengthened further becoming a minimal hurricane late on september 14 hurricane deepened further reaching maximum winds of 110 mph 180 km h a category 2 storm debby approached bermuda in this time and on september 16 debby passed 80 miles 130 km west of island and continued north thumb right hurricane debby intensifying in north atlantic on september 17 debby began to slow down to 5 mph 10 km h early on september 17 as another trough in westerlies arrived and system entered it as hurricane entered trough its forward speed picked up from 5 mph 10 km h to 30 mph 50 km h during this time debby reached category 4 strength reaching a peak intensity of 130 mph 215 km h and a minimal pressure of 950 mbar 28 05 inhg early on september 19 debby passed just south of cape race newfoundland and started accelerating to east at 60 mph 100 km h on following day debby remained a tropical cyclone while crossing north atlantic ocean and weakened to a tropical storm at 0600 utc september 20 debby was rapidly approaching british isles on september 20 shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remains of debby maintained plenty of intensity over northern europe and on september 21 it struck northern parts of finland where it was named storm mauri as one of most powerful windstorms in country s recorded history winds over 90 mph 145 km h felled millions of cubic miles of forest and a storm surge severely damaged cities of kemi and tornio claiming two lives starting in 1982 season with debby hurricane hunter aircraft also known as p 3s began running a new mission for noaa s hurricane research division mission was to drop dropwindsondes that deployed very low omega frequency signals these signals were to estimate sonde s motion compared to aircraft in certain areas in a storm preparations and impact thumb left debby rainfall rainfalls from debby in puerto rico ranged between around northern end of island to in southern ridge of island rains on island peaked at 12 86 inches 326 mm in penuelas u s virgin islands reported rain of about while about of precipitation fell in dominican republic united states navy removed its 700 personnel on bermuda s air force base placing them in a gymnasium nearby thousands of tourists took last minute flights out of bermuda on september 16 as debby drew near some of airlines had pulled back number of flights going in and out of island eastern airlines dropped from five flights to two with them going to only new york city newark new jersey and boston massachusetts storm had sustained winds of 110 mph 180 km h winds and forecasters were predicting that hurricane s eye would be over island next day airlines canceled flights buildings boarded up and cruise liners were hurried out of their harbors in time before debby arrived rescue teams evacuated workers from mobil oil rigs in debby s path as it neared bermuda experienced heavy gusts of wind which caused minor damage with no injuries or fatalities power outages were reported on island though electricity was quickly restored numerous trees were knocked down on island due to high winds as storm was approaching canada some oil rigs offshore of newfoundland were evacuated and a science expedition off grand banks was discontinued onshore debby produced light rainfall in southeastern portions of newfoundland with precipitation peaking at approximately in addition a few areas experienced tropical storm
