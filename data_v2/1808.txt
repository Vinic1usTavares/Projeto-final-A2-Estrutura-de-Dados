patient and eager to please as such dogs of breed are good with children and other dogs cavaliers are not shy about socializing with much larger dogs they will adapt quickly to almost any environment family and location and suit city and country life their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as other dog is trained cavaliers rank 44th in stanley coren s intelligence of dogs being of average intelligence in working or obedience cavaliers are naturally curious and playful but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and elderly cavaliers are active and sporting cavaliers are successful in conformation shows obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet gentle natures breed is adaptable in their need for exercise happy with either sleeping on couch or taking long walks thumb breed is well known for its loving temperament they have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets and so most cavaliers will never become street wise as they tend to regard all strangers as friends members of breed will usually not make good guard dogs spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals however owners have reported that through training their cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils cavalier s coat requires weekly brushing but no trimming however some owners prefer to trim their cavalier s long feathers and slippers which can become very dirty when walking or playing outside health thumbnail alt three dogs of same breed on leads each is a different colour left dog is mostly

spaniel cavaliers can notably be prone to mitral valve disease which leads to heart failure this appears in many cavaliers at some point in their lives and is most common cause of death some serious genetic health problems including early onset mitral valve disease mvd potentially severely painful syringomyelia sm hip dysplasia luxating patellas and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed as today s cavaliers all descend from only six dogs any inheritable disease present in at least one of original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations this is known as founder effect and is likely cause of prevalence of mvd in breed coile 2008 p 69 health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease luxating patella and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia cavaliers are also affected by ear problems a common health problem among spaniels of various types and they can have such other general conditions as hip dysplasia which are common across many types of dog breeds mitral valve disease thumb cavalier king charles spaniel with bandaged paw nearly all cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen leading to heart failure this condition is polygenic affected by multiple genes and therefore all lines of cavaliers worldwide are susceptible it is leading cause of death in breed a survey by kennel club of united kingdom showed that 42 8 of cavalier deaths are cardiac related next most common causes are cancer 12 3 and old age 12 2 condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all cavalier king charles spaniels by age 5 it is rare for a 10 year old cavalier not to have a heart murmur while heart disease is common in dogs generally one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems mitral valve disease is generally as in humans a disease of old age hinge on heart s mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate along with valve s flaps causing a heart murmur as blood seeps through valve between heartbeats then congestive heart failure cavalier is particularly susceptible to early onset heart disease which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early onset mitral valve disease in breed but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines chairperson of uk club said in 2009 there are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock and of those who do it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals mvd breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2 5 years old and heart clear and their parents i e puppy s grandparents should be heart clear until age 5 syringomyelia syringomyelia sm is a condition affecting brain and spine causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis it is caused by a malformation commonly known as chiari malformation in lower back of skull which reduces space available to brain compressing it and often forcing it out it through opening into spinal cord this blocks flow of cerebral spinal fluid csf around brain and spine and increases fluid s pressure creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets or syrinxes hence term syringomyelia in spinal cord syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in cavalier king charles spaniel with international research samples in past few years consistently showing over 90 of cavaliers have malformation and that between 30 70 have syrinxes however most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85 of symptomatic dogs according to clare rusbridge a research scientist symptoms include sensitivity around head neck or shoulders often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at area of his neck or shoulder scratching is often unilateral restricted to one side of body scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with body air scratching scratching behavior appears involuntary and dog frequently scratches while walking without stopping in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching bunny hopping scratching typical of sm is usually worse when dog is wearing a collar is being walked on leash or is excited and first thing in morning or at night not all dogs with sm show scratching behavior not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to be in pain though several leading researchers including dr clare rusbridge in uk and drs curtis dewey and dominic marino in us believe scratching in sm cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to dorsal horn region of spine if onset is at an early age a first sign may be scratching and or rapidly appearing scoliosis if problem is severe there is likely to be poor proprioception awareness of body position especially with regard to forelimbs clumsiness and falling results from this problem progression is variable though majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of condition a veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites fleas and allergies and then primary secretory otitis media psom glue ear as well as spinal or limb injuries before assuming that a cavalier has sm psom can present similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat episodic falling syndrome can also present similar symptoms an mri scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of sm and also will reveal psom if a veterinarian suspects sm he or she will recommend an mri scan neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade episodic falling ef thumb right alt a puppy with red fur faces camera while looking off to left there is a streak of white down middle of its head between its eyes and it has a white chest it wears a black collar with a metal tag ruby cavalier king charles spaniel puppy episodic falling causes exercise induced paroxysmal hypertonicity meaning that there is increased muscle tone in dog and muscles cannot relax previously thought to be a muscular disorder it is now known to be neurological ef is caused by a single recessive gene and a genetic test is available except for severe cases episodes will be in response to exercise excitement or similar exertions although ef is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy which typically results in loss of consciousness dog remains conscious throughout episode severity of symptoms can range from mild occasional falling to freezing to seizure like episodes lasting hours episodes can become more or less severe as dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to attacks onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age it is similar to scotty cramp a genetic disorder in scottish terriers about 1 of cavaliers are affected by condition with 19 being carriers dogs with whole colored coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti colored coats thrombocytopenia and as many as half of all cavalier king charles spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia an abnormally low number of platelets in blood according to recent studies in denmark and united states platelets or are disk shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting excessively low numbers are most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs platelets in blood of many cavalier king charles spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized or also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of these large platelets function normally and typical cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either size or fewer numbers of its platelets hip and knee disorders hip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects cavalier king charles spaniels it is not present at birth but develops with age hip dysplasia is diagnosed by x rays but it is not usually evident in x rays of cavaliers until they mature even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia x rays may not always indicate disease in a series of evaluations by orthopedic foundation for animals cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds worst affected breeds were bulldog pug and dogue de bordeaux cavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of femur and knee called luxating patella this condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old in most serious cases surgery may be indicated grading system for patella runs from 1 a tight knee to 4 a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced if a cavalier has a grade 1 2 physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce grading and potentially avoid surgery grades 3 4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct problem to avoid development of arthritis and lameness in limb eye problems a disorder commonly found in cavaliers is colloquially known as dry eye usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against dog s lacrimal gland tear gland reducing production of tears according to canine inherited disorders database condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness this disorder can decrease or heal over time a 1999 study of cavaliers conducted by canine eye registration foundation showed that an average of 30 of all cavalier king charles spaniels evaluated had eye problems they include hereditary cataracts corneal dystrophy progressive retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia ear disorders primary secretory otitis media psom also known as glue ear consists of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills dog s middle ear and may cause tympanic membrane to bulge psom has been reported almost exclusively in cavaliers and it may affect over half of them because pain and other sensations in head and neck areas resulting from psom are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia sm some examining veterinarians have mis diagnosed sm in cavaliers which actually have psom and not sm cavalier king charles spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness which is present at birth due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in inner ear although this is relatively rare in addition more recent studies have found cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss which usually begins during puppy hood and progresses until dog is completely deaf usually between ages of three and five years progressive nature of this form of deafness in cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of hearing nerve rather than lack of formation or early degeneration of inner ear receptors urban legend an urban legend claims that charles ii issued a special decree granting king charles spaniels permission to enter any establishment in uk overriding no dog except guide dogs rules a variant of this myth relates specifically to houses of parliament this myth is sometimes instead applied to cavalier king charles spaniel uk parliament website states contrary to popular rumor there is no act of parliament referring to king charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in palace of westminster we are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it similarly there is no proof of any such law covering wider uk a spokesman for kennel club said this law has been quoted from time to time it is alleged in books that king charles made this decree but our research hasn t tracked it down see also
