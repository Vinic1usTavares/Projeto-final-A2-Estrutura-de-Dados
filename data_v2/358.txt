military when board was established in november 1937 it included fred jones minister of defence and duigan as first military member duigan offered little counter to favouring of fledgling royal new zealand air force by new zealand government of time and this affected morale within army one of duigan s most significant changes resulted in downsizing of territorial force tf which was already in a state of decline current recruitment was insufficient to support theoretical infantry division and three mounted rifle brigades that tf mobilisation plans called for duigan downsized division to a brigade group and three lots of fortress troops centred around auckland wellington and lyttelton many infantry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted as battalions while mounted regiments were each reduced to size of a squadron several senior officers were placed in retirement as well morale of tf declined as remaining senior officers raised concerns disregarded by duigan over state of army four tf colonels publicly protested reforms in press in what became known as four colonels revolt this was a breach of military regulations which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do so instead of a court martial which he feared would generate public sympathy for colonels duigan placed all four officers on retired list as punishment revolt did result in greater public awareness of poor state of new zealand s military but little was done to rectify situation second world war following outbreak of second world war duigan desired command of second new zealand expeditionary force 2nzef which was to be raised for service in europe lack of command experience and his performance as cgs meant that he was not a popular choice within military or new zealand government major general bernard freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2nzef and duigan s term as cgs was extended throughout 1940 duigan worked to ensure continued support and reinforcement of 2nzef and oversaw reintroduction of conscription he also attended defence conferences in singapore and india and made tours of 2nzef while it was in middle east later life
