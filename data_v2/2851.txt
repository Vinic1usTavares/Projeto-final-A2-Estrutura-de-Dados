production on short began when hayley atwell agreed to reprise her role from captain america first avenger hayley atwell as peggy carter an ssr agent forced to work in data analysis and code breaking since end of world war ii carter reprises her role from captain america first avenger on character starring in her own short film director louis d esposito said that marvel always wanted to do a peggy carter short since character was a fan favorite and a marvel studios favorite d esposito enjoyed moment when carter uses her compact to view bad guy which was ad libbed during filming because that s essence of what she s about and what film s about not only is she especially in that time a woman in a man s world she still maintains her femininity bradley whitford as john flynn carter s ssr boss dominic cooper as howard stark co head and founder of s h i e l d cooper reprises his role from captain america first avenger in short as an easter egg stark is seen wearing same robe that his son

footage from first avenger shane black director and co writer of iron man 3 voices disembodied voice caller on other end of case line production development in august 2011 marvel studios announced that a couple of short films would be released direct to video which were designed to be self contained stories and known as marvel one shots co producer brad winderbaum said it s a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas but more importantly it s a way for us to expand marvel cinematic universe and tell stories that live outside plot of our features one of ideas developed as a potential one shot was a spin off from captain america first avenger following story of peggy carter after events of that film idea was looked at again when marvel was deciding on a short film to produce for home media release of iron man 3 in 2013 and it was chosen for spot dependent on actress hayley atwell s availability marvel studios co president louis d esposito who directed previous one shot item 47 returned as director while writer eric pearson also returned from previous one shots d esposito noted that short had twice budget of item 47 but same amount of shooting time so scope of it is much bigger it s set in a period there are more actors involved scale s bigger there are three fight scenes we ve never had that in any of previous one shots atwell agreed to project after watching item 47 and due to her love for character and potential to show off some of her skill sets that were not seen in film atwell worked for three days with stunt team to rehearse pre choreographed fight sequences for short d esposito elaborated on decision to focus on carter saying it s telling best story and finding that story we want to tell whether it s connectivity to marvel universe or it s highlighting a character in case of hayley it s a little bit of both we wanted to tell peggy carter s story she s been left back in 40s announcing to world that she was running s h i e l d with howard stark is a great connectivity filming agent carter was filmed over five days with gabriel beristain serving as cinematographer budget did not allow for a storyboard artist to be hired so d esposito winderbaum and beristain worked together to plan a shot list for production using stand in actors stunts were also pre filmed to show actors d esposito explained that having shots planned helped with planning visual effects for film mid credits scene with neal mcdonough as dum dum dugan was planned to show character in a pool but had to be changed on set to taking place beside pool when it was found that muscle suit mcdonough wears to portray character could not get wet d esposito chose to differentiate short from first avenger by avoiding sepia tone used for that film by director joe johnston instead using a cooler blue color production used two old lenses for both night and day that gave short some better lens flares that d esposito felt gave period setting a more modern feel d esposito used a steadicam or a camera dolly for action sequences to avoid a quick cutty or blurry or shaky feel d esposito said that crew was ultimately pushing our limit to get planned shots on schedule and he eventually realized that he wasn t going to get every shot and i wasn t going to get every punch and kick so what we do is get optimum post production visual effects shots of 1940s new york from captain america first avenger were reused in short for budgetary reasons d esposito noted sequence where carter comes flying with gun into door and last fight when carter is being attacked by big guy were both created with visual effects elements after they ran out of time to complete filming on them on set in early 2013 marvel approached visual effects company perception to create main on end title sequence for short visual effects supervisor sheena duggal was told to retell story of short in 90 seconds so she decided to use stylized versions of imagery from period and short itself a mixture of 2d and 3d animation was used to achieve a final 2d look music composer christopher lennertz who previously collaborated with d esposito on one shot item 47 composed music for agent carter like rest of short d esposito wanted music to reflect period setting but to have a modern feel to it as well so he sent lennertz johnny rivers secret agent man as a reference track despite it having been released in 1960s since it had feel and sentiment d esposito was looking for release agent carter was first shown in full at 2013 san diego comic con international it was then released on iron man 3 home media first on september 3 2013 in digital download form and then on blu ray disc and 3d blu ray on september 24 2013 d esposito said that it was decided to release short along with iron man 3 because time was right with iron man 3 home media being released before opening of captain america winter soldier in theaters it is also included on bonus disc of marvel cinematic universe phase two collection box set which includes all of phase two films in marvel cinematic universe as well as other marvel one shots collection features audio commentary from d esposito and atwell and was released on december 8 2015 reception rosie fletcher of total film noted that short was well received by audience at comic con and praised atwell s performance she said short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments andy hunsaker at crave online gave short a score of 8 5 out of 10 calling it a fun treat that gives its title character send off she deserves and hoping that it would lead to further female focused properties from marvel ign s scott collura called atwell big screen female superhero we ve all been waiting for she kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb using not just brawn but also brains and it s all very clever and fun he felt short seemed more of a proof of concept that female based superhero projects could work but that atwell never loses touch with her feminine side either movie ramblings review of short highlighted its short sharp and witty script mixed with some equally sharp action and d esposito s direction naming it best marvel one shot at that point flickering myth called short a great effort a nice compact story that gives us a lot of great moments with character reviewer felt flynn made a great foil to carter and also noted great cameos and a post credit scene that should put a smile on everybody s face agent carter is another great marvel offering that shows how committed they are to idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine short won golden reel award for best sound music editing direct to video live action television series marvel s agent carter a
