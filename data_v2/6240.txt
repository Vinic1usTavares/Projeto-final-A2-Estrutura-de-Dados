jared leto said that while recording in wyoming there was an interesting dichotomy a kind of contradiction with technology and organic world that we were surrounded it s something that i think ended up in music ezrin helped band to understand importance of an album s structure and how to create a progression rather than a simple series of singles we really wanted to create something that had depth leto explained he described process of working with ezrin as tumultuous but also fulfilling having its own dynamics he also stated that virtue was a key element in helping band define their sound track fallen originally titled jupiter was first to be produced for album thirty seconds to mars initially thought to exclude track from record since they were not satisfied with it but then

tendencies ryan rayhill from blender found album befitting prog rock prototypes rush and opined that thirty seconds to mars emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like tool on dark side of moon referring to 1973 album by pink floyd lyrics and themes 30 seconds to mars is a concept album focusing on human struggle and self determination it deals with characters who battle with social alienation emotional isolation and political malaise title itself 30 seconds to mars indicates accelerated human society and suggests a potential escapism from it album s lyrics describe personal human experience through use of metaphors and moments of fantasy jared leto regarded it as a very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation he cited human struggle as most inspiring source for band and explained that record features a definite desire for change for renewal for a new beginning and ultimately for escape author karin lowachee commented that leto who wrote most of lyrics allows listener to draw his or her own conclusions to meanings of songs she noted that this makes music especially personal as whatever images you conjure from sound and words can be interpreted by your own inner language opening track capricorn a brand new name deals with a desire for renewal leto however stated that he prefers to let listener take its own understanding and meaning from song claiming that interpretation from individual to individual is one of most interesting aspects of music track fallen faces necessity to escape from inner world that every person has created for itself lyrics of oblivion originally titled reckoning lead into a frantic threat in which unity divides division will unite leto described this paradox as a rather common but unfortunate occurrence a dramatic narration drives buddha for mary whose story is not about a specific person and represents a metaphor end of beginning features a foreboding tone and emphasizes human nature in constant search for something album ends with hidden track struggle whose lyrics were taken from ancient chinese military treatise art of war
