daddy did you remember to clean yourself however standards still objected so it was changed to its current version stewie is seen practicing for olympics and is disturbed by chris this scene was originally meant to be start of a subplot in which stewie would build a machine to make chris intelligent although it would be successful chris would become more clever than stewie subplot was scrapped because it was deemed not funny enough gag in which peter is a landlord over a rat family in griffin family basement was removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes thinking
