little boy was codename for type of atomic bomb dropped on japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945 during world war ii it was first nuclear weapon used in warfare bomb was dropped by boeing b 29 superfortress enola gay piloted by colonel paul w tibbets jr commander of 509th composite group of united states army air forces and captain robert a lewis it exploded with an energy of approximately and caused widespread death and destruction throughout city hiroshima bombing was second man made nuclear explosion in history after trinity test little boy was developed by lieutenant commander francis birch s group at manhattan project s los alamos laboratory during world war ii a development of unsuccessful thin man nuclear bomb like thin man it was a gun type fission weapon but it derived its explosive power from nuclear fission of uranium 235 whereas thin man was based on fission of plutonium 239 fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium bullet onto a solid cylinder of same material target by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder it contained of enriched uranium although less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of complete design after war ended it was not expected that inefficient little boy design would ever again be required and many plans and diagrams were destroyed however by mid 1946 hanford site reactors began suffering badly from wigner effect dislocation of atoms in a solid caused by neutron radiation and plutonium became scarce so six little boy assemblies were produced at sandia base navy bureau of ordnance built another 25 little boy assemblies in 1947 for use by lockheed p2v neptune nuclear strike aircraft which could be launched from midway class aircraft carriers all little boy units were withdrawn from service by end of january 1951 naming physicist robert serber named first two atomic bomb designs during world war ii based on their shapes thin man and fat man thin man was a long thin device and its name came from dashiell hammett detective novel and series of movies about thin man fat man was round and fat so it was named after kasper gutman a rotund character in hammett s novel maltese falcon played by sydney greenstreet in film version little boy was named by others as an allusion to thin man since it was based on its design development because uranium 235 was known to be fissionable it was first material pursued in approach to bomb development as first design developed as well as first deployed for combat it is sometimes known as mark i vast majority of work came in form of isotope enrichment of uranium necessary for weapon since uranium 235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium enrichment was performed at oak ridge tennessee where electromagnetic separation plant known as y 12 became fully operational in march 1944 first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to los alamos laboratory in june 1944 most of uranium necessary for production of bomb came from shinkolobwe mine and was made available thanks to foresight of ceo of high katanga mining union edgar sengier who had of uranium ore transported to a new york warehouse in 1940 at least part of in addition to uranium ore and uranium oxide captured by alsos mission in 1944 and 1945 went to oak ridge for enrichment as did of uranium oxide captured on japan bound after germany s surrender in may 1945 thumb as part of project alberta commander a francis birch left assembles bomb while physicist norman ramsey watches this is one of rare photos where inside of bomb can be seen little boy was a simplification of thin man previous gun type fission weapon design thin man long was designed to use plutonium so it was also more than capable of using enriched uranium thin man design was abandoned after experiments by emilio g segre and his p 5 group at los alamos on newly reactor produced plutonium from oak ridge and hanford site showed that it contained impurities in form of isotope plutonium 240 this has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than cyclotron produced plutonium on which original measurements had been made and its inclusion in reactor bred plutonium needed for bomb making due to quantities required appeared unavoidable this meant that background fission rate of plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely plutonium would predetonate and blow itself apart in initial forming of a critical mass in july 1944 almost all research at los alamos was redirected to implosion type plutonium weapon overall responsibility for uranium gun type weapon was assigned to captain william s parsons s ordnance o division all design development and technical work at los alamos was consolidated under lieutenant commander francis birch s group in contrast to plutonium implosion type nuclear weapon and plutonium gun type fission weapon uranium gun type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop a plutonium bomb it would still be possible to use gun principle gun type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only and this allowed thin man design to be greatly simplified a high velocity gun was no longer required and a simpler weapon could be substituted simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a b 29 bomb bay design specifications were completed in february 1945 and contracts were let to build components three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of complete design gun and breech were made by naval gun factory in washington d c target case and some other components by naval ordnance plant in center line michigan and tail fairing and mounting brackets by expert tool and die company in detroit michigan bomb except for uranium payload was ready at beginning of may 1945 manhattan district engineer kenneth nichols expected on 1 may 1945 to have uranium 235 for one weapon before august 1 and a second one sometime in december assuming second weapon would be a gun type designing an implosion bomb for uranium 235 was considered and this would increase production rate uranium 235 projectile was completed on 15 june and target on 24 july target and bomb pre assemblies partly assembled bombs without fissile components left hunters point naval shipyard california on 16 july aboard heavy cruiser arriving on 26 july target inserts followed by air on 30 july although all of its components had been tested no full test of a gun type nuclear weapon occurred before little boy was dropped over hiroshima only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion type device employing plutonium as its fissile material and took place on 16 july 1945 at trinity nuclear test there were several reasons for not testing a little boy type of device primarily there was little uranium 235 as compared with relatively large amount of plutonium which it was expected could be produced by hanford site reactors additionally weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with gun type assembly unlike implosion design which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges gun type design was considered almost certain to work though little boy incorporated various safety mechanisms an accidental detonation was nonetheless possible for example should bomber carrying device crash then hollow bullet could be driven into target cylinder detonating bomb or at least releasing massive amounts of radiation tests showed that this would require a highly unlikely impact of 500 times force of gravity another concern was that a crash and fire could trigger explosives if immersed in water uranium components were subject to a neutron moderator effect which would not cause an explosion but would release radioactive contamination for this reason pilots were advised to crash on land rather than at sea design thumb gun assembly method when hollow uranium projectile was driven onto target cylinder a nuclear explosion resulted little boy was in length in diameter and weighed approximately design used gun method to explosively force a hollow sub critical mass of uranium 235 and a solid target cylinder together into a super critical mass initiating a nuclear chain reaction this was accomplished by shooting one piece of uranium onto other by means of four cylindrical silk bags of cordite bomb contained of enriched uranium most was enriched to 89 but some was only 50 uranium 235 for an average enrichment of 80 less than a kilogram of uranium underwent nuclear fission and of this mass only was transformed into several forms of energy mostly kinetic energy but also heat and radiation assembly details inside weapon uranium 235 material was divided into two parts following gun principle projectile and target projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60 of total mass it consisted of a stack of nine uranium rings each in diameter with a bore in center and a total length of pressed together into front end of a thin walled projectile long filling in remainder of space behind these rings in projectile was a tungsten carbide disc with a steel back at ignition projectile slug was pushed along long smooth bore gun barrel slug insert was a cylinder in length with a axial hole slug comprised 40 of total fissile mass insert was a stack of six washer like uranium discs somewhat thicker than projectile rings that were slid over a rod this rod then extended forward through tungsten carbide tamper plug impact absorbing anvil and nose plug backstop eventually protruding out of front of bomb casing this entire target assembly was secured at both ends with when hollow front projectile reached target and slid over target insert assembled super critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel both materials having a combined mass of neutron initiators at base of projectile were activated by impact center counter intuitive design for first fifty years after 1945 every published description and drawing of little boy mechanism assumed that a small solid projectile was fired into center of a larger stationary target however critical mass considerations dictated that in little boy larger hollow piece would be projectile assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium 235 this required one of two pieces to have more than one critical mass with larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with neutron reflecting tungsten carbide tamper a hole in center of larger piece dispersed mass and increased surface area allowing more fission neutrons to escape thus preventing a premature chain reaction but for this larger hollow piece to have minimal contact with tamper it must be projectile since only projectile s back end was in contact with tamper prior to detonation rest of tungsten carbide surrounded sub critical mass target cylinder called insert by designers with air space between it and insert this arrangement packs maximum amount of fissile material into a gun assembly design fuze system thumb arming plugs for a little boy type atomic bomb on display at national air and space museum s steven f udvar hazy center fuzing system was designed to trigger at most destructive altitude which calculations suggested was it employed a three stage interlock system a timer ensured that bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release one quarter of predicted fall time to ensure safety of aircraft timer was activated when electrical pull out plugs connecting it to airplane pulled loose as bomb fell switching it to internal 24v battery power and starting timer at end of 15 seconds bomb would be from aircraft and radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to barometric stage purpose of barometric stage was to delay activating radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude a thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber a similar design is still used today in old fashioned wall barometers gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate bomb at precise ignition height because air pressure varies with local conditions when bomb reached design height for this stage reportedly membrane closed a circuit activating radar altimeters barometric stage was added because of a worry that external radar signals might detonate bomb too early two or more redundant radar altimeters were used to reliably detect final altitude when altimeters sensed correct height firing switch closed igniting three buord mod 1 navy gun primers in breech plug which set off charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing two pounds of wm slotted tube cordite this launched uranium projectile towards opposite end of gun barrel at an eventual muzzle velocity of approximately 10 milliseconds later chain reaction occurred lasting less than 1 microsecond radar altimeters used were modified u s army air corps aps 13 tail warning radars nicknamed archie normally used to warn a fighter pilot of another plane approaching from behind rehearsals thumb little boy in bomb pit on tinian island before being loaded into enola gays bomb bay a section of bomb bay door is visible on top right little boy pre assemblies were designated l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 and l 11 l 1 l 2 l 5 and l 6 were expended in test drops first drop test was conducted with l 1 on 23 july 1945 it was dropped over sea near tinian in order to test radar altimeter by b 29 later known as big stink piloted by colonel paul w tibbets commander of 509th composite group two more drop tests over sea were made on 24 and 25 july using l 2 and l 5 units in order to test all components tibbets was pilot for both missions but this time bomber used was one subsequently known as l 6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 july b 29 next objective piloted by major charles w sweeney flew to iwo jima where emergency procedures for loading bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced this rehearsal was repeated on 31 july but this time l 6 was reloaded onto a different b 29 enola gay piloted by tibbets and bomb was test dropped near tinian l 11 was assembly used for hiroshima bomb bombing of hiroshima parsons enola gays weaponeer was concerned about possibility of an accidental detonation if plane crashed on takeoff so he decided not to load four cordite powder bags into gun breech until aircraft was in flight parsons and his assistant second lieutenant morris r jeppson made their way into bomb bay along narrow catwalk on port side jeppson held a flashlight while parsons disconnected primer wires removed breech plug inserted powder bags replaced breech plug and reconnected wires before climbing to altitude on approach to target jeppson switched three safety plugs between electrical connectors of internal battery and firing mechanism from green to red bomb was then fully armed jeppson monitored bomb s circuits thumb left mushroom cloud over hiroshima after dropping of little boy bomb was dropped at approximately 08 15 jst 6 august 1945 after falling for 44 4 seconds time and barometric triggers started firing mechanism detonation happened at an altitude of it was less powerful than fat man which was dropped on nagasaki but damage and number of victims at hiroshima were much higher as hiroshima was on flat terrain while hypocenter of nagasaki lay in a small valley according to figures published in 1945 66 000 people were killed as a direct result of hiroshima blast and 69 000 were injured to varying degrees of those deaths 20 000 were members of imperial japanese army exact measurement of yield was problematic since weapon had never been tested president harry s truman officially announced that yield was this was based on parsons s visual assessment that blast was greater than what he had seen at trinity nuclear test since that had been estimated at speech writers rounded up to 20 kilotons further discussion was then suppressed for fear of lessening impact of bomb on japanese data had been collected by luis alvarez harold agnew and lawrence h johnston on instrument plane great artiste but this was not used to calculate yield at time after hostilities ended a survey team from manhattan project that included william penney robert serber and george t reynolds was sent to hiroshima to evaluate effects of blast from evaluating effects on objects and structures penney concluded that yield was 12 1 kilotons later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons in 1953 frederick reines calculated yield as 15 kilotons this figure became official yield project ichiban in 1962 scientists at los alamos created a mockup of little boy known as project ichiban in order to answer some of unanswered questions but it failed to clear up all issues in 1982 los alamos created a replica little boy from original drawings and specifications this was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion a hydraulic lift was used to move projectile and experiments were run to assess neutron emission based on this and data from great artiste yield was estimated at 16 6 0 3 kilotons after considering many estimation methods a 1985 report concluded that yield was 15 kilotons 20 physical effects thumb left general effects of atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki a us air force film after being selected in april 1945 hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target where effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed while damage could be studied later energy yield of untested little boy design could be determined only at moment of detonation using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with one that dropped bomb radio transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons comparing this yield to observed damage produced a rule of thumb called 5 psi lethal area rule approximately 100 of people inside area where shock wave carries an overpressure of 5 psi or greater would be killed at hiroshima that area was in diameter damage came from three main effects blast fire and radiation blast blast from a nuclear bomb is result of x ray heated air fireball sending a shock wave or pressure wave in all directions initially at a velocity greater than speed of sound analogous to thunder generated by lightning knowledge about urban blast destruction is based largely on studies of little boy at hiroshima nagasaki buildings suffered similar damage at similar distances but nagasaki bomb detonated from city center over hilly terrain that was partially bare of buildings thumb frame house in 1953 nuclear test 5 psi overpressure in hiroshima almost everything within of point directly under explosion was completely destroyed except for about 50 heavily reinforced earthquake resistant concrete buildings only shells of which remained standing most were completely gutted with their windows doors sashes and frames ripped out perimeter of severe blast damage approximately followed contour at later test explosions of nuclear weapons with houses and other test structures nearby confirmed 5 psi overpressure threshold ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed toppled or gutted by force of air pressure picture at right shows effects of a nuclear bomb generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in nevada in 1953 a major effect of this kind of structural damage was that it created fuel for fires that were started simultaneously throughout severe destruction region fire first effect of explosion was blinding light accompanied by radiant heat from fireball hiroshima fireball was in diameter with a surface temperature of near ground zero everything flammable burst into flame one famous anonymous hiroshima victim sitting on stone steps from hypocenter left only a shadow having absorbed fireball heat that permanently bleached surrounding stone simultaneous fires were started throughout blast damaged area by fireball heat and by overturned stoves and furnaces electrical shorts etc twenty minutes after detonation these fires had merged into a firestorm pulling in surface air from all directions to feed an inferno which consumed everything flammable thumb hiroshima blast and fire damage u s strategic bombing survey map hiroshima firestorm was roughly in diameter corresponding closely to severe blast damage zone see ussbs map right blast damaged buildings provided fuel for fire structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about debris choked roads obstructed fire fighters broken gas pipes fueled fire and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless at nagasaki fires failed to merge into a single firestorm and fire damaged area was only one fourth as great as at hiroshima due in part to a southwest wind that pushed fires away from city as map shows hiroshima firestorm jumped natural firebreaks river channels as well as prepared firebreaks spread of fire stopped only when it reached edge of blast damaged area encountering less available fuel accurate casualty figures are impossible to determine because many victims were cremated by firestorm along with all record of their existence manhattan project report on hiroshima estimated that 60 of immediate deaths were caused by fire but with caveat that many persons near center of explosion suffered fatal injuries from more than one of bomb effects in particular many fire victims also received lethal doses of nuclear radiation radiation local fallout is dust and ash from a bomb crater contaminated with radioactive fission products it falls to earth downwind of crater and can produce with radiation alone a lethal area much larger than that from blast and fire with an air burst fission products rise into stratosphere where they dissipate and become part of global environment because little boy was an air burst above ground there was no bomb crater and no local radioactive fallout however a burst of intense neutron and gamma radiation came directly from fireball its lethal radius was covering about half of firestorm area an estimated 30 of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation but died in firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent over 6 000 people survived blast and fire but died of radiation injuries among injured survivors 30 had radiation injuries from which they recovered but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk to date no radiation related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among survivors children conventional weapon equivalent although little boy exploded with energy equivalent of 16 000 tons of tnt strategic bombing survey estimated that same blast and fire effect could have been caused by 2 100 tons of conventional bombs 220 b 29s carrying 1 200 tons of incendiary bombs 400 tons of high explosive bombs and 500 tons of anti personnel fragmentation bombs since target was spread across a two dimensional plane vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted a cluster bomb pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy efficient match to target post war thumb one of five casings built for little boy bomb used on hiroshima on display at imperial war museum in london during 2015 when war ended it was not expected that inefficient little boy design would ever again be required and many plans and diagrams were destroyed however by mid 1946 hanford site reactors were suffering badly from wigner effect faced with prospect of no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for initiators for cores that had already been produced director of manhattan project major general leslie r groves ordered that some little boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found no little boy assemblies were available and no comprehensive set of diagrams of little boy could be found although there were drawings of various components and stocks of spare parts at sandia base three army officers captains albert bethel richard meyer and bobbie griffin attempted to re create little boy they were supervised by harlow w russ an expert on little boy who served with project alberta on tinian and was now leader of z 11 group of los alamos laboratory s z division at sandia gradually they managed to locate correct drawings and parts and figured out how they went together eventually they built six little boy assemblies although casings barrels and components were tested no enriched uranium was supplied for bombs by early 1947 problem caused by wigner effect was on its way to solution and three officers were reassigned navy bureau of ordnance built 25 little boy assemblies in 1947 for use by nuclear capable lockheed p2v neptune aircraft carrier aircraft which could be launched from but not land on midway class aircraft carriers components were produced by naval ordnance plants in pocatello idaho and louisville kentucky enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets although there were only enough initiators for six all little boy units were withdrawn from service by end of january 1951 smithsonian institution displayed a little boy complete except for enriched uranium until 1986 department of energy took weapon from museum to remove its inner components so bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material government returned emptied casing to smithsonian in 1993 three other disarmed bombs are on display in united states another is at imperial war museum in london notes references this report can also be found here and here this
