monowai is a volcanic seamount to north of new zealand it is formed by a large caldera and a volcanic cone just south southeast from caldera volcanic cone rises to depths of up to but its depth varies with ongoing volcanic activity including sector collapses and growth of lava domes seamount and its volcanism were discovered after 1877 but only in 1980 was it named monowai after a research ship of same name subduction of pacific plate beneath australia plate has given rise to volcanic and hydrothermal activity on kermadec ridge that monowai is part of volcano is located at site where osbourn trough and louisville seamount chain subduct in tonga trench and this subduction process probably has influenced its volcanism monowai is one of most active volcanoes in kermadec volcanic arc with many eruptions since 1977 and perhaps most active submarine volcano in world volcanic activity is characterised by emission of gas and discolouration of water along with seismic activity and a substantial growth rate of volcano ongoing hydrothermal activity has also been observed and hydrothermal vents on monowai feature a rich variety of fauna discovery and research history volcanic activity at monowai was discovered between 1877 and 1924 and a shoal was first noted in 1944 although this may constitute a misinterpreted pumice raft or disturbance of water monowai was first recognized to be a volcano in 1977 and was named in 1980 after research ship caldera was discovered only in 2004 volcano has been dredged and further investigated by submersibles pisces v and and various research cruises it is also informally known as orion seamount geography and structure regional monowai lies at northern end of kermadec arc north of new zealand in southwestern pacific ocean about halfway between tonga and kermadec islands kermadec arc is southern part of about long tonga kermadec arc this volcanic arc contains about 12 volcanic islands and at least 37 submarine volcanoes which occur about every many of these volcanoes were only recently discovered and are poorly studied hydrothermal activity has been observed at many osbourn trough and louisville seamount chain are being subducted close to monowai and might have influenced development of seamount and of volcanic arc and back arc in general monowai is one of most active volcanoes in kermadec arc two other active volcanoes are raoul island and rumble iii while clark rumble v healy brothers volcano w macauley and are hydrothermally active local monowai is a large volcano which consists of a wide conical stratovolcano that rises from tonga kermadec ridge in a part of ocean with a depth of to a depth of less than below sea level exact depth of summit is subject to changes owing to ongoing volcanic activity this activity is also responsible for frequent changes of its morphology with up to height variation recorded between surveys made in 1998 2004 and 2007 recent volcanic activity has smoothed slopes of monowai volcano and covered them with lapilli sand and scoria in some places migration of summit vent has formed a long ridge at top of monowai and aligned vents and radial ridges occur on its slopes as well to its north northeast lies a large and deep caldera which is elongated in northwest southeast direction monowai volcano as a whole has a similar elongation caldera appears to consist of two nested calderas outer of which is largest in northern kermadec arc with a surface area of although an origin as one single long lived caldera is also possible this caldera is largest in kermadec volcanic arc rim of caldera lies at a depth of about parasitic cones occur around caldera and a cone is also found within inner caldera and appears to be an about high resurgent dome additional cones can be found on caldera floor which is covered by sediments on mussel ridge a ridge located within caldera and close to its southwestern margin seafloor observations have found cemented volcanic ash dispersed rocks mud pillow lavas pillow tube lavas and talus another about high cone is situated between monowai cone and caldera both monowai cone and monowai caldera rise from a lava shield and entire volcanic complex covers an area of about hydrothermal activity including venting at temperatures of less than occurs at mussel ridge where a number of low temperature vents can be found additional venting occurs on monowai main cone and on satellite vents on its flanks deep hydrothermal plumes hint at additional vents at greater depths in addition to true hydrothermal fluids slopes of monowai are sources of non hydrothermal plumes that probably originate from landslides or when material is remobilized by eruptions geology subduction of pacific plate beneath australian plate occurs at a rate of at a rate that decreases towards south and is responsible for volcanism in kermadec arc behind trench back arc spreading takes place at a rate of also with a southwards decreasing tendency other volcanic centres close to monowai are centre about south southwest and u volcanic centre about farther north less than north lies volcano 19 which has erupted basaltic andesite and is hydrothermally active basement that monowai volcano is constructed on may be same as one underpinning rest of kermadec ridge compacted miocene to oligocene volcanic sediments above an eocene volcanic arc which in area of monowai form a graben structure a number of faults that occur west of volcano relate to developing graben and additional faults dissect volcano including ring faults that surround caldera faults that dissect monowai volcano have strikes and trends comparable to these of other volcanoes in central kermadec arc kermadec arc has been active for past 1 million years about 5 6 million years ago lau havre backarc trough opened up and separated kermadec arc from colville lau arc where volcanic activity ceased about 5 3 5 million years ago subduction of louisville seamount chain appears to have altered behaviour of backarc since north of subducting area lau basin is undergoing full fledged seafloor spreading while havre trough south of subducting area only features short rift segments composition monowai has erupted rocks ranging from andesite and basaltic andesite both mainly around caldera to basalt which makes up bulk of monowai cone dredged samples contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene olivine and plagioclase and define a mainly mafic rock suite which is unusual for a large caldera ultimately magmas originate from partial melting of mantle wedge beneath australian plate and mixing of water rich and water poor melts in a magma chamber magma evolution processes occurring in magma chamber at temperatures of eventually yielded andesites from a basaltic parental melt on mussel ridge hydrothermal alteration of rocks has produced a number of minerals like alunite amorphous silica anhydrite chalcopyrite cristobalite magnetite marcasite pyrite smectite and native sulfur in some places volcanic rocks have been entirely replaced by alteration products rocks have also been observed biology hydrothermal vents on mussel ridge features a rich life characterised by anemones crabs crustaceans fish mussels polychaetes shrimps sponges and tube worms mussel beds can be so thick that seafloor disappears below them fish and mussels have been observed on monowai cone as well and rhizocephalan parasitic barnacles have been found at certain unspecified vents chemicals by monowai volcano are used by microbes to produce organic material through a process known as chemosynthesis and these microbes are a food source for animals additionally phytoplankton has been observed to grow after eruptions when fallout from monowai fertilises waters eruption history chronology of volcanic activity at monowai is largely unknown given absence of available dating it is not known for example whether two nested calderas formed during same eruption however parasitic cones appear to be older than caldera and main monowai cone and most of volcanic complex probably formed within last 780 000 years formation of caldera most likely occurred in a fashion and regional tectonic processes may be involved caldera formation was probably followed by formation of resurgent dome and cone between monowai cone and caldera with a trend towards more explosive activity present day activity occurs at top of monowai cone and manifests itself in form of earthquakes discoloured water emission of gases and pumice rafts rumbling sounds and upwelling water underwater this activity generates cones debris flows lava flows and pyroclastic flows as well as sector collapses and lava dome growth which have caused summit of monowai cone to shift southward a number of seismic swarms have been observed on monowai including a strong swarm in may 2002 that may be associated with a sector collapse and sound waves from volcano have been recorded as far aways as ascension island in atlantic ocean monowai volcano is a fast growing edifice with growth rates ranging between monowai s magma output rate reaches during some periods and exceeds that of many oceanic volcanoes such as hawaii this fast growth is accompanied by cyclical landslides and sector collapses that redistribute material down its slopes these landslides while much smaller than comparable landslides at other volcanoes appear to occur at a very high frequency such submarine landslides can lead to tsunamis there is however no evidence for tsunamis triggered by eruptions at monowai volcano early observations of volcanic activity at monowai occurred in 1977 and 1978 last eruption sequence may have occurred in october 2014 or may 2016 when pumice rafts and water discolouration were observed respectively both events were accompanied by seismic episodes which indicate that between april 2014 and january 2017 there were about two eruptions per month
