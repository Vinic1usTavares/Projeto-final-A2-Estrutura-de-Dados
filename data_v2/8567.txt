and so forth much as a parent would do if asked to get some help in house in mid 1980s landy stated of wilson i influence all of his thinking i m practically a member of band we re partners in life

somebody he can go anywhere on his own anytime he wants an august 1988 issue of rolling stone states following even though beach boys had hired landy part of regimen involved cutting wilson s contact from group as landy reasoned you can t deal with people who only want to use you wilson said that dr landy doesn t like me to be in touch with my family too much he thinks it s unhealthy for example brian remembered participating in an interview with his brother carl wilson and interviewer asked carl what it was between him and me he goes well brian and i don t have to talk to each other we re just beach boys but we don t need to be friends and that s true although whenever i think about him i feel rotten in 1986 wilson met his future wife and manager melinda ledbetter a cadillac saleswoman and former model while browsing through a car dealership six months after meeting wilson she had reported landy to state s attorney general who informed her that nothing could be done without cooperation of wilson s family ledbetter felt that family had been at their rope s end with wilson and that they did not know what to do to help him she said that three years into their relationship

to his fee landy received 25 of copyright to all of wilson s songs regardless of whether he contributed to them or not which band manager tom hulett explained was an incentive for landy to reignite wilson s drive it was sort of like gee there s nothing coming in now if you can go make this person well to go create some income landy expressed similar views saying that i would share in future songwriting royalties in 84 was like me telling you i ll pay you a million dollars if you can get up and fly around room this arrangement was revoked in 1985 with landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions landy reported that he never received any money since wilson had not published any material before pact was voided afterward wilson paid landy a salary of

equally and share any profits from recordings films soundtracks or books landy was then credited as co writer and executive producer for wilson s debut solo album brian wilson released in 1988 co producer russ disparaged landy s role in album s creation calling him disruptive and anti creative wilson s cousin and bandmate mike love denied landy s claims that beach boys were preventing wilson from participating on their recordings and believed that reason landy encouraged wilson to pursue a solo career was to destroy us then he would be sole custodian of brian s career and legacy landy maintained that his songwriting collaborations on brian wilson earned him less than 50 000 for publishing of wilson s autobiographic memoir wouldn t it be nice my own story landy stood to earn 30 of its proceeds book glorifies landy and its contents were challenged for plagiarism landy denied accusations that he was involved as a ghostwriter wilson later distanced himself from book in a 1995 court case wilson s lawyers argued that harpercollins were aware that wilson s statements in book were either manipulated or written by landy state intervention action was taken against landy s professional practice as a result of beach boys and wilson family s struggles for control a former nurse and girlfriend of wilson s brought landy to state s attention in 1984 state was then aided by journals written by songwriter gary usher during a ten month collaboration with wilson these journals depicted wilson as a virtual captive dominated by landy who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through wilson by this time wilson had become landy s only patient in february 1988 state of california board of medical quality charged landy with ethical and license code violations stemming from improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient along with wilson s psychological dependency on landy landy denied allegations but later admitted to one of seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to wilson landy surrendered his psychological license complying with an agreement made with state of california and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for next two years an august 1988 board meeting with beach boys had landy promising that brian would reconnect with group which love says was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against california authorities we never wrote letter and brian s public behavior continued to unsettle landy and his colleagues said that his treatment of wilson ended in february 1988 at request of state attorney general s office but deputy attorney who drafted complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request nor was office advised that they sever landy s relationship with wilson co producers of wilson s solo album said they witnessed no changes and landy s assistants remained with wilson sol samuels said this was because landy had little direct involvement with wilson s treatment and that it was instead people landy hired who continued to regulate wilson s medication according to songwriter p f sloan landy took advantage of sloan s disappearance and claimed at one point to be real p f sloan he explains that it was an attempt by landy to gain credibility and appease members of medical community who were questioning why landy felt that he was an appropriate songwriting collaborator for wilson conservatorship hearings thumb upright brian was granted a restraining order against landy shortly after concerns were brought to his brother carl pictured 1983 peter reum a therapist who met wilson while attending a beach boys fan convention in 1990 was alarmed by wilson s demeanor and speculated that he may be suffering from tardive dyskinesia a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of antipsychotic medication reum phoned biographer david leaf who then reported reum s observations to carl wilson it was then discovered that landy had been named as a chief beneficiary in a 1989 revision of brian s will collecting 70 with remainder split between his girlfriend and brian s two daughters this discovery was made by kay gilmer a publicist employed by landy in march 1990 she phoned gary usher to explain why his messages were not being returned to which usher warned if landy knows that you re calling me he d kill you he d literally kill you gilmer left her job two weeks later taking expired drug bottles as well as names phone numbers and bank account information that she later turned over to california board of medical quality assurance aided by gilmer s findings brian s cousin stan love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on may 17 1990 a press conference with stan at lectern featured an unexpected appearance from brian while reading from a piece of paper brian was given a microphone and said i have heard of charges made by stan love and i think they are outrageous which means they are out of ballpark i feel great carl carnie and wendy wilson then contested landy s control of brian pursuing legal action on may 7 1991 ruling was finalized on february 3 1992 when landy was barred by court order from contacting brian leaving his affairs to hands of conservator jerome s billet in december 1992

which landy is portrayed by paul giamatti these events are told from point of view of wilson s then girlfriend melinda ledbetter landy s son evan disputed film s accuracy believing that his father was unfairly portrayed mike love commented that evan s account was very interesting because you get an intimate look at someone who was with brian every day for a few years although he had not watched film he also said that it overstated ledbetter s role in stopping treatment screenwriter oren stated that virtually everything in 1980s portions was sourced from conversations he had with ledbetter he felt that landy was most difficult character to write for even though many things that he says in movie i actually have recording of in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over top giamatti said he prepared for role by meeting landy s early career acquaintances and listening to hours of tapes where he d just keep talking and talking in these completely huge paragraphs they were brilliant sounding but if you dug into them they didn t make much sense personal life and death landy had one son in early 1960s evan landy after 1990s landy continued a psychotherapeutic practice with licensure in new mexico and hawaii up until his death he died aged 71 on march 22 2006 in honolulu hawaii of pneumonia while suffering from lung cancer legacy in 1995 music producer don was commented that wilson was so different from his public image as a drug burnout or of someone catatonic and propped up by a greedy psychologist i knew landy i was around for tail end of it and i saw some gray in there he wasn t just this evil guy who took over brian when asked what his reaction to landy s death had been wilson responded i was devastated in 2015 wilson reflected i thought he was my friend but he was a very fucked up man and also i still feel that there was benefit i try to overlook bad stuff and be thankful for what he taught me references bibliography further reading
