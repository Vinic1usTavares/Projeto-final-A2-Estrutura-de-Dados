there are 24 named waterfalls in ricketts glen state park in u s state of pennsylvania along kitchen creek as it flows in three steep narrow valleys or glens they range in height from 9 feet 2 7 m to 94 foot 29 m ganoga falls ricketts glen state park is named for r bruce ricketts a colonel in american civil war who owned over 80 000 acres 32 000 ha in area in late 19th and early 20th centuries but spared old growth forests in glens from clearcutting park which opened in 1944 is administered by bureau of state parks of pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources dcnr nearly all of waterfalls are visible from falls trail which ricketts had built from 1889 to 1893 and which state park rebuilt in 1940s and late 1990s falls trail has been called most magnificent hike in state and one of top hikes in east young p 66 waterfalls are on section of kitchen creek that flows down allegheny front a steep escarpment between allegheny plateau to north and ridge and valley appalachians to south glens are made of sedimentary rocks from huntley mountain and catskill formations that formed up to 370 million years ago in devonian and carboniferous periods waterfalls are result of increased flow in kitchen creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during last ice age ricketts named 21 of waterfalls mostly for native american tribes and places and his family and friends there are ten named falls in ganoga glen eight named falls in glen leigh and between four and six named waterfalls in ricketts glen dcnr names 22 falls united states geological survey usgs

ricketts glen state park are on allegheny front which is boundary between allegheny plateau to north and ridge and valley appalachians to south headwaters of kitchen creek are on dissected plateau from which stream drops approximately 1 000 feet 300 m in 2 25 miles 3 62 km as it flows down steep escarpment of allegheny front much of this drop occurs in glen leigh and ganoga glen two narrow valleys carved by branches of kitchen creek which come together at waters meet branch in glen leigh has eight named waterfalls and lies north of confluence while branch in ganoga glen has ten named waterfalls and lies to northwest ricketts glen lies south of and downstream from waters meet here terrain becomes less steep and there are fewer named waterfalls dcnr names only four in ricketts glen all on kitchen creek usgs gnis names these and one more on creek and brown s book on pennsylvania waterfalls adds a sixth named falls on a tributary brown pp 50 52 rocks exposed in park were formed between 370 and 340 million years ago when land was part of coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now north america high mountains to east of sea gradually eroded causing a build up of sediment made up primarily of clay sand and gravel tremendous pressure on sediment caused formation of rocks that are found in park and in kitchen creek drainage basin sandstone shale siltstone and conglomerates thumb left 200px upright alt a large waterfall cascades down a near vertical rock face composed of many layers lush green vegetation surrounds falls with dappled sunlight at top erie falls cascades 47 feet 14 m over many layers of sedimentary rock in ganoga glen about 300 to 250 million years ago allegheny plateau allegheny front and appalachian mountains all formed in orogeny this happened long after sedimentary rocks in park were deposited when part of gondwana that became africa collided with what became north america forming pangaea in years since up to 5 000 feet 1 500 m of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather at least three major glaciations in past million years have been final factor in shaping land that makes up park today shultz pp 372 374 391 399 818 effects of glaciation have made kitchen creek unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down allegheny front as it is only one with an almost continuous series of waterfalls prior to last ice age kitchen creek and phillips creek to east had drainage basins of similar area and slope and both watersheds were confined to allegheny front this changed when receding glaciers formed temporary dams on two of kitchen creek s neighboring streams on allegheny plateau south branch bowman creek to northeast and big run a tributary of fishing creek to northwest headwaters of south branch bowman creek were very close to those for glen leigh branch of kitchen creek and headwaters for big run were very close to those for ganoga glen branch as glaciers retreated to northeast about 20 000 years ago glacial lakes formed drainage from melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway or channel that diverted headwaters of south branch bowman creek into glen leigh branch of kitchen creek retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20 to 30 feet 6 1 to 9 1 m thick which formed a dam blocking water from draining into big run instead water from ganoga lake and area that later became lake jean was diverted into ganoga glen branch of kitchen creek these diversions added about 7 square miles 18 km2 to kitchen creek drainage basin increasing it by just over 50 percent to 20 1 square miles 52 km2 result was increased water flow in kitchen creek which has been cutting falls in glens since gradient or slope of kitchen creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin as phillips creek still does increased basin size means that kitchen creek in glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow as kitchen creek continues to cut into rock and erode it up allegheny front creek s slope will decrease and become less steep in future creek s flow and slope are predicted to become similar to those of other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins this process could take so long that a new glacial period might occur before transformation is complete formations and falls thumb alt a diagram shows light blue water

mountain formation from late devonian and early mississippian this is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale lower and older layer is catskill formation which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370 million years old harder huntley mountain formation caps allegheny front and has kept it from eroding as much as softer catskill formation to south portions of allegheny front within park are named north mountain and red rock mountain with latter name coming from an exposed band of huntley formation red shale and sandstone visible along

park this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of huntley mountain formation sandstone in bridal veil falls second type water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in stream bed below within park this type of falls flows over catskill formation rocks or red shale and sandstone of huntley formation in park harder caprock which forms ledge from which bridal veil falls drops is grey sandstone softer red shale below is eroded away by water sand and gravel to form plunge pool while official ricketts glen state park web page also classifies waterfalls as either bridal veil or wedding cake type brown s pennsylvania waterfalls a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types for classification falls cascade slide and chute first falls is same as dcnr s bridal veil type with water that falls freely from a ledge brown divides wedding cake class into three types cascade where water falls down a vertical to nearly vertical surface that has terraces slide where water falls down a near vertical to less than vertical wide surface that is smoother than a cascade and chute where water is confined by rock as it falls down a narrow slide or feature

disease and warfare with five nations of iroquois and by 1675 they had died out moved away or been assimilated into other tribes after this lands of susquehanna valley were under nominal control of iroquois who encouraged displaced tribes from east to settle there including shawnee and lenape or delaware richter pp 3 46 on november 5 1768 british acquired land known in pennsylvania as new

controlled or owned more than 80 000 acres 32 000 ha including glens and waterfalls ricketts and other settlers living in area were not aware of glens and their waterfalls until about 1865 when they were discovered by two of ricketts guests who went fishing and wandered down kitchen creek in 1872 ricketts built a three story wooden addition to stone house this opened as north mountain house hotel

in 1881 based on a suggestion by pennsylvania senator charles r buckalew ricketts also used name ganoga for tallest waterfall and glen it flows through in 1889 ricketts hired matt hirlinger and five other men to build trails along kitchen creek it took them four years to complete trails and stone steps through glens wooden addition to stone house was torn down in 1897 and hotel and fishing club closed in 1903 stone house remained ricketts summer home ricketts was a lumberman who made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land but glens were saved from lumberman s axe through foresight of ricketts family ricketts died in 1918 between 1920 and 1924 pennsylvania game commission bought 48 000 acres 19 000 ha from his heirs via central pennsylvania lumber company this became most of

trail past adams falls was built at this time in 1969 glens natural area was named a national natural landmark and it became a pennsylvania state park natural area in 1993 which guarantees it will be protected and maintained in a natural state in 1996 heavy rains washed out two bridges on falls trail because of difficulty of transporting materials on trail an army national guard helicopter dropped 36 foot 11 m poles into glens to rebuild bridges in early 1997 in winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in ganoga glen section of park for first time that same year local fire companies trained to rescue people injured in park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them treacherous in 1998 a four year project to repair and improve falls trail began with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize trail fix steps reduce erosion and repair some bridges in 2001 john young in hike pennsylvania an atlas of pennsylvania s greatest hiking adventures wrote of falls
