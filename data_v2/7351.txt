paralympic games or paralympics are a periodic series of international multi sport events involving athletes with a range of disabilities including impaired muscle power e g paraplegia and quadriplegia muscular dystrophy post polio syndrome spina bifida impaired passive range of movement limb deficiency e g amputation or dysmelia leg length difference short stature hypertonia ataxia athetosis vision impairment and intellectual impairment there are winter and summer paralympic games which since 1988 summer olympics in seoul south korea are held almost immediately following respective olympic games all paralympic games are governed by international paralympic committee ipc paralympics has grown from a small gathering of british world war ii veterans in 1948 to become one of largest international sporting events by early 21st century paralympics has grown from 400 athletes with a disability from 23 countries in 1960 to thousands of competitors from over 100 countries at 2012 summer olympics paralympians strive for equal treatment with non disabled olympic athletes but there is a large funding gap between olympic and paralympic athletes paralympic games are organized in parallel with olympic games while ioc recognized special olympics world games include athletes with intellectual disabilities and include deaf athletes world games for deaf and paralympic games international committee of sports for deaf december olympics and olympic movement official website of special olympics 2006 given wide variety of disabilities that paralympic athletes have there are several categories in which athletes compete allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types categories are impaired muscle power impaired passive range of movement limb deficiency leg length difference short stature hypertonia ataxia athetosis vision impairment and intellectual impairment these categories are further broken down into classifications which vary from sport to sport forerunners thumb right sir ludwig guttmann athletes with disabilities did compete at olympic games prior to advent of paralympics first athlete to do so was german american gymnast george eyser in 1904 who had one artificial leg hungarian karoly takacs competed in shooting events in both 1948 and 1952 summer olympics he was a right arm amputee and could shoot left handed another disabled athlete to appear in olympics prior to paralympic games was lis hartel a danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in dressage event depauw and gavron 2005 p 38 first organized athletic day for disabled athletes that coincided with olympic games took place on day of opening of 1948 summer olympics in london united kingdom jewish german born dr ludwig guttmann of stoke mandeville hospital who had been helped to flee nazi germany by council for assisting refugee academics cara in 1939 hosted a sports competition for british world war ii veteran patients with spinal cord injuries first games were called 1948 international wheelchair games and were intended to coincide with 1948 olympics dr guttman s aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to olympic games games were held again at same location in 1952 and dutch and israeli veterans took part alongside british making it first international competition of its own kind these early competitions also known as stoke mandeville games have been described as precursors of paralympic games milestones there have been several milestones in paralympic movement first official paralympic games no longer open solely to war veterans was held in rome in 1960 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at 1960 games since 1960 paralympic games have taken place in same year as olympic games galligan 2000 pp 89 90 games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs at 1976 summer games athletes with different disabilities were included for first time at a summer paralympics with inclusion of more disability classifications 1976 summer games expanded to 1 600 athletes from 40 countries 1988 summer paralympics in seoul was another milestone for paralympic movement it was in seoul that paralympic summer games were held directly after 1988 summer olympics in same host city and using same facilities this set a precedent that was followed in 1992 1996 and 2000 it was eventually formalized in an agreement between international paralympic committee ipc and international olympic committee ioc in 2001 depauw and gavron 2005 p 92 and was extended through 2020 on march 10 2018 two committees further extended their contract to 2032 1992 winter paralympics were first winter games to use same facilities as winter olympics winter games first winter paralympic games were held in 1976 in ornskoldsvik sweden this was first paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete winter games were celebrated every four years on same year as their summer counterpart just as olympics were this tradition was upheld until 1992 games in albertville france after that beginning with 1994 games winter paralympics and winter olympics have been held in those even numbered years separate from summer olympics international paralympic committee thumb left alt

and not their disability recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability movement has grown dramatically since its early days for example number of athletes

name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries and olympic inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate present formal explanation for name is that it derives from greek preposition para para beside or alongside and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with olympic games summer games of 1988 held in seoul was first time term paralympic came into official use spirit in motion is motto for paralympic movement symbol for paralympics contains three colours

international olympic committee ioc and international paralympic committee ipc signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both olympic and paralympic games initially agreed to remain in effect until 2012 summer olympics this has since been extended encompassing all summer and winter games up until 2020 summer olympics even beyond this all summer and winter host cities currently announced are preparing pairs of olympic and paralympics games this was further confirmed when in march 10 2018 ioc and ipc agreed to further extend contract to 2032 summer olympics ioc has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter which states while charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability given language in charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on basis of disability would be against ideals of olympic charter and ioc gilbert and schantz 2008 p 169 this is also consistent with paralympic charter which forbids discrimination on basis of political religious economic disability gender sexual orientation or racial reasons chairman of london organising committee sebastian coe said about 2012 summer paralympics and 2012 summer olympics in london england that we want to change public attitudes towards disability celebrate excellence of paralympic sport and to enshrine from very outset that two games are an integrated whole 2014 winter paralympic games is first such paralympics hosted by russia russia ratified un convention on rights of persons with disabilities during that period notably at 2010 vancouver their paralympic team topped medal table at winter paralympics while their olympic team performed well below expectations at winter olympics this led media to highlight contrast between achievements of country s olympic and paralympic delegations despite greater attention and funding awarded to olympic athletes russian

olympics and competed in two events he made semi final in 400 metres race and his team came 8th in final of 4 x 400 metres relay race even though all athletes are given equal opportunities to participate in these events such as 400 meter race there has been growing criticism that games may not be fair to all athletes for example athletes running a race with a left prosthetic leg may be disadvantaged compared to those with a right side prosthesis because races are run in an anticlockwise direction giving some athletes an advantage some athletes without a disability also compete at paralympics sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of competition that athlete with visual impairment and guide are considered a team and both

compared to olympic athletes an example of this criticism was a lawsuit filed by paralympic athletes tony iniguez scot and jacob of united states in 2003 court lets ruling stand in u s o c case new york times october 6 2008 they alleged that united states olympic committee usoc which also include usoc paralympic division national paralympic committee was underfunding american paralympic athletes iniguez cited fact that usoc made healthcare benefits available to a smaller percentage of paralympians usoc provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at a paralympics us paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for us paralympic athletes as nations such as canada and britain supported paralympians and olympians virtually equally usoc did not deny discrepancy in funding and contended that this was due to fact that it did not receive any government financial support as a result it had to rely on revenue generated by media exposure of its athletes olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for usoc than paralympic athletic achievements case was heard by lower courts who ruled that usoc has right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates case was appealed to supreme court where on september 6 2008 it announced that it would not hear appeal however during time lawsuit lasted from 2003 to 2008 funding from usoc had nearly tripled in 2008 11 4 million was earmarked for paralympic athletes up from 3 million in 2004 as with olympics recent paralympics have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors unlike olympics where ioc mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos paralympics do allow logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms media coverage while olympic games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since 1984 summer olympics paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence television broadcasts of paralympic games began in 1976 but this early coverage was confined to taped delay releases to one nation or region at 1992 summer paralympics there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in europe other countries broadcast highlight packages during games no meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until 2000 summer paralympics in sydney 2000 paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for paralympic games a deal was reached between sydney paralympic organizing committee and all media sports ams to broadcast games internationally deals were reached with asian south american and european broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible games were also webcast for first time because of these efforts sydney paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people cashman and darcy 2008 pp 100 101 also significant was fact that organizers did not have to pay networks to televise games as had been done at 1992 and 1996 games goggin and newell 2003 p 91 despite these advances consistent media attention has been a challenge which was evidenced in coverage in great britain of 2010 winter paralympics in uk it is a legal requirement for games to be broadcast by a free to air broadcaster british broadcasting corporation bbc was criticized for its minimal coverage of 2010 winter paralympics as compared to its coverage of 2010 winter olympics bbc announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one hour highlight program after games ended for winter olympics bbc aired 160 hours of coverage response from bbc was that budget constraints and time zone factor necessitated a limited broadcast schedule reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for 2008 summer paralympics which was watched by 23 of population of great britain in norway norwegian broadcasting corporation nrk broadcast 30 hours of 2010 winter games live nrk

2012 channel 4 have also acquired rights to 2014 winter paralympics and 2016 summer paralympics american broadcaster nbc sports who also owns broadcast rights to olympics has been criticised by athletes and ipc officials for airing too little coverage of paralympics lack of coverage from nbc in athens was a cause for concern from senior ipc officials especially given that united states was bidding for 2012 games in 2012 nbc only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from games airing on pay tv channel nbc sports network and did not cover ceremonies at all ipc president philip craven was vocal about nbc s reluctance to air coverage in 2012 expressing his disappointment for american athletes and viewers who would miss amazing images games would bring and remarking that some people think that north america always lead s on everything and on this they don t it s about time they caught up following closing ceremonies craven hinted that ipc might put greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future editions of paralympics or may strip nbc of its broadcast rights by stating that if we find our values don t fit we ll have to go somewhere else nbc would pick up broadcast rights to 2014 and 2016 paralympics promising significantly increased coverage than before outside games a 2010 study by university of british columbia ubc on olympic games impact ogi showed

pushing herself with two poles olena iurkovska of ukraine competing on cross country sit skis at 2010 winter paralympics international paralympic committee ipc has established ten disability categories athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport categories ipc has established ten disability categories including physical visual and intellectual impairment athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category these categories apply to both summer and winter paralympics physical impairment there are eight different types of physical impairment impaired muscle power with impairments in this category force generated by muscles such as muscles of one limb one side of body or lower half of body is reduced e g spinal cord injury spina bifida post polio syndrome impaired passive range of movement range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way acute conditions such as arthritis are not included loss of limb or limb deficiency a total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness trauma or congenital limb deficiency e g dysmelia leg length difference significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma short stature standing height is reduced due to shortened legs arms and trunk which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures e g achondroplasia growth hormone deficiency osteogenesis imperfecta hypertonia hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch hypertonia may result from injury disease or conditions which involve damage to central nervous system e g cerebral palsy ataxia ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements e g cerebral palsy s ataxia multiple sclerosis athetosis athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture e g cerebral palsy visual impairment athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision sufficient to be judged legally blind to total blindness this includes impairment of one or more component of visual system eye structure receptors optic nerve pathway and visual cortex sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of competition that athlete with visual impairment and guide are considered a team beginning in 2012 these guides along with sighted goalkeepers in 5 a side football became eligible to receive medals of their own intellectual disability athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour ipc primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities but disability group intellectual disability has been added to some paralympic games this includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before age of 18 however ioc recognized special olympics world games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities classification system within disability categories athletes still need to be divided according to level of impairment classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many athletes as possible who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability biggest challenge in classification system is how to account for wide variety and severity of disabilities consequently there is a range of impairment within most classifications medical classification until 1980s from its inception until 1980s paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment an athlete s medical condition was only factor used to determine what class they competed in for example an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis would not compete in same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above knee amputation fact that their disability caused same impairment did not factor into classification determination only consideration was their medical diagnosis it was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself that classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on functional abilities of athlete functional classification since 1980s thumb right alt three men wearing eye shades laying on floor a red ball is to left of image swedish goalball team at 2004 summer paralympics while there is no clear date when shift occurred a functional classification system became norm for disabled athletic classification in 1980s in a functional system focus is on what effect athlete s impairment has on his or her athletic performance under this system athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports because their functional loss is same and reason for loss is immaterial only exception to functional system is classification format used by international blind sports federation ibsa which still uses a medically based system some sports are only held for certain disability types for example goalball is only for visually impaired athletes paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or black out mask so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage other sports like athletics are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments in athletics participants are broken down into a range of classes based on disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment for example classes 11 13 are for visually impaired athletes which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment there are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby members of team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation a lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score a team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on field of play at same time to ensure equal competition for example in wheelchair rugby four players combined disability number must total no more than eight points sports there are twenty two sports on summer paralympic program and five sports on winter paralympics program within some of sports are several events for example alpine skiing has downhill super combined super g slalom giant slalom ipc has governance over several of sports but not all of them other international organizations known as international sports federations if notably international wheelchair and amputee sports federation iwas international blind sports federation ibsa and cerebral palsy international sports and recreation association cp isra govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups there are national chapters for these international sport federations including national paralympic committees which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at national level cheating after 2000 sydney games a spanish basketball player alleged that several members of gold medal winning spanish basketball intellectually disabled id team were not disabled he claimed that only two athletes out of twelve member team met qualifications of an intellectually disabled athlete a controversy ensued and ipc called on spanish national paralympic committee to launch an investigation investigation uncovered several spanish athletes who had flouted id rules in an interview with president of federation that oversees id competition fernando martin vicente admitted that athletes around world were breaking id eligibility rules ipc responded by starting an investigation of its own results of ipc s investigation confirmed spanish athlete s allegations and also determined that incident was not isolated to basketball id event or to spanish athletes as a result all id competitions were suspended indefinitely ban was lifted after 2008 games after work had been done to tighten criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities four sports swimming athletics table tennis and rowing were anticipated to hold competitions for id athletes at 2012 summer paralympics paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use at 2008 games in beijing three powerlifters and a german basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances this was a decrease in comparison to ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from 2000 games german skier thomas became first winter paralympian to test positive for steroids he had won two gold medals at 2002 winter paralympics but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test at 2010 winter paralympics in vancouver swedish curler glenn tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six doping rule violation of swedish wheelchair curler international paralympic committee ipc may 4 2010 by ipc he was removed from rest of curling competition but his team was allowed to continue 54 year old curler said his doctor had prescribed a medication on banned substances list another concern now facing paralympic officials is technique of boosting athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure often by self harming which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15 this is most effective in endurance sports such as cross country skiing to increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury this trauma can include breaking bones strapping extremities in too tightly and using high pressure compression stockings injury is painless but it does affect athlete s blood pressure another potential concern is use of gene therapy among paralympic athletes all paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts g 2008 oscar pistorius and future nature of olympic paralympic and other sports script ed 5 1 world anti doping agency is currently
