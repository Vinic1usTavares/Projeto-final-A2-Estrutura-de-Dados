american airlines flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight operated by american airlines from o hare international airport in chicago illinois to los angeles international airport in los angeles california on may 25 1979 mcdonnell douglas dc 10 10 operating this flight was taking off from runway when it crashed into ground all 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed along with two people on ground with 273 fatalities it is deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in united states national transportation safety board ntsb found that as aircraft was beginning its takeoff rotation engine number one left engine separated from left wing flipping over top of wing and landing on runway as engine separated from aircraft it severed hydraulic fluid lines that lock wing s leading edge slats in place and damaged a section of left wing s leading edge aerodynamic forces acting on wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of outboard slats as aircraft began to climb damaged left wing with no engine produced far less lift stalled than right wing with its slats still deployed and its engine providing full takeoff thrust disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to left until it was partially inverted reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near end of runway engine separation was attributed to damage to pylon structure holding engine to wing caused by improper maintenance procedures used at american airlines accident thumb n110aa aircraft involved in accident photographed five years before accident thumb crash site of american airlines flight 191 on accident flight just as aircraft reached takeoff speed no 1 engine and its pylon assembly separated from left wing ripping away a section of leading edge with it combined unit flipped over top of wing and landed on runway robert graham supervisor of maintenance for american airlines stated as aircraft got closer i noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from leading edge of wing and no 1 engine pylon i noticed that no 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about time aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation engine came off went up over top of wing and rolled back down onto runway before going over wing engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing it didn t strike top of wing on its way rather it followed clear path of airflow of wing up and over top of it then down below tail aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to left and at that point i thought he was going to come back to airport it is not known what was said in cockpit in 50 seconds leading up to final impact as cockpit voice recorder lost power when engine detached only crash related audio collected by recorder is a thumping noise likely sound of engine separating followed by first officer exclaiming damn at which point recording ends this may also explain why air traffic control was unsuccessful in their attempts to radio crew and inform them that they had lost an engine this loss of power did however prove useful in investigation serving as a marker of exactly what circuit in dc 10 s extensive electrical system had failed in addition to engine s failure several related systems failed number one hydraulic system powered by number one engine also failed but continued to operate through motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact hydraulic system two was undamaged number one electrical bus whose generator was attached to number one engine failed as well causing several electrical systems to go offline most notably captain s instruments his stick shaker and slat disagreement sensors a switch in overhead panel would have allowed captain to restore power to his instruments but it was not used it might have been possible for flight engineer to reach backup power switch as part of an abnormal situation checklist not as part of their take off emergency procedure in an effort to restore electrical power to number one electrical bus that would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in number one electrical system in order to reach that backup power switch flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat release his safety belt and stand up since aircraft did not get any higher than 350 feet 110 m above ground and was only in air for 50 seconds between time engine separated and moment it crashed there was not sufficient time to perform such an action in any event first officer was flying airplane and his instruments continued to function normally aircraft climbed to about above ground level while spewing a white mist trail of fuel and hydraulic fluid from left wing first officer had followed flight director and raised nose to 14 degrees which reduced airspeed from to takeoff safety airspeed v2 of speed at which aircraft could safely climb after sustaining an engine failure however engine separation had severed hydraulic fluid lines that controlled leading edge slats on left wing and locked them in place causing outboard slats immediately left of no 1 engine to retract under air load retraction of slats raised stall speed of left wing to approximately 6 knots higher than prescribed takeoff safety airspeed v2 of 153 knots as a result left wing entered a full aerodynamic stall with left wing stalled aircraft began banking to left rolling over onto its side until it was partially inverted at a 112 degree bank angle as seen in laughlin photograph with its right wing over its left wing as cockpit had been equipped with a closed circuit television camera positioned behind captain s shoulder and connected to view screens in passenger cabin it is possible that passengers were able to witness these events from viewpoint of cockpit as aircraft dove towards ground whether camera s view was interrupted by power loss from number one electrical bus is not known aircraft eventually slammed into a field approximately from end of runway large sections of aircraft debris were hurled by force of impact into an adjacent trailer park destroying five trailers and several cars dc 10 had also crashed into an old aircraft hangar located at edge of airport at former site of ravenswood international airport which was used for storage in addition to 271 people onboard aircraft two employees at a nearby repair garage were killed and two more were severely burned crash site is a field located northwest of intersection of touhy avenue illinois route 72 and mount prospect road on border of suburbs of des plaines and mount prospect illinois investigation aircraft involved was a mcdonnell douglas dc 10 10 registered n110aa it had been delivered on february 25 1972 and at time of crash it had logged just under 20 000 hours of flying time over seven years jet was powered by three general electric cf6 6d engines a review of aircraft s flight logs and maintenance records showed that no mechanical discrepancies were noted for may 11 1979 on day of accident in violation of standard procedure records were not removed from aircraft and were destroyed in accident disaster and investigation received widespread media coverage impact on public was increased by dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of aircraft rolling that was published on front page of chicago tribune on sunday two days after crash there were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been cause of crash this apparently was result of discovery of small aircraft parts among wreckage at crash site national transportation safety board vice chairman elwood t driver in a press briefing was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut implying that these parts were a cause of accident small plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on ground at time of crash at former general aviation ravenswood airport a facility that had been out of service for a few years an owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building engine separation thumb left upright 1 35 an faa diagram of dc 10 engine and pylon assembly indicating failed aft pylon attach fitting witnesses to crash were in universal agreement that aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on runway also no pieces of wing or other aircraft components were found along with separated engine other than its supporting pylon leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free from airframe and struck engine hence engine pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure during investigation an examination on pylon attachment points revealed some damage done to wing s pylon mounting bracket that matched shape of pylon s rear attachment fitting this meant that pylon attachment fitting had struck mounting bracket at some point this was important evidence as only way pylon fitting could strike wing s mounting bracket in observed manner was if bolts that held pylon to wing had been removed and engine pylon assembly was being supported by something other than aircraft itself therefore investigators now could conclude that observed damage to rear pylon mount had been present before crash actually occurred rather than being caused by it ntsb determined that damage to left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at american airlines aircraft maintenance facility in tulsa oklahoma between march 29 and 30 1979 on those dates aircraft had undergone routine service during which engine and pylon had been removed from wing for inspection and maintenance removal procedure recommended by mcdonnell douglas called for engine to be detached from pylon before detaching pylon itself from wing however american airlines as well as continental airlines and united airlines had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200 man hours per aircraft and more importantly from a safety standpoint it would reduce number of disconnects of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines electrical cables and wiring from 79 to 27 this new procedure involved removal of engine and pylon assembly as a single unit rather than as individual components united airlines implementation involved use of an overhead crane to support engine pylon assembly during removal and installation method chosen by american and continental relied on supporting engine pylon assembly with a large forklift it was learned that if forklift was incorrectly positioned engine pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled causing it to rock like a see saw and jam pylon against wing s attachment points forklift operators were guided only by hand and voice signals as they could not directly see juncture between pylon and wing positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result compounding problem maintenance work on n110aa did not go smoothly mechanics started to disconnect engine and pylon but there was a shift change halfway through job when work was resumed pylon was jammed on wing and forklift had to be re positioned resulting in unseen structural damage to wing s pylon attachment points structural damage was not enough to cause an immediate failure however damage to mount developed into fatigue cracking and worsened with each takeoff and landing cycle during eight weeks that followed maintenance on n110aa finally damaged rear pylon mount was weakened to such an extent that it was no longer able to support even normal flight loads and failed due to loss of this attachment at full takeoff power engine and its pylon broke away from wing structure surrounding forward pylon mount then failed from resulting stresses inspection of dc 10 fleets of three airlines revealed that while united airlines hoist approach seemed to be harmless there were several dc 10s at both american and continental that already had fatal damage to their pylon mounts field service representative from mcdonnell douglas stated company would not encourage this procedure due to element of risk and had so advised american airlines mcdonnell douglas however does not have authority to either approve or disapprove maintenance procedures of its customers inadequate speed ntsb determined that loss of one engine and asymmetrical drag caused by damage to wing s leading edge should not have been enough to cause pilots to lose control of their aircraft aircraft should have been capable of returning to airport using its remaining two engines ntsb thus examined effects that engine s separation would have on aircraft s flight control hydraulic electrical and instrumentation systems unlike other aircraft designs dc 10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock extended leading edge slats in place relying instead solely on hydraulic pressure within system ntsb determined that engine tore through hydraulic lines as it separated from dc 10 s wing causing a loss of hydraulic pressure airflow over wings forced left wing slats to retract which caused a stall over left wing in response to accident slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage faa airworthiness directive 80 03 03 wreckage was too severely fragmented to determine exact position of rudders elevators flaps and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that right wing slats were fully extended as crew tried unsuccessfully to correct steep roll they were in left wing slats could not be determined from blurry color photographs so they were sent to a laboratory in palo alto california for digital analysis a process that was pushing limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large complicated and expensive equipment photographs were reduced to black and white which made it possible to distinguish slats from wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted in addition it was also verified that tail section of aircraft was undamaged and landing gear was down wind tunnel and flight simulator tests were conducted to help to understand trajectory of aircraft after engine detached and left wing slats retracted those tests established that damage to wing s leading edge and retraction of slats increased stall speed of left wing from to dc 10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted pilots to impending stall slat disagreement warning light which should have illuminated after uncommanded retraction of slats and stick shaker on captain s control column which activates close to stall speed both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by number one engine both systems became inoperative after loss of that engine first officer s control column was not equipped with a stick shaker device was offered by mcdonnell douglas as an option for first officer but american airlines chose not to have it installed on its dc 10 fleet stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident faa airworthiness directive 80 03 10 since it was no longer possible to abort takeoff after loss of engine crew followed standard operating procedure for an engine out climb this procedure is to climb at takeoff safety airspeed v2 and attitude angle as directed by flight director partial electrical power failure produced by separation of left no 1 engine meant that neither stall warning nor slat retraction indicator was operative crew therefore did not know that slats on left wing were retracting this retraction significantly raised stall speed of left wing thus flying at takeoff safety airspeed caused left wing to stall while right wing was still producing lift so aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to left in simulator recreations held after accident it was determined that had pilot maintained excess airspeed accident may not have occurred probable cause findings of investigation by national transportation safety board were released on december 21 1979 legacy of dc 10 crash of flight 191 brought strong criticism from media regarding dc 10 s safety and design dc 10 had been involved in two accidents related to design of its cargo doors american airlines flight 96 1972 and turkish airlines flight 981 1974 separation of engine one from its mount widespread publication of dramatic images of airplane missing its engine seconds before crash and a second photo of fireball resulting from impact raised widespread concerns about safety of dc 10 final blow to airplane s reputation was dealt two weeks after crash when aircraft was grounded by faa although aircraft itself was later exonerated damage in public s eye was already done investigation also revealed other dc 10s with damage caused by same faulty maintenance procedure faulty procedure was banned and aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft in response to this accident american airlines was fined 500 000 by u s government for improper maintenance procedures on june 6 1979 two weeks after crash federal aviation administration suspended type certificate for dc 10 thereby grounding all dc 10s under its jurisdiction it also enacted a special air regulation banning dc 10 from u s airspace which prevented foreign dc 10s not under jurisdiction of faa from flying within country this was done while faa investigated whether or not airplane s engine mounting and pylon design met relevant requirements once faa was satisfied that maintenance issues were primarily at fault and not actual design of aircraft type certificate was restored on july 13 and special air regulation repealed however type certificate was amended stating that removal of engine and pylon as a unit will immediately render aircraft un airworthy another dc 10 performing western airlines flight crashed in mexico city after a red eye flight from los angeles barely 5 months after crash of american airlines flight 191 western airlines dc 10 s crash however was due to low visibility and an attempt to land on a closed runway through reportedly confusion of its crew crash of yet another dc 10 at end of november air new zealand flight 901 exactly six months after flight 191 added to dc 10 s negative reputation crash of flight 901 an antarctic sightseeing flight which hit a mountain was caused by several human and environmental factors not related to airworthiness of dc 10 and aircraft was later completely exonerated in that accident thumb left firefighters survey flight 191 crash site in des plaines illinois ironically crash of yet another dc 10 united airlines flight 232 ten years later restored some of aircraft s reputation despite losing an engine all flight controls crash landing in a huge fireball which was caught on video by a local news crew and killing 111 people 185 people survived accident experts praised dc 10 s sturdy construction as partly responsible for high number of survivors despite initial safety concerns dc 10 aircraft continued to serve with passenger airlines for over 30 years after crash of flight 191 dc 10 production ended in 1988 many retired passenger dc 10s have since been converted to all cargo use dc 10 freighters along with its derivative md 11 constitute part of fedex express fleet dc 10s have been upgraded with glass cockpit from md 11 thereby turning them into md 10s american airlines retired its last dc 10s in 2000 after 29 years of service in february 2014 biman bangladesh airlines operated final dc 10 passenger flights dc 10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations and military variants also remain in service victims nationalities of victims flight crew captain walter lux 53 had been flying dc 10 since its introduction eight years earlier he had logged around 22 000 flying hours of which about 3 000 were in a dc 10 he was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft including dc 6 dc 7 and boeing 727 first officer james dillard 49 and flight engineer alfred 56 were also highly experienced 9 275 hours and 15 000 hours respectively between them they had 1 830 hours flying experience in dc 10 passengers some of victims in crash of flight 191 were itzhak a czechoslovakia born israeli american biomedical inventor cardiac catheter and new age author stalking wild pendulum and a cosmic book leonard stogel music business manager promoter producer executive for california jam california jam ii sam sham tommy james and redbone gentle giant and other musical groups coincidentally stogel s parents had earlier perished on american airlines flight 1 memorial for 32 years there was no permanent memorial to victims funding was obtained for a memorial in 2009 through a two year effort by sixth grade class of decatur classical school in chicago memorial a concave wall with interlocking bricks displaying names of crash victims was formally dedicated in a ceremony on october 15 2011 memorial is located at lake park at northwest corner of lee and touhy avenues two miles east of crash site depictions in media cable satellite national geographic channel produced a documentary on crash and an episode from seconds from disaster titled chicago plane crash detailed crash and included film of investigation press conferences canadian television series mayday profiled crash in episode catastrophe at o hare which has subsequently aired in u s on smithsonian channel s television series air disasters flight was also featured on an episode of why planes crash which is featured on weather channel chicago folk singer steve goodman wrote song ballad of flight 191 they know everything about it in response to crash and subsequent investigation as inaugural song for a series of topical songs which aired on
