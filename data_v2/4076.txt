nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva was a nuclear thermal rocket engine development program that ran for roughly two decades nerva was a joint effort of atomic energy commission aec and nasa it was managed by space nuclear propulsion office snpo until program ended in january 1973 nerva demonstrated that nuclear thermal rocket engines were a feasible and reliable tool for space exploration and at end of 1968 snpo certified that latest nerva engine xe met requirements for a human mission to mars although nerva engines were built and tested as much as possible with flight certified components and engine was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft nerva was cancelled before it flew in space nerva was considered by aec snpo and nasa to be a highly successful program it met or exceeded its program goals its principal objective was to establish a technology base for nuclear rocket engine systems to be utilized in design and development of propulsion systems for space mission application virtually all spacecraft concepts featuring nuclear thermal rockets use derivative designs from nerva nrx or pewee origins during world war ii some scientists at manhattan project s los alamos laboratory where first atomic bombs were designed including stan ulam frederick reines and frederic de hoffmann speculated about development of nuclear powered rockets in 1946 ulam and c j everett wrote a paper in which they considered use of atomic bombs as a means of rocket propulsion this would become basis for project orion public revelation of atomic energy at end of war generated a great deal of speculation and in united kingdom val cleaver chief engineer of rocket division at de havilland and leslie shepard a nuclear physicist at university of cambridge independently considered problem of nuclear rocket propulsion they became collaborators and in a series of papers published in journal of british interplanetary society in 1948 and 1949 they outlined design of a nuclear powered rocket with a solid core graphite heat exchanger they reluctantly concluded that nuclear rockets were essential for deep space exploration but not yet technically feasible in 1953 robert w bussard a physicist working on nuclear energy for propulsion of aircraft nepa project at oak ridge national laboratory wrote a detailed study on nuclear energy for rocket propulsion he had read cleaver and shepard s work that of chinese physicist hsue shen tsien and a february 1952 report by engineers at consolidated vultee bussard s study had little impact at first because only 29 copies were printed and it was classified as restricted data and therefore could only be read by someone with required security clearance in december 1953 it was published in oak ridge s journal of reactor science and technology while still classified this gave it a wider circulation darol froman deputy director of los alamos scientific laboratory lasl and herbert york director of university of california radiation laboratory at livermore were interested and established committees to investigate nuclear rocket propulsion froman brought bussard out to los alamos to assist for one week per month bussard s study also attracted attention of john von neumann and he formed an ad hoc committee on nuclear propulsion of missiles mark mills assistant director at livermore was its chairman and its other members were norris bradbury from lasl edward teller and herbert york from livermore abe silverstein associate director of national advisory committee for aeronautics naca lewis flight propulsion laboratory and allen f donovan from ramo wooldridge after hearing input on various designs mills committee recommended that development proceed with aim of producing a nuclear rocket upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm york created a new division at livermore and bradbury created a new one called n division at los alamos under leadership of raemer schreiber to pursue it in march 1956 armed forces special weapons project afswp recommended allocating 100 million to nuclear rocket engine project over three years for two laboratories to conduct feasibility studies and construction of test facilities eger v murphree and herbert loper at atomic energy commission aec were more cautious atlas missile program was proceeding well and if successful would have sufficient range to hit targets in most of soviet union at same time nuclear warheads were becoming smaller lighter and more powerful case for a new technology that promised heavier payloads over longer distances therefore seemed weak however nuclear rocket had acquired a political patron in senator clinton p anderson from new mexico where lasl was located deputy chairman of united states congress joint committee on atomic energy jcae who was close to von neumann bradbury and ulam he managed to secure funding all work on nuclear rocket was consolidated at los alamos where it was given codename project rover livermore was assigned responsibility for development of nuclear ramjet which was codenamed project pluto project rover was directed by an active duty usaf officer seconded to aec lieutenant colonel harold r schmidt he was answerable to another seconded usaf officer colonel jack l armstrong who was also in charge of pluto and systems for nuclear auxiliary power snap projects project rover design concepts in principle design of a nuclear thermal rocket engine is quite simple a turbopump would force hydrogen through a nuclear reactor that would heat it to very high temperatures complicating factors were immediately apparent first was that a means had to be found of controlling reactor temperature and power output second was that a means had to be devised to hold propellant only practical means of storing hydrogen was in liquid form and this required temperatures below third was that hydrogen would be heated to a temperature of around and materials would be required that could both withstand such temperatures and resist corrosion by hydrogen for fuel they considered plutonium 239 uranium 235 and uranium 233 plutonium was rejected because while it forms compounds easily they could not reach temperatures as high as those of uranium uranium 233 was seriously considered as compared to uranium 235 it is slightly lighter has a higher number of neutrons per fission event and a high probability of fission it therefore held prospect of saving some weight in fuel but its radioactive properties make it more difficult to handle and in any case it was not readily available as to structural materials in reactor choice came down to graphite or metals of metals tungsten emerged as frontrunner but tungsten was expensive hard to fabricate and had undesirable neutronic properties to get around its neutronic properties it was proposed to use tungsten 184 which does not absorb neutrons on other hand graphite was cheap actually gets stronger at temperatures up to and sublimes rather than melts at graphite was therefore chosen to control reactor core was surrounded by control drums coated with graphite or beryllium a neutron moderator on one side and boron a neutron poison on other reactor s power output could be controlled by rotating drums to increase thrust it is sufficient to increase flow of propellant hydrogen whether in pure form or in a compound like ammonia is an efficient nuclear moderator and increasing flow also increases rate of reactions in core this increased reaction rate offsets cooling provided by hydrogen moreover as hydrogen heats up it expands so there is less in core to remove heat and temperature will level off these opposing effects stabilize reactivity and a nuclear rocket engine is therefore naturally very stable and thrust is easily controlled by varying hydrogen flow without changing control drums lasl produced a series of design concepts each with its own codename uncle tom uncle tung bloodhound and shish by 1955 it had settled on a 1 500 mw design called old black joe in 1956 this became basis of 2 700 mw design intended to be upper stage of an icbm test site thumb left engine maintenance assembly and disassembly e mad facility nuclear reactors for project rover were built at lasl technical area 18 ta 18 also known as pajarito site reactors were tested at very low power before being shipped to jackass flats in nevada test site testing of fuel elements and other materials science was done by lasl n division at ta 46 using various ovens and later nuclear furnace work commenced on test facilities at jackass flats in mid 1957 all materials and supplies had to be brought in from las vegas test cell a consisted of a farm of hydrogen gas bottles and a concrete wall thick to protect electronic instrumentation from radiation produced by reactor control room was located away reactor was test fired with its plume in air so that radioactive products could be safely dissipated reactor maintenance and disassembly building r mad was in most respects a typical hot cell used by nuclear industry with thick concrete walls lead glass viewing windows and remote manipulation arms it was exceptional only for its size long and high this allowed engine to be moved in and out on a railroad car jackass and western railroad as it was light heartedly described was said to be world s shortest and slowest railroad there were two locomotives remotely controlled electric l 1 and diesel electric l 2 which was manually controlled but had radiation shielding around cab former was normally used latter was provided as a backup construction workers were housed in mercury nevada later thirty trailers were brought to jackass flats to create a village named boyerville after supervisor keith boyer construction work was completed in fall of 1958 nasa planned to develop a community of 2 700 people with 800 dwellings and their own shopping complex by 1967 organization transfer to nasa thumb right president john f kennedy right visits nuclear rocket development station on 8 december 1962 with harold finger left and glenn seaborg behind by 1957 atlas missile project was proceeding well and need for a nuclear upper stage had all but disappeared on 2 october 1957 aec proposed cutting its budget but its timing was off two days later soviet union launched sputnik 1 first artificial satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around world it demonstrated that soviet union had capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances and contested cherished american notions of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated sputnik crisis and triggered space race president dwight d eisenhower responded to by creating national aeronautics and space administration nasa which absorbed naca naca had long been interested in nuclear technology in 1951 it had begun exploring possibility of acquiring its own nuclear reactor for aircraft nuclear propulsion anp project and selected its lewis flight propulsion laboratory in ohio to design build and manage it a site was chosen at nearby plum brook ordnance works naca obtained approval from aec and construction of plum brook reactor commenced in september 1956 abe silverstein director of lewis was particularly eager to acquire control of project rover donald a quarles deputy secretary of defense met with t keith glennan new administrator of nasa and hugh dryden his deputy on 20 august 1958 day they after were sworn into office at white house and rover was first item on agenda quarles was eager to transfer rover to nasa as project no longer had a military purpose responsibility for non nuclear components of project rover was officially transferred from united states air force usaf to nasa on 1 october 1958 day nasa officially became operational and assumed responsibility for us civilian space program space nuclear propulsion office project rover became a joint nasa aec project silverstein whom glennan had brought to washington dc to organise nasa s spaceflight program appointed harold finger to oversee nuclear rocket development as head of nasa s office of space reactors anderson had doubts about finger s suitability considering that he lacked enthusiasm for it glenn met with anderson on 13 april 1959 and convinced him that finger would do a good job on 29 august 1960 nasa created space nuclear propulsion office snpo to oversee nuclear rocket project finger was appointed as its manager with milton klein from aec as his deputy finger was also director of nuclear systems in nasa office of advanced research and technology a formal agreement between nasa and aec on management of nuclear rocket engine contracts was signed by nasa deputy administrator robert seamans and aec general manager alvin luedecke on 1 february 1961 this was followed by an inter agency agreement on program for development of space nuclear rocket propulsion project rover which they signed on 28 july 1961 snpo also assumed responsibility for snap with armstrong becoming assistant to director of reactor development division at aec and lieutenant colonel g m anderson formerly snap project officer in disbanded anp office became chief of snap branch in new division it soon became apparent that there were considerable cultural differences between nasa and aec thumb left b 1 and b 3 test stands at nasa s plum brook station test stands were constructed in early 1960s to test full scale liquid hydrogen fuel systems in simulated altitude conditions snpo headquarters was co located with aec headquarters in germantown maryland finger established branch offices at albuquerque new mexico snpo a to work liaise with lasl and in cleveland ohio snpo c to coordinate with lewis research center which was activated in october 1961 in february 1962 nasa announced establishment of nuclear rocket development station nrds at jackass flats and in june an snpo branch was established at las vegas snpo n to manage it by end of 1963 there were 13 nasa personnel at snpo headquarters 59 at snpo c and 30 at snpo n snpo staff were a combination of nasa and aec employees whose responsibilities included program and resource planning and evaluation justification and distribution of program resources definition and control of overall program requirements monitoring and reporting of progress and problems to nasa and aec management and preparation of testimony to congress finger called for bids from industry for development of nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva based upon kiwi engine award was scheduled for 1 march 1961 so decision to proceed could be made by incoming kennedy administration eight companies submitted bids aerojet douglas glenn l martin lockheed north american rocketdyne thiokol and westinghouse a joint nasa aec board evaluated bids it rated north american s bid as best bid overall but westinghouse and aerojet had superior bids for reactor and engine respectively when they were considered separately after aerojet promised nasa administrator james e webb that it would put its best people on nerva webb spoke to selection board and told them that while he did not wish to influence their decision north american was deeply committed to project apollo and board might consider combining other bids on 8 june webb announced that aerojet and westinghouse had been selected aerojet became prime contractor with westinghouse as principal subcontractor both companies recruited aggressively and by 1963 westinghouse had 1 100 staff working on nerva in march 1961 president john f kennedy announced cancellation of aircraft nuclear propulsion project just as nasa s plum brook reactor was nearing completion and for a time it seemed that nerva would soon follow nasa estimated its cost at 800 million although aec reckoned that it would be much less and bureau of budget bob argued that nerva made sense only in context of a crewed lunar landing or flights further into solar system to neither of which had administration committed then on 12 april soviet union launched yuri gagarin into orbit on vostok 1 once again demonstrating their technological superiority a few days later kennedy launched disastrous bay of pigs invasion of cuba resulting in yet another humiliation for united states on 25 may he addressed a joint session of congress first he announced i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving goal before this decade is out of landing a man on moon and returning him safely to earth he then went on to say secondly an additional 23 million dollars together with 7 million dollars already available will accelerate development of rover nuclear rocket this gives promise of someday providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space perhaps beyond moon perhaps to very end of solar system itself reactor in flight test rift thumb tight wooden mock up of a nerva engine on engine installation vehicle near e mad snpo set an objective for nerva of 99 7 percent reliability meaning that engine would fail to perform as designed no more than three times in every thousand starts to achieve this aerojet and westinghouse estimated that they would require 6 reactors 28 engines and 6 reactor in flight test rift flights they planned for 42 tests considerably less than 60 tests that snpo had thought might be required unlike other aspects of nerva rift was solely a nasa responsibility nasa delegated responsibility for rift to wernher von braun s marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama von braun created a nuclear vehicle projects office at msfc headed by colonel scott fellows a usaf officer who had worked on anp at this time nasa was engaged in planning for lunar landing mission that kennedy had called for it to undertake for this it considered various booster concepts including what became saturn family and larger nova these were chemical rockets although nuclear upper stages were also considered for nova december 1959 silverstein committee had defined configuration of saturn launch vehicle including use of liquid hydrogen as fuel for upper stages in a 1960 paper schmidt proposed replacing upper stages with nuclear nerva stages this would deliver same performance as nova but for half cost he estimated cost of putting a pound of payload into lunar orbit as 1 600 for an all chemical saturn 1 100 for nova and 700 for a chemical nuclear saturn msfc issued a study contract for a rift with nerva as upper stage of a saturn c 3 but c 3 was replaced soon after by more powerful c 4 and ultimately c 5 which became saturn v only in july 1962 after much debate did nasa finally settle on lunar orbit rendezvous which could be performed by saturn v and nova was abandoned thumb left nevada test site xe prime engine before test at ets 1 rift vehicle would consist of an s ic first stage a dummy s ii middle stage filled with water and an s n saturn nuclear nerva upper stage for an actual mission a real s ii stage would be used s n stage was to be built by lockheed in a dirigible hangar nasa acquired at moffet field in sunnyvale california and assembled at nasa s mississippi test facility snpo planned to build ten s n stages six for ground tests and four for flight tests launches were to take place from cape canaveral nerva engines would be transported by road in watertight containers with control rods locked in place and nuclear poison wires in core since it would not be radioactive it could be safely transported and mated to lower stages without shielding rift test vehicle would be tall about same as saturn v saturn c 5n mission configuration would be larger still at tall but in vehicle assembly building vab could easily accommodate it in flight poison wires would be pulled and reactor started above atlantic ocean engine would fire for 1 300 seconds boosting it to an altitude of it would then be shut down and reactor cooled before impacting atlantic downrange nerva would be regarded as mission ready after four successful tests to support rift lasl established a rover flight safety office and snpo a rover flight safety panel since rift called for up to four reactors to fall into atlantic ocean lasl attempted to determine what would happen when a reactor hit water at several thousand kilometers per hour in particular whether it would go critical or explode when flooded with sea water a neutron moderator there was also concern about what would happen when it sank down to bottom of atlantic where it would be under a crushing pressure possible impact on marine life and indeed what marine life was down there all had to be considered main bottleneck in nerva program was test facilities at jackass flats test cell c was supposed to be complete in 1960 but nasa and aec did not request funds for additional construction in 1960 although anderson provided them anyway then there were construction delays forcing anderson to personally intervene in august 1961 soviet union ended nuclear test moratorium that had been in place since november 1958 so kennedy resumed us testing in september with a second crash program at nevada test site labor became scarce and there was a strike when that ended workers had to come to grips with difficulties of dealing with hydrogen which could leak through microscopic holes that would contain other fluids on 7 november 1961 a minor accident caused a violent hydrogen release complex finally became operational in 1964 snpo envisaged construction of a 20 000 mw nuclear rocket engine so boyer had chicago bridge iron company construct two gigantic cryogenic storage dewars an engine maintenance and disassembly building e mad was added it had thick concrete walls and shield bays where engines could be assembled and disassembled there was also an engine test stand ets 1 two more were planned in march 1963 snpo and msfc commissioned space technology laboratories stl to produce a report on what kind of nuclear rocket engine would be required for possible missions between 1975 and 1990 these missions included early crewed planetary interplanetary round trip expeditions empire planetary swingbys and flybys and a lunar shuttle conclusion of this nine volume report which was delivered in march 1965 and of a follow up study was that these missions could be carried out with a 4 100 mw engine with a specific impulse of this was considerably smaller than had originally been thought necessary from this emerged a specification for a 5 000 mw nuclear rocket engine which became known as nerva ii engine development kiwi thumb right technicians in a vacuum furnace at nasa lewis fabrication shop prepare a kiwi b 1 nozzle for testing first phase of project rover kiwi was named after new zealand kiwi bird a kiwi cannot fly and kiwi rocket engines were not intended to do so either their function was to verify design and test behavior of materials used kiwi program developed of a series of non flyable test nuclear engines with primary focus on improving technology of hydrogen cooled reactors in kiwi a series of tests conducted between july 1959 and october 1960 three reactors were built and tested kiwi a was considered a success as a proof of concept for nuclear rocket engines it demonstrated that hydrogen could be heated in a nuclear reactor to temperatures required for space propulsion and that reactor could be controlled next step was kiwi b series of tests which commenced with kiwi b1a on 7 december 1961 this was a development of kiwi a engine with a series of improvements second test in series kiwi b1b on 1 september 1962 resulted in extreme structural damage to reactor with fuel module components being ejected as it was ramped up to full power subsequent full power kiwi b4a test on 30 november 1962 along with a series of cold flow tests revealed that problem was vibrations induced as hydrogen was heated when reactor was brought to full power that shook reactor apart rather than when it was running at full power unlike a chemical engine that would likely have blown up after suffering catastrophic damage nuclear rocket engine remained stable and controllable even when tested to destruction tests demonstrated that a nuclear rocket engine would be rugged and reliable in space kennedy visited los alamos on 7 december 1962 for a briefing on project rover it was first time a president had visited a nuclear weapons laboratory he brought with him a large entourage that included lyndon johnson mcgeorge bundy jerome wiesner harold brown donald hornig glenn seaborg robert seamans harold finger clinton anderson howard cannon and alan bible next day flew to jackass flats making kennedy only president to ever visit a nuclear test site project rover had received 187 million in 1962 and aec and nasa were asking for another 360 million in 1963 kennedy drew attention to his administration s budgetary difficulties and asked what relationship was between project rover and apollo finger replied that it was an insurance policy and could be used in later apollo or post apollo missions such as a base on moon or a mission to mars weisner supported by brown and hornig argued that if a mars mission could not occur before 1980s then rift could be postponed to 1970s seamans noted that such an attitude had resulted in sputnik crisis and a loss of american prestige and influence thumb left inside e mad in january 1963 anderson became chairman of united states senate committee on aeronautical and space sciences he met privately with kennedy who agreed to request a supplemental appropriation for rift if a quick fix to kiwi vibration problem that seaborg promised could be implemented in meantime finger called a meeting he declared that there would be no quick fix he criticised lasl s management structure and called for lasl to adopt a project management structure he wanted case of vibration problems thoroughly investigated and cause definitely known before corrective action was taken three snpo staff known at lasl as three blind mice were assigned to lasl to ensure that his instructions were carried out finger assembled a team of vibration specialists from other nasa centers and along with staff from lasl aerojet and westinghouse conducted a series of cold flow reactor tests using fuel elements without fissionable material rift was cancelled in december 1963 although its reinstatement was frequently discussed it never occurred a series of minor design changes were made to address vibration problem in kiwi b4d test on 13 may 1964 reactor was automatically started and briefly run at full power with no vibration problems this was followed by kiwi b4e test on 28 august in which reactor was operated for twelve minutes eight of which were at full power on 10 september kiwi b4e was restarted and run at full power for two and a half minutes demonstrating ability of a nuclear rocket engine to be shut down and restarted in september tests were conducted with a kiwi b4 engine and parka a kiwi reactor used for testing at los alamos two reactors were run and apart and reactivity measurements were taken these tests showed that neutrons produced by one reactor did indeed cause fissions in another but that effect was negligible 3 12 and 24 cents respectively tests demonstrated that nuclear rocket engines can be clustered just as chemical ones often are nerva nrx thumb nerva nuclear rocket engine snpo chose kiwi b4 nuclear thermal rocket design with a specific impulse of 825 seconds as baseline for nerva nrx nuclear rocket experimental whereas kiwi was a proof of concept nerva nrx was a prototype of a complete engine that meant that it would need actuators to turn drums and start engine gimbals to control its movement a nozzle cooled by liquid hydrogen and shielding to protect engine payload and crew from radiation westinghouse modified cores to make them more robust for flight conditions some research and development was still required available temperature sensors were accurate only up to far below what was required new sensors were developed that were accurate to even in a high radiation environment aerojet and westinghouse attempted to theoretically predict performance of each component this was then compared to actual test performance over time two converged as more was understood by 1972 performance of a nerva engine under most conditions could be accurately forecast first test of a nerva engine was of nerva a2 on 24 september 1964 aerojet and westinghouse cautiously increased power incrementally to 2 mw 570 mw 940 mw running for a minute or two at each level to check instruments before finally increasing to full power at 1 096 mw reactor ran flawlessly and only had to be shut down after 40 seconds because hydrogen was running out test demonstrated that nerva had designed specific impulse of solid propellant rockets have a maximum impulse of around while chemical rockets with liquid propellant can seldom achieve more than executives at aerojet and westinghouse were so pleased they took out a full page ad in wall street journal with a picture of test and caption on to mars reactor was restarted on 15 october originally this was intended to test nozzle but that was dropped as it was close to its design maximum of instead turbopump was tested engine was powered up to 40 mw control drums were locked in place and turbopump was used to keep power steady at 40 mw it worked perfectly computer simulations had been correct and whole project was ahead of schedule thumb left ets 1 at test cell c next test was of nerva a3 on 23 april 1965 this test was intended to verify that engine could be run and restarted at full power engine was operated for eight minutes three and a half of them at full power before instruments indicated that too much hydrogen was going into engine a scram was ordered but a coolant line became clogged power increased to 1 165 mw before line and engine shut down gracefully there were fears for integrity of tie rods that held fuel clusters together they were supposed to operate at with a maximum of sensors recorded that they had reached which was their own maximum laboratory tests later confirmed that they might have reached there was also what appeared to be a hole in nozzle but this turned out to be soot robust engine was undamaged so test continued and engine was run for thirteen minutes at 1 072 mw once again test time was limited only by available hydrogen testing of nasa s nerva nrx est engine system test commenced on 3 february 1966 objectives were demonstrate feasibility of starting and restarting engine without an external power source evaluate control system characteristics stability and control mode during startup shutdown cooldown and restart for a variety of initial conditions investigate system stability over a broad operating range investigate endurance capability of engine components especially reactor during transient and steady state operation with multiple restarts nrx est was run at intermediate power levels on 3 and 11 february with a full power 1 055 mw test on 3 march followed by engine duration tests on 16 and 25 march engine was started eleven times all test objectives were successfully accomplished and nrx est operated for nearly two hours including 28 minutes at full power it exceeded operating time of previous kiwi reactors by nearly a factor of two next objective was to run reactors for an extended length of time nrx a5 was started up on 8 june 1966 and run at full power for fifteen and a half minutes during cooldown a bird landed on nozzle and was asphyxiated by nitrogen or helium gas dropping onto core it was feared that it might block propellant lines or create uneven heating before being blown out again when engine was restarted so westinghouse engineers rigged a television camera and a vacuum hose and were able to remove bird while safely behind a concrete wall engine was restarted on 23 june and run at full power for another fourteen and a half minutes although there was severe corrosion resulting in about 2 20 of reactivity lost engine could still have been restarted but engineers wanted to examine core an hour was now set as goal for nrx a6 test this was beyond capacity of test cell a so testing now moved to test cell c with its giant dewars nrx a5 was therefore last test to use test cell a reactor was started on 7 december 1966 but a shutdown was ordered 75 seconds into test due to a faulty electrical component this was followed by a postponement due to inclement weather nrx a6 was started up again on 15 december it ran at full power 1 125 mw with a chamber temperature of over and pressure of and a flow rate of it took 75 3 hours to cool reactor with liquid nitrogen on examination it was found that beryllium reflector had cracked due to thermal stress test caused abandonment of plans to build a more powerful nerva ii engine if more thrust was required a nerva i engine could be run longer or it could be clustered nerva xe with success of a6 test snpo cancelled planned follow on tests a7 and a8 and concentrated on completing ets 1 all previous tests had engine firing upwards ets 1 would permit an engine to be reoriented to fire downward into a reduced pressure compartment to partly simulate firing in vacuum of space test stand provided a reduced atmospheric pressure of about equivalent to being at an altitude of this was done by injecting water into exhaust which created a superheated steam that surged out at high speeds creating a vacuum thumb right nerva control room ets 1 took longer for aerojet to complete than expected partly due to shrinking budgets but also because of technical challenges it was built from pure aluminum which did not become radioactive when irradiated by neutrons and there was a water spray to keep it cool rubber gaskets were a problem as they tended to turn into goo in a radioactive environment metal ones had to be used most challenging part was exhaust ducts which were required to handle much higher temperatures than their chemical rocket counterparts steel work was carried out by allegheny technologies while air company fabricated pipes work required of steel of welding wire and of welds during a test 234 tubes would have to carry up to of water to save money on cabling aerojet moved control room to a bunker away second nerva engine nerva xe was designed to come as close as possible to a complete flight system even to point of using a flight design turbopump components that would not affect system performance were allowed to be selected from what was available at jackass flats to save money and time and a radiation shield was added to protect external components test objectives included testing use of ets 1 at jackass flats for flight engine qualification and acceptance total run time was 115 minutes including 28 starts nasa and snpo felt that test confirmed that a nuclear rocket engine was suitable for space flight application and was able to operate at a specific impulse twice that of chemical rocket system s engine was deemed adequate for mars missions being planned by nasa facility was also deemed adequate for flight qualification and acceptance of rocket engines from two contractors final test of series was xe prime this engine was long in diameter and weighed approximately it was designed to produce a nominal thrust of with a specific impulse of when reactor was operating at full power about 1 140 mw chamber temperature was chamber pressure was and flow rate was of which was diverted into cooldown system a series of experiments were carried out between of 4 december 1968 and 11 september 1969 during which reactor was started 24 times and ran at full power for 1 680 seconds cancellation at time of nerva nrx est test nasa s plans for nerva included a visit to mars by 1978 a permanent lunar base by 1981 and deep space probes to jupiter saturn and outer planets nerva rockets would be used for nuclear tugs designed to take payloads from low earth orbit leo to larger orbits as a component of later named space transportation system resupply several space stations in various orbits around earth and moon and support a permanent lunar base nerva rocket would also be a nuclear powered upper stage for saturn rocket which would allow upgraded saturn to launch much larger payloads of up to to leo thumb left 1970 artist s concept illustrates use of space shuttle nuclear shuttle and space tug in nasa s integrated program defending nerva from its critics like horning chairman of president s science advisory committee psac required a series of bureaucratic and political battles as rising cost of vietnam war put pressure on budgets but anderson cannon and webb were up to task congress defunded nerva ii in 1967 budget but president johnson needed anderson s support for his medicare legislation and on 7 february 1967 he provided money for nerva ii from his own contingency fund klein who had succeeded finger as head of snpo in 1967 faced two hours of questioning on nerva ii before house committee on science and astronautics which cut nasa budget defunding nerva ii saved 400 million mainly in new facilities that would be required to test it this time aec and nasa acquiesced because nrx a6 test had demonstrated that nerva i could perform missions expected of nerva ii following year webb attempted to take money from nerva i to pay for nasa overhead after congress cut nasa s budget to 3 8 billion johnson restored nerva i s funding but not nasa s nerva had plenty of proposed missions nasa considered using saturn v and nerva on a grand tour of solar system a rare alignment of planets that occurs every 174 years occurred between 1976 and 1980 allowing a spacecraft to visit jupiter saturn uranus and neptune with nerva that spacecraft could weigh up to this was assuming nerva had a specific impulse of only was more likely and with that it could place a space station size of skylab into orbit around moon repeat trips to moon could be made with nerva powering a nuclear

returned fuel and a payload this could be repeated as nerva was restartable nerva now needed shuttle but shuttle did not need nerva nerva still had steadfast support of anderson and cannon in senate although former was aging and tiring and now delegated many of his duties to latter nerva received 88 million in fiscal year fy 1970 and 85 million in fy 1971 with funds coming jointly from nasa and aec when nixon tried to kill nerva in 1971 anderson and margaret chase smith killed nixon s pet project boeing 2707 supersonic transport sst instead it was a stunning defeat for president in budget

congress again supported nerva a bi partisan coalition headed by smith and cannon appropriated 100 million for it small nerva engine that would fit inside shuttle s cargo bay was estimated to cost about 250 million over a decade they added a stipulation that there would be no more reprogramming nerva funds to pay for other nasa activities nixon administration decided to cancel nerva anyway on 5 january 1973 nasa announced that nerva was terminated staff at lasl and snpo were stunned project to build a small nerva had been proceeding well layoffs began immediately and snpo was abolished in june after 17 years of research and development projects nova and nerva had spent about 1 4 billion but nerva had never flown post nerva research thumb left artist s impression of a bimodal nuclear thermal rocket in 1983 strategic defense initiative star wars identified missions that could benefit from rockets that are more powerful than chemical rockets and some that could only be undertaken by more powerful rockets a nuclear propulsion project sp 100 was created in february 1983 with aim of developing a 100 kw nuclear rocket system concept incorporated a pebble bed reactor a concept developed by james r powell at brookhaven national laboratory which promised higher temperatures and improved performance over nerva from 1987 to 1991 it was funded as a secret project codenamed project timber wind which spent 139 million proposed rocket was later expanded into a larger design after project was transferred to space nuclear thermal propulsion sntp program at air force phillips laboratory in october 1991 nasa conducted studies as part of its space exploration initiative sei but felt that sntp offered insufficient improvement over nerva and was not required by any sei missions sntp program was terminated in january 1994 after 200 million was spent an engine for interplanetary travel from earth orbit to mars orbit and back was studied in 2013 at msfc with a focus on nuclear thermal rocket ntr engines since ntrs are at least twice as efficient as most advanced chemical engines they allow quicker transfer times and increased cargo capacity shorter flight duration estimated at 3 4 months with ntr engines compared to 8 9 months using chemical engines would reduce crew exposure to potentially harmful and difficult to shield cosmic rays ntr engines like pewee of project rover were selected in mars design reference architecture dra on 22 may 2019 congress approved 125 million in funding for development of nuclear thermal propulsion rockets reactor test summary
