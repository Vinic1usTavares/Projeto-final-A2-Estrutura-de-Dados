thumb king leopold iii subject of political disagreement pictured in 1934 royal question was a major political crisis in belgium that lasted from 1945 to 1951 coming to a head between march and august 1950 question at stake surrounded whether king leopold iii could return to country and resume his royal duties as king of belgians amid allegations that his actions during world war ii had gone contrary to provisions of belgian constitution it was eventually resolved by abdication of leopold in favour of his son baudouin in 1951 crisis emerged from division between leopold and his government led by hubert pierlot during german invasion of 1940 leopold who was suspected of authoritarian sympathies had taken over command of belgian army at outbreak of war considering his constitutional position as commander in chief to take precedence over his civil role as head of state he refused to leave his army and join belgian government in exile in france leopold s refusal to obey government marked a constitutional crisis and after having negotiated surrender to germans on 28 may 1940 leopold was widely condemned during subsequent german occupation leopold was held under house arrest in his palace where he was praised for stoically sharing suffering of ordinary belgians shortly before allies liberated country in 1944 he was deported to germany by nazis with belgium liberated but king still in captivity his brother prince charles count of flanders was elected regent king was declared officially unable to rule in accordance with constitution with country divided along political lines over whether king could ever return to his functions and with left wing dominant politically leopold went into exile in switzerland in 1950 a national referendum was organised by a new centre right government to decide on whether leopold could return although result was a victory for leopoldists it produced a strong regional split between flanders which was broadly in favour of king s return and brussels and wallonia which generally opposed it leopold s return to belgium in july 1950 was greeted with widespread protests in wallonia and a general strike unrest culminated in killing of four workers by police on 30 july with situation fast deteriorating on 1 august 1950 leopold announced his intention to abdicate after a transition period he formally abdicated in favour of baudouin in july 1951 background monarchy and constitution thumb upright belgian crown symbolically resting on constitution in a nineteenth century statue of leopold i belgium gained its independence from united netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy a liberal constitution was written in 1831 which codified responsibilities and restrictions imposed on monarch although king as head of state was prevented from acting without approval of a government minister he was allowed full control of military matters in his capacity as commander in chief which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would lie at heart of royal question first king leopold i accepted terms of constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers this was continued by his successors although with little real success king leopold iii leopold iii came to throne in 1934 after his father albert i died in a mountaineering accident albert known as knight king roi chevalier or ridder had been hugely popular in belgium after commanding belgian army during world war i 1914 18 while much of country was under german occupation leopold s reign was marked by economic crisis in wake of great depression and political agitation by both far left and far right parties amid this period of crisis leopold attempted to expand powers of monarch he was widely suspected of holding authoritarian and right wing political views from 1936 leopold was a strong supporter of belgium s independence policy of political neutrality in face of nazi germany s increasingly aggressive territorial expansion german invasion and occupation 1940 44 on 10 may 1940 german forces invaded neutral belgium without a formal declaration of war leopold headed immediately to fort breendonk headquarters of belgian army near mechelen to take control of army he refused to address belgian parliament beforehand as albert i had famously done at outbreak of world war i speed of german advance using new blitzkrieg approach soon pushed belgian army westwards despite british and french support on 16 may belgian government left brussels break between king and government thumb a modern view of kasteel van wijnendale where final meeting between leopold and belgian government took place on 25 may 1940 soon after outbreak of war king and government began to disagree while government argued that german invasion had violated belgian neutrality and made belgium one of allies leopold argued that belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders leopold opposed allowing british and french forces into belgian territory to fight alongside belgian troops as a breach of its neutrality on 25 may 1940 leopold met senior representatives of his government for a final time at kasteel van wijnendale in west flanders meeting is frequently cited as start of royal question and moment of decisive break between king and government four ministers of government were present hubert pierlot paul henri spaak henri denis and arthur by time of meeting against backdrop of bloody battle of lys belgian government was preparing to continue fight against germany from exile in france they urged king to join them following examples of queen wilhelmina of netherlands and charlotte grand duchess of luxembourg king rejected their arguments and hardened his own position he refused to leave belgian territory and his army in flanders at any cost ministers suspected that leopold s aides were already negotiating with germans meeting broke up with no agreement and belgian government left for france leopold negotiated a cease fire with germans on 27 may 1940 and belgian armed forces officially surrendered following day leopold became a prisoner of war and was placed under house arrest at royal palace of laeken near brussels furious that king had both ignored government and negotiated a surrender without consulting them pierlot gave an angry speech on radio paris condemning king and announcing government s intention to continue fighting alongside allies french politicians notably paul reynaud blamed leopold for growing disaster of battle of france and angrily condemned him as a criminal king roi felon leopold during german occupation with belgian surrender on 28 may 1940 belgium was placed under german occupation and a military administration was established under general alexander von falkenhausen to govern country belgian civil servants were ordered to remain at their posts in order to ensure continued functioning of state and to attempt to protect population from demands of german authorities with france s defeat and installation of pro german vichy regime it was widely believed that germany was about to win war leopold was hailed as a martyr or a symbol of national resilience in contrast to a government that appeared to place its ideology above interests of belgian people on 31 may 1940 senior representative of catholic church in belgium cardinal jozef ernest van roey circulated a pastoral letter calling for all belgians to unite around king other figures in king s entourage particularly authoritarian socialist henri de man believed that democracy had failed and that end of war would see king as ruler of an authoritarian belgian state thumb left modern view of royal palace of laeken where leopold was detained during occupation imprisoned king continued to follow his own political programme he believed that after german victory a new order would be established in europe and that as senior belgian figure in occupied europe he could negotiate with german authorities leopold corresponded with adolf hitler and tried to organise a meeting with him hitler remained uninterested and distrustful of king but on 19 november 1940 leopold succeeded in gaining an unproductive audience with him at berchtesgaden popular support for leopold in belgium declined sharply in december 1941 when news of leopold s remarriage to lilian was made public marriage was deeply unpopular with belgian public image of prisoner king roi prisonnier sharing suffering of belgian prisoners of war was undermined and his popularity fell sharply especially in wallonia home of majority of belgian prisoners still detained popular opinion also turned on king for his perceived unwillingness to speak out against german occupation policies amid german defeats against russians on eastern front after 1942 king prepared for end of war he ordered preparation of a document known as political testament testament politique which would justify his behaviour under occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of belgian prisoners of war and deported workers leopold however continued to condemn action of belgian government in exile based in london after october 1940 on 7 june 1944 following d day he was deported to germany he was finally liberated by american forces on 7 may 1945 regency and early crisis 1944 49 leopold declared unable to reign 1944

german forces offered little resistance and by 4 september allies were in control of brussels although last occupied parts of belgian territory were only liberated in february 1945 on 8 september 1944 government in exile returned to brussels and was greeted with general indifference although king was no longer in country his political testament was presented to returned government as he had wished and was soon circulated publicly at same time a copy was presented to british king george vi and was seen by foreign secretary anthony eden text reignited divisions within government which had been largely hidden since earlier in war since king was still in german custody there was no opposition to creation of a regency in his absence on 20 september 1944 a meeting of both chambers of parliament was called article 82 of constitution was invoked declaring king unable to reign dans l de regner leopold s reclusive brother prince charles count of flanders was elected regent and took oath following day further action on royal question was pushed aside by more pressing economic and political issues that occupied most of government s time with belgium under partial allied military administration until restoration of government services british hostility to leopold s return also complicated issue political recovery and revival of royal question soon after liberation belgium began a period of rapid economic recovery and process of political reconstruction began traditional party system had been torn apart by war and occupation two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties socialists created belgian socialist party psb bsp while catholics and conservatives created christian social party psc cvp biggest change in early post liberation politics was surge of support for communist party of belgium which become third party in belgian politics until 1949 temporarily displacing liberal party walloon movement also re emerged after war promoting

exile under early regency both pierlot and subsequent achille van acker governments attempted to avoid confronting issue of leopold s return despite calls from communists some socialists and trade unionists for king s abdication in april and may 1945 soon after king s liberation van acker and a government delegation headed to strobl austria to negotiate with leopold at a series of meetings between 9 and 11 may 1945 van acker insisted that king publicly announce his support for allied cause and his commitment to parliamentary democracy no agreement was reached in meantime leopold took up residence in pregny near geneva in switzerland under pretext that heart palpitations made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible in belgium political debate about royal question continued and grew after war and remained a polemical topic in popular press notably in francophone newspaper le soir in general election of 1949 psc cvp campaigned on a pro leopold royalist platform results reshaped political landscape communists were routed and psb bsp lost seats to both liberals and catholics catholics gained a new majority in senate and a plurality in chamber of representatives their best results since war gaston eyskens took over as prime minister at head of a liberal catholic coalition both parties in government and leopold himself supported a referendum on king s return which became focus of political attention culmination of crisis 1950 referendum of march 1950 eyskens government agreed to a national referendum known as popular consultation consultation populaire or which was scheduled for 12 march 1950 it was first such vote in belgian history and was intended to be advisory campaigning was vigorous on both sides with little disruption to polls despite contentious nature of subject results of referendum were indecisive leopold s return won a 58 per cent majority in national vote with majorities in seven of nine provinces however vote was heavily divided by region in flanders 72 per cent voted in favour of leopold s return but in arrondissement of brussels leopoldists won only a minority of 48 per cent in wallonia a mere 42 per cent voted for restitution of king final results in percentages by province were result confirmed worries of some including spaak that vote would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide country along regional and linguistic lines on 13 march eyskens traveled to pregny to attempt to encourage leopold to abdicate paul van zeeland and spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which leopold would abdicate in favour of his son on 15 april 1950 leopold announced that he was willing to temporarily delegate his authority many within psc cvp realised that despite referendum s result their party s lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around king as long as their liberal coalition partners and socialist opponents were unwilling to accept king s return leopold s return to belgium on 29 april 1950 charles dissolved parliament pending fresh elections his intention was probably to prevent formation of a psc cvp government under van zeeland a staunch leopoldist which would lead to return of king without further discussion following election produced an absolute psc cvp majority in both chamber and senate and a new single party government under jean duvieusart was formed one of first acts of duvieusart government was to introduce a bill bringing impossibility to reign to an end on 22 july 1950 leopold returned to belgium for first time since june 1944 and resumed his functions general strike and abdication thumb left memorial plaque at grace berleur near liege commemorating four

supporting strike action taken in event of king s return union took lead in opposition which emerged in summer of 1950 andre renard a walloon trade union leader called for insurrection and revolution in newspaper la wallonie shortly after king s return in july 1950 modern historians have noted that smell of revolution was on air as walloon nationalists called for immediate secession of wallonia and creation of a republic general strike of 1950 began in coal mining centres of hainaut and quickly spread workers were soon on strike across wallonia brussels and to a lesser extent flanders port of antwerp was one of key sites affected and country was virtually paralysed on 30 july four workers were shot dead by gendarmerie at grace berleur near liege and violence intensified staunch leopoldists in government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority even in psc cvp frustrated at lack of progress government threatened to resign en masse as situation escalated national confederation of political prisoners and their dependents confederation nationale des politiques et des droit nationale van en or cnppa ncpgr organisation representing political prisoners detained during german occupation offered to act as intermediaries between different parties because of their respected status cnppa ncpgr succeeded in persuading both king and government to reopen negotiations which resumed on 31 july in afternoon on 1 august leopold publicly announced his intention to abdicate in favour of his eldest son baudouin to avoid further bloodshed baudouin at age of 19 became regent with title of prince royal on 11 august 1950 accession of baudouin 1951 thumb upright king baudouin photographed in 1960 who succeeded leopold in 1951 leopold s abdication message of 1 august 1950 was premised on a reconciliation in person of his eldest son over course of a year baudouin was seen by most parties as an acceptable alternative candidate under a law of 11 august executive powers were transferred to baudouin in advance of official abdication leopold formally abdicated on 16 july 1951 his son succeeded him following day assassination of julien lahaut on 11 august 1950 as baudouin was taking oath of allegiance to constitution in front of parliament an unidentified individual in communist benches shouted vive la republique long live republic interruption caused outrage it was widely suspected that culprit was julien lahaut noted communist leader who had been one of leading opponents of leopold s return a week later 18 august lahaut was shot dead by an unidentified assassin outside his house in seraing near liege murder shocked belgian public and an estimated 200 000 people attended lahaut s funeral although no one was ever prosecuted for murder it was widely attributed to clandestine leopoldist militia like ligue or bloc belge who operated with knowledge of security services aftermath and significance in aftermath of royal question national priorities shifted to other political questions on 17 september 1950 government of joseph announced its intention of dispatching belgian volunteers to fight in korean war negotiations about european defence community followed and by mid 1950s belgium was immersed in a new political crisis known as second school war surrounding secularisation of education in august 1960 baudouin informed prime minister gaston eyskens that he did not have confidence in his government and asked for his resignation eyskens refused and challenged king to invoke article 65 of constitution and unilaterally revoke his ministerial mandate fearing that such an action would reopen royal question baudouin yielded modern historians describe royal question as an important moment in belgian recovery after world war ii opposition between leopoldists and anti leopoldists led to re establishment of socialist and catholic political parties from before war question was also an important moment in belgian linguistic conflict it also put an end to federalisation of belgian institutions which might exacerbate regional tensions exposed by royal question in addition perceived failure of psc cvp to realise flemish demands for return of leopold helped to strengthen support for flemish nationalist party after 1954 in wallonia legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during general strike paved way for a left wing revival of walloon movement lahaut assassination was not solved and it remains contentious as only political murder in belgian history apart from death of socialist politician andre cools in 1991 leopoldists were suspected but no individual was prosecuted in aftermath an enquiry by historians rudy van and etienne named an alleged culprit a final report commissioned by
