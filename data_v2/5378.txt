company logo obscured production development casino royale had been produced as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film eon productions gained rights to casino royale in 1999 after sony pictures entertainment exchanged them for metro goldwyn mayer s rights to spider man in march 2004 neal purvis and robert wade began writing a screenplay for pierce brosnan as bond aiming to bring back flavour of ian fleming s original bond novels paul haggis main contribution was to rewrite climax of film he explained draft that was there was very faithful to book and there was a confession so in original draft character confessed and killed herself she then sent bond to chase after villains bond chased villains into house i don t know why but i thought that vesper had to be in sinking house and bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her broccoli and wilson were mindful that die another day had become too fantastical barbara broccoli and michael g wilson interview producing skyfall den of geek feeling next film should be more realistic director quentin tarantino expressed interest in directing an adaptation of casino royale but eon was not interested he claims to have worked behind scenes with fleming family and believed this was reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with casino royale tarantino also said he would have set it in 1960s and would have only made it with pierce brosnan as bond in february 2005 martin campbell was announced as film s director later in 2005 sony led a consortium that purchased mgm allowing sony to gain distribution rights starting with film eon believed that it had relied too heavily on computer generated imagery effects in more recent films particularly die another day and was keen to accomplish stunts in casino royale old fashioned way in keeping with this drive for more realism screenwriters purvis wade and haggis wanted script to follow as closely as possible original 1953 novel keeping fleming s darker storyline and characterisation of bond due to then existing copyright issues related to ownership of thunderball organisation of which mr white is a part is not named spectre casting pierce brosnan had signed a deal for four films when he was cast in role of james bond this was fulfilled with production of die another day in 2002 at this stage brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday brosnan kept in mind fans and critics were not happy with roger moore playing bond until he was 58 and speculation began that producers were seeking to replace brosnan with a younger actor brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in february 2004 at one point producer michael g wilson claimed over 200 names were being considered for his replacement croatian actor goran auditioned for role same day as craig but was reportedly unable to master a british accent new zealander karl urban was considered but was unable to make screen test due to filming commitments according to martin campbell henry cavill was only other actor in serious contention for role but at 22 years old he was considered too young australian actor sam worthington and scottish actor dougray scott were also considered hugh jackman was approached to play character just before craig was chosen to play bond but turned it down due to other commitments in may 2005 english actor daniel craig stated mgm and producers michael g wilson and barbara broccoli had assured him he would get role of bond and matthew vaughn told reporters mgm offered him opportunity to direct new film but eon productions at that point had not approached either of them a year beforehand craig rejected idea of starring as he felt series had descended into formula only when he read script did he become interested craig read all of fleming s novels to prepare for part and cited mossad and british secret service agents who served as advisors on set of munich as inspiring because bond has just come out of service and he s a killer you can see it in their eyes you know immediately oh hello he s a killer there s a look these guys walk into a room and very subtly they check perimeters for an exit that s sort of thing i wanted on 14 october 2005 eon productions sony pictures entertainment and mgm announced at a press conference in london that craig would be sixth actor to portray james bond taking time off from reshoots for invasion a business suit clad rather long haired craig boarded a royal marines rigid raider from before travelling to hms president where he was introduced to world s press controversy followed

gunther von hagens also has a cameo appearance in film although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen effects in designing credit sequence for film graphic designer daniel kleinman was inspired by cover of 1953 british first edition of casino royale which featured ian fleming s original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood kleinman said hearts not only represent cards but tribulations of bond s love story so i took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in titles like a club representing a puff of gun smoke and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts in creating shadow images of sequence kleinman digitised footage of craig and film s stuntmen on inferno visual effects system at framestore cfc in london actors silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns kleinman decided not to use female silhouettes commonly seen throughout bond title sequences considering that women did not fit with both film s spirit and storyline following bond falling in love for rest of film chris corbould special effects and miniature effects supervisor returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects according to corbould cgi is a great tool and can be very useful but i will fight to tooth and nail to do something for real it s best way to go three scenes involving primarily physical effects in film were chase at a building site in madagascar miami airport chase sequence and

non uk irish and us or canada markets film retained top spot at worldwide box office for four weeks critical response critics responded with praise to film in particular to craig s performance and credibility during production craig had been subject to debate by media and public as he did not appear to fit ian fleming s original portrait of character as tall dark and suave daily telegraph compared quality of craig s characterisation of bond to sean connery s and praised script as smartly written noting how film departed from series conventions times compared craig s portrayal of character to that of timothy dalton and praised action as edgy with another reviewer citing in particular action sequence involving cranes in madagascar critics paul arendt of bbc films kim newman of empire and todd mccarthy of variety all described craig as first actor to truly embody ian fleming s james bond from original novel ironic brutal and cold arendt commented craig is first actor to really nail 007 s defining characteristic he s an absolute swine film was similarly well received in north america msnbc gave movie a perfect 5 star rating film was described as taking james bond back to his roots similar to from russia with love where focus was on character and plot rather than high tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in die another day on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes film received an approval rating of 94 based on 254 reviews with an average rating of 7 87 10 site s critical consensus reads casino royale disposes of silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent james bond outings and daniel craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for a caustic haunted intense reinvention of 007 it is fourth highest rating for a bond film on site behind goldfinger which earned a 97 score and from russia with love and dr no both of which earned a 96 score on metacritic film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics indicating generally favorable reviews entertainment weekly named film as fifth best of series and chose vesper lynd as fourth best bond girl in series some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by craig s performance to consider him a viable candidate for an academy award nomination roger ebert gave film a four out of four star rating and wrote that craig makes a superb bond who gives sense of a hard man wounded by life and his job who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong and that film has answers to all my complaints about 45 year old james bond series specifically why nobody in a bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions time out new york s joshua rothkopf called craig best bond in franchise s history citing actor s crisp hateful mamet worthy snarl this is a screwed up bond a rogue bond a bounder a scrapper and in movie s astoundingly bleak coda an lover vicky allan of sunday herald noted bond himself and not his love interests was sexually objectified in this film a moment where he rises from sea is reminiscent of ursula andress in dr no he feels skewered by vesper lynd s criticism of him and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation that is exactly what happens to bond in film so although film backed off from past criticism of bond girls being sex objects once invincible james bond becomes just another joint at meat market this sentiment is shared by university of leicester s james chapman author of license to thrill who also notes craig s bond is not yet polished article he felt his incarnation of bond is close to fleming s because he is humourless but is also different because fleming s bond did not enjoy killing craig s bond seems almost to relish it andrew sarris of new york observer wrote that this particular bond film is very first that i would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10 best list furthermore i consider daniel craig to be most effective and appealing of six actors who have played 007 and that includes even sean connery roger moore wrote daniel craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing casino royale by introducing a more gritty unrefined edge to character that i thought sean connery might just have to move over craig s interpretation was like nothing we d seen on screen before jimmy bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes it was intriguing to see him being castigated by m just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster script showed him as a vulnerable troubled and flawed character quite opposite to my bond craig was and is very much bond ian fleming had described in books a ruthless killing machine it was a bond that public wanted so impressed was moore that he chose to buy dvd raymond benson author of nine bond novels called casino royale a perfect bond film however film met with mixed reactions from other critics rob gonsalves of efilmcritic com gave film a positive review but commented when you strip 007 films down for action and realism you lose soul of those old beloved bond movies they might as well be jason bourne movies john of commercial appeal said who wants to see bond learn a lesson about ego as if he were greg brady in his johnny bravo phase anthony lane of new yorker criticised more imperfect and self aware depiction of character saying even james bond in other words wants to be 007 though american radio personality michael medved gave film three stars out of four describing it as intriguing audacious and very original more believable and less cartoonish than previous 007 extravaganzas he commented that sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some bond fanatics similarly a reviewer for sun praised film for its darkness and craig s performance but felt that like novel it suffers from a lack of sharpness in plot and believed that it required additional editing particularly finale commentators such as emanuel levy concurred feeling ending was too long and that film s terrorist villains lacked depth although he praised craig and gave film a b overall other reviewers responded negatively including tim adams of observer who felt film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make series grittier in december 2006 casino royale was named best film of year by viewers of film 2006 sequence with craig sporting swimming trunks topped sexiest male celebrity poll of sun and in 2009 uk ice cream company del monte superfruit smoothies launched an
