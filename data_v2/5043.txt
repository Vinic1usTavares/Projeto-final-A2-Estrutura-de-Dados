thumb yamaha ns 10 studio monitor identifiable by its horizontal lettering and distinctive white cone yamaha ns 10 is a loudspeaker that became a standard nearfield studio monitor in music industry among rock and pop recording engineers launched in 1978 ns 10 started life as a bookshelf speaker destined for domestic environment it was poorly received but eventually became a valuable tool with which to mix rock recordings speaker has a characteristic white coloured mid bass drive unit technically it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it resulting in what became known as tissue paper effect a type of comb filtering ns 10 has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists leading gizmodo to refer to it as most important loudspeaker you never heard of history originally conceived as a domestic hi fi speaker ns 10 was designed by akira nakamura and launched in 1978 speaker was poorly received recording engineers came to rely on ns 10 as a benchmark model was discontinued in 2001 ns 10 displaced auratone 5c sound cube as nearfield monitor of choice in 1980s and was recognised for its ability to reveal shortcomings in recordings it probably first reached american shores through a recording engineer s visit to japan engineer likely to have been greg ladanyi monitored a recording session through speaker in a japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to us ladanyi then began using speakers in a los angeles studio other engineers heard ns 10 for first time and were impressed by its sound its use spread to new york where ns 10 was adopted at power station and other studios early use of ns 10 among engineers include bob clearmountain rhett davies and bill in us and nigel jopson in uk clearmountain then a rising star in record production is often credited for popularity of ns 10 phil ward writing in sound on sound suggested that clearmountain was probably not earliest but was certainly most influential early adopter it became a legend that clearmountain had chosen it because it was worst speaker he could find he was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones and a pair of yamaha ns 10 as a reference recording studios around world particularly those specialising in rock and pop music adopted speaker as standard in excess of 200 000 pairs were sold throughout world gizmodo referred to it as most important loudspeaker you never heard of yamaha stopped manufacturing speaker in 2001 citing problems sourcing wood pulp for drivers even years after it was discontinued speaker continued to be found in studios everywhere mix reported in 2008 that variants of ns 10 were still commercially available in japanese consumer market design and construction ns 10 is an 8 ohm two way loudspeaker with a 10 4 litre sealed cabinet measuring and weighing its particle board cabinet has a wood veneer skin with seven black finishing layers domestic version of speaker was vertically orientated and came factory fitted with a grille its two drivers are a 180 mm paper woofer and a 35 mm soft domed tweeter woofer s diaphragm weighing 3 7 g is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper unconventionally it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure but by curling and then gluing two ends together against black finish of cabinet white bass mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic feature of product network is second order passive crossing over at 2 khz frequency range is quoted from 60 hz to 20 khz and rated power handling is 25 50 w early version of speaker has press down type input terminals later models had screw terminals signature sound in simplistic terms ns 10 possesses sonic characteristics that allow record producers to assume that if a recording sounds good on these monitors then it should sound good on most playback systems whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in recording mix as well as monitoring chain it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in domestic setting ns 10 does not have a perfectly flat frequency response sound of ns 10 is slightly heavy in midrange and like other sealed box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited it has a 5 db boost in midrange at around 2 khz and bottom end starts rolling off at 200 hz midrange response is so open that it exposes frequencies that are most problematic and worst sounding to human ear on a practical level for music professional speaker is analytic and clinical sounding gizmodo likened ns 10 to music editors who reveal weaknesses of recordings so that engineers would be forced to either make necessary compensation in mix or otherwise rework them a 2001 report by newell et al at southampton university undertaken for studio sound in 2001 found that ns 10 had excellent time domain response at low frequencies its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors part of this was related to its closed box design researchers held that extremely fast decay time of speaker in low frequencies ensures that bass instruments guitar and drums are correctly balanced in mix product revisions there were many other versions of ns 10 best known of which were ns 10m studio and ns 10m pro both introduced in 1987 technically identical to studio pro comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation professional version launched some nine years after its first introduction on back of popularity of ns 10 among engineers revised version with everything including logo and connection panel orientated horizontally was badged ns 10m studio improvements included a new tweeter and crossover to address problem in treble better connection terminals and a sturdier cabinet that no longer accommodates grilles studio reincarnation also has improved power handling 60 120 w in excess of 200 000 pairs of studio alone were sold throughout world also in product line up were ns ns 10m x ns ns 10mt ns 10m x is a studio with magnetic shielding and a different tweeter in 1990s yamaha introduced ns 10mt a bass reflex version of 10m x with a different tweeter and grille designed for home cinema it has bass response down to 43 hz nominal impedance of 6 ohm and maximum power handling rated at 180 w a miniature version named natural sound surround speaker was launched in 1997 or 1998 reception sound quality of ns 10 has polarised opinions characterised as love them or hate them many professionals find it indispensable even though they may not particularly enjoy listening to it others refuse to give it space in their studio but will happily admit that it is an effective professional tool reliance on ns 10 by top independent producers became a viral phenomenon thousands of studios equipped themselves with ns 10s to attract big named producers making speakers an industry standard tissue paper effect clearmountain was said to have been one of first recording engineers to hang tissue paper over tweeters of ns 10 to tame over bright treble covering tweeters with tissue paper was said to produce treble deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi fi phenomenon became subject of hot debate recording engineer bob hodas investigated alleged sonic effects of tissue paper he found inconsistent results with different paper but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering where high frequencies are reflected back into tweeter instead of being absorbed hodas derided tissue practice as aberrant behaviour saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects he also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable newell et al noted that had speakers grilles been used in studios where they are routinely removed they would have had same effect on treble output as improvised tissue paper filter influence speaker came to be relied on by independent engineers who worked in different studios and needed equipment they were familiar with as a reference point throughout 1980s engineers and producers worked widely with speaker to monitor almost any album you love from 80s or 90s from born in u s a bruce springsteen avalon roxy music let s dance david bowie to big bam boom hall and oates ns 10 and auratone before it are two of most influential nearfield monitors used in professional mixing of sound recordings in 2008 ns 10 was inducted into mix magazine hall of fame also reflecting its influence speaker won a technical grammy for yamaha in 2007 in 2008 speaker was found in almost every studio as ns 10 has been out of production for many years in late 2018 with chris lord alge world famous mix engineer and proponent of ns 10 released cla 10 although they were careful not to mention it in any of company s materials many have speculated that cla 10 is an ns 10 clone to fill market gap left by yamaha when they stopped production of original ns 10 in january of 2019 minneapolis speaker company launched a new brand of speakers called bold north audio their first product ms 10w is stated to be ideal replacement woofer for ns 10m website includes copious amounts of engineering data showing driver and in system comparisons see also
