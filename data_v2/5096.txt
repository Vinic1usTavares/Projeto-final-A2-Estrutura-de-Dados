area 51 a military base frequently subject of conspiracy theories 200px thumb right garry shandling was initially sought out to play part of fletcher however he was unavailable because he was filming a movie called town and country but he would later appear in seventh season episode hollywood a d playing a fictional version of himself shapiro pp 229 240 production staff began looking for a replacement going through as show s casting director rick millikan put it lists and lists of potential actors vince gilligan noted however that mckean was at top of our list from beginning meisler p 64 mckean was very happy to play part although he did specifically ask writers not to kill off his character meisler p 53 julia vera was cast in role of lana chee hopi woman whose mind is switched with that of a young air force pilot in order to age her vera wore special makeup and facial appliances special contact lenses were also crafted giving her eyes a clouded look scene in which she flicks a cigarette butt into mulder s lap took five takes to get because lenses obstructed her vision filming production for dreamland necessitated series to temporarily relocate to club ed a movie ranch near lancaster california because club ed was almost 100 miles away from fox studios most of show s crew had to camp out in motels located in desert because this filming location was outside los angeles studio zone fox was required to pay all actors and production staff members a per diem covering cost of meals and motel reservations leading to budget constraints meisler p 65 half way through episode s production duchovny was reported as saying when is this show moving back to los angeles within days crew had made t shirts that humorously featured question meisler p 67 many of locations in episode were created from scratch either through conventional means or through computer technology for instance gas station that explodes was erected by props department outside lancaster and fitted with gas pumps from a station that had recently closed store was then loaded with merchandise and then rigged for detonation after set was destroyed and filming ceased remnants were quickly cleared away according to set decorator duke it was if whole thing never even existed area 51 government airplanes and alien craft were all created with cgi technology by visual effects producer bill millar meisler p 66 originally time warp effect resembled a blue sheet according to producer john shiban sans blurring effect visible in finished episode eventually production crew felt that this effect was not effective and so footage was blurred in order to create a more convincing molecular effect other locations were either real or were filmed with use of stand ins gate for area 51 set for instance was filmed at a desolate stretch of fence near los angeles san bernardino county division scene was later supplemented with a matte painting to complete effect while there really is a little a le inn cafe in rachel nevada along route 375 neither outside or inside of this location was featured in episode choreography scene where mulder as fletcher encounters his reflection and proceeds to dance is an homage to marx brothers comedy film duck soup 1933 initially producers thought about creating scene with expensive digital effects duchovny and mckean however volunteered to do it old fashioned way by choreographing their moves so that they would be in sync duchovny and mckean each watched duck soup and then practiced their routine for a week and a half during filming a metronome was used so that two actors could keep time with each other this ticking was then removed during post production effect was furthered by a unique set that was actually two bedrooms both mirror images of each other only part of this dance that required any cgi was when mulder fogs up mirror with his breath reception ratings dreamland first aired in united states on november 29 and dreamland ii aired on

part of episode with line can he get back reviews episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics with many commenting on episode s reliance on humor in a review of part one a critic from knight ridder wrote as disorienting as this body transfer had to be for mulder experience provided amusing television and that seems to be a problem for some x files fans knowing that human population s survival is imperiled by colonization plans of a fierce extraterrestrial race a large number of x philes want show to focus on our heroes efforts to come to rescue newspaper s review of part 2 was much more negative with article saying by end of latest x files episode we were wishing we could push a reset button on dreamland ii just to forget some of silly stuff that transpired in this show robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode two stars out of five and noted that episode lacked structure and point shearman and pearson p 172 paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave both episodes mixed reviews awarding first part two and a half stars out of four and second part two stars vitaris was unhappy with amount of comedy used in episode noting that once mulder visited fletcher s house comedy turns sour she argued that members of fletcher s family were examples of caricatures despite this she praised scene featuring murder of gas station attendant claiming that for a moment this episode really clicks vitaris in her review for part two called episode purely illogical although she noted it did feature minor fun pointing out scene wherein scully catches fletcher by handcuffing him not all reviews were completely negative zack handlen from a v club wrote positively of first part of episode s humor and awarded it a b handlen noted that context of seeing actors in wrong places is what s funny about episode however he did slightly criticize episode s padding specifically nora dunn s role as fletcher s wife and duck soup mirror gag but argued that for every bit that doesn t play in episode there are three that do emily vanderwerff also from a v club gave second half of episode a b and wrote i have basically nothing to add to what zack said about first dreamland last week dreamland ii is a fairly unnecessary hour of television and there s no reason this logy two parter couldn t have become a much tighter one hour episode tom kessenich in his book examination an unauthorized look at seasons 6 9 of x files wrote that my final judgement on dreamland part one is that i enjoyed entertainment value it presented it was fun and i m not one to a little romp now and then kessenich p 21 kessenich however did note that second part felt strung out kessenich p 23 den of geek writer juliette harrisson however saw episode in a more positive light and said season six included some more excellent episodes only peripherally related to main story arc such as dreamland parts one and two kerry fall from dvd journal wrote positively of episodes and described them together as one of best episodes in years gareth wigmore of tv zone gave first part of episode an 8 out of 10 rating and
