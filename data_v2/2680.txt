considered for one of students at x mansion singer remembered we thought about gambit as young boy on basketball field but feeling was that if he has basketball and then releases it and it exploded then people would be like what s wrong with those basketballs kevin feige had a cameo as a weapon x tech but his scenes did not make final cut of film production development alt drawing of an ape man wearing trunks he has huge muscular arms that hang down past his knees thumb concept art for beast before character was deleted from subsequent scripts by industrial light magic marvel comics writers and chief editors gerry conway and roy thomas wrote an x men screenplay in 1984 when orion pictures held an option on film rights but development stalled when orion began facing financial troubles throughout 1989 and 1990 stan lee and chris claremont were in discussions with carolco pictures for an x men film adaptation with james cameron as producer and kathryn bigelow directing a story treatment was written by bigelow with bob hoskins being considered for wolverine and angela bassett being considered for role of storm deal fell apart when stan lee piqued cameron s interest on a spider man film carolco going bankrupt and film rights reverting to marvel in december 1992 marvel discussed selling property to columbia pictures to no avail meanwhile avi arad produced animated x men tv series for fox kids 20th century fox was impressed by success of tv show and producer lauren shuler donner purchased film rights for them in 1994 bringing andrew kevin walker to write script walker s draft involved professor xavier recruiting wolverine into x men which consists of cyclops jean grey iceman beast and angel brotherhood of mutants which consisted of magneto sabretooth toad juggernaut and blob try to conquer new york city while henry peter and bolivar trask attack x men with three tall sentinels script focused on rivalry between wolverine and cyclops as well as latter s self doubt as a field leader part of backstory invented for magneto made him cause of chernobyl disaster script also featured x copter and danger room walker turned in his second draft in june 1994 john logan james and joss whedon were brought on for subsequent rewrites one of these scripts kept idea of magneto turning manhattan into a mutant homeland while another hinged on a romance between wolverine and storm whedon s draft featured danger room and concluded with jean grey dressed as phoenix according to entertainment weekly this screenplay was rejected because of its quick witted pop culture referencing tone and finished film contained only two dialogue exchanges that whedon had contributed michael chabon pitched a six page film treatment to fox in 1996 it focused heavily on character development between wolverine and jubilee and included professor x cyclops jean grey nightcrawler beast iceman and storm under chabon s plan villains would not have been introduced until second film fox considered brett ratner as director ratner would go on to direct x men last stand and offered position to robert rodriguez but he turned it down after commercial success of mortal kombat in united states paul w s anderson was offered position but turned it down wanting to shift away from making another pg 13 rated film in favour of making an r rated horror film event horizon following release of usual suspects bryan singer was looking to do a science fiction film and fox offered him alien resurrection but producer tom desanto felt he would be more appropriate for x men themes of prejudice in comic resonated with singer by december 1996 singer was in director s position while ed solomon was hired to write script in april 1997 and singer went to film apt pupil fox then announced a christmas 1998 release date in late 1997 budget was projected at 60million in 1998 claremont returned to marvel and seeing how fox was still struggling with script sent them a four page long memo where he explained core concepts and what differentiated x men from other superheroes dark phoenix comic creator on pitching james cameron and 4 page memo that made x men in late 1998 singer and desanto sent a treatment to fox which they believed was perfect because it took seriously themes and comparisons between xavier and magneto and martin luther king and malcolm x unlike other scripts they made rogue an important character because singer recognized that her mutation which renders her unable to touch anyone was most symbolic of alienation singer merged attributes of kitty pryde and jubilee into film s depiction of rogue magneto s plot to mutate world leaders into accepting his people is reminiscent of how constantine i s conversion to christianity ended persecution of early christians in roman empire analogy was emphasized in a deleted scene in which storm teaches history senator kelly s claim that he has a list of mutants living in united states recalls joseph mccarthy s similar claim regarding communists fox who had projected budget at 75million rejected treatment which they estimated would have cost 5million more beast nightcrawler pyro and danger room had to be deleted before studio greenlighted x men fox head bill mechanic argued that this would enhance story and singer concurred that removing danger room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred elements of beast particularly his medical expertise were transferred to jean grey singer and desanto brought christopher mcquarrie from usual suspects and together did another rewrite david hayter simultaneously rewrote screenplay receiving solo screenplay credit from writers guild of america while singer and desanto were given story credit wga offered mcquarrie a credit but he voluntarily took his name off when final version was more in line with hayter s script than his casting russell crowe was singer s first choice to play wolverine but he turned it down instead recommending his friend actor hugh jackman for part jackman was an unknown actor at time while a number of more established actors offered their services for role with singer casting dougray scott part of scott s contract included a sequel but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with mission impossible 2 in early october 1999 and was injured in a motorbike accident jackman was then cast three weeks into filming based on a successful audition glenn danzig was invited by 20th century fox to audition for role of wolverine as his height and build closely resemble that of film s protagonist as described in original comic books however he declined due to scheduling conflicts with his band keanu reeves gary sinise mel gibson aaron eckhart jean claude van damme viggo mortensen edward norton and bob hoskins were also considered for role of wolverine jeri ryan was in running for role of mystique patrick stewart was first approached by singer to play xavier on set of conspiracy theory 1997 which was directed by x men executive producer richard donner jim caviezel was originally cast as cyclops but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with frequency james marsden

angela bassett was studio s first choice to portray storm but she was too expensive to cast at time janet jackson and mariah carey were also considered for role of storm anna paquin dropped out of lead role in tart in favor of x men drew barrymore sarah michelle gellar jennifer love hewitt katie holmes christina ricci alicia silverstone and katharine isabelle were considered for role of rogue although natalie portman turned it down selma blair renee o connor lucy lawless and maria bello were considered for role of jean grey peta wilson was offered role of jean grey but had to film fourth season of la femme nikita 1997 instead and helen hunt was asked to play jean grey but she turned down role david hemblen christopher lee and terence stamp were considered for magneto before singer cast ian mckellen who had acted in his previous film apt pupil mckellen responded to gay allegory of film allegory of mutants as outsiders disenfranchised and alone and coming to all of that at puberty when their difference manifests singer explained ian is an activist and he really responded to potential of that allegory filming original start date was mid 1999 with release date set for christmas 2000 but fox moved x men to june steven spielberg had been scheduled to film minority report for release in june 2000 but he had chosen to film a i artificial intelligence and fox needed a film to fill void this meant that singer had to finish x men six months ahead of schedule although filming had been pushed back release date was then moved to july 14 filming took place from september 22 1999 to march 3 2000 in toronto and in hamilton ontario locations included central commerce collegiate distillery district and canadian warplane heritage museum casa loma roy thomson hall and metro hall were used for x mansion interiors while parkwood estate located in oshawa east of toronto was chosen for exteriors spencer smith park in burlington ontario doubled for liberty island post production was hectic with shuler donner saying that we had to lock picture and score and edit sometimes at same time design and effects filmmakers decided not to replicate x men costumes as seen in comic book stan lee and chris claremont supported this decision claremont joked you can do that on a drawing but when you put it on people it s disturbing producer co writer tom desanto had been supportive of using blue and yellow color scheme of comics but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen to acknowledge fan complaints singer added cyclops line what would you prefer yellow spandex when wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms during filming singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for x men to wear as protective clothing and shuler donner added that costumes helped them blend into night oakley inc provided red lensed glasses worn by cyclops a customized version of company s own x metal juliet wolverine s claws required no cast of hugh jackman s hands and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer gordon smith refused to do it production also insisted on real metal blades which smith also refused to do making injection moulded plaster blades instead hundreds of pairs were built for jackman and his stunt doubles gordon smith rebecca romijn stamos wore 110 individual silicone prosthetics on her body to portray mystique only edges were glued rest were self sticking prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body they were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint original agreed to and tested design was to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well but at last minute bryan singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque as in comic book which added six hours to makeup making ordeal very difficult for her there were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes during one of canada s colder winters gordon smith romijn reflected i had almost no contact with rest of cast it was like i was making a different movie from everyone else it was hell in late 1990s computer generated imagery was becoming more commonly used singer visited sets of star wars episode i phantom menace and titanic to understand practical and digital effects filming had started without a special effects company hired digital domain cinesite construction co hammerhead production matte world digital core and pop were all hired in december 1999 visual effects supervisor mike fink admitted to have been dissatisfied with his work on x men in 2003 despite nearly being nominated for an academy award fx2 visual effects 2003 20th century fox digital domain s technical director sean c cunningham and lead compositor claas henke morphed bruce davison into a liquid figure for kelly s mutation scene cunningham said there were many digital layers water without refraction water with murkiness skin with and without highlights skin with goo in it when rendered together it took 39 hours per frame they considered showing kelly s internal organs during transformation but that seemed too gruesome according to cunningham music singer approached john williams to compose film score but williams turned down offer because of scheduling conflicts then singer set on his usual composer john ottman however once fox pushed x men from december to july ottman s commitment to direct urban legends final cut made him unable to work with singer john ottman on urban legend final cut michael kamen was eventually hired given film was only completed shortly before its premiere kamen wrote score to finished scenes which were sent to him just as work was done on them singer asked him not to use any songs in soundtrack as he didn t want to date movie x marks spot due to kamen s unfamiliarity with comics he only tried to represent bryan singer s filmic tone that he s made for a comic book a quite serious movie which is about capacity of humanity to categorize people by race religion or type and prejudice people against them based on their innate characteristics character specific themes were written to identify these characters as you go through film because they re not always clear for instance mystique s motif focused on cello as kamen found it a very erotic sounding instrument played in soundtrack as she was disguised as wolverine due to time restrictions producers scrapped their original plan to record score in london and did it in los angeles kamen s first draft of score had been described as having an abundance of themes and rich orchestrations during early recording sessions producer lauren shuler donner expressed her dissatisfaction with kamen s music and forced him to rewrite entire score by using fewer themes and more electronic elements release marketing fox broadcasting company aired a special

sequel just as a reward for absorbing it all while x men doesn t take your breath away wire to wire way matrix did it s an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp to it net s james berardinelli an x men comic book fan believed film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition character development and special effects enhanced action neither plot nor character relationships are difficult to follow and movie avoids trap of spending too much time explaining things that don t need to be explained x men fandom is likely to be divided over whether picture is a success or a failure desson thomson of washington post commented t he movie s enjoyable on surface but i suspect many people even die hards will be less enthusiastic about what lies or doesn t underneath roger ebert of chicago sun times said he started out liking this movie while waiting for something really interesting to happen when nothing did i still didn t dislike it i assume x men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel and maybe find time to get involved in a story no doubt fans of comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior they should linger in lobby after each screening to answer questions he also gave it a thumbs down on ebert roeper peter travers of rolling stone noted since it s wolverine s movie any x men or women who don t hinge directly on his story get short shrift as storm halle berry can do neat tricks with weather but her role is gone with wind it sucks that stewart and mckellen two superb actors are
