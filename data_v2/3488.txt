designed by regionally significant architect marcus f cummings downtown street plan was borrowed from philadelphia and one neighborhood washington square was influenced by london s squares of its era district reflects troy s evolution from its origins as a hudson river port into an early industrial center built around textile manufacture and steelmaking during this period it was rebuilt twice in wake of two devastating fires resulting in its mix of architecture styles after decline of its industries in mid 20th century downtown troy was threatened by urban renewal efforts that galvanized local preservationists leading to early nrhp listings and eventually creation of district today city of troy protects and preserves district with special provisions in its zoning and programs which with assistance from state of new york encourage and subsidize property owners who maintain and restore historic buildings these efforts have paid off with increased attention from developers revival of much of area and praise from visitors to city with collaboration of nearby rensselaer polytechnic institute rpi troy is hoping to make district a center for development of cutting edge technologies

are one block washington park near its southern end and seminary park main quad at russell sage most of major streets and central area of district are lined with multi story dwellings that are primarily commercial but with a mix of office and residential space on their upper floors on side streets there are smaller scale residential townhouses institutional use is limited to russell sage a few churches rpi s buildings and governmental structures like county courthouse and post office no industrial use past or present is within district with notable exception of gurley building and even that has been scaled back in recent years 2016 expansion in 2014 state historic preservation board considered a boundary adjustment that removes a small area at northeast corner but adds far more primarily at southeast it would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend district s period of significance to 1978 to take into account city s urban renewal era most of new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in district or accidentally excluded when district was originally designated lafrank 5 8 two years later national park service officially approved expansion most significant change to district is extension on southeast to boundary of city s eighth ward in 1870 between adams and ferry streets three blocks would be added with new boundary

industrial building in proposed expanded district former paper works on northwest corner of fifth and liberty streets area has begun to see some restoration efforts such as some greek revival rowhouses on liberty street near fourth which will benefit from state tax credits should area be added to district on west side boundary would be extended a block from first to river street at
