auditions alexandre began working as maslany s clone double playing opposite maslany in any scene when multiple clones interact and being replaced with maslany in post production fawcett and manson had planned to cast alexandre in her own role from start of show s second season and had considered casting her as gracie before deciding that due to amount of interaction between gracie and helena played by maslany it would turn into a mess if we cast her they decided to find a smaller role for alexandre and eventually settled on part of alexis thumb left some scenes from episode were filmed at bridgepoint health centre left and don jail right scenes in garage were filmed on a set set replicated real garage of a house in markham ontario which had been used for filming in show s first season set was built above ground so that it could be excavated with a jackhammer on film bridgepoint health centre stood in as clinic where kira underwent bone marrow extraction and was also used for exterior shots of dyad institute scenes at cosima s laboratory were filmed at don jail now an administrative facility connected to bridgepoint montage of rachel drinking martinis and watching home videos from her childhood was not originally included in episode s script nor was it filmed with rest of episode according to fawcett when he and manson viewed final cut of episode they felt that something was missing from rachel s subplot manson then scripted short sequence and fawcett filmed it over two days during production of next episode due to time constraints while filming scene in which helena tortures henrik scene was shot with a handheld camera by episode s director tj scott with maslany and outerbridge improvising dialogue and use of props subsequent shot of barn on fire was created by visual effects company intelligent creatures title of final two episodes things which have never yet been done and by means which have never yet been tried are taken from a francis bacon quotation in his philosophical work novum organum it would be an unsound fancy and self contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried reception episode was aired in united states on 14 june 2014 on bbc america it was watched by 613 000 viewers with a nielsen rating of 0 27 in demographic of adults aged 18 49 matt brennan of slant magazine summarised episode as being among best hours of television i ve seen so far this year and an example of unrelenting brilliance he praised exploration of rachel s character and especially maslany s nothing short of masterful performance in role and described satire of suburbia presented through alison and donnie as impeccably wry writing for a v club caroline framke gave episode an a grade and found it much more focused and with more of an emotional core than preceding episode she highlighted gorgeous cinematography chemistry between maslany and bruun as alison and donnie and stunning montage of rachel s emotional breakdown ign s eric goldman has described episode as a very busy very strong episode and among best of season he praised darkly funny storyline involving alison and donnie although he found pacing of some of subplots to be rushed paste critic mark rozeman gave episode a rating of 8 4 out of 10 commending bruun s performance as donnie and wonderful bit of coen brothers esque dark comedy provided by alison s subplot however he criticised predictability of episode and opined that kira s abduction by rachel felt like a recycled plot point from first season vlada gelman gave episode a mixed review for tvline writing that it was first episode of show s second season that didn t quite work and it didn t have momentum and progress you d expect from a penultimate hour similarly new york timess adam w kepler opined that episode displayed orphan black finest qualities strong characterisation dark satire and shocking moments and its worst odd pacing and ropey plotting he enjoyed alison and donnie s comedic subplot and praised maslany s performance as rachel but found conclusion to helena s storyline with proletheans baffling and haphazard references external links things which have never yet been done at bbc america category 2014 canadian television episodes category orphan black episodes
