thumb boris karloff in james whale s 1931 film frankenstein based on mary shelley s 1818 novel monster is created by an unorthodox scientific experiment aspects of genetics including mutation hybridisation cloning genetic engineering and eugenics have appeared in fiction since 19th century genetics is a young science having started in 1900 with rediscovery of gregor mendel s study on inheritance of traits in pea plants during 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including molecular biology dna sequencing cloning and genetic engineering ethical implications were brought into focus with eugenics movement since then many science fiction novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices often taking one of two routes a genetic accident with disastrous consequences or feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic film gattaca did attempt to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists background thumb upright 1953 discovery of double helix chemical structure of dna transformed genetics and launched science of molecular biology modern genetics began with work of monk gregor mendel in 19th century on inheritance of traits in pea plants mendel found that visible traits such as whether peas were round or wrinkled were inherited discretely rather than by blending attributes of two parents in 1900 hugo de vries and other scientists rediscovered mendel s research william bateson coined term genetics for new science which soon investigated a wide range of phenomena including mutation inherited changes caused by damage to genetic material genetic linkage when some traits are to some extent inherited together and hybridisation crosses of different species eugenics production of better human beings by selective breeding was named and advocated by charles darwin s cousin scientist francis galton in 1883 it had both a positive aspect breeding of more children with high intelligence and good health and a negative aspect aiming to suppress race degeneration by preventing supposedly defective families with attributes such as profligacy laziness immoral behaviour and a tendency to criminality from having children molecular biology interactions and regulation of genetic materials began with identification in 1944 of dna as main genetic material reprint genetic code and double helix structure of dna was determined by james watson and francis crick in 1953 dna sequencing identification of an exact sequence of genetic information in an organism was developed in 1977 by frederick sanger genetic engineering modification of genetic material of a live organism became possible in 1972 when paul berg created first recombinant dna molecules artificially assembled genetic material using viruses cloning production of genetically identical organisms from some chosen starting point was shown to be practicable in a mammal with creation of dolly sheep from an ordinary body cell in 1996 at roslin institute genetics themes mutants and hybrids thumb upright h g wells s 1896 island of dr moreau imagined use of hybridisation to create human like hybrid beings mutation and hybridisation are widely used in fiction starting in 19th century with science fiction works such as mary shelley s 1818 novel frankenstein and h g wells s 1896 island of dr moreau in her 1977 biological themes in modern science fiction helen parker identified two major types of story genetic accident uncontrolled unexpected and disastrous alteration of a species and planned genetic alteration whether controlled by humans or aliens and question of whether that would be either feasible or desirable in science fiction up to 1970s genetic changes were brought about by radiation breeding programmes or manipulation with chemicals or surgery and thus notes lars not necessarily by strictly genetic means examples include island of dr moreau with its horrible manipulations aldous huxley s 1932 brave new world with a breeding programme and john taine s 1951 seeds of life using radiation to create supermen after discovery of double helix and then recombinant dna genetic engineering became focus for genetics in fiction as in books like brian stableford s tale of a genetically modified society in his 1998 inherit earth or michael marshall smith s story of organ farming in his 1997 spares comic books have imagined mutated superhumans with extraordinary powers dc universe from 1939 imagines metahumans marvel universe from 1961 calls them mutants while wildstorm from 1992 and ultimate marvel 2000 2015 universes name them stan lee introduced concept of mutants in marvel x men books in 1963 villain magneto declares his plan to make homo sapiens bow to homo superior implying that mutants will be an evolutionary step up from current humanity later books speak of an x gene that confers powers from puberty onwards x men powers include telepathy telekinesis healing strength flight time travel and ability to emit blasts of energy marvel s god like celestials are later 1999 said to have visited earth long ago and to have modified human dna to enable mutant powers james blish s 1952 novel titan s daughter in kendell foster s future tense collection featured stimulated polyploidy giving organisms multiple sets of genetic material something that can create new species in a single step based on spontaneous polyploidy in flowering plants to create humans with more than normal height strength and lifespans cloning thumb left steven spielberg s 1993 film jurassic park portrayed recreation of dinosaurs from cloned fossil dna cloning too is a familiar plot device aldous huxley s 1931 dystopian novel brave new world imagines in vitro cloning of fertilised human eggs huxley was influenced by j b s haldane s 1924 non fiction book daedalus or science and future which used greek myth of daedalus to symbolise coming revolution in genetics haldane predicted that humans would control their own evolution through directed mutation and in vitro fertilisation cloning was explored further in stories such as poul anderson s 1953 un man in his 1976 novel boys from brazil ira levin describes creation of 96 clones of adolf hitler replicating for all of them rearing of hitler including death of his father at age 13 with goal of resurrecting nazism in his 1990 novel jurassic park michael crichton imagined recovery of complete genome of a dinosaur from fossil remains followed by its use to recreate living animals of an extinct species cloning is a recurring theme in science fiction films like jurassic park 1993 alien resurrection 1997 6th day 2000 resident evil 2002 star wars episode ii 2002 and island 2005 process of cloning is represented variously in fiction many works depict artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or dna sample replication may be instantaneous or take place through slow growth of human embryos in artificial in long running british television series doctor who fourth doctor and his companion leela were cloned in a matter of seconds from dna samples invisible enemy 1977 and then in an apparent homage to 1966 film fantastic voyage shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter doctor s body to combat an alien virus clones in this story are short lived and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire films such as matrix and star wars episode ii attack of clones have featured human foetuses being cultured on an industrial scale in enormous tanks cloning humans from body parts is a common science fiction trope one of several genetics themes parodied in woody allen s 1973 comedy sleeper where an attempt is made to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose genetic engineering genetic engineering features in many science fiction stories films such as island and blade runner 1982 bring engineered creature to confront person who created it or being it was cloned from a theme seen in some film versions of frankenstein few films have informed audiences about genetic engineering as such with exception of 1978 boys from brazil and 1993 jurassic park both of which made use of a lesson a demonstration and a clip of scientific film in 1982 frank herbert s novel white plague described deliberate use of genetic engineering to create a pathogen which specifically killed women another of herbert s creations dune series of novels starting with dune in 1965 emphasises genetics it combines selective breeding by a powerful sisterhood bene to produce a male being with genetic engineering of powerful but despised thumb 1921 conference logo depicting eugenics as a tree uniting many fields genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film michael clark writing for wellcome trust calls portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology seriously distorted in films such as roger spottiswoode s 2000 6th day which makes use of trope of a vast clandestine laboratory filled with row upon row of blank human bodies kept floating in tanks of nutrient liquid or in suspended animation in clark s view biotechnology is typically given fantastic but visually arresting forms while science is either relegated to background or fictionalised to suit a young audience eugenics eugenics plays a central role in films such as andrew niccol s 1997 gattaca title alluding to letters g a t c for guanine adenine thymine and cytosine four of dna genetic engineering of humans is unrestricted resulting in genetic discrimination loss of diversity and adverse effects on society film explores ethical implications production company sony pictures consulted with a gene therapy researcher french anderson to ensure that portrayal of science was realistic and test screened film with society of mammalian cell biologists and american national human genome research institute before its release this care did not prevent researchers from attacking film after its release yam of scientific american called it science bashing in nature kevin davies called it a surprisingly pedestrian affair and molecular biologist lee silver described film s extreme genetic determinism as a straw man myth and oversimplification geneticist dan koboldt observes that while science and technology play major roles in fiction from fantasy and science fiction to thrillers representation of science in both literature and film is often unrealistic in koboldt s view genetics in fiction is frequently oversimplified and some myths are common and need to be debunked for example human genome project has not he states immediately led to a gattaca world as relationship between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward people do differ genetically but only very rarely because they are missing a gene that other people have people have different alleles of same genes eye and hair colour are controlled not by one gene each but by multiple genes mutations do occur but they are rare people are 99 99 identical genetically 3 million differences between any two people being dwarfed by hundreds of millions of dna bases which are identical nearly all dna variants are inherited not acquired afresh by mutation and koboldt writes believable scientists in fiction should know their knowledge is limited see also evolution in fiction parasites in fiction references further reading category genetics category science in fiction category cloning in fiction
