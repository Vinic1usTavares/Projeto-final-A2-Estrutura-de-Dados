tension build but had mixed reception for its puzzles gameplay thumb unlike in silent hill games player character has no means of defense against hostile ghost lisa pictured her design has drawn

which leads to room in which player starts a loop or a continuous reincarnation of corridor only actions player can use are walking and zooming to progress player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles each time a loop is successfully completed changes appear in corridor additionally player encounters a hostile ghost named lisa if she catches protagonist player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning camera horizontally and is sent back to beginning of current loop after player solves final puzzle a cryptic and unrevealed puzzle that allows player to escape a trailer reveals that p t is a playable teaser for a new game in silent hill series called silent hills directed by hideo kojima and guillermo del toro with protagonist portrayed by norman reedus plot p t centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor in which he can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself first time he passes a radio reports on a familicide which was committed by father and later mentions two other cases exactly like it later on protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition presumably named lisa upon entering bathroom and being locked inside he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in sink he soon gets out but finds out that apparition is watching him while it is possible to avoid ghost completely if protagonist is attacked by ghost he reawakens in first room of game beginning loop again in this room there is a bloody moving paper bag that speaks to him telling him of a disturbing experience and stating same quote seen at start of game watch out gap in door it s a separate reality only me is me are you sure only you is you next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from ceiling leaking blood muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from refrigerator which shakes violently after player completes a puzzle and enters next loop refrigerator is absent and radio issues a swedish message referencing 1938 radio drama war of worlds in next loop lamps turn completely red player s vision blurs character moves abnormally quickly and door leading to staircase at other end of corridor is replaced by infinite repetitions of same loop eventually protagonist discovers a hole in wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in bathroom while a voice on radio rants about societal instability after sounds of radio and killing stop bathroom door opens by itself and player enters upon fetus like creature telling protagonist that ten months earlier an unspecified person lost his job and turned to alcoholism his wife then worked as a part time cashier to financially support family but manager was sexually attracted to her implying a motive for familicide corridor then corrects itself and protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering repeatedly player s perspective distorts and game displays a false crash message when game is restarted protagonist awakens in beginning room and continues next and final loop with only flashlight as a light source he discovers torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout hall and it in its frame after picture is completed and a set of tasks is done a telephone rings and radio s voice says you ve been chosen protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves building in subsequent cutscene radio s voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity he then voices his intention to return with his new toys protagonist steps out into streets of a deserted city and is revealed to be portrayed by norman reedus credits then reveal nature of playable teaser development thumb right hideo kojima designer of p t kojima productions used their game engine fox engine to develop p t hideo kojima s intention when creating p t was to scare people in a unique way as well as to deliver an interactive teaser experience instead of releasing trailers and screenshots of silent hills p t was designed to take players at least a week to complete and kojima intended puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult despite this a few gamers reportedly finished game within hours after release surprising him kojima also intended for p t to be a mystery in order to make it a more frightening experience there is little if not cryptic information given in game on events that take place and there are few clues as to how to solve puzzles he chose corridor as setting as opposed to a ruin because he wanted teaser to emotionally affect player regardless of cultural background kojima elaborated that p t and silent hills have no canonical and direct relation and that silent hills would have been enhanced by elements that were never in p t he based his concept of p t on horror films and other media that he found frightening when creating game kojima refrained from using graphic violence to build up suspense as he felt that too many horror games rely on trope he wanted to elicit a more genuine thoughtful and permeating type of fear a user was able to hack in game camera of p t to show that for most of game model of lisa is tethered directly behind player away from direction player is looking this enabled game to show fleeting shadows of lisa and some of sound effects associated with her that player experiences throughout game same user discovered that player character is modeled after reedus throughout all parts of game and not just at ending and that much of world outside of interior rooms is a incomplete but detailed map of silent hill release p t was originally announced at gamescom 2014 as a demo for an eponymous mystery horror video game it was released on 12 august 2014 on playstation network instead of formally announcing a new silent hill game director hideo kojima decided to release p t as a game demo from a nonexistent gaming studio called 7780s studio in september 2014 sony announced during its pre tokyo game show press conference that p t had been downloaded over a million times critical reception erik kain of forbes enjoyed game for its anxiety inducing horror and wrote that it succeeded as marketing for upcoming silent hills david houghton of gamesradar praised it for its immersive well executed horror and for how game s difficulty created online discourse by spreading out into real world by forcing solutions by way of hearsay internet whispers and desperate rumoured logic it has become its own urban myth eurogamers jeffrey matulef wrote that through its emphasis on sound effects visual design choreography and difficult to decipher enemy placements over traditional progress game became immersive and terrifying however puzzles in p t received criticism patrick klepek panned puzzles describing them as an exercise in frustration matthew reynolds of digital spy wrote that final puzzle was a source of frustration which lacked a clear solution in contrast stated that while puzzles ranged in cleverness and difficulty they added to horror of game by being emotionally uncomfortable p t was also placed on some best of lists in 2014 gamespot awarded it game of month for august 2014 ign s marty sliva chose p t as an honorable mention on his list of best video game trailers of year describing it as one of most interesting gorgeous and terrifying games he played that year another reviewer for ign lucy o brien described game as most genuinely frightening interactive experience in recent years making it her choice for game of year giant bomb gave best horror game of year award to p t saying that p t reminded us what happens when unlimited resources are thrown at a horror experience p t won scariest game at bloody fear awards game also won innovation in game technology at 2014 national academy of video game trade reviewers navgtr awards polygon ranked it as tenth best game of year and slant magazines staff ranked it as eighth best video game of year patrick klepek of kotaku originally listed game as number one on a list of ten best horror games on 13 february 2015 describing it as new king of horror game was replaced by amnesia dark descent as number one when silent hills was cancelled and p t removed in 2018 av club ranked p t as greatest horror game of all time in a list of 35 in 2017 gamesradar ranked p t fourth best horror game of all time out of 20 themes and analysis thumb left danielle riendeau from polygon compared p t s fetus in sink pictured to deformed baby in david lynch s film eraserhead 1977 reviewers have identified several themes in p t according to eurogamers jeffrey matulef game s main theme is cyclical mental anguish supported by obscure and confusing nature of puzzles danielle riendeau of polygon wrote that p t uses two primary themes from silent hill series a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and duality of real world and nightmare world she suggested that p t and eraserhead shared thematic content writing that both included a crying deformed infant and that film s protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world p t s ceaselessly looping hallway has been a source of critical discussion rob crossley of gamespot wrote that it induced mild claustrophobia and a familiarity with your surroundings he remarked that while length of first part of corridor worked to create tension design of second part intentionally prevented player from being able to keep everything in view causing player to feel vulnerable david houghton of gamesradar described looping corridor as conduit for everything that it builds along with saying that it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of horror every time you leave is a monumental relief and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might and almost certainly will escalate compounded by knowledge of seemingly countless iterations before houghton felt that game understood how to evoke horror by working within realm of psychology polygon quoted a game player who said that p t s greatest asset is its looping hallway elaborating that it not only invokes fear but also curiosity or a desire to know what will happen next matulef said that claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in game can hypnotize player into a sense of vulnerability majority of what is said and depicted in game is open to interpretation leading fans to develop and discuss theories about nature of events that occur in game let s players and bob from video game related podcast grate debate opined that open ended nature of game is one of its greatest aspects they also said that there may be something in game that has not been discovered yet they noted changing colors of flashlight s beam in final loop as something they still had not figured out and they felt that game hinted that radio may be main culprit behind father s murderous actions podcast s youtube channel released a video in august 2019 claiming that whole game was a metaphor for kojima s discontent for konami and how he was allegedly treated by them drawing allusions to key moments leading up to his leaving of company in october 2015 game also contains a swedish line in radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true which gamers suggested may be a nod to orson welles s radio adaptation of war of worlds this possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a silent hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens another theory commonly discussed is deciphering identity of player character fetus talking to player character about his remembering moments ten months back seems to imply that he is father who killed lisa and kids although there is speculation that player character may be protagonist that was to be in silent hills as shown in trailer following ending of p t media description journalists have expressed confusion about whether game should be described as a teaser video game or demo despite ongoing debate game won awards for best trailer while also winning game of month and best horror game of year awards while naming p t as an honorable mention for best trailer marty sliva from ign felt that p t was more of an interactive experimental film puzzle game demo has been one of more common descriptions though gamespot was reluctant to categorize it as such despite it being commonly called a demo of silent hills there is no evidence that it was going to be a part of silent hills aside from reveal of trailer and title after end of game hideo kojima himself explained that it was not a demo of silent hills and described it as a teaser in a tweet christopher grant from polygon likened p t to pixar s animated shorts shown before its full length animated feature films legacy p t has also been alluded to in other video games metal gear solid v phantom pain another game directed by kojima includes several direct references to p t such as radio dialogue and sound used in teaser additionally first person survival horror video game allison road was heavily inspired by p t allison road is to take place in a haunted townhouse in united kingdom and feature a male protagonist who attempts to unravel mystery behind his missing family over five nights in demo some wall graffiti directly alludes to p t by repeating a statement made in game park a spin off game from secret world has a sequence inspired by p t and horror games layers of fear and visage were heavily inspired by p t as well in february 2016 youtube channel known collectively as oddest of odd released a short film titled silent hills p t in real life film draws heavily from its source material as an unseen protagonist explores a two story hallway loop in first person camera perspective short film was featured by ign describing it as incredible while s alexander pan described video as being complete with demo s much touted disturbing content and eerie atmosphere resident evil 7 biohazard was also compared with p t during its announcement at e3 2016 thanks in part to beginning hour demo its first person perspective and its photo realistic graphics jordan amaro level designer of silent hills was responsible for creation of resident evil 7s design and setting although he has denied that his work on resident evil 7 was influenced by p t claiming that he wasn t part of core team of p t and that silent hills would have been quite different from resident evil 7 anyway removal and remakes following news of cancellation of silent hills it was announced that p t would be removed from playstation network on 29 april 2015 originally it was reported that demo could be re downloaded but in may 2015 it was no longer re downloadable from playstation store cancellation of game led to criticism of konami patrick klepek from kotaku stated it s fine that konami doesn t want to make silent hills but that deletion of p t was wrong since demo had become part of gaming culture nick robinson of polygon described konami s removal as most irresponsible cowardly decision possible but that subsequent unavailability had also made demo one of coolest most fascinating games in history of our medium after cancellation playstation 4 consoles with p t installed were listed on ebay for over 1000 ebay later pulled auctions down incident has been compared to mass selling of iphones containing bird after that game s removal from ios app store guillermo del toro intended future director of silent hills commented on p t s popularity speculating that there were people who still have a passion for
