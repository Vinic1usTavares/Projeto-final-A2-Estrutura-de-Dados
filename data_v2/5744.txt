battle of bunker hill was fought on june 17 1775 during siege of boston in early stages of american revolutionary war battle is named after bunker hill in charlestown massachusetts which was peripherally involved in battle it was original objective of both colonial and british troops though majority of combat took place on adjacent hill which later became known as breed s hill borneman

fortify unoccupied hills surrounding city which would give them control of boston harbor in response 1 200 colonial troops under command of william prescott stealthily occupied bunker hill and breed s hill during night colonists constructed a strong redoubt on breed s hill as well as smaller fortified lines across charlestown peninsula hubbard robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of

2017 battle was a tactical though somewhat pyrrhic victory for british as it proved to be a sobering experience for them involving many more casualties than americans had incurred including many officers battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle subsequently battle discouraged british from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines american casualties were comparatively much fewer although their losses included general joseph warren and major andrew mcclary final casualty of battle hubbard robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of american revolution pp 94 95 mcfarland company inc jefferson north carolina 2017 battle led british to adopt a more cautious planning and maneuver execution in future engagements which was evident in subsequent new york and new jersey campaign and arguably helped rather than hindered american forces their new approach to battle was actually giving americans greater opportunity to retreat if defeat was imminent costly engagement also convinced british of need to hire substantial numbers of hessian auxiliaries to bolster their strength in face of new and formidable continental army geography thumb left 400px 1775 map of boston area contains some inaccuracies boston situated on a peninsula 18th century boston was a peninsula primarily in 19th century much land around peninsula was filled giving modern city its present geography see history of boston for details was largely protected from close approach by expanses of water surrounding it which were dominated by british warships in aftermath of battles of lexington and concord on april 19 1775 colonial militia a force of about 15 000 men chidsey p 72 new hampshire 1 200 rhode island 1 000 connecticut 2 300 massachusetts 11 500 had surrounded town and effectively besieged it under command of artemas ward they controlled only land access to boston itself roxbury neck but lacking a navy were unable to even contest british domination of waters of harbor british troops a force of about 6 000 under command of general thomas gage occupied city and were able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea alden p 178 in theory they were thus able to remain in boston indefinitely however land across water from boston contained a number of hills which could be used to advantage visitors to boston upon seeing nearby hills may conclude that they are too low hills were once higher but were lowered by excavations to obtain landfill used to expand boston in 19th century if militia could obtain enough artillery pieces these could be placed on hills and used to bombard city until occupying army evacuated it or surrendered it was with this in mind that knox expedition led by henry knox later transported cannon from fort ticonderoga to boston area charlestown peninsula lying to north of boston started from a short narrow isthmus known as charlestown neck at its northwest and extended about southeastward into boston harbor bunker hill with an elevation of lay at northern end of peninsula breed s hill at a height of was more southerly and nearer to boston chidsey p 91 has an historic map showing elevations town of charlestown occupied flats at southern end of peninsula at its closest approach less than separated charlestown peninsula from boston peninsula where copp s hill was at about same height as breed s hill while british retreat from concord had ended in charlestown general gage rather than immediately fortifying hills on peninsula had withdrawn those troops

june 16 colonial colonel william prescott led about 1 200 men onto peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into boston frothingham pp 122 123 this force was made up of men from regiments of prescott putnam unit was commanded by thomas knowlton james frye and ebenezer bridge ketchum pp 102 245 at first putnam prescott and their engineer captain richard gridley disagreed as to where they should locate their defense some work was performed on bunker hill but breed s hill was closer to boston and viewed as being more defensible arguably against orders they decided to build their primary redoubt there frothingham pp 123 124 prescott and his men using gridley s outline began digging a square fortification about on a side with ditches and earthen walls walls of redoubt were about high with a wooden platform inside on which men could stand and fire over walls frothingham p robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of american revolution pp

gage and howe that they needed to prepare to attack position at daylight british sentries were also aware of activity but most apparently did not think it cause for alarm ketchum p 115 then in early predawn around 4 a m a sentry on board spotted new fortification and notified her captain lively opened fire temporarily halting colonists work aboard his flagship admiral samuel graves awoke irritated by gunfire that he had not ordered frothingham p 125 he stopped it only to have general gage his decision when he became fully aware of situation in morning he ordered all 128 guns in harbor as well as batteries atop copp s hill in boston to fire on colonial position which had relatively little effect brooks p 127 rising sun also alerted prescott to a significant problem with location of redoubt it could easily be flanked on either side he promptly ordered his men to begin constructing a breastwork running down hill to east deciding he did not have manpower to also build additional defenses to west of redoubt ketchum p 117 british preparations when british generals met to discuss their options general clinton who had urged an attack as early as possible preferred an attack beginning from charlestown neck that would cut off colonists retreat reducing process of capturing new redoubt to one of starving out its occupants however he was outvoted by other three generals howe who was senior officer present and would lead assault was of opinion that hill was open and easy of ascent and in short would be easily carried ketchum pp 120 121 general burgoyne concurred arguing that untrained rabble would be no match for their trained troops wood p 54 orders were then issued to prepare expedition ketchum p 122 when general gage surveyed works from boston with his staff loyalist abijah willard recognized his brother in law colonel prescott will he fight asked gage a s to his men i cannot answer for them replied willard but colonel prescott will fight you to gates of hell graydon p 424 prescott lived up to willard s word but his men were not so resolute when colonists suffered their first casualty asa pollard of billerica chidsey p 84 a young private killed by cannon fire prescott gave orders to bury man quickly and quietly but a large group of men gave him a solemn funeral instead with several deserting shortly thereafter it took six hours for british to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect men on parade general howe was to lead major assault drive around colonial left flank and take them from rear brigadier general robert pigot on british left flank would lead direct assault on redoubt and major john pitcairn led flank or reserve force it took several trips in longboats to transport howe s initial forces consisting of about 1 500 men to eastern corner of peninsula known as moulton s point by 2 p m howe s chosen force had landed frothingham p 133 however while crossing river howe noted large number of colonial troops on top of bunker hill believing these to be reinforcements he immediately sent a message to gage requesting additional troops he then ordered some of light infantry to take a forward position along eastern side of peninsula alerting colonists to his intended course of action troops then sat down to eat while they waited for reinforcements ketchum p 139 thumb right 275px first british attack on bunker hill shaded areas are hills colonists reinforce their positions prescott seeing british preparations called for reinforcements among reinforcements were joseph warren popular young leader of massachusetts committee of safety and seth pomeroy an aging massachusetts militia leader both of these men held commissions of rank but chose to serve as infantry prescott ordered connecticut men under captain knowlton to defend left flank where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork and topped it with fence rails and hay they also constructed three small v shaped trenches between this dirt wall and prescott s breastwork troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from 1st and 3rd new hampshire regiments under colonels john stark and james reed stark s men who did not arrive until after howe landed his forces and thus filled a gap in defense that howe could have taken advantage of had he pressed his attack sooner took positions along breastwork on northern end of colonial position when low tide opened a gap along mystic river to north they quickly extended fence with a short stone wall to water s edge ketchum p p 93 colonel stark placed a stake about in front of fence and ordered that no one fire until regulars passed it chidsey p 96 just prior to action further reinforcements arrived including portions of massachusetts regiments of colonels brewer nixon woodbridge little and major moore as well as callender s company of artillery frothingham p 136 behind colonial lines confusion reigned many units sent toward action stopped before crossing charlestown neck from cambridge which was under constant fire from gun batteries to south others reached bunker hill but then uncertain about where to go from there milled around one commentator wrote of scene that it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command ketchum p 147 while general putnam was on scene attempting to direct affairs unit commanders often

pigot s force gathering just south of charlestown village were taking casualties from sniper fire and howe asked admiral graves for assistance in clearing out snipers graves who had planned for such a possibility ordered incendiary shot fired into village and then sent a landing party to set fire to town ketchum pp 151 152 smoke billowing from charlestown lent an almost surreal backdrop to fighting as winds were such that smoke was kept from field of battle frothingham pp 144 145 pigot commanding 5th 38th 43rd 47th and 52nd regiments as well as major pitcairn s marines were to feint an assault on redoubt however they continued to be harried by snipers in charlestown and pigot when he saw what happened to howe s advance ordered a retreat ketchum p 160 general howe led light infantry companies and grenadiers in assault on american left flank expecting an easy effort against stark s recently arrived troops ketchum p 152 his light infantry were set along narrow beach in column in order to turn far left flank of colonial position mark urban p38 grenadiers were deployed in middle they lined up four deep and several hundred across as regulars closed john simpson a new hampshire man prematurely fired drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from regulars when regulars finally closed within range both sides opened fire colonists inflicted heavy casualties on regulars using fence to steady and aim their muskets and benefit from a modicum of cover with this devastating barrage of musket fire regulars retreated in disarray and militia held their ground frothingham pp 141 142 regulars reformed on field and marched out again this time pigot was not to feint he was to assault redoubt possibly without assistance of howe s force howe instead of marching against stark s position along beach marched instead against knowlton s position along rail fence outcome of second attack was much same as first one british observer wrote most of our grenadiers and light infantry moment of presenting themselves lost three fourths and many nine tenths of their men some had only eight or nine men a company left ketchum p 161 pigot did not fare any better in his attack on redoubt and again ordered a retreat ketchum p 162 meanwhile in rear of colonial forces confusion continued to reign general putnam tried with only limited success to send additional troops from bunker hill to

back to boston and wounded lying on field of battle were source of moans and cries of pain ketchum p 163 general howe deciding that he would try again sent word to general clinton in boston for additional troops clinton who had watched first two attacks sent about 400 men from 2nd marines and 63rd foot and then followed himself to help rally troops in addition to new reserves he also convinced about 200 of wounded to form up for third attack ketchum p 164 during interval between second and third assaults general putnam continued trying to direct troops toward action some companies and leaderless groups of men moved toward action others retreated hubbard robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of american revolution pp 92 95 mcfarland company inc jefferson north carolina

ketchum pp 165 166 third assault concentrated on redoubt with only a feint on colonists flank was successful although colonists again poured musket fire into british ranks and it cost life of major pitcairn chidsey p 99 defenders had run out of ammunition reducing battle to close combat british had advantage once they entered redoubt as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets while most of colonists were not colonel prescott one of last colonists to leave redoubt parried bayonet thrusts with his normally ceremonial sabre frothingham p 150 it is during retreat from redoubt that joseph warren was killed frothingham p 151 retreat of much of colonial forces from peninsula was made possible in part by controlled retreat of forces along rail fence led by john stark and thomas knowlton which prevented encirclement of hill their disciplined retreat described by burgoyne as no flight it was even covered with bravery and military skill was so effective that most of wounded were saved ketchum p 181 most of prisoners taken by british were mortally wounded general putnam attempted to reform troops on bunker hill however flight of colonial forces was so rapid that artillery pieces and entrenching tools had to be abandoned colonists suffered most of their casualties during retreat on bunker hill by 5 p m colonists had retreated over charlestown neck to fortified positions in cambridge and british were in control of peninsula frothingham pp 151 152 aftermath thumb 190px bunker hill monument thumb 190px ralph farnham one of last survivors british had taken ground but at a great loss they had suffered 1 054 casualties 226 dead and 828 wounded with a disproportionate number of these officers casualty count was highest suffered by british in any single encounter during entire war brooks p 237 general clinton echoing pyrrhus of epirus remarked in his diary that a few more such victories would have shortly put an end to british dominion in america clinton p 19 general clinton s remark is an echoing of pyrrhus of epirus s original sentiment after battle of heraclea one more such victory and cause is lost british dead and wounded included 100 commissioned officers a significant portion of british officer corps in north america brooks pp 183 184 much of general howe s field staff was among casualties frothingham pp 145 196 general gage in

killed most of colonial losses came during withdrawal major andrew mcclary was technically highest ranking colonial officer to die in battle he was hit by cannon fire on charlestown neck last person to be killed in battle he was later commemorated by dedication of fort mcclary in kittery maine bardwell p 76 a serious loss to patriot cause however was death of dr joseph warren he was president of massachusetts provincial congress and he had been appointed a major general on june 14 his commission had not yet taken effect when he served as a volunteer private three days later at bunker hill ketchum p 150 only thirty men were captured by british most of them with grievous wounds twenty died while held prisoner colonials also lost numerous shovels and other entrenching tools as well as five out of six cannon they had brought to peninsula ketchum p 255hubbard robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of american revolution pp 94 96 mcfarland company inc jefferson north carolina 2017 political consequences when news of battle spread through colonies it was reported as a colonial loss as ground had been taken by enemy and significant casualties were incurred george washington who was on his way to boston as new commander of continental army received news of battle while in new york city report which included casualty figures that were somewhat inaccurate gave washington hope that his army might prevail in conflict ketchum pp 207 208 massachusetts committee of safety seeking to repeat sort of propaganda victory it won following battles at lexington and concord commissioned a report of battle to send to england their report however did not reach england before gage s official account arrived on july 20 his report unsurprisingly caused friction and argument between tories and whigs but casualty counts alarmed military establishment and forced many to rethink their views of colonial military capability ketchum pp 208 209 king george s attitude toward colonies hardened and news may have contributed to his rejection of continental congress olive branch petition last substantive political attempt at reconciliation sir james adolphus part of tory majority wrote to lord dartmouth of colonies sooner they are made to taste distress sooner will crown control over them be produced and effusion of blood be put a stop to ketchum p 211 about a month after receiving gage s report proclamation of rebellion would be issued in response this hardening of british position would also lead to a hardening of previously weak support for rebellion especially in southern colonies in favor of independence gage s report had a more direct effect on his own career his dismissal from office was decided just three days after his report was received although general howe did not replace him until october 1775 ketchum p 213 gage wrote another report to british cabinet in which he repeated earlier warnings that a large army must at length be employed to reduce these people that would require hiring of foreign troops scheer p 64 analysis much has been written in wake of this battle over how it was conducted both sides made strategic and tactical missteps which could have altered outcome of battle while hindsight often gives a biased view some things seem to be apparent after battle that might reasonably have been within reach of command of day years after battle and after israel putnam was dead general dearborn published an account of battle in port folio magazine accusing general putnam of inaction cowardly leadership and failing to supply reinforcements during battle which subsequently sparked a long lasting and major controversy among veterans of war various friends family members and historians cray 2001 people were shocked by rancor of attack and this prompted a forceful response from defenders of putnam including such notables as john and abigail adams historian harold murdock wrote that dearborn s account abounds in absurd misstatements and amazing flights of imagination dearborn attack received considerable attention because at time he was in middle of considerable controversy himself he had been relieved of one of top commands in war of 1812 due to his mistakes he had also been nominated to serve as secretary of war by president monroe but was rejected by united states senate which was first time that senate had voted against confirming a presidential cabinet choice purcell 2010 pp 164 richard m battle for bunker hill p 178 press london england 1963 murdock harold bunker hill notes and

disposition of colonial forces thumb 350px a historic map of bunker hill featuring military notes colonial forces while nominally under overall command of general ward with general putnam and colonel prescott leading in field often acted quite independently frothingham p 131 this was evident in opening stages of battle when a tactical decision was made that had strategic implications after deliberating with general putnam and colonel gridley colonel prescott and his staff apparently in contravention of orders decided to fortify breed s hill rather than bunker hill frothingham p 19 fortification of breed s hill was more provocative it would have put offensive artillery closer to boston hubbard robert ernest major general israel putnam hero of american revolution p 87 mcfarland company inc jefferson north carolina 2017 it also exposed forces there to possibility of being trapped as they probably could not properly defend against attempts by british to land troops and take control of charlestown neck if british had taken that step they might have had a victory with many fewer casualties frothingham p 155 while front lines of colonial forces were generally well managed scene behind them especially once action began was significantly disorganized due at least in part to a poor chain of command only some of militias operated directly under ward s and putnam s authority frothingham pp 158 159 and some commanders also disobeyed orders staying at bunker hill rather than joining in defense on third british assault several officers were subjected to court martial and cashiered french pp 274 276 colonel prescott was of opinion that third assault would have been repulsed had his forces in redoubt been reinforced with either more men or more supplies of ammunition and powder frothingham p 153 disposition of british forces british leadership for its part acted slowly once works on breed s hill were spotted it was 2 p m when troops were ready for assault roughly ten hours after lively first opened fire this leisurely pace gave colonial forces time to reinforce flanking positions that had been poorly defended french pp 263 265 gage and howe decided that a frontal assault on works would be a simple matter when an encircling move gaining control of charlestown neck would have given them a more resounding victory this move would not have been without risks of its own as colonists could have made holding neck expensive with fire from high ground in cambridge but british leadership was excessively optimistic believing that two regiments were sufficient to beat strength of province frothingham p 156 right thumb 350px view of attack on bunker s hill with burning of charlestown by lodge once in field howe rather than focusing on redoubt opted twice to dilute force attacking redoubt with a flanking maneuver against colonial left it was only with third attack when flank attack was merely a feint french p 277 and main force now also reinforced with additional reserves squarely targeted redoubt that attack succeeded frothingham p 148 following taking of peninsula british arguably had a tactical advantage that they could have used to press into cambridge general clinton proposed this to howe having just led three assaults with grievous casualties he declined idea frothingham pp 152 153 colonial military leaders eventually recognized howe as a tentative decision maker to his detriment in aftermath of battle of long island 1776 he again had tactical advantages that might have delivered washington s army into his hands but again refused to act jackson p 20 historian john ferling maintains that had general gage used royal navy to secure narrow neck to charleston peninsula cutting americans off from mainland he could have achieved a far less costly victory but he was motivated by revenge over patriot resistance at battles of lexington and concord and relatively heavy british losses and also felt that colonial militia were completely untrained and could be overtaken with little effort opting for a frontal assault ferling 2015 p 127 129 whites of their eyes famous order don t fire until you see whites of

may have been mentioned in histories colonial military leaders were familiar with winsor p 85 whether or not it was actually said in this battle it was clear that colonial military leadership were
