three cent silver also known as three cent piece in silver or was struck by mint of united states for circulation from 1851 to 1872 and as a proof coin in 1873 designed by mint s chief engraver james b longacre it circulated well while other silver coinage was being hoarded and melted but once that problem was addressed became less used it was abolished by congress with coinage act of 1873 after a massive importation of gold bullion during california gold rush silver could be traded for increasing amounts of gold so u s silver coins were exported and melted for their metal this and reduction of postage rates to three cents prompted congress in 1851 to authorize a coin of that denomination made of 750 fine silver rather than conventional 900 three cent silver was first american coin to contain metal valued significantly less than its face value and first silver coin not to be legal tender for an unlimited amount coin saw heavy use until congress acted again in 1853 making other silver coins lighter which kept them in circulation congress also lightened three cent silver and increased its fineness to 900 silver with return of other denominations to circulation three cent silver saw less use and its place in commerce was lost with economic chaos of american civil war which led to hoarding of all gold and silver coins a three cent piece in copper nickel was struck beginning in 1865 and three cent silver saw low mintages for its final decade before its abolition series is not widely collected and pieces remain inexpensive relative to other u s coins of similar scarcity background although mint of united states had been striking silver coins since 1790s they did not always circulate due to fluctuations in price of metal in 1834 for example half dollars sold on market at a premium of one percent u s was then on a bimetallic standard and though congress had slightly overvalued silver with respect to gold enough mexican silver flowed into country to produce a rough equilibrium by early 1849 most of silver coins in circulation were small coins of spanish colonial real including levy one real and fip half real levy and fip often passed for twelve and six cents respectively in eastern u s mint accepted them as payment at a slightly lower figure but even so lost money on transactions as many of pieces were lightweight through wear odd denominations of levy and fip were a convenience allowing payment or change to be made without use of cents which were at that time large made of copper and not accepted by government as legal tender due to their lack of precious metal in western u s levy and fip were accepted as equivalent of silver dime and half dime although spanish pieces contained more silver inception bullion from california gold rush and other discoveries came to eastern u s in considerable quantities beginning in 1848 by following year price of gold relative to silver had dropped making it profitable to export american silver coins sell them as bullion and use payment in gold to buy more u s coins silver coins consequently vanished from circulation meaning highest value american coin actually circulating that was worth less than quarter eagle 2 50 piece was half dollar sized copper cent which saw no use in much of country because of its lack of legal tender status early in 1849 congress authorized a gold dollar to help bridge gap spanish silver coins were bulk of what was left in commerce for small change although there was disagreement as to value to be assigned to them additionally they were often heavily worn reducing their intrinsic worth at a time when americans expected coins to contain metal worth value assigned to them in 1850 new york senator daniel s dickinson introduced legislation for a three cent piece in 750 fine silver that is three parts silver to one part copper american silver coins were then 900 fine he proposed to offer it in exchange for spanish silver which would be valued at eight reals to dollar for purpose higher than going rate new coin would weigh three tenths as much as dime but debasement of silver would compensate government for losses it would take in redeeming underweight worn spanish coins three cent denomination was chosen as it coordinated well with six and twelve cent values often assigned fip and levy house of representatives instead considered legislation to reduce valuation of spanish coins to ten cents per real and to strike a twenty cent piece of 900 silver to facilitate exchange neil carothers in his book on small denomination american money suggests that house s plan would have resulted in spanish coins staying in circulation and any twenty cent pieces issued being hoarded or melted no legislation passed in 1850 which saw continued export of america s silver coinage impetus for passage of a three cent coin came when congress in january 1851 considered reducing postage rates from five cents to three in 1849 house committee on ways and means chairman samuel vinton had written to mint director robert m patterson that his committee was considering both reducing postage rate and instituting a three cent coin although no legislative action was then taken patterson had mint prepare experimental pattern coins house committee proposing 1851 bill included dickinson s three cent piece and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents when bill was debated in house on january 13 1851 new york congressman william duer indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 2 cents and his fellow new yorker matteson offered an amendment to that effect amendment failed as did every other attempt to change legislation including dickinson s plea in senate to restore requirement that new coin be used to retire some of spanish silver bill passed both houses and became act of march 3 1851 when president millard fillmore signed it carothers pointed out precedent setting nature of legislation first to authorize an american silver coin containing an amount of metal worth considerably less than its face value preparation thumb left pattern coin struck to peale s design for three cent piece in silver in addition to striking pattern coins in 1849 officials at philadelphia mint continued to experiment with three cent silvers matter was caught up in ongoing conflict between mint chief coiner franklin peale and chief engraver james b longacre who each prepared designs peale produced a coin depicting a liberty cap based on a design prepared by longacre s late predecessor christian gobrecht in 1836 longacre prepared a design similar to coin that was eventually released on march 2 1851 day before legislation was passed longacre with reluctant permission of patterson a peale ally sent treasury secretary thomas corwin samples of his proposed three cent piece along with a letter explaining symbology patterson preferred peale s design but recommended longacre s for approval on ground that it was in lower relief patterson writing to corwin on march 7 indicated that if three cent were struck in 900 silver it would be hoarded but as silver in 750 pieces was worth only two and a half cents mint would profit via seignorage from coining new pieces patterson also suggested that new orleans mint could be used to strike new coin despite provision of mint act of 1837 entrusting longacre by virtue of his office with responsibility for preparing dies peale prepared his own and ran off some sample three cent pieces both types of pattern coin were sent by patterson to corwin on march 25 1851 with mint director s recommendation that chief engraver s design be selected next day acting treasury secretary william l hodge approved longacre s design knowing there was a large demand for new coins patterson thought it best to build up a stock of 500 000 before beginning distribution design art historian cornelius vermeule in his book on american coins and medals considered silver three cent piece one of ugliest u s coins though it has redeeming feature of delicate workmanship dennis tucker head of whitman publishing in 2016 described coin as something of a sarah plain and small congress had required in authorizing act for three cent silver that piece bear a design distinct from both gold dollar and other silver coins as longacre wrote in his letter to corwin of march 2 1851 longacre s original design for reverse type 1 was altered when fineness of coin was increased in 1854 to aid public in distinguishing between them for type 2 and type 3 reverses of which are identical only differences between two types are on obverse an olive sprig a symbol of peace was added over iii and a bundle of three arrows a symbol of war below it arrows are bound by a ribbon production type 1 1851 1853 thumb right a spanish colonial two reals piece two bits from potosi mint today in bolivia according to numismatic historian walter breen new 3c coins were minted in large quantities went immediately into circulation and stayed there despite mechanical difficulties in striking so small a piece a total of 5 446 400 were struck at philadelphia in 1851 and 720 000 at new orleans latter would prove only mintage of three cent pieces outside philadelphia coins were shipped directly to post offices for use with stamps members of public who wanted pieces were refused them by mint officials who advised would be purchasers to seek them at treasury depository branches small size of coins which were dubbed fish scales was disliked as they were easily lost mint used them to redeem some of spanish silver but bulk of those foreign coins remained in circulation a shopper paying for a small purchase with a gold dollar might receive fifteen or so three cent pieces and remainder in badly worn and other small silver coins one philadelphia newspaper reported derisively that merchants were reduced to giving ladles full of three cent pieces in change for a five dollar banknote silver coins continued to flow out of u s in 1852 and three cent silver saw its highest mintage 18 663 500 all from philadelphia value of these pieces was larger than that of all other silver coins struck by mints in 1852 chaotic state of commerce with no circulating federal coin valued between three cent piece and gold dollar was a source of concern and mint officials and congressmen corresponded in 1852 concerning a reduction in weight of silver coins such as half dime and half dollar congress at last responded by laws passed on february 21 1853 and march 3 1853 these reduced weight of all silver coins except for silver dollar three cent piece had its weight reduced from 8 grams to 75 but its fineness increased to 900 although other reduced weight silver coins were given legal tender limits of five dollars that of three cent piece remained at thirty cents carothers theorized congress probably realizing that 3 cent piece was a misfit at best preferred to leave it with a discordant legal tender value pursuant to these congressional acts mintage of type 1 three cent silver stopped on march 31 1853 these changes to silver coinage alleviated problem of small change as new lightweight coins remained in circulation and were not then hoarded type 2 1854 1858 shift to 900 silver for three cent silver was intended to help drive spanish coins out of circulation longacre made changes to both sides of three cent silver engraving a triple line around star on obverse and adding an olive branch and bunch of arrows to reverse these parallel changes were made to other silver coins of less than a dollar to distinguish new lighter coins from old since it was more urgent to complete work on modifications to silver coins such as half dollar and quarter longacre left three cent piece for last and did not complete work on coin until late 1853 new treasury secretary james guthrie approved changes on november 10 starting with 1854 small quantities of proof coins were struck and apparently distributed in sets with other silver coins beginning in 1858 mint director james ross snowden made proof sets available to general public 1853 acts had prohibited mint from buying silver from public since silver dollar was heavy relative to its value little silver was presented for striking into that piece as statutes did not permit public to deposit silver and receive it back in form of subsidiary silver coins three cent piece through half dollar this effectively placed u s on gold standard despite statutes in 1853 and 1854 snowden had mint purchase large quantities of silver bullion at a fixed price generally above market rate and struck it into coin since subsidiary coins were only legal tender to five dollars and could not be redeemed for gold this led to a glut of silver coins in commerce this oversupply which persisted through 1862 led to lower mintages of silver coins in mid 1850s including three cent piece largest mintage for type 2 three cent silver was in 1858 when 1 603 700 were struck for circulation type 3 1859 1873 although there is no archival evidence breen theorized that in 1858 snowden ordered longacre to make changes to improve striking quality as most type 2 pieces were weakly struck changes include removal of one of outlines around star with smaller and more evenly spaced lettering breen suggested that lettering displays influence of assistant engraver anthony c paquet who likely assisted longacre these changes only affected obverse reverse was not altered economic chaos of civil war brought introduction of legal tender notes backed only by credit of government and by mid 1862 gold and silver coins had vanished from circulation in much of nation their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps three cent silver remained in circulation longer than other silver coins apparently because public thought it was still made of debased silver but by autumn of 1862 it too was hoarded with little point to issuing coins that would not circulate mintage of three cent silver dropped from 343 000 in 1862 to 21 000 in 1863 a figure that would be exceeded only once 22 000 in 1866 during rest of series in march 1863 treasury secretary salmon p chase wrote in a letter that three cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding congress began task of restoring federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two cent piece in bronze and by authorizing a three cent piece in copper nickel following year in 1866 it authorized a five cent piece in latter alloy nickel as it has come to be known with three cent silver effectively replaced by base metal pieces it did not share in increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868 three cent silver was struck at rate of a few thousand per year into 1870s in 1870 treasury secretary george boutwell sent congress a draft bill to replace outdated 1837 mint act and bits of legislation passed over years regarding mint and coinage even in draft bill no provision was made for three cent silver though some in congress wished to retain coin in anticipation of resumption of specie payments after much debate in congress president ulysses s grant signed coinage act of 1873 on february 12 of that year law abolished two cent piece three cent silver half dime and standard silver dollar later restored in 1878 carothers called abolition of silver three and five cent pieces a necessity if 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after revival of silver coinage breen deemed decision to eliminate silver three cent piece and half dime which might have directly competed with two copper nickel coins a favor to industrialist joseph wharton whose mines produced much of nickel ore used in coinage according to numismatist r w julian three cent silver had played its part well in u s monetary system but there was no longer any need for it aftermath large quantities of three cent silver including much of production from 1863 and later were held by treasury and were melted after coin was three cent nickel went way of its silver counterpart after years of low mintages and decreasing popularity it was abolished by act of september 26 1890 along with gold dollar and three dollar piece three cent silver was confirmed as fully legal tender by coinage act of 1965 which proclaimed all coin and currency of united states good to any amount for payment of public and private debt by then that coin had long since disappeared from circulation collecting according to kevin flynn and winston zack in their book on three cent silver lower interest in that piece means that it is type of coin on which you can find great deals on pricing even on dates in which rarity is high according to r s yeoman s a guide book of united states coins published in 2017 ones that catalog highest are proof issues from before 1858 with 1854 issue leading way listed at 12 000 not listed is 1851 proof three cent silver of which only one is known which was last sold in 2012 for 172 500 and once formed part of louis eliasberg collection flynn and zack theorize that this was specimen viewed by hodge in approving longacre s design as there is no record of its return to philadelphia mint 1873 coin final issue was struck in proof only and is listed at between 825 and 2 000 depending on condition most u s coins of that year were struck with a close 3 in date and following a complaint that 3 too closely resembled an eight an open 3 variety three cent silver exists only as a close 3 of coins struck for circulation yeoman s highest listings are for 1868 at 11 000 in near pristine ms 66 condition yeoman lists all three cent pieces
