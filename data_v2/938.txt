banksia violacea commonly known as violet banksia is a species of shrub or tree in plant genus banksia family proteaceae it generally grows as a small shrub to 1 5 m 5 ft high with fine narrow leaves and is best known for its unusually coloured dark purple violet inflorescences colour of inflorescences short leaves and flattened follicles which are sticky when young help identify this species from others in field it is found in low shrubland in southern regions of western australia from esperance in east to narrogin in west growing exclusively in sandy soils first described in 1927 by west australian botanist charles gardner species was at one stage considered a variety of b sphaerocarpa although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for banksia violacea wasps ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes banksia violacea is classified as not threatened under wildlife conservation act of western australia regarded as of little value to floriculture it is rarely cultivated description thumb left typical shrubby habit alt a shrubby fine bush is part backlit by sunlight banksia violacea grows as a shrub up to 1 5 m 5 ft tall with narrow leaves 1 2 cm 0 4 0 8 in long and about 0 15 cm 0 06 in wide new growth occurs in summer and flowering ranges from november to april with a peak in february but can be irregular in timing flowers arise from typical banksia flower spikes and inflorescences are made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis roughly spherical with a diameter of 2 3 cm 0 8 1 2 in flower spikes arise from lateral stems lie partly within foliage unusually for banksia species inflorescences are often violet in colour ranging anywhere from a dark violet black through various combinations of violet and greenish yellow in less pigmented blooms each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals and one long wiry style styles are hooked rather than straight and are initially trapped inside upper perianth parts but break free at anthesis old flowers gradually fade to brown fruiting structure or follicle is a stout woody cone with a hairy appearance caused by persistence of old withered flower parts these follicles are crowded around globular spike called an infructescence at this point and are oval to rhomboid

their first year of life taxonomy thumb inflorescence in early bud alt a roundish bloom made up of hundreds of golden flower buds growing type specimen of banksia violacea was collected by west australian botanist charles gardner on 14 december 1926 in vicinity of lake grace following year he published a description of species in journal and proceedings of royal society of western australia he placed it in section oncostylis of bentham s taxonomic arrangement of banksia giving it specific epithet violacea in reference to violet flowers thus full name of species with author citation is banksia violacea c a gardner retrieved june 26 2010 species has been considered a variety of b sphaerocarpa fox banksia this view was published by william blackall in his 1954 how to know western australian wildflowers he considered b violacea to be a variety of b sphaerocarpa with violet flowers this description was an invalid publication however and a nomen nudum in 1981 alex george declared banksia sphaerocarpa var violacea blackall a nomenclatural synonym of b violacea in george s 1981 arrangement b violacea was placed in subgenus banksia because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike section oncostylis because of its hooked styles and series abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical it was placed in taxonomic sequence between b incana hoary banksia and b meisneri meissner s banksia in 1996 kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of banksia they retained george s subgenera and many of his series but discarded his sections b ser abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic and so it was retained it further resolved into four subclades so thiele and ladiges split it into four subseries b violacea appeared in last of these thumb right young follicles are green and slightly sticky at this stage alt a globular old flowerhead now mostly made up of greenish developing seed pods this clade became basis of b subseries longistyles which thiele defined as containing those taxa with very long and slender styles smoothly convex perianth limbs without a costal ridge and thickened margins in accordance with their cladogram their arrangement placed b violacea first in taxonomic sequence followed by b laricina rose fruited banksia however thiele and ladiges arrangement was not accepted by george who questioning emphasis on cladistics rejected most of their changes in his 1999 arrangement restored b series abietinae to his broader 1981 definition and abandoned all of thiele and ladiges subseries george commented that species has no close relatives being loosely allied to b sphaerocarpa fox banksia and b telmatiaea swamp fox banksia despite this sequence of series was altered so that b violacea fell between b scabrella burma road banksia and b incana and its placement in george s arrangement may be summarised as follows thumb right older follicles alt a globular old flowerhead mostly made up of mature brown seed pods banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia 9 series 50 species 9 subspecies 3 varieties b sect coccinea 1 species b sect oncostylis b ser spicigerae

cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae his analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from george s arrangement and somewhat different from thiele and ladiges with respect to b violacea mast s results agree with its placement near b laricina and b incana placing it in a clade with these two species and b sphaerocarpa var dolichostyla treated at species rank as b dolichostyla however thiele s b subseries longistyles appears to be polyphyletic as do both definitions of b ser abietinae that is none form a natural grouping thumb paler inflorescence and leaves alt a round bloom of mixed purplish and greenish yellow flowers lies amid some short grey green needle like leaves early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement of banksia by merging dryandra into it and publishing b subgenus spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b violacea is placed in b subgenus spathulatae distribution and habitat thumb right distribution of b violacea shown on a map of western australia s biogeographic regions alt map of western australia with red area in south of state b violacea occurs in southern regions of western australia from woodanilling to esperance and as far north as hyden this distribution includes areas of avon wheatbelt esperance plains and mallee biogeographic regions retrieved june 26 2010 it favours white sandy soils often overlying laterite clay or quartzite it usually grows among heath and shrublands associated with mallee eucalypts and banksia sphaerocarpa var caesia banksia violacea is classified as not threatened under 1950 wildlife conservation act of western australia ecology like most other proteaceae banksia violacea has proteoid roots roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in soil just below leaf litter these enhance solubilisation of nutrients thus allowing their uptake in low nutrient soils such as phosphorus deficient soils of australia b violacea is highly susceptible to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback banksia violacea is one of a small number of banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non lignotuberous populations in both cases plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground however possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire but resprout from below ground level lignotuberous plants generally occur among north eastern populations in vicinity of woodanilling an investigation into biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative climatic or other environmental factors associated with possession of a lignotuber banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds mammals and insects retrieved june 24 2010 however only wasps ants and flies were recorded visiting flower spikes during observations for banksia atlas in mid 1980s cultivation banksia violacea is rarely cultivated it is a slow growing plant that tends to become untidy with age and generally does not flower until four to five years after sprouting from seed flowers are an unusual colour but occur within bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage it tolerates light pruning not below green foliage except for variant with a lignotuber which may be pruned heavily george recommends a sunny position in light sandy soil professor margaret bernard sedgley of waite institute suggests species is of no value to floriculture as inflorescences are too small and obscured by foliage although she does add that purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding seeds do not require any treatment and take 19 to 50 days to germinate see also references violacea category eudicots of western australia
