knickerbocker spread fear throughout city s trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from new york city banks panic extended across nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks panic might have deepened if not for intervention of financier j p morgan panic of 1907 j p morgan saves day who pledged large sums of his own money and convinced other new york bankers to do same to shore up banking system this highlighted impotence of nation s independent treasury system which managed nation s money supply yet was unable to inject liquidity back into market by

system combined with roiled stock market even a small shock could have grave repercussions panic cornering copper 1907 panic began with a stock manipulation scheme to corner market in f augustus heinze s united copper company heinze had made a fortune as a copper magnate in butte montana in 1906 he moved to new york city where he formed a close relationship with notorious wall street banker charles w morse morse had once successfully cornered new york city s ice market and together with heinze gained control of many banks pair served on at least six national banks ten state banks five trust companies and four insurance firms thumb curb outside new york stock exchange where panic began augustus brother otto devised scheme to corner united copper believing that heinze family already controlled a majority of company he also believed that a significant number of heinze s shares had been borrowed and sold short by speculators betting that stock price would drop and that they could thus repurchase borrowed shares cheaply pocketing difference otto proposed a short squeeze in which heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible and then force short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares aggressive purchasing would drive up share price and being unable to find shares elsewhere short sellers would have no option but to turn to heinzes who could then name their price to finance scheme otto augustus and charles morse met with charles t barney president of city s third largest trust knickerbocker trust company barney had provided financing for previous morse schemes morse however cautioned otto that in order to attempt squeeze otto needed much more money than barney had and barney declined to provide funding otto decided to attempt corner anyway on monday october 14 he began aggressively purchasing shares of united copper which rose in one day from 39 to 52 per share on tuesday oct 15 he issued call for short sellers to return borrowed stock share price rose to nearly 60 but short sellers were able to find plenty of united copper shares from sources other than heinzes otto had misread market and share price of united copper began to collapse stock closed at 30 on tuesday and fell to 10 by wednesday oct 16 otto heinze was ruined stock of united copper was traded outside hall of new york stock exchange literally an outdoor market on curb this curb market would later become american stock exchange after crash wall street journal reported never has there been such wild scenes on curb so say oldest veterans of outside market

collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for mercantile national bank in new york city of which f augustus heinze was then president f augustus heinze s association with corner and insolvent state savings bank proved too much for board of mercantile to accept although they forced him to resign before lunch time by then it was too late as news of collapse spread depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from mercantile national bank mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals but depositors began to pull cash from banks of heinzes associate charles w morse runs occurred at morse s national bank of north america and new amsterdam national afraid of impact tainted reputations of augustus heinze and morse could have on banking system new york clearing house a consortium of city s banks forced morse and heinze to resign all banking interests by weekend after failed corner there was not yet systemic panic funds were withdrawn

emergency conference at his library saturday morning a proposal was made that u s steel corporation a company morgan had helped form through merger of steel companies of andrew carnegie and elbert

morgan then entered talks and advised trust companies that they must provide a loan of 25 million to save weaker institutions trust presidents were still reluctant to act but morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of banking system through his considerable influence at about 4 45 a m he persuaded unofficial leader of trust companies to sign agreement and
