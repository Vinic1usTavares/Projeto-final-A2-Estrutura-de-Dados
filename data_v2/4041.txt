advantage of this marketing opportunity factor 5 included content from upcoming film in rogue squadron lucasfilm provided developers with design art for naboo starfighter a ship prominently featured in new film these designs were used to create an in game model because game was scheduled to be released six months before film factor 5 was required to keep ship s inclusion a secret as a result most of game s development team at factor 5 and lucasarts were not informed of its inclusion a complex scrambling system was also developed to help hide ship s code from gamers using cheat cartridges such as gameshark or action replay more than six months after release of rogue squadron lucasarts unveiled code to unlock naboo starfighter as a playable craft code has been named nintendo 64 s most well hidden code because of length of time before its discovery synopsis setting star wars rogue squadron is set in fictional star wars galaxy where a war is fought between galactic empire and rebel

star wars shadows of empire on nintendo 64 in 1996 lucasarts began planning a follow up factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps for their planned sequel to lucasarts rescue on fractalus at time after lucasarts signed a three game exclusivity deal with nintendo factor 5 was allowed to convert their work on new fractalus sequel into a star wars game instead game s focus would be space combat this direction was inspired by a level of shadows of empire in which player flies a snowspeeder during battle of hoth rogue squadron and lucasarts production manager brett tosti stated that whole scene was actually genesis for rogue squadron because everybody said why don t you do a whole game like that so we did factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to fans favorite action sequences from star wars films this proposal was rejected however at that time lucasfilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from films consequently resulting game was almost completely set in star wars expanded universe designers at lucasarts initially planned to adapt rogue squadron and star wars x wing rogue squadron a series of books and comic books set after years of original film trilogy and have game centered around wedge antilles it was later decided that game would instead focus on luke skywalker and primarily take place between events of a new hope and empire strikes back as it was more commercially appealing thumb right alt a rectangular cartridge consisting of a black base and a flat red top nintendo 64 s expansion pak allows gameplay at a higher resolution lucasarts began developing story and gameplay in a setting that would include characters from films participating in new original missions using factor 5 s terrain map engine as base in may 1998 a demo of game was displayed at e3 but game was so incomplete at time that tosti considered it a tech demo it rendered a basic and an immobile at at model while tie fighters lacking artificial intelligence flew and fired in a predetermined path when playing demo for audiences tosti followed a very specific flight path of his own to give illusion that he was actually battling with ties despite demo s barebones presentation response from gamers was largely positive late in development team realized that they were developing game with a nintendo 64 memory expansion in place at all times unable to run game on a standard nintendo 64 they began working on compression techniques to allow game to run within confines of standard console at same time factor 5 also appealed to nintendo to release newly developed memory expansion pak commercially nintendo was reluctant expecting technology to be reserved solely for hardware peripherals however after iguana entertainment also wanted to use expansion pak to achieve a higher display resolution for turok 2 seeds of evil factor 5 was given green light ultimately rogue squadron was made to run on a standard nintendo 64 but expansion pak increases its resolution from 320 x 240 to 640 x 480 lucasfilm was hesitant to grant access to star wars library of sound effects to factor 5 sound designer rudolph stember as a compromise company provided stember with sounds sampled at relatively low rate of 22 khz half standard rate stember objected claiming that clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from vhs tapes for a previous star wars project game includes voice work from several notable persons including screen actors olivia hussey and raphael sbarge as well as voice actors bob bergen neil ross and terence mcgovern instead of using nintendo s default sound drivers factor 5 developed its own tool called fx surround factor 5 drivers use nintendo 64 processors but tax them less advanced compression techniques were also employed as a result game includes over 80 minutes of high quality stereo sound in november 1998 a month before game s scheduled release lucasarts announced worldwide agreement with nintendo concerning three new star wars video games it granted nintendo rights to market games and hold exclusive worldwide distribution rights for five years following each release rogue squadron was first game released under this agreement to promote release of game mark hamill actor who played luke skywalker in star wars films visited mattel children s hospital in los

well paced gameplay a story tied into star wars canon and visuals that made it one of generation s top stunners game s technical aspects were singled out for acclaim its visuals were called respectable in standard resolution but highly praised in high resolution mode achieved via nintendo 64 s expansion pak gamespot remarked that in a higher resolution textures of landscapes ships lighting effects everything looks so much better while ign s peer schneider said after playing game in optional high resolution mode 640 x 480 once it s impossible to go back to still respectable standard resolution citing details such as decals rebel markings r2 units cockpit views and exhaust flames schneider described game s 3d ship models as gorgeous ign s matt casamassina said that game was best looking nintendo 64 game to date reviewers also praised game s sound design powered by new factor 5 audio drivers rogue squadron features about 40 minutes of speech and 40 minutes of music gamespot s ryan mac donald believed that game s inclusion of extended voice work helped create a movie like atmosphere ign noted that in addition to being technically impressive game s dolby pro logic surround sound was an important gameplay element audio signals helped players determine enemy positions and direction of travel ign awarded game three sound awards including sound effects best voice and best overall sound of 1998 on nintendo 64 some reviewers complained about aspects of game s visuals critics disliked heavy reliance on distance fog another common criticism of game was lack of multiplayer modes gamepro review called omission a serious unforgivable sin schneider believed that while adding these modes would have extended rogue squadron replay value game was still enjoyable for its medal reward system and large number of secrets and unlockables although nearly identical game s pc version garnered lower review scores than its nintendo 64 counterpart with an aggregated gamerankings score of 80 percent this version enjoyed many of same praises for its gameplay but handling and graphics were cited as problematic directly comparing two versions allgame s brad cook wrote that pc version s handling is more difficult than n64 version he believed pc s choppy feel made it difficult to target enemies in contrast to its opinion of n64 version ign s pc review was not enthusiastic about game s visuals ign staff remarked that rogue squadrons graphics and special effects aren t spectacular and that they had seen better graphics on pc sales when rogue squadron was
