standards and its protagonist lara croft developed by british studio core design tomb raider was a commercial and critical success and was followed by five successive games between 1996 and 2000 their sixth tomb raider game tomb raider angel of darkness was beset by developmental problems and rushed to release resulting in low sales and mixed critical reception game s failure and core design s fatigue with series prompted franchise publisher eidos interactive to move development of tomb raider to american studio crystal dynamics who rebooted franchise with tomb raider legend legend released in 2006 to critical and commercial success a remake of original tomb raider to commemorate game s tenth anniversary was proposed by core design who at time were working on free running several core design staff wanted to remake tomb raider for playstation portable psp and playstation 2 ps2 they received permission from eidos to create remake and began development in late 2005 for a release during 2006 holiday season remake would have retained original story and gameplay flow with adjustments for new players and some rearrangements to puzzles according to staff game was at an advanced development stage during production eidos asked core design to adjust lara s model to more closely match that used in legend team intended jonell elliot who voiced lara from tomb raider last revelation to angel of darkness to reprise her role for remake in 2006 following sale of core design to rebellion developments remake was cancelled while eidos gave no explanation for cancellation it was assumed by core design staff that they did not want tomb raider franchise to be developed by a third party studio prior to and following cancellation footage from an internal presentation was leaked online following success of legend crystal dynamics were requested by eidos to develop their own remake of original tomb raider anniversary was co developed by crystal dynamics and buzz monkey software company responsible for legends psp port game s creative director and lead designer was james botta its producer was lulu lamer and its art director was andrew wood team were eager to develop anniversary as they could use development assets of legend they were also shocked by request due to original game s status amongst both tomb raider fans and video game history another reason for developing anniversary over a new game was to help celebrate series tenth anniversary and create a compelling gameplay experience by remaking first game rather than creating a new title with two studios working on game development structure was quite complex a core team of fifteen was based at crystal dynamics buzz monkey software formed a large part of game s staff and crystal dynamic s executive creative services section oversaw development when designing anniversary team emphasised creating game first before making adjustments to keep paper documentation to a minimum in favour of face to face conversations to facilitate a smooth process team created a merit based democratic environment where ideas could be put forward by other team members story and art design thumb right alt a short haired man with a beard standing in front of an advertisement poster man wears glasses and a light brown jacket over a brown top toby gard pictured 2006 a key figure for series and credited creator of lara croft was one of story designers for anniversary toby gard one of original designers and lara s credited creator acted as story designer script and dialogue were written by matt original game s story was described by crystal dynamics staff as pretty sparse and difficult to understand without gard s explanations one of aims with anniversary was to flesh out narrative and tie it into continuity of legend gard fleshed out lore and character motivations in anniversary something impossible with tomb raider as it needed to tell its story as quickly as possible narrative s conclusion which included lara s temptation by natla s offer of knowledge her father sought thematically led into lara s search for her mother in legend keeley hawes lara s voice actress in legend reprised her role for anniversary lara s personality was modelled upon that shown in legend but with suitable adjustments for who she was as a person during events of anniversary lara s initial drive for adventure defined by gard as an unstoppable madness contained within a proper british woman was fleshed out to provide purpose for players aim was to make her appealing while staying true to her original portrayal gard s expansion of story became focused on how far lara was willing to go and what moral boundaries she would cross in pursuit of her goals interactions of natla larson and pierre were extensively expanded by gard beginning with an infiltration sequence of natla s los angeles offices by lara prior to greece levels which in anniversary had her watching video messages between characters character of larson who was carried over from first game and merged with another of natla s original henchman called cowboy was made a more ambiguous character who shared a chemistry with lara moment where lara kills larson was written to show lara crossing a moral line and killing a person for first time in pursuit of her goals natla s other henchmen were also reimagined to be more realistic with lara s confrontation with them being an intense battle following emotional scene with larson as described by art director andrew wood one of team s starting points was taking most memorable moments from tomb raider and recreating them in anniversary on a grander and more detailed scale art team wanted to show respect for original game designing environments to evoke nostalgia while being more complex and on a grander scale all original areas were brought back in anniversary but redesigned around modern gaming conventions botta said that team picked out most interesting parts of each area to preserve leaving out less interesting hallway traversal of original environmental design saw an upgrade compared to those in legend animals primary enemies in original tomb raider were carried over into anniversary but redesigned to appear as threatening and dangerous as possible so people would see them as a threat and not feel too uncomfortable about killing them when designing each environment art team would first create them with a low colour palate and desaturated lighting to increase their realism they would then add colourful elements such as foliage combining that with different types of lighting changing levels of light and darkness as lara explored each location were used to convey a sense of mystery peru was given a variety of environments transitioning from snowy mountains to lush jungle to an underground tomb lost valley area which had become a fan favourite since original release was redesigned using available technology and hardware to be more open gameplay was condensed into a smaller area compared to original which spread its puzzles and platforming through adjoining caves greece was designed around theme of a subterranean temple hidden in a mountain egypt focused on motif of bright sunlight magnifying use of lighting to promote mystery its layout and design saw least overall changes when compared to original tomb raider main difference was in its scale and variety lost island area was given a unique design was volcanic elements and fantastic architecture unlike any of other locations to act as game s thematic finale game design as part of their research for anniversary developers played through original game multiple times pinpointing its characteristic and iconic elements that needed to be carried over into remake a large amount of time was spent deciding what would be included what elements to keep and what to change so it would appeal to old and new players alike anniversary was developed using an updated and expanded version of legend engine but with expanded gameplay elements and moves for lara which in turn impacted level design design was influenced by team s previous experience with legend puzzles were mostly redesigned based on technology and physics engine of legend much of original game s focus on item collection and pulling switches was included but developers tried not to rely on this style too much adding more variety with physics based puzzles and environmental set pieces when creating puzzles team needed to take a second look at their design techniques so they could make puzzles and their solutions more visible and intuitive an element they took into consideration was criticism of legends linear environments with anniversary being built with a philosophy of branching paths and an emphasis on exploration this style was possible due to it being a core part of original game lara s original inventory was also carried over from tomb raider removing some of tools introduced in legend when peru areas were being created gard was eager to redesign village area of vilcabamba an area rest of team did not know existed village was rebuilt to be better portray vilcabamba s now extinct civilisation st frances folly was extensively redesigned to make puzzles larger and more complex with many elements in anniversary such as giant statue of atlas in one of challenge chambers being parts of original game that could not be completed this theme of expansion continued through rest of areas egypt levels were themed around traps and puzzles taking a more prominent place than in other areas lost island levels were changed in various ways natla s mines area was made more manageable while later levels within atlantean pyramid were made larger and more intricate audio music for anniversary was written by troels brun folmann who had previously created score for legend a lot of folmann s work revolved around reworking and expanding original game s themes main theme was similar to that used in first game except with more advanced orchestral elements goal for music was to convey a sense of adventure while his work on legend involved a large amount of electronic and rhythm instruments to blend musical genres folmann changed to a purely orchestral score for anniversary also in contrast to legend which used dynamic music throughout its levels anniversary used sparse musical cues combined with environmental ambience goal for folmann was to translate music into an evolved version for anniversary while remaining faithful to original sound team wished only to use a traditional symphonic style use of strings brass woodwinds percussion and choirs combined with classic settings used in game this purely orchestral approach carried over into cutscenes all of thematic elements from tomb raider including choir segments were present in new score alongside remade themes folmann composed original tracks and new musical elements for egypt levels folmann used instrumentation incorporating persian musical styles which he described as typical for representing egyptian music folmann worked on score for five months release and versions existence of anniversary was hinted at by eidos staff member ian livingstone during an interview shortly after release of legend in may 2006 game was announced under provisional title tomb raider 10th anniversary edition in june of that year along with its planned platforms of ps2 psp and windows personal computers pc its official title was revealed in november of that year crystal dynamics co developed ps2 version with buzz monkey software during development crystal dynamics wanted to push ps2 version to its technical limits with scale and quality of environments which caused problems for psp conversion as this was at odds with designs that would run smoothly in console while conversion was successful lamar described process as primarily a brute force approach pc version was developed by nixxes software anniversary was originally planned only for pc and playstation platforms as they had a long association with tomb raider due to fan demand team created an xbox 360 port to reach release as soon as possible 360 version was originally planned as a series of downloadable segments through xbox live arcade with a later full retail release to download players needed a copy of legend for 360 which was explained by eidos as a means of bringing game to players as quickly as possible this plan was later changed so xbox live version would release month after retail version anniversary was first tomb raider title for wii developed to expand eidos s game catalogue into new nintendo consoles due to receiving wii development kits fairly late from nintendo wii version could not be released at same

calling it a worthy remake of original game 1up coms joe rybicki called game a damn fine homage and a damn fine game in its own right eurogamers kristan reed said that anniversary merited a higher score than legend due to its less linear structure and lower frequency of tutorials gamespys patrick praised recreation and expansion of original game s locations and gameplay but faulted camera control and some unforgiving puzzles ryan davis of gamespot greatly enjoyed anniversary calling it a further step in fixing franchise following success of legend though he faulted its unwillingness to experiment with formula greg miller writing for ign praised updated environments and controls and despite problems with graphics found that it managed to capture original game s spirit reviewers generally recommended pc version over ps2 due to lower quality graphics 360 version saw praise for its gameplay and environments comments shared with other versions but graphics were generally faulted common complaints were frame rate drops low quality textures and a lack of console specific upgrades seen in legend psp port was lauded as a high quality port of ps2 version although difficult camera control and technical issues such as frame rate drops and long load times were points of criticism wii port s redesigned controls and incorporation of motion controls into gameplay divided opinion some praised them or at least enjoyed their implementation while others found several elements clumsy or unnecessary port s graphics also received praise being cited as visually equal or superior to ps2 version despite noticeable drops in frame rate unintuitive camera control was a frequent criticism igns matt casamassina called port a competently executed enhanced port of previously released ps2 affair that also happens to be good fun at its best and frustrating at its worst tom east of official nintendo magazine was very positive in his review praising game s implementation of wii control functions in addition to its general gameplay and design anniversary was nominated at 2007 national academy of video game trade reviewers awards under art direction in a game engine category mobile
