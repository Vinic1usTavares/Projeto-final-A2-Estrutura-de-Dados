coenwulf also spelled cenwulf or or was king of mercia from december 796 until his death in 821 he was a descendant of a sibling of king penda who had ruled mercia in middle of 7th century he succeeded ecgfrith son of offa ecgfrith only reigned for five months and coenwulf ascended throne in same year that offa died in early years of coenwulf s reign he had to deal with a revolt in kent which had been under offa s control eadberht praen returned from exile in francia to claim kentish throne and coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene when pope leo iii agreed to eadberht coenwulf invaded and retook kingdom eadberht was taken prisoner was blinded and had his hands cut off coenwulf also appears to have lost control of kingdom of east anglia during early part of his reign as an independent coinage appears under king eadwald coenwulf s coinage reappears in 805 indicating that kingdom was again under mercian control several campaigns of coenwulf s against welsh are recorded but only one conflict with northumbria in 801 though it is likely that coenwulf continued to support opponents of northumbrian king eardwulf coenwulf came into conflict with archbishop wulfred of canterbury over issue of whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries breakdown in relationship between two eventually reached point where archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years a partial resolution was reached in 822 with coenwulf s successor king ceolwulf but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between wulfred and coenwulf s daughter cwoenthryth who had been main beneficiary of coenwulf s grants of religious property coenwulf was succeeded by his brother ceolwulf a post conquest legend claims that his son cynehelm was murdered to gain succession within two years ceolwulf had been deposed and kingship passed permanently out of coenwulf s family coenwulf was last king of mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other anglo saxon kingdoms within a decade of his death rise of wessex had begun under king egbert and mercia never recovered its former position of power background and sources for most of 8th century mercia was dominant among anglo saxon kingdoms south of river humber aethelbald who came to throne in 716 had established himself as overlord of southern anglo saxons by 731 simon keynes mercia in lapidge et al blackwell encyclopaedia of anglo saxon england p 306 he was assassinated in 757 and was briefly succeeded by beornred but within a year offa ousted beornred and took throne for himself offa s daughter eadburh married beorhtric of wessex in 789 and beorhtric became an ally thereafter stenton anglo saxon england p 210 in kent offa intervened decisively in kirby earliest english kings p 167 and at some point became overlord of east anglia whose king aethelred was beheaded at offa s orders in 794 yorke kings and kingdoms p 64 offa appears to have moved to eliminate dynastic rivals to succession of his son ecgfrith according to a contemporary letter from alcuin of york an english deacon and scholar who spent over a decade as a chief advisor at charlemagne s court lapidge alcuin of york in lapidge et al encyclopaedia of anglo saxon england p 24 vengeance of blood shed by father has reached son alcuin added this was not a strengthening of kingdom but its ruin letter of alcuin to mercian ealdorman osbert tr in whitelock english historical documents p 787 offa died in july 796 ecgfrith succeeded him but reigned for less than five months before coenwulf came to throne simon keynes coenwulf in lapidge et al blackwell encyclopaedia of anglo saxon england p 111 a significant corpus of letters dates from period especially from alcuin who corresponded with kings nobles and ecclesiastics throughout england letters between coenwulf and papacy also survive see exchange of letters between coenwulf and pope leo iii in whitelock english historical documents 204 and 205 pp 791 794 another key source for period is anglo saxon chronicle a collection of annals in old english narrating history of anglo saxons chronicle was a west saxon production however and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of wessex campbell anglo saxon state p 144 charters dating from coenwulf s reign have survived these were documents granting land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by kings who had authority to grant land hunter blair roman britain pp 14 15 campbell anglo saxons pp 95 98 a charter might record names of both a subject king and his overlord on witness list appended to grant such a witness list can be seen on diploma for example where aethelric son of king of hwicce is described as a subregulus or subking of aethelbald whitelock english historical documents 67 pp 453 454 mercia and southern england at ecgfrith s death according to anglo saxon chronicle ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days swanton anglo saxon chronicle p 50 offa is known to have died in 796 on either 26 july or 29 july so ecgfrith s date of death is either 14 december or 17 december of same year coenwulf succeeded ecgfrith as king coenwulf s father s name was who may have been same person as an ealdorman of that name who witnessed charters during reign of offa yorke kings and kingdoms p 118 coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during offa s reign yorke kings and kingdoms p 120 according to genealogy of mercian kings preserved in anglian collection coenwulf was descended from a brother of penda named cenwealh of whom there is no other record it is possible that this refers to cenwealh of wessex who was married to and later repudiated a sister of penda williams kingship and government p 29 coenwulf s kin may have been connected to royal family of hwicce a of mercia around lower river severn sarah and john zaluckyj decline in zaluckyj and zaluckyj mercia p 228 it appears that coenwulf s family were powerful but they were not of recent mercian royal lineage kirby earliest english kings p 177 a letter written by alcuin to people of kent in 797 laments that scarcely anyone is found now of old stock of kings story carolingian connections p 145 eardwulf of northumbria had like coenwulf gained his throne in 796 so alcuin s meaning is not clear but it may be that he intended it as a slur on eardwulf or coenwulf or on both kirby earliest english kings p 156 alcuin certainly held negative views of coenwulf regarding him as a tyrant and criticising him for putting aside one wife and taking another alcuin wrote to a mercian nobleman to ask him to greet coenwulf peaceably if it is possible to do so implying uncertainty about coenwulf s policy towards carolingians coenwulf s early reign was marked by a breakdown in mercian control in southern england in east anglia king eadwald minted coins at about this time implying that he was no longer subject to mercia kirby earliest english kings p 178 a charter of 799 seems to show that wessex and mercia were estranged for some time before that date though charter is not regarded as undoubtedly genuine kirby earliest english kings p 179 and n 122 p 184 in kent an uprising began probably starting after ecgfrith s death though it has been suggested that it began much earlier in year before offa s death kirby earliest english kings p 183 n 8 quoting brooks early history of church of canterbury uprising was led by eadberht praen who had been an exile at charlemagne s court eadberht s cause almost certainly had carolingian support kirby earliest english kings p 185 eadberht became king of kent and aethelheard archbishop of canterbury at that time fled his see it is likely that christ church canterbury was sacked reign 300px thumb southern england during coenwulf s reign coenwulf was unwilling to take military action in kent without acknowledgement from pope leo iii that eadberht was a pretender basis for this assertion was that eadberht had reportedly been a priest and as such had given up any right to throne coenwulf wrote to pope and asked leo to consider making london seat of southern archbishopric removing honour from canterbury it is likely that coenwulf s reasons included loss of mercian control over kent whitelock english historical documents 204 p 791 leo refused to agree to moving archiepiscopate to london but in same letter he agreed that eadberht s previous ordination made him ineligible for throne whitelock english historical documents 205 p 793 and concerning that letter which most reverend and holy aethelheard sent to us as regards that apostate cleric who mounted to throne we excommunicate and reject him having regard to safety of his soul for if he should still persist in that wicked behaviour be sure to inform us quickly that we may write to princes and all people dwelling in island of britain exhorting them to expel him from his most wicked rule and procure safety of his soul this authorisation from pope to proceed against eadberht was delayed until 798 but once it was received coenwulf took action mercians captured eadberht put out his eyes and cut off his hands yorke kings and kingdoms p 121 and led him in chains to mercia where according to later tradition he was imprisoned at winchcombe a religious house closely affiliated with coenwulf s family story carolingian connections p 142 by 801 at latest coenwulf had placed his brother cuthred on throne of kent cuthred ruled until time of his death in 807 after which coenwulf took control of kent in name as well as fact yorke kings and kingdoms p 32 coenwulf styled himself king of mercians and province of kent rex atque provincie in a charter dated 809 offa s domination of kingdom of essex was continued by coenwulf king of essex left for rome in 798 according to anglo saxon chronicle swanton anglo saxon chronicle p 56 presumably abdicating throne in favour of his son sigered sigered appears on two charters of coenwulf s in 811 as king rex of essex but his title is reduced thereafter first to subregulus or subking and thereafter to dux or ealdorman yorke kings and kingdoms p 51 stenton anglo saxon england p 305 thumb lead bulla of king coenwulf of mercia british museum course of events in east anglia is less clear but eadwald s coinage ceased and new coinage issued by coenwulf began by about 805 so it is likely that coenwulf forcibly re established mercian dominance there kirby earliest english kings p 179 resumption of friendly relations with wessex under beorhtric received a setback when beorhtric died and throne of wessex passed to egbert who like eadberht had been an exile at charlemagne s court sarah and john zaluckyj decline in zaluckyj zaluckyj mercia p 232 anglo saxon chronicle records that on same day that egbert came to throne an ealdorman of hwicce named led a force across thames at but was defeated by men of wiltshire under leadership of also an ealdorman swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp 58 59 egbert may also have had a claim on kentish throne according to chronicle but he made no move to recover it during coenwulf s reign kirby earliest english kings p 189 egbert appears to have been independent of mercia from beginning of his reign and wessex s independence meant that coenwulf was never able to claim overlordship of southern english that had belonged to offa and aethelbald he did however claim title of emperor on one charter only anglo saxon king to do so before 10th century patrick wormald age of offa and alcuin in campbell et al anglo saxons p 101 in 796 or 797 welsh engaged mercian forces at rhuddlan by 798 coenwulf was in a position to invade in return killing caradog ap meirion king of gwynedd a civil war in gwynedd in 810s ended with succession of hywel ap caradog in 816 or 817 and coenwulf invaded again this time ravaging snowdonia and taking control of a small welsh territory near rhos it is not clear if mercians were involved in a battle recorded in anglesey in 817 or 818 but following year coenwulf and his army devastated dyfed kirby earliest english kings p 188 northumbrian king aethelred was assassinated in april 796 and less than a month later his successor osbald was deposed in favour of eardwulf kirby earliest english kings p 155 eardwulf had alhmund killed in 800 alhmund was son of king alhred of northumbria who had reigned from 765 to 774 alhmund s death was regarded as a martyrdom and his cult subsequently developed at derby in mercian territory perhaps implying mercian involvement in northumbrian politics at time coenwulf gave hospitality to eardwulf s enemies who had been exiled from northumbria and consequently eardwulf invaded mercia in 801 invasion was inconclusive however and peace was arranged on equal terms coenwulf may also have been behind coup in 806 that led to eardwulf losing his throne yorke kings and kingdoms p 95 and he likely continued to support eardwulf s enemies after eardwulf returned in 808 kirby earliest english kings p 197 relations with church thumb left dioceses of england during coenwulf s reign boundary between archdioceses of lichfield and canterbury is shown in bold in 787 offa had persuaded church to create a new archbishopric at lichfield dividing archdiocese of canterbury new archdiocese included sees of worcester hereford leicester lindsey dommoc and elmham these were essentially midland anglian territories canterbury retained sees in south and southeast kirby earliest english kings p 174 according to brooks earliest source for list of dioceses attached to lichfield is 12th century william of malmesbury brooks emphasizes that this is a late source though he acknowledges division given is plausible brooks early history p 119 hygeberht already bishop of lichfield was new archdiocese s first and only archbishop stenton anglo saxon england pp 217 218 218 notes 3 4 two versions of events that led to creation of new archdiocese appear in form of an exchange of letters in 798 between coenwulf and pope leo iii coenwulf asserted in his letter that offa wanted new archdiocese created out of enmity for jaenberht archbishop of canterbury at time of division but leo responded that only reason papacy agreed to creation was because of size of kingdom of mercia whitelock english historical documents 204 205 pp 791 794 comments of both coenwulf and leo are partisan as each had his own reasons for representing situation as they did coenwulf was entreating leo to make london sole southern archdiocese while leo was concerned to avoid appearance of complicity with unworthy motives coenwulf imputed to offa kirby earliest english kings pp 169 170 coenwulf s desire to move southern archbishopric to london would have been influenced by situation in kent where archbishop aethelheard had been forced to flee by eadberht praen coenwulf would have wished to retain control over archiepiscopal seat and at time he wrote to pope kent was independent of mercia brooks early history of canterbury pp 120 125 aethelheard who had succeeded jaenberht in 792 had been abbot of a monastery at louth in lindsey stenton anglo saxon england p 225 on 18 january 802 aethelheard received a papal privilege that re established his authority over all churches in archdiocese of lichfield as well as those of canterbury aethelheard held a council at clovesho on 12 october 803 which finally stripped lichfield of its archiepiscopal status however it appears that hygeberht had already been removed from his office a hygeberht attended council of clovesho as head of church in mercia but signed as an abbot stenton anglo saxon england p 227 archbishop aethelheard died in 805 and was succeeded by wulfred s e kelly wulfred in lapidge et al blackwell encyclopaedia of anglo saxon history p 491 wulfred was given freedom to mint coins that did not name coenwulf on reverse probably indicating that wulfred was on good terms with mercian king in 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind a letter from pope leo to charlemagne mentioned that coenwulf had not yet made peace with wulfred after this no further discord is mentioned until 816 when wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses kirby earliest english kings p 186 council held at chelsea asserted that coenwulf did not have right to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries although both leo and his predecessor pope hadrian i had granted offa and coenwulf right to do so coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter cwoenthryth to position of abbess of minster in thanet leo died in 816 and his successor stephen iv died following january new pope paschal i confirmed coenwulf s privileges but this did not end dispute kirby earliest english kings p 187 in 817 wulfred witnessed two charters in which coenwulf granted land to bishop of worcester but there is no further record of wulfred acting as archbishop for rest of coenwulf s reign one account records that quarrel between wulfred and coenwulf led to wulfred being deprived of his office for six years with no baptisms taking place during that time but this may have been an exaggeration with four years being more likely term of suspension stenton anglo saxon england p 229 n 5 in 821 year of coenwulf s death a council was held in london at which coenwulf threatened to exile wulfred if archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to king stenton anglo saxon england pp 229 230 wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms but conflict continued well past coenwulf s death with an apparently final agreement between wulfred and coenwulf s daughter cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827 however wulfred officiated at consecration of coenwulf s brother and heir ceolwulf on 17 september 822 so it is evident that some accommodation had been reached by that time wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year coinage thumb right a silver penny of coenwulf from c ad 807 coinage of coenwulf follows broad silver penny format established under offa and his contemporaries his very first coins are very similar to heavy coinage of offa s last three years and since mints at canterbury and in east anglia were under control of eadbert praen and eadwald respectively these earliest pennies must be product of london mint before 798 new tribrach type appeared with a design consisting of three radial lines meeting at centre tribrach design was introduced initially at london alone but soon spread to canterbury after it was reconquered from rebels it was not struck in east anglia but there are tribrach pennies in name of cuthred sub king of kent around 805 a new portrait coinage was introduced to all three of southern mints after around 810 a range of reverse designs was introduced though several were common to many or all of moneyers blackburn grierson

from at least 970s thacker kings saints and monasteries p 8 according to alfred great s biographer welsh monk and bishop asser alfred s wife ealhswith was descended from coenwulf through her mother eadburh though asser does not say which of coenwulf s children eadburh descends from kirby earliest english kings p 212 coenwulf died in 821 at near holywell flintshire probably while making preparations for a campaign against welsh that took place under his brother and successor ceolwulf following year stenton anglo saxon england p 230 coenwulf s body was moved to winchcombe where it was buried in st mary s abbey later known as winchcombe abbey a mid 11th century source asserts that cynehelm briefly succeeded to throne while still a child and was then murdered by his tutor at behest of cwoenthryth this version of events bristles with historical problems according to one historian and it is also possible that cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in coenwulf s reign and who appears to have died by about 812 yorke kings and kingdoms p 119 opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point simon keynes has suggested that ealdorman is unlikely to be same person as prince and that cynehelm therefore may well have survived to end of his father s reign regardless of interpretation of cynehelm s legend there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in ceolwulf s reign a document from 825 says that after death of coenwulf much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings nobles bishops and ministers of church of god on very many matters of secular business coenwulf was last of a series of mercian kings beginning with penda in early 7th century to exercise dominance over most or all of southern england in years after his death mercia s position weakened and battle of ellendun in 825 firmly established egbert of wessex as dominant king south of humber yorke kings and kingdoms pp 104 105 112 122 anglo and historian john blair has identified evidence that coenwulf came to be venerated as a saint at least by 12th century and included him in his handlist of anglo saxon saints

abbey john blair a handlist of anglo saxon saints in at p 521 where as indicated in blair s introduction at p 495 of his name signals that his holiness is attested only in post conquest evidence and
