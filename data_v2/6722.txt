2002 atlantic hurricane season was a borderline average atlantic hurricane season it officially started on june 1 2002 and ended on november 30 dates which conventionally limit period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in atlantic ocean season produced fourteen tropical cyclones of which twelve developed into named storms four became hurricanes and two attained major hurricane status while season s first cyclone did not develop until july 14 activity quickly picked up 2002 season tied with 2010 in which a record number of tropical storms eight developed in month of september it ended early however with no tropical storms forming after october 6 a rare occurrence caused partly by el nino conditions most intense hurricane of season was hurricane isidore with a minimum central pressure of 934 mbar although hurricane lili attained higher winds and peaked at category 4 whereas isidore only reached category 3 season s low activity is reflected in low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 67 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so low number reflects small number of strong storms and preponderance of tropical storms season was less destructive than normal causing an estimated 2 47 billion 2002 usd in property damage and 23 fatalities most destruction was due to isidore which caused about 1 28 billion 2002 usd in damage and killed seven people in yucatan peninsula and later united states and hurricane lili which caused 1 16 billion 2002 usd in damage and 15 deaths as it crossed caribbean sea and eventually made landfall in louisiana seasonal forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 2002 seasonsourcedatenamedstormshurricanesmajorhurricanescsuaverage 1950 2000 9

gray and his associates at colorado state university issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year separately from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa gray s team determined average number of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9 6 tropical storms 5 9 hurricanes and 2 3 major hurricanes storms exceeding category 3 a normal season as defined by noaa has 9 to 12 named storms of which 5 to 7 reach hurricane strength and 1 to 3 become major hurricanes pre season forecasts on december 7 2001 gray s team issued its first extended range forecast for 2002 season predicting above average activity 13 named storms 8 hurricanes and about 2 of category 3 or higher it listed an 86 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking u s mainland this included a 58 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on east coast including florida peninsula and a 43 percent chance of at least one such strike on gulf coast from florida panhandle westward potential for major hurricane activity in caribbean was forecast to be above average on april 5 a new forecast was issued calling for 12 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 intense hurricanes decrease in forecast was attributed to further intensification of el nino conditions estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect u s was decreased to 75 percent east coast potential decreased slightly to 57 percent and from florida panhandle westward to brownsville texas probability remained same mid season forecasts on august 7 2002 gray s team lowered its season estimate to 9 named storms with 4 becoming hurricanes and 1 becoming a major hurricane noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in year sea level pressure and trade wind strength in tropical atlantic were reported to be above normal while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend on august 8 2002 noaa revised its season estimate to 7 10 named storms with 4 6 becoming hurricanes and 1 3 becoming major hurricanes reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions and building el nino conditions systems tropical storm arthur arthur formed out of a tropical depression off coast of north carolina on july 14 from a decaying frontal zone it then moved out to sea strengthening slightly into a tropical storm on july 15 arthur gradually strengthened and peaked as a tropical storm on following day however cooler waters and upper level shear caused it to weaken by july 17 arthur had become extratropical and moved north over newfoundland it proceeded to weaken below gale strength precursor system produced up to of rainfall in weston florida later one person drowned in river in newfoundland due to arthur tropical storm bertha a surface trough of low pressure that would later spawn tropical storm cristobal developed a tropical depression in northern gulf of mexico on august 4 it quickly strengthened into a minimal tropical storm early on august 5 and made landfall near boothville louisiana just two hours later bertha weakened to a tropical depression but retained its circulation over louisiana a high pressure system built southward unexpectedly forcing depression to southwest it emerged back over gulf of mexico on august 7 where proximity to land and dry air prevented further strengthening bertha moved westward and made a second landfall near kingsville texas on august 9 having made no significant gain in strength across gulf coast of united states bertha dropped light to moderate rainfall most areas received less than precipitation from storm peaked at in norwood louisiana minor flooding was reported which caused light damage to a few businesses 15 to 25 houses and some roadways overall damage was very minor totaling to 200 000 2002 usd in damage in addition one death was reported due to bertha a drowning due to heavy surf in florida tropical storm cristobal on august 5 tropical depression three formed off coast of south carolina from a surface trough of low pressure same trough that spawned tropical storm bertha in gulf of mexico under a southerly flow depression drifted southward where dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development on august 7 it became tropical storm cristobal and reached a peak of on august 8 storm meandered eastward and was absorbed by a front on august 9 interaction between extratropical remnant and a high pressure system produced strong rip currents along coastline of long island storm also caused waves of three to four ft 1 2 m in height three people drowned from rip currents and waves in new york tropical storm dolly a tropical wave exited african coast on august 27 and with low favorable conditions system organized into tropical depression four on august 29 about 630 mi 1 020 km southwest of cape verde six hours later depression was upgraded to tropical storm dolly after developing sufficient outflow and curved banding features storm continued to intensify as more convection developed and dolly reached peaked winds of 60 mph 95 km h on august 30 after peaking in intensity storm suddenly lost organization and winds decreased to minimal tropical storm force after a brief re intensification trend dolly again weakened due to wind shear on september 4 dolly weakened to a tropical depression and later that day was absorbed by trough it never affected land tropical storm edouard edouard formed out of an area of disturbed weather north of bahamas on september 2 it drifted northward then executed a clockwise loop off coast of florida despite dry air and moderate upper level shear edouard strengthened to a peak of winds but unfavorable conditions caught up with it storm weakened as it turned west southwestward and made landfall near ormond beach florida on september 5 as a minimal tropical storm edouard crossed florida and emerged over gulf of mexico as a minimal depression outflow from stronger tropical storm fay caused tropical depression edouard to weaken further and edouard was eventually absorbed by fay tropical storm edouard dropped moderate rainfall across florida peaking at 7 64 inches 194 mm in desoto county though it was a tropical storm at landfall winds were light across path of storm over land several roads were flooded from moderate precipitation no casualties were reported and damage was minimal tropical storm fay in early september a low pressure center developed along a trough of low pressure and on september 5 system had gained sufficient organization to be a tropical depression to southeast of galveston depression drifted south southwest while strengthening into tropical storm fay reaching its peak strength of 60 mph 95 km h on morning of september 6 system then abruptly turned to west northwest and remained steady in strength and course until landfall next day near matagorda it quickly degenerated into a remnant low which itself moved slowly southwestward over texas low eventually dissipated on september 11 over northeastern mexico storm brought heavy rainfall in mexico and texas storm also caused six tornadoes up to of rain and extended periods of tropical storm force winds storm caused moderate flooding in some areas due to high rainfall amounts which left about 400 homes with some form of damage in total 400 houses sustained damage from flooding 1 575 houses were damaged from flooding or tornadic damage 23 severely amounting to 4 5 million 2002 usd in damage no deaths are attributed to fay tropical depression seven a tropical wave exited africa on september 1 and after initial development became disorganized it moved west northwestward for a week reorganizing enough by september 7 to be declared tropical depression seven about 1155 mi 1855 km east southeast of bermuda at time depression had persistent convection around a small circulation and it moved steadily westward due to a ridge to its north shortly after forming strong wind shear diminished convection and left center partially exposed by september 8 there was no remaining thunderstorm activity and depression degenerated into a remnant low pressure area storm dissipated shortly after as strong wind shear continued to cause storm to deteriorate while located 980 mi 1580 mi southeast of bermuda depression never affected land hurricane gustav an area of unsettled weather developed between bahamas and bermuda on september 6 and over next few days convection increased in intensity and coverage on september 8 system gained sufficient organization to be declared a subtropical depression off southeast united states coast later that day system was named subtropical storm gustav after attaining tropical characteristics on september 10 gustav passed slightly to east of outer banks of north carolina as a tropical storm before moving northeastward and making two landfalls in atlantic canada as a category 1 hurricane on september 12 storm was responsible for one death and 100 000 2002 usd in damage mostly in north carolina interaction between gustav and a non tropical system produced strong winds that caused an additional 240 000 2002 usd in damage in new england but this damage was not directly attributed to hurricane in atlantic canada hurricane and its remnants brought heavy rain tropical storm and hurricane force winds as well as storm surges for several days localized flooding was reported in areas of prince edward island and 4 000 people in halifax nova scotia and charlottetown prince edward island were left without power tropical storm hanna in early september a tropical wave merged with a trough of low pressure in gulf of mexico and spawned a low pressure system convection steadily deepened on september 11 east of upper level low and surface low it was classified as tropical depression nine next day disorganized storm moved westward then northward where it strengthened into tropical storm hanna later that day after reaching a peak with winds of 55 mph 90 km h it made two landfalls on gulf coast eventually dissipating on september 15 over georgia because most of associated convective activity was east of center of circulation minimal damage was reported in louisiana and mississippi to east on dauphin island alabama storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced evacuation of residents florida received high wind gusts heavy rainfall and strong surf that resulted in deaths of three swimmers throughout state 20 000 homes lost electricity heavy rainfall progressed into georgia where significant flooding occurred crop damage was extensive and over 300 structures were damaged by flooding storm caused a total of about 20 million 2002 usd in damage and three fatalities hurricane isidore on september 9 a tropical wave moved off coast of africa and by september 14 it was classified as a tropical depression next day storm was located just south of jamaica and it developed into tropical storm isidore on september 19 it intensified into a hurricane and isidore made landfall in western cuba as a category 1 storm just before landfall near puerto on september 22 isidore reached its peak intensity with wind speeds of making it a strong category 3 storm after returning to gulf of mexico as a tropical storm isidore s final landfall was near grand isle louisiana on september 26 where storm weakened to a depression isidore made landfall on yucatan peninsula of southern mexico as a category 3 hurricane leaving 950 million 2002 usd in damage in country despite dropping over 30 inches 760 mm of rainfall among other effects david m roth black background color filled rainfall graphic for isidore hydrometeorological prediction center retrieved on 2008 08 10 only two indirect deaths were reported there as a tropical storm isidore produced a maximum of 15 97 inches 406 mm of rainfall in united states at metairie louisiana rainfall was responsible for flooding that caused moderate crop damage with a total of 330 million in damage 2002 usd john l beven ii richard j pasch and miles b lawrence december 23 2003 atlantic hurricane season of 2002 noaa retrieved on 2008 08 10 tropical storm josephine a non tropical low developed along a dissipating stationary front on september 16 in central atlantic and drifted north northeastward national hurricane center classified it as tropical depression eleven on september 17 about 710 mi 1 150 km east of bermuda and initially depression did not have significant deep convection a wind report early on september 18 indicated depression intensified into tropical storm josephine storm continued generally northeastward steered between a subtropical high to northeast and a frontal system approaching from west josephine maintained a well defined circulation but its deep convection remained intermittent early on september 19 storm began being absorbed by cold front and as a tropical cyclone its winds never surpassed 40 mph 75 km h later that day josephine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and suddenly intensified to winds of 60 mph 95 km h extratropical low was quickly absorbed by another larger extratropical system on afternoon of september 19 hurricane kyle a non tropical low formed into subtropical depression twelve well east southeast of bermuda on september 20 it became subtropical storm kyle next day and tropical storm kyle on september 22 kyle drifted slowly westward slowly strengthening and reached hurricane strength on september 25 it weakened back into a tropical storm on september 28 cyclone s strength continued to fluctuate between tropical depression and tropical storm several times its movement was also extremely irregular as it shifted sharply north and south along its generally westward path on october 11 kyle reached land and made its first landfall near mcclellanville south carolina while skirting coastline of carolinas it moved back over water and made a second landfall near long beach north carolina later same day kyle continued out to sea where it merged with a cold front on october 12 becoming fourth longest lived atlantic hurricane kyle brought light precipitation to bermuda but no significant damage was reported there moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in united states causing localized flash flooding and road closures floodwaters forced evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in south carolina kyle spawned at least four tornadoes costliest of which struck georgetown south carolina it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others causing eight injuries overall damage totaled about 5 million 2002 usd and no direct deaths were reported however remnants of kyle contributed to one indirect death in british isles hurricane lili on september 16 a tropical wave moved off coast of africa and across atlantic it developed a low level cloud circulation midway between africa and lesser antilles on september 20 next day system had become sufficiently organized to classify system as a tropical depression about east of windward islands on september 30 lili became a hurricane while passing over cayman islands storm attained category 4 status in gulf of mexico before making landfall on louisiana coast on october 2 next day it was absorbed by an extratropical low near tennessee arkansas border in louisiana wind gusts reaching 120 mph 190 km h coupled with over 6 inches 150 mm of rainfall and a storm surge of 12 feet 3 7 m caused 1 1 billion 2002 usd in damage a total of 237 000 people lost power and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week tropical depression fourteen a weak tropical wave moved through lesser antilles on october 9 as system reached southwestern caribbean sea on october 12 convection increased and a broad low pressure area formed later that day over next two days low significantly organized and became tropical depression fourteen at 1200 utc on october 14 depression initially tracked west northwestward but then curved to north northeast due to vertical wind shear depression was unable to intensify and remained below tropical storm status during its duration by 1600 utc on october 16 depression made landfall near cienfuegos cuba with winds of 30 mph 45 km h while crossing island depression was absorbed by a cold front early on october 17 minimal impact was reported which was limited to locally heavy rains over portions of jamaica cuba and cayman islands storm names following names were used on named storms that formed in north atlantic during 2002 season names that were not used are marked in 2002 list was taken from 1996 season with substitution of cristobal fay and hanna for cesar fran and hortense respectively three new names were used for atlantic storms for first time list was used again in 2008 atlantic hurricane season with exception of isidore and lili which were retired by world meteorological organization on march 30 2003 they were replaced with ike and laura respectively ike was retired and replaced with isaias arthur bertha cristobal dolly edouard fay gustav hanna isidore josephine kyle lili season effects following
