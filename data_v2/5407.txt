american library with illustrations from paul bacon by 2002 007 in new york had been added to book by penguin books reviews philip larkin wrote in spectator that i am not surprised that fleming preferred to write novels james bond unlike sherlock holmes does not fit snugly into short story length there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted these are no exception critic for times literary supplement wrote that book was slight and predictable and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology writing in listener anthony burgess thought that in their fascinated poring on things remind us that stuff of anti novel needn t necessarily spring from a thought out aesthetic going on to note that it is mastery of world that gives fleming his peculiar literary niche on a personal note burgess added i admired all bond books and i m sorry
