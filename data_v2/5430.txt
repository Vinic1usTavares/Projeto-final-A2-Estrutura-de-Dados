unbiquadium also known as element 124 or eka uranium is hypothetical chemical element with atomic number 124 and placeholder symbol ubq unbiquadium and ubq are temporary iupac name and symbol respectively until element is discovered confirmed and a permanent name is decided upon in periodic table unbiquadium is expected to be a g block superactinide and sixth element in 8th period unbiquadium has attracted attention as it may lie within island of stability leading to longer half lives especially for 308ubq which is predicted to have a magic number of neutrons 184 despite several searches unbiquadium has not been synthesized nor have any naturally occurring isotopes been found to exist it is believed that synthesis of unbiquadium will be far more challenging than that of lighter undiscovered elements and nuclear instability may pose further difficulties in identifying unbiquadium unless island of stability has a stronger stabilizing effect than predicted in this region as a member of superactinide series unbiquadium is expected to bear some resemblance to its possible lighter congener uranium valence electrons of unbiquadium are expected to participate in chemical reactions fairly easily though relativistic effects may significantly influence some of its properties for example electron configuration has been calculated to differ considerably from one predicted by aufbau principle history synthesis attempts because complete nuclear shells or equivalently a magic number of protons or neutrons may confer additional stability on nuclei of superheavy elements moving closer to center of island of stability it was thought that synthesis of element 124 or nearby elements would populate longer lived nuclei within island scientists at ganil grand national d ions attempted to measure direct and delayed fission of compound nuclei of elements with z 114 120 and 124 in order to probe shell effects in this region and to pinpoint next spherical proton shell in 2006 with full results published in 2008 team provided results from a reaction involving bombardment of a natural germanium target with uranium ions fission team reported that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half lives 10 18 s this result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at z 124 and points to next proton shell at z 120 not at z 114 as previously thought a compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet it has no internal structure and is held together only by collision forces between target and projectile nuclei it is estimated that it requires around 10 14 s for nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells at which point compound nucleus becomes a nuclide and this number is used by iupac as minimum half life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered thus ganil experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124 fission of compound nucleus 312124 was also studied in 2006 at tandem alpi heavy ion accelerator at di legnaro legnaro national laboratories in italy fission similarly to previous experiments conducted at jinr joint institute for nuclear research fission fragments clustered around doubly magic nuclei such as 132sn z 50 n 82 revealing a tendency for superheavy nuclei to expel such doubly magic nuclei in fission see flerov lab annual reports 2000 2004 inclusive http www1 jinr ru reports reports eng arh html average number of neutrons per fission from 312124 compound nucleus relative to lighter systems was also found to increase confirming that trend of heavier nuclei emitting more neutrons during fission continues into superheavy mass region possible natural occurrence a study in 1976 by a group of american researchers from several universities proposed that primordial superheavy elements mainly livermorium unbiquadium unbihexium and could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage particularly in minerals unbiquadium was then suggested to exist in nature with its possible congener uranium in detectable quantities at a relative abundance of 10 11 such unbiquadium nuclei were thought to undergo alpha decay with very long half lives down to flerovium which would then exist in natural lead at a similar concentration 10 11 and undergo spontaneous fission this prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983 a group led by tom cahill a professor at university of california at davis claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and x rays with right energies to cause damage observed supporting presence of these elements others claimed that none had been detected and questioned proposed characteristics of primordial superheavy nuclei in particular they cited that magic number n 228 necessary for enhanced stability would create a neutron excessive nucleus in unbiquadium that would not be beta stable this activity was also proposed to be caused by nuclear transmutations in natural cerium raising further ambiguity upon this claimed observation of superheavy elements possible extent of primordial superheavy elements on earth today is uncertain even if they are confirmed to have caused radiation damage long ago they might now have decayed to mere traces or even be completely gone it is also uncertain if such superheavy nuclei may be produced naturally at all as spontaneous fission is expected to terminate r process responsible for heavy element formation between mass number 270 and 290 well before elements such as unbiquadium may be formed naming using 1979 iupac recommendations element should be temporarily called unbiquadium symbol ubq until it is discovered discovery is confirmed and a permanent name chosen although widely used in chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists who work theoretically or experimentally on superheavy elements who call it element 124 with symbol 124 or 124 some researchers have also referred to unbiquadium as eka uranium a name derived from system dmitri mendeleev used to predict unknown elements though such an extrapolation might not work for g block elements with no known congeners and eka uranium would instead refer to element 144 or 146 when term is meant to denote element directly below uranium difficulties in synthesis every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion evaporation reactions culminating in discovery of heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010 these reactions approached limit of current technology for example synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249bk and an intense 48ca beam for six months intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging target and detector and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical consequently future experiments must be done at facilities such as under construction superheavy element factory she factory at joint institute for nuclear research jinr or riken which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions even so it is expected to be a great challenge to continue past elements 120 or 121 given short predicted half lives and low predicted cross sections production of new superheavy elements will require projectiles heavier than 48ca which was successfully used in discovery of elements 114 118 though this necessitates more symmetric reactions which are less favorable hence it is likely that reactions between 58fe and a 249cf or newly available 251cf target are most promising studies on fission of various superheavy compound nuclei have found that dynamics of 48ca and 58fe induced reactions are similar suggesting that 58fe projectiles may be viable in producing superheavy nuclei up to z 124 or possibly 125 it is also possible that a reaction with 251cf will produce compound nucleus with 185 neutrons immediately above n 184 shell closure for this reason compound nucleus is predicted to have relatively high survival probability and low neutron separation energy leading to 1n 3n channels and isotopes 306 308ubq with a relatively high cross section these dynamics are highly speculative as cross section may be far lower should trends in production of elements 112 118 continue or fission barriers be lower than expected regardless of shell effects leading to decreased stability against spontaneous fission which is of growing importance nonetheless prospect of reaching n 184 shell on proton rich side of chart of nuclides by increasing proton number has long been considered already in 1970 georgy flyorov suggested bombarding a plutonium target with zinc projectiles to produce isotopes of element 124 at n 184 shell predicted properties nuclear stability and isotopes thumb right 400px this nuclear chart used by japan atomic energy agency predicts decay modes of nuclei up to z 149 and n 256 for unbiquadium z 124 there are predicted regions of increased stability around n 184 and n 228 though many intermediate isotopes are theoretically susceptible to spontaneous fission with half lives shorter than 1 unbiquadium is of interest to researchers because of its possible location near center of an island of stability a theoretical region comprising longer lived superheavy nuclei such an island of stability was first proposed by university of california professor glenn seaborg specifically predicting a region of stability centered at element 126 unbihexium and encompassing nearby elements including unbiquadium with half lives possibly as long as 109 years in known elements stability of nuclei decreases greatly with increase in atomic number after uranium heaviest primordial element so that all observed isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half life under a day with an exception of dubnium 268 nevertheless there is a slight increase in nuclear stability in nuclides around atomic numbers 110 114 which suggests presence of an island of stability this is attributed to possible closure of nuclear shells in superheavy mass region with stabilizing effects that may lead to half lives on order of years or longer for some as yet undiscovered isotopes of these elements while still unproven existence of superheavy elements as heavy as oganesson provides evidence of such stabilizing effects as elements with an atomic number greater than approximately 104 are extremely unstable in models neglecting magic numbers in this region of periodic table n 184 and n 228 have been proposed as closed neutron shells and various atomic numbers have been proposed as closed proton shells including z 124 island of stability is characterized by longer half lives of nuclei located near these magic numbers though extent of stabilizing effects is uncertain due to predictions of weakening of proton shell closures and possible loss of double magicity more recent research predicts island of stability to instead be centered at beta stable copernicium isotopes 291cn and 293cn which would place unbiquadium well above island and result in short half lives regardless of shell effects a 2016 study on decay properties of unbiquadium isotopes 284 predicts that 284 lie outside proton drip line and thus may be proton emitters 305 may undergo alpha decay with some chains terminating as far as flerovium and heavier isotopes will decay by spontaneous fission these results as well as those from a quantum tunneling model predict no half lives over a millisecond for isotopes lighter than as well as especially short half lives for 309 in sub microsecond range due to destabilizing effects immediately above shell at n 184 this renders identification of many unbiquadium isotopes nearly impossible with current technology as detectors cannot distinguish rapid successive signals from alpha decays in a time period shorter than microseconds increasingly short spontaneous fission half lives of superheavy nuclei and possible domination of fission over alpha decay will also probably determine stability of unbiquadium isotopes while some fission half lives constituting a sea of instability may be on order of 10 18 s as a consequence of very low fission barriers especially in even even nuclei due to pairing effects stabilizing effects at n 184 and n 228 may allow existence of relatively long lived isotopes for n 184 fission half lives may increase though alpha half lives are still expected to be on order of microseconds or less despite shell closure at 308ubq it is also possible that island of stability may shift to n 198 region where total half lives may be on order of seconds in contrast to neighboring isotopes that would undergo fission in less than a microsecond in neutron rich region around n 228 alpha half lives are also predicted to increase with increasing neutron number meaning that stability of such nuclei would primarily depend on location of beta stability line and resistance to fission one early calculation by p moller a physicist at los alamos national laboratory estimates total half life of with n 228 to be around 67 seconds and possibly longest in n 228 region however such conclusions are strongly dependent on nuclear mass model used and exact location of closed shells as predictions for half life of unbiquadium isotopes vary within over 30 orders of magnitude chemical unbiquadium is fourth member of superactinide series and may be a heavier congener of uranium in superactinide series aufbau principle is expected to break down due to relativistic effects and an overlap of 5g 6f 7d and 8p orbitals is expected ground state electron configuration of unbiquadium is thus predicted to be og 8s2 8p1 in contrast to og 8s2 derived from aufbau this predicted overlap of orbitals and uncertainty in order of filling especially for f and g orbitals renders predictions of chemical and atomic properties of these elements very difficult one predicted oxidation state of unbiquadium is 6 which would exist in halides x a halogen analogous to known 6 oxidation state in uranium like other early superactinides binding energies of unbiquadium s valence electrons are predicted to be small enough that all six should easily participate in chemical reactions predicted
