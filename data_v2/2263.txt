william warelwast died 1137 was a medieval norman cleric and bishop of exeter in england warelwast was a native of normandy but little is known about his background before 1087 when he appears as a royal clerk for king william ii most of his royal service to william was as a diplomatic envoy as he was heavily involved in king s dispute with anselm archbishop of canterbury which constituted english theatre of investiture controversy he went several times to rome as an emissary to papacy on business related to anselm one of whose supporters medieval chronicler eadmer alleged that warelwast bribed pope and papal officials to secure favourable outcomes for king william possibly present at king william s death in a hunting accident warelwast served as a diplomat to king s successor henry i after resolution of investiture controversy warelwast was rewarded with bishopric of exeter in devon but he continued to serve henry as a diplomat and royal judge he began construction of a new cathedral at exeter and he probably divided diocese into archdeaconries warelwast went blind after 1120 and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew robert warelwast early life little is known of warelwast s background or family before 1087 later in life he was involved in founding augustinian houses of canons which according to historian implies that he was an augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons blake bishop william warelwast report and transactions of devonshire association p 15 several medieval chroniclers hostile to warelwast including eadmer claim that he was illiterate but his career suggests otherwise as it involved extensive use of written documents he must also have been an accomplished speaker given number of times he was used as a diplomat he was possibly educated at laon where later in life he sent his nephew robert warelwast to school another nephew william became bishop s steward barlow warelwast william de oxford dictionary of national biography warelwast may have been a clerk for king william i of england as a confirmation charter from time of king stephen reigned 1135 1154 records that a grant of churches in exeter was given to warelwast by willelmus avus or william my grandfather ancestor stephen was a grandson of william i who reigned 1066 1087 but this charter may be a forgery or willelmus referred to may have been william ii rather than william i charter itself is insufficient evidence to confidently assert that warelwast served william i even though most such grants were made as a reward for royal service it may have been that warelwast was awarded land by william i not because he was a royal servant but because he was a relative certainly late medieval writer william worcester claimed that warelwast was related to king blake bishop william warelwast report and transactions of devonshire association pp 15 16 royal clerk under king william ii first reliable mentions of warelwast occur early in reign of king william ii when warelwast appears as authorizing writs for king barlow william rufus p 96 as well as being a royal clerk warelwast acted as a judge in a legal case between st florent abbey in and fecamp abbey heard before king william ii some time between 1094 and 1099 at blake bishop william warelwast report and transactions of devonshire association p 16 warelwast served king as an envoy to pope urban ii in 1095 when king was seeking to have newly appointed archbishop of canterbury anselm of canterbury removed from office poole domesday book to magna carta p 174 he visited pope with another royal clerk gerard with orders to recognize urban as pope in return for anselm s deposition at least according to eadmer an anselm partisan two clerks travelled very quickly as they did not leave before 28 february 1095 and were back in england by 13 may 1095 vaughn anselm of bec p 187 eadmer claimed that ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium symbol of an archbishop s authority for king to give to his new choice as archbishop but although king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects he was probably willing to negotiate and to settle for less barlow william rufus pp 342 343 two clerks returned with a papal legate walter of albano who accepted king s recognition of urban but refused to allow anselm s deposition mason william ii rufus p 143 king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in church and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval it may well be that king always regarded anselm s deposition as unlikely warelwast was probably sent as an envoy to urban in 1096 to bribe pope into recalling papal legate who had been sent to england to protest king s conduct towards church barlow william rufus p 364 in addition to his ambassadorial duties warelwast acted as a royal justice under king william records of one case have survived barlow william rufus p 395 shortly before anselm went into exile in 1097 warelwast searched his baggage bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 405 probably looking for communications to pope either from anselm or other english bishops rather than for valuables and in particular for any letters of complaint mason william ii rufus pp 175 178 warelwast was king s envoy at rome when during his exile anselm petitioned to have king excommunicated poole domesday book to magna carta p 177 which according to eadmer who was also present warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing pope and papal officials king had sent warelwast to urban at christmas 1098 with his reply to a letter pope had written ordering restoration of anselm s estates royal service for king henry i thumb upright king henry s dream from a 12th century manuscript of chronicon ex chronicis of john of worcester left warelwast may have been with hunting party on 2 august 1100 in which king william was accidentally killed as he was one of witnesses to letter sent on 5 august 1100 from william iis brother new king henry i to anselm recalling archbishop barlow william rufus p 420 king henry continued to use warelwast as an ambassador sending him to rome in 1101 to bring back pope paschal ii s reply to a letter written by henry immediately after his accession henry was seeking a reconciliation with papacy and confirmed to pope rights and obedience which his father had rendered but he also requested same rights within church as his father had enjoyed chiefly lay investiture of bishops and granting of symbols of episcopal authority by laymen paschal declined to grant henry those rights barlow english church pp 297 henry i p 118 it was warelwast who told anselm in 1103 that king would not permit his return to england this came after a failed joint mission by warelwast and anselm to paschal attempting to resolve dispute between henry and archbishop over king s investiture of bishops a dispute generally known as investiture controversy it is quite likely that king had given instructions that if mission failed warelwast was to inform anselm that he should only to return to england if he agreed with king s position in dispute vaughn anselm of bec pp 244 245 in 1106 warelwast was king s negotiator in discussions that led to settlement of investiture controversy in england barlow english church p 80 king ultimately lost little relinquishing right to give actual symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive homage from bishops huscroft ruling england pp 131 132 early in 1106 warelwast was sent to bec abbey where anselm was residing in exile to inform him of settlement and deliver to archbishop king s invitation to return to england hollister henry i p 198 in may 1107 warelwast acted as king s envoy at paschal s council at troyes where paschal was attempting to secure support for bohemond of antioch s proposed campaign against byzantium warelwast probably relayed to pope news that king henry would make no contribution to bohemond s efforts cantor church kingship and lay investiture p 264 henry had reserved episcopal see of exeter for warelwast since death of osbern in 1103 but controversy over investiture meant that his election and consecration were not possible before a settlement was reached instead king gave warelwast office of archdeacon of exeter after osbern s death medieval chronicler william of malmesbury records that warelwast had earlier tried to remove osbern from office but this story probably originates with eadmer and is of dubious veracity while archdeacon warelwast is recorded as being present at transfer of a devon church to bath cathedral brett english church p 108 he was elected bishop of exeter and was consecrated on 11 august 1107 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 246 by anselm at royal palace of

1115 henry sent warelwast back to rome to negotiate with paschal who was angry that king was prohibiting papal legates in england not allowing clerics to appeal to papal court and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or translation of bishops warelwast was unable to change pope s mind but he did manage to prevent sanctions against king hollister henry i pp 240 241 henry

medieval history p 3 william of malmesbury felt that during warelwast s episcopate cathedral chapter relaxed its communal living which previously had been strong it is likely that during warelwast s episcopate canons of cathedral chapter quit living in a communal dormitory blake development of chapter journal of medieval history p 6 warelwast went blind in his later years starting in about 1120 which william of malmesbury regarded as a fitting punishment for warelwast s alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early he died about 26 september 1137 and was buried in priory at plympton he may have resigned his see prior to his death 16th century antiquary john leland thought that warelwast resigned his see before 1127 became a canon at plympton and died in 1127 although leland s year of death is incorrect it is possible that warelwast became a canon shortly before his death blake bishop william warelwast report and transactions of devonshire association p 30 annales
