as inspired by offerings from other artists first volume was released alongside video game as volume 1 on november 9 of same year as soundtrack was finished before all in game music was completed none of tracks written by o donnell appear in halo 2 in same arrangement bands featured in volume 1 including breaking benjamin and incubus were enthusiastic about adding music to soundtrack incubus was tapped to produce a suite of music which appears scattered throughout soundtrack as four movements incubus guitarist mike einziger said that halo is only video game that ever inspired us to write a whole suite of music first pieces of music o donnell wrote for halo 2 were promotional in nature o donnell scored cinematic announcement trailer for halo 2 on august 2 2002 and followed up with interactive music for electronic entertainment expo 2003 halo 2 demo o donnell confirmed that chanting monks of halo combat evolveds choral theme along with additional guitars by steve vai would return in halo 2 o donnell noted that new setting of africa prompted him to look at afro cuban influences but most of this type of music did not make it to final product rather than write for locations or use leitmotifs for all different characters in what o donnell called a peter and wolf approach to music o donnell wrote sad music for sad moments scary music to score scary bits and so forth recurring themes developed more by accident than planning recording of orchestrated music was completed over several sessions with northwest sinfonia orchestra at studio x in seattle washington

mixed and mastered volume s music is formatted in a suite structure that corresponds with chapters within game in order to create a music representation of video game o donnell stated that this
