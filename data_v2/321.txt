amanita atkinsoniana is a species of fungus in amanitaceae family it is found in northeastern southeastern and southern united states as well as southern canada where it grows solitarily or in small groups on ground in mixed woods fruit body is white to brownish with caps that measure up to in diameter and stems up to long and thick surface of cap is covered with reddish brown to grayish brown conical warts stem has a bulbous base covered with grayish brown scales fruit bodies smell faintly like bleaching powder although not known to be poisonous mushroom is not recommended for consumption taxonomy species was first described by american botanist william chambers coker in 1917 in his monograph of amanitas of eastern united states coker s description was based on several specimens he had collected from various locations in north carolina in september and october 1914 specific name honors george atkinson a cornell university mycologist who collected and described mushrooms in southern and eastern united states in late 19th century in 1952 marcel chose to place it in genus armillaria as armillaria atkinsoniana but this change was not adopted by later authors amanita atkinsoniana is classified in stirps microlepsis of subsection solitariae in section lepidella of genus amanita species in subsection solitariae are distinguished by several characteristics a volva composed of cellular structures of varying shape rows of large cylindrical to slender club shaped cells that are never dominant a stem that typically has a bulbous base and remnants of volva on surface that are concentrated towards base volva is not membranous nor nearly membranous never forming a limb at base of stem and never forming patches on surface of cap where outer layer consists of hyphae pressed against surface description thumb left this mature fruit body has a plano convex cap margin bears floccose patches remnants of partial veil cap of a atkinsoniana is wide and depending on its age ranges in shape from convex to flattened sometimes with a shallow central depression its color can vary from whitish to yellowish white brownish gray brownish orange to grayish brown and is lighter on margin cap surface is covered with remnants of universal veil as small reddish brown to grayish brown easily removable conical warts approaching edge of cap warts gradually become small woolly patches cap margin is smooth or has faint grooves mirroring underlying gills and has partial veil remnants hanging along edge gills are free from attachment to stem close to crowded together moderately broad yellowish white and occasionally have a slight reddish stain lamellulae short gills that do not extend completely from cap margin to stem are truncate cut off sharply to attenuate stem is long and wide equal or tapering slightly toward apex whitish and floccose to smooth basal bulb is club shaped ventricose fusiform or turnip shaped rounded or pointed usually covered with rings of reddish brown scales or warts of universal veil remains often extending up stem for a short distance universal veil on stem base is quite unusual in amanita because it forms warts that extend nearly to very bottom of bulb stem often roots into soil beneath bulb with an elongated cord of mycelium known as a pseudorhiza partial veil forms a ring that is somewhat membranous fragile to moderately persistent and yellowish white to pale yellow eventually as mushroom matures it collapses on stem as a thin membrane flesh is white with a weak odor of bleaching powder microscopic characteristics thumb right a partial veil covers developing gills of young fruit bodies spore print is white spores are ellipsoid to elongated hyaline translucent thin walled and have dimensions of 9 12 5 by 5 5 8 mm they are amyloid meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with melzer s reagent basidia spore bearing cells are 35 60 by 7 13 5 mm club shaped four spored with clamps at their bases cheilocystidia cystidia found on edge of gill are 15 45 by 10 30 mm ellipsoid to club shaped and abundant cap cuticle is up to 165 mm thick and is made of interwoven to radial hyphae 2 5 8 mm diameter which is slightly to strongly gelatinized universal veil on cap consists of mainly roughly spherical to ellipsoid but also club shaped and elongated cells up to 75 by 40 mm arranged in short terminal chains and relatively sparse hyphae measuring 3 7 5 mm in diameter at base of stem universal veil tissue is very similar to that on cap clamp connections are present in hyphae edibility pomerleau 1980 considers mushroom as doubtfully edible while orson and hope miller in their field guide to north american mushrooms list it as possibly poisonous although they also indicate that no specific reports of toxins have been reported from species and recommend that in general no species in amanita subgenus lepidella should be consumed similar species thumb right amanita onusta is a potential lookalike species because of colored volva a atkinsoniana resembles a onusta which differs from a atkinsoniana by small to medium sized fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting sometimes fruit bodies of a atkinsoniana are confused with a microlepsis which can be distinguished by presence of reddish brown to grayish brown volval remnants and rooting bulb of a atkinsoniana distribution and habitat fruit bodies of amanita atkinsoniana grow on ground in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests they have been collected in alabama georgia massachusetts maryland michigan north carolina new jersey new york pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia vermont and west virginia one field guide notes a preference for association with oak where there is ground cover of blueberry vaccinium bushes mushroom has also been collected in quebec canada southern extent of its range extends to mexican state of michoacan mushroom fruits most commonly
