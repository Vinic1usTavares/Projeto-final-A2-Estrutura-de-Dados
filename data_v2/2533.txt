william mckinley born william mckinley jr january 29 1843 september 14 1901 was 25th president of united states serving from march 4 1897 until his assassination six months into his second term during his presidency mckinley led nation to victory in spanish american war raised protective tariffs to promote american industry and kept nation on gold standard in a rejection of free silver effectively expansionary monetary policy mckinley was last president to have served in american civil war and only one to have started war as an enlisted soldier beginning as a private in union army and ending as a brevet major after war he settled in canton ohio where he practiced law and married ida saxton in 1876 he was elected to congress where he became republican party s expert on protective tariff which he promised would bring prosperity his 1890 mckinley tariff was highly controversial which together with a democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office led to his defeat in democratic landslide of 1890 he was elected governor of ohio in 1891 and 1893 steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests with aid of his close adviser mark hanna he secured republican nomination for president in 1896 amid a deep economic depression he defeated his democratic rival william jennings bryan after a front porch campaign in which he advocated sound money gold standard unless altered by international agreement and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity rapid economic growth marked mckinley s presidency he promoted 1897 dingley tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 secured passage of gold standard act mckinley hoped to persuade spain to grant independence to rebellious cuba without conflict but when negotiation failed he led nation into spanish american war of 1898 united states victory was quick and decisive as part of peace settlement spain turned over to united states its main overseas colonies of puerto rico guam and philippines while cuba was promised independence but at that time remained under control of united states army united states annexed independent republic of hawaii in 1898 and it became a united states territory historians regard mckinley s 1896 victory as a realigning election in which political stalemate of post civil war era gave way to republican dominated fourth party system which began with progressive era mckinley defeated bryan again in 1900 presidential election in a campaign focused on imperialism protectionism and free silver his legacy was suddenly cut short when he was shot on september 6 1901 by leon czolgosz a second generation polish american with anarchist leanings mckinley died eight days later and was succeeded by his vice president theodore roosevelt as an innovator of american interventionism and pro business sentiment mckinley s presidency is generally considered above average though his highly positive public perception was soon overshadowed by roosevelt early life and family left thumb upright william mckinley at age 15 william mckinley jr was born in 1843 in niles ohio seventh of nine children of william

american civil war began thousands of men in ohio volunteered for service among them were mckinley and his cousin william mckinley osbourne who enlisted as privates in newly formed poland guards in june 1861 men left for columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form 23rd ohio infantry men were unhappy to learn that unlike ohio s earlier volunteer regiments they would not be permitted to elect their officers they would be designated by ohio s governor william dennison dennison appointed colonel william rosecrans as commander of regiment and men began training on outskirts of columbus mckinley quickly took to soldier s life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling army and union cause delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought men into conflict with their officers but major rutherford b hayes convinced them to accept what government had issued them his style in dealing with men impressed mckinley beginning an association and friendship that would last until hayes s death in 1893 after a month of training mckinley and 23rd ohio now led by colonel eliakim p scammon set out for western virginia today part of west virginia in july 1861 as a part of kanawha division mckinley initially thought scammon was a martinet but when regiment finally saw battle he came to appreciate value of their relentless drilling their first contact with enemy came in september when they drove back confederate troops at carnifex ferry in present day west virginia three days after battle mckinley was assigned to duty in brigade quartermaster office where he worked both to supply his regiment and as a clerk in november regiment established winter quarters near fayetteville today in west virginia mckinley spent winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill and in april 1862 he was promoted to that rank regiment resumed its advance that spring with hayes in command scammon by then led brigade and fought several minor engagements against rebel forces that september mckinley s regiment was called east to reinforce general john pope s army of virginia at second battle of bull run delayed in passing

was first regiment to encounter confederates at battle of south mountain on september 14 after severe losses union forces drove back confederates and continued to sharpsburg maryland where they engaged lee s army at battle of antietam one of bloodiest battles of war 23rd was also in thick of fighting at antietam and mckinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to men on line mckinley s regiment again suffered many casualties but army of potomac was victorious and confederates retreated into virginia regiment was then detached from army of potomac and returned by train to western virginia shenandoah valley and promotion thumb upright mckinley in 1865 just after war photograph by mathew brady while regiment went into winter quarters near charleston virginia present day west virginia mckinley was ordered back to ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops when they arrived in columbus governor david tod surprised mckinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at antietam mckinley and his comrades saw little action until july 1863 when division skirmished with john hunt morgan s cavalry at battle of buffington island early in 1864 army command structure in west virginia was reorganized and division was assigned to george crook s army of west virginia they soon resumed offensive marching into southwestern virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by enemy on may 9 army engaged confederate troops at cloyd s mountain where men charged enemy entrenchments and drove rebels from field mckinley later said combat there was as desperate as any witnessed during war following rout union forces destroyed confederate supplies and skirmished with enemy again successfully mckinley and his regiment moved to shenandoah valley as armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities crook s corps was attached to major general david hunter s army of shenandoah and soon back in contact with confederate forces capturing lexington virginia on june 11 they continued south toward lynchburg tearing up railroad track as they advanced hunter believed troops at lynchburg were too powerful however and brigade returned to west virginia before army could make another attempt confederate general jubal early s raid into maryland forced their recall to north early s army surprised them at kernstown on july 24 where mckinley came under heavy fire and army was defeated retreating into maryland army was reorganized again major general philip sheridan replaced hunter and mckinley who had been promoted to captain after battle was transferred to general crook s staff by august early was retreating south in valley with sheridan s army in pursuit they fended off a confederate assault at where mckinley had a horse shot out from under him and advanced to opequon creek where they broke enemy lines and pursued them farther south they followed up victory with another at fisher s hill on september 22 and were engaged once more at cedar creek on october 19 after initially falling back from confederate advance mckinley helped to rally troops and turn tide of battle after cedar creek army stayed in vicinity through election day when mckinley cast his first presidential ballot for incumbent republican abraham lincoln next day they moved north up valley into winter quarters near kernstown in february 1865 crook was captured by confederate raiders crook s capture added to confusion as army was reorganized for spring campaign and mckinley found himself serving on staffs of four different generals over next fifteen days crook john d stevenson samuel s carroll and winfield s hancock finally assigned to carroll s staff again mckinley acted as general s first and only adjutant lee and his army surrendered to general ulysses s grant a few days later effectively ending war mckinley found time to join a freemason lodge later renamed after him in winchester virginia before he and carroll were transferred to hancock s first veterans corps in washington just before war s end mckinley received his final promotion a brevet commission as major in july veterans corps was mustered out of service and mckinley and carroll were relieved of their duties carroll and hancock encouraged mckinley to apply for a place in peacetime army but he declined and returned to ohio following month mckinley along with samuel m taylor and james c howe co authored and published a twelve volume work official roster of soldiers of state of ohio in war of rebellion 1861 1866 published in 1886 mckinley taylor howe 1886 legal career and marriage thumb left upright ida saxton mckinley thumb left upright katherine mckinley after war ended in 1865 mckinley decided on a career in law and began studying in office of an attorney in poland ohio following year he continued his studies by attending albany law school in new york after studying there for less than a year mckinley returned home and was admitted to bar in warren ohio in march 1867 that same year he moved to canton county seat of stark county and set up a small office he soon formed a partnership with george w belden an experienced lawyer and former judge his practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on main street in canton which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come when his army friend rutherford b hayes was nominated for governor in 1867 mckinley made speeches on his behalf in stark county his first foray into politics county was closely divided between democrats and republicans but hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory in 1869 mckinley ran for office of prosecuting attorney of stark county an office usually then held by democrats and was unexpectedly elected when mckinley ran for re election in 1871 democrats nominated william a lynch a prominent local lawyer and mckinley was defeated by 143 votes as mckinley s professional career progressed so too did his social life blossom as he wooed ida saxton daughter of a prominent canton family they were married on january 25 1871 in newly built first presbyterian church of canton although ida soon joined her husband s methodist church their first child katherine was born on christmas day 1871 a second daughter ida followed in 1873 but died same year mckinley s wife descended into a deep depression at her baby s death and her health never robust grew worse two years later in 1875 katherine died of typhoid fever ida never recovered from her daughters deaths mckinleys had no more children ida mckinley developed epilepsy around same time and thereafter disliked her husband s leaving her side he remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife s medical and emotional needs for rest of his life ida mckinley insisted that william continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics he attended state republican convention that nominated hayes for a third term as governor in 1875 and campaigned again for his old friend in election that fall next year mckinley undertook a high profile case defending a group of striking coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers lynch mckinley s opponent in 1871 election and his partner william r day were opposing counsel and mine owners included mark hanna a cleveland businessman taking case pro bono he was successful in getting all but one of miners acquitted case raised mckinley s standing among laborers a crucial part of stark county electorate and also introduced him to hanna who would become his strongest backer in years to come mckinley s good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for republican nomination for ohio s 17th congressional district delegates to county conventions thought he could attract blue collar voters and in august 1876 mckinley was nominated by that time hayes had been nominated for president and mckinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign both were successful mckinley campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff defeated democratic nominee levi l by 3 300 votes while hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach presidency mckinley s victory came at a personal cost his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer rising politician 1877 1895 spokesman for protection mckinley first took his congressional seat in october 1877 when president hayes summoned congress into special session with republicans in minority mckinley was given unimportant committee assignments which he undertook conscientiously mckinley s friendship with hayes did mckinley little good on capitol hill president was not well regarded by many leaders there young congressman broke with hayes on question of currency but it did not affect their friendship united states had effectively been placed on gold standard by coinage act of 1873 when silver prices dropped significantly many sought to make silver again a legal tender equally with gold such a course would be inflationary but advocates argued that economic benefits of increased money supply would be worth inflation opponents warned that free silver would not bring promised benefits and would harm united states in international trade mckinley voted for bland allison act of 1878 which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money and also joined large majorities in each house that overrode hayes veto of legislation in so doing mckinley voted against position of house republican leader his fellow ohioan and friend james garfield thumb representative mckinley from his first term in congress mckinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue but to allow american manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in domestic market over foreign competitors mckinley biographer margaret leech noted that canton had become prosperous as a center for manufacture of farm equipment because of protection and that this may have helped form his political views mckinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue garfield s election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on house ways and means committee mckinley was selected to fill it placing him on most powerful committee after only two terms mckinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics in 1880 he served a brief term as ohio s representative on republican national committee in 1884 he was elected a delegate to that year s republican convention where he served as chair of committee on resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of convention when called upon to preside by 1886 mckinley senator john sherman and governor joseph b foraker were considered leaders of republican party in ohio sherman who had helped to found republican party ran three times for republican nomination for president in 1880s each time failing while foraker began a meteoric rise in ohio politics early in decade hanna once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor supported sherman s ambitions as well as those of foraker latter relationship broke off at 1888 republican national convention where mckinley foraker and hanna were all delegates supporting sherman convinced sherman could not win foraker threw his support to unsuccessful republican 1884 presidential nominee maine senator james g blaine when blaine stated he was not a candidate foraker returned to sherman but nomination went to former indiana senator benjamin harrison who was elected president in bitterness that followed convention hanna abandoned foraker and for rest of mckinley s life ohio republican party was divided into two factions one aligned with mckinley sherman and hanna and other with foraker hanna came to admire mckinley and became a friend and close adviser to him although hanna remained active in business and in promoting other republicans in years after 1888 he spent an increasing amount of time boosting mckinley s political career in 1889 with republicans in majority mckinley sought election as speaker of house he failed to gain post which went to thomas b reed of maine however speaker reed appointed mckinley chairman of ways and means committee ohioan guided mckinley tariff of 1890 through congress although mckinley s work was altered through influence of special interests in senate it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods gerrymandering and defeat for re election recognizing mckinley s potential democrats whenever they controlled ohio legislature sought to gerrymander or him out of office in 1878 mckinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district he won anyway causing hayes to exult oh good luck of mckinley he was gerrymandered out and then beat gerrymander we enjoyed it as much as he did after 1882 election mckinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party line house vote out of office he was briefly depressed by setback but soon vowed to run again democrats again redistricted stark county for 1884 election mckinley was returned to congress anyway thumb judge magazine cover from september 1890 showing mckinley left having helped dispatch speaker reed s opponent in early voting maine hurrying off with victor to mckinley s gerrymandered ohio district for 1890 democrats gerrymandered mckinley one final time placing stark county in same district as one of strongest pro democrat counties holmes populated by solidly democratic pennsylvania dutch new boundaries seemed good based on past results for a democratic majority of 2000 to 3000 republicans could not reverse gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891 but they could throw all their energies into district as mckinley tariff was a main theme of democratic campaign nationwide and there was considerable attention paid to mckinley s race republican party sent its leading orators to canton including blaine then secretary of state speaker reed and president harrison democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues mckinley tirelessly stumped his new district reaching out to its 40 000 voters to explain that his tariff democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor john g warwick to drive their point home they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers who went door to door offering 25 cent to housewives for 50 cents explaining rise in prices was due to mckinley tariff in end mckinley lost by 300 votes but republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory governor of ohio 1892 1896 even before mckinley completed his term in congress he met with a delegation of ohioans urging him to run for governor governor james e campbell a democrat who had defeated foraker in 1889 was to seek re election in 1891 ohio republican party remained divided but mckinley quietly arranged for foraker to nominate him at 1891 state republican convention which chose mckinley by acclamation former congressman spent much of second half of 1891 campaigning against campbell beginning in his birthplace of niles hanna however was little seen in campaign he spent much of his time raising funds for election of legislators pledged to vote for sherman in 1892 senatorial election mckinley won 1891 election by some 20 000 votes following january sherman with considerable assistance from hanna turned back a challenge by foraker to win legislature s vote for another term in senate right thumb even after his final run for president in 1884 james g blaine was still seen as a possible candidate for republican nomination in this 1890 puck cartoon he is startling reed and mckinley right as they make their plans for 1892 ohio s governor had relatively little power for example he could recommend legislation but not veto it but with ohio a key swing state its governor was a major figure in national politics although mckinley believed that health of nation depended on that of business he was in dealing with labor he procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union president harrison had proven unpopular there were divisions even within republican party as year 1892 began and harrison began his re election drive although no declared republican candidate opposed harrison many republicans were ready to dump president from ticket if an alternative emerged among possible candidates spoken of were mckinley reed and aging blaine fearing that ohio governor would emerge as a candidate harrison s managers arranged for mckinley to be permanent chairman of convention in minneapolis requiring him to play a public neutral role hanna established an unofficial mckinley headquarters near convention hall though no active effort was made to convert delegates to mckinley s cause mckinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him nevertheless he finished third behind renominated harrison and behind blaine who had sent word he did not want to be considered although mckinley campaigned loyally for republican ticket harrison was defeated by former president cleveland in november election in wake of cleveland s victory mckinley was seen by some as likely republican candidate in 1896 soon after cleveland s return to office hard times struck nation with panic of 1893 a businessman in youngstown robert walker had lent money to mckinley in their younger days in gratitude mckinley had often guaranteed walker s borrowings for his business governor had never kept track of what he was signing he believed walker a sound businessman in fact walker had deceived mckinley telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones walker was ruined by recession mckinley was called upon for repayment in february 1893 total owed was over 100 000 equivalent to million in and a despairing mckinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn money as an attorney instead mckinley s wealthy supporters including hanna and chicago publisher h h kohlsaat became trustees of a fund from which notes would be paid both william and ida mckinley placed their property in hands of fund s trustees who included hanna and kohlsaat and supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money all of couple s property was returned to them by end of 1893 and when mckinley who had promised eventual repayment asked for list of contributors it was refused him many people who had suffered in hard times sympathized with mckinley whose popularity grew he was easily re elected in november 1893 receiving largest percentage of vote of any ohio governor since civil war mckinley campaigned widely for republicans in 1894 midterm congressional elections many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful his political efforts in ohio were rewarded with election in november 1895 of a republican successor as governor asa bushnell and a republican legislature that elected foraker to senate mckinley supported foraker for senate and bushnell who was of foraker s faction for governor in return new senator elect agreed to back mckinley s presidential ambitions with party peace in ohio assured mckinley turned to national arena election of 1896 obtaining nomination thumb upright mckinley s close friend and adviser mark hanna it is unclear when william mckinley began to seriously prepare a run for president as phillips notes no documents no diaries no confidential letters to mark hanna or anyone else contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems from beginning mckinley s preparations had participation of hanna whose biographer william t horner noted what is certainly true is that in 1888 two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put mckinley in white house sherman did not run for president again after 1888 and so hanna could support mckinley s ambitions for that office wholeheartedly backed by hanna s money and organizational skills mckinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896 when other contenders such as speaker reed and iowa senator william b allison sent agents outside their states to organize republicans in support of their candidacies they found that hanna s agents had preceded them according to historian stanley jones in his study of 1896 election hanna on mckinley s behalf met with eastern republican political bosses such as senators thomas platt of new york and matthew quay of pennsylvania who were willing to guarantee mckinley s nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices mckinley however was determined to obtain nomination without making deals and hanna accepted that decision many of their early efforts were focused on south hanna obtained a vacation home in southern georgia where mckinley visited and met with republican politicians from region mckinley needed 453 1 2 delegate votes to gain nomination he gained nearly half that number from south and border states platt lamented in his memoirs hanna had south practically solid before some of us awakened thumb left upright 1 35 louis dalrymple cartoon from puck magazine june 24 1896 showing mckinley about to crown himself with republican nomination priests are hanna in green and representative charles h grosvenor red h h kohlsaat is page holding robe bosses still hoped to deny mckinley a first ballot majority at convention by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as quay new york governor and former vice president levi p morton and illinois senator shelby cullom delegate rich illinois proved a crucial battleground as mckinley supporters such as chicago businessman and future vice president charles g dawes sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for mckinley at national convention in st louis cullom proved unable to stand against mckinley despite support of local republican machines at state convention at end of april mckinley completed a near sweep of illinois delegates former president harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered race when harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination mckinley organization took control of indiana with a speed harrison privately found unseemly morton operatives who journeyed to indiana sent word back that they had found state alive for mckinley wyoming senator francis warren wrote politicians are making a hard fight against him but if masses could speak mckinley is choice of at least 75 of entire body of republican voters in union by time national convention began in st louis on june 16 1896 mckinley had an ample majority of delegates former governor who remained in canton followed events at convention closely by telephone and was able to hear part of foraker s speech nominating him over line when ohio was reached in roll call of states its votes gave mckinley nomination which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled house anticipating first of many crowds that gathered at republican candidate s home thousands of partisans came from canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear mckinley speak from his front porch convention nominated republican national committee vice chairman garret hobart of new jersey for vice president a choice actually made by most accounts by hanna hobart a wealthy lawyer businessman and former state legislator was not widely known but as hanna biographer herbert croly pointed out if he did little to strengthen ticket he did nothing to weaken it general election campaign thumb left before 1896 convention mckinley tried to avoid coming down on one side or other of currency question william allen rogers s cartoon from harper s weekly june 1896 showing mckinley riding rail of currency question alt a political cartoon an imperially confident looking man in an exaggerated military officer s uniform is riding a plank of wood marked financial question which is balanced between two saw horses man s weight is bending wood rather dramatically before republican convention mckinley had been a straddle bug on currency question favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement in final days before convention mckinley decided after hearing from politicians and businessmen that platform should endorse gold standard though it should allow for bimetallism through in coordination with other nations adoption of platform caused some western delegates led by colorado senator henry m teller to walk out of convention however compared with democrats republican divisions on issue were small especially as mckinley promised future concessions to silver advocates bad economic times had continued and strengthened hand of forces for free silver issue bitterly divided democratic party president cleveland firmly supported gold standard but an increasing number of rural democrats wanted silver especially in south and west silverites took control of 1896 democratic national convention and chose william jennings bryan for president he had electrified delegates with his cross of gold speech bryan s financial radicalism shocked bankers they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt railroads and ruin economy hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win election and they gave 3 5 million for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating republican position on money and tariff questions bryan s campaign had at most an estimated 500 000 with his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in race bryan decided on a whistle stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale hanna urged mckinley to match bryan s tour with one of his own candidate declined on grounds that democrat was a better stump speaker i might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against bryan i have to think when i speak instead of going to people mckinley would remain at home in canton and allow people to come to him according to historian r hal williams in his book on 1896 election it was as it turned out a brilliant strategy mckinley s front porch campaign became a legend in american political history thumb left william and ida mckinley to her husband s left pose with members of flower delegation from oil city pennsylvania before mckinley home although women could not vote in most states they might influence male relatives and were encouraged to visit canton mckinley made himself available to public every day except sunday receiving delegations from front porch of his home railroads subsidized visitors with low excursion rates pro silver cleveland plain dealer stated that going to canton had been made cheaper than staying at home delegations marched through streets from railroad station to mckinley s home on north market street once there they crowded close to front porch from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs as their spokesman addressed mckinley candidate then responded speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit interest of delegation speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks even spokesman s remarks were approved by mckinley or a representative this was done as candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him as had happened to blaine in 1884 thumb right upright a man of mark 1896 homer davenport

major exception being new york journal controlled by william randolph hearst whose fortune was based on silver mines in biased reporting and through sharp cartoons of homer davenport hanna was viciously characterized as a trampling on labor mckinley was drawn as a child easily controlled by big business even today these depictions still color images of hanna and mckinley one as a heartless businessman other as a creature of hanna and others of his ilk democrats had pamphlets too though not as many jones analyzed how voters responded to education campaigns of two parties mckinley always thought of himself as a tariff man and expected that monetary issues would fade away in a month he was mistaken silver and gold dominated campaign battleground proved to be midwest south and most of west were conceded to bryan and democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states northeast was considered most likely safe for mckinley after early voting states of maine and vermont supported him in september by then it was clear that public support for silver had receded and mckinley began to emphasize tariff issue by end of september republicans had discontinued printing material on silver issue and were entirely concentrating on tariff question on november 3 1896 voters had their say mckinley won entire northeast and midwest he won 51 of vote and an ample majority in electoral college bryan had concentrated entirely on silver issue and had not appealed to urban workers voters in cities supported mckinley only city outside south of more than 100 000 population carried by bryan was denver colorado right thumb upright 1 25 1896 electoral vote results 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election in which mckinley s view of a stronger central government building american industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed voting patterns established then displaced near deadlock major parties had seen since civil war republican dominance begun then would continue until 1932 another realigning election with ascent of franklin roosevelt phillips argues that with possible exception of iowa senator allison mckinley was only republican who could have defeated bryan he theorized that eastern candidates such as morton or reed would have done badly against illinois born bryan in crucial midwest according to biographer though bryan was popular among rural voters mckinley appealed to a very different industrialized urbanized america presidency 1897 1901 inauguration and appointments thumb mckinley s first

wife and mother looked on new president gave a lengthy inaugural address he urged tariff reform and stated that currency issue would have to await tariff legislation he warned against foreign interventions we want no wars of conquest we must avoid temptation of territorial aggression mckinley s most controversial cabinet appointment was that of john sherman as secretary of state sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities mckinley needed to have hanna appointed to senate so senator sherman was moved up sherman s mental faculties were decaying even in 1896 this was widely spoken of in political circles but mckinley did not believe rumors nevertheless mckinley sent his cousin william mckinley osborne to have dinner with 73 year old senator

declined it preferring to remain as chairman of ways and means committee charles dawes who had been hanna s lieutenant in chicago during campaign was considered for treasury post but by some accounts

lyman j gage president of first national bank of chicago and a gold democrat navy department was offered to former massachusetts congressman john davis long an old friend from house on january 30 1897 although mckinley was initially inclined to allow long to choose his own assistant there was considerable pressure on president elect to appoint theodore roosevelt head of new york city police commission and a published naval historian mckinley was reluctant stating to one roosevelt booster i want peace and i am told that your friend theodore is always getting into rows with everybody nevertheless he made appointment in addition to sherman mckinley made one other ill advised cabinet appointment that of secretary of war which fell to russell a alger former general and michigan governor competent enough in peacetime alger proved inadequate once conflict with spain began with war department plagued by scandal alger resigned at mckinley s request in mid 1899 vice president

freedom from spanish colonial rule by 1895 conflict had expanded to a war for cuban independence as war engulfed island spanish reprisals against rebels grew ever harsher american public opinion favored rebels and mckinley shared in their outrage against spanish policies however while public opinion called for war to liberate cuba mckinley favored a peaceful approach hoping that through negotiation spain might be convinced to grant cuba independence or at least to allow cubans some measure of autonomy united states and spain began negotiations on subject in 1897 but it became clear that spain would never concede cuban independence while rebels and their american supporters would never settle for anything less recent historiography emphasizes humanitarian motivations for initial

when american consul fitzhugh lee reported riots in havana mckinley agreed to send battleship uss maine on february 15 maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed public attention focused on crisis and consensus was that regardless of who set bomb spain had lost control over cuba mckinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether explosion was accidental negotiations with spain continued as court considered evidence but on march 20 court ruled that maine was blown up by an underwater mine as pressure for war mounted in congress mckinley continued to negotiate for cuban

management of war than previous presidents had enjoyed and he used new technologies to direct army s and navy s movements as far as he was able mckinley found alger inadequate as secretary of war and did not get along with army s commanding general nelson a miles bypassing them he looked for strategic advice first from miles s predecessor general john schofield and later from adjutant general henry clarke corbin war led to a change in mckinley s cabinet as president accepted sherman s resignation as secretary of state day agreed to serve as secretary until war s end within a fortnight navy had its first victory when asiatic squadron led by commodore george dewey destroyed spanish navy at battle of manila bay in philippines dewey s overwhelming victory expanded scope of war from one

wesley merritt power to set up legal systems and raise taxes necessities for a long occupation by time troops arrived in philippines at end of june 1898 mckinley had decided that spain would be required to surrender archipelago to united states he professed to be open to all views on subject however he believed that as war progressed public would come to demand retention of islands as a prize of war meanwhile in caribbean theater a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near tampa florida for an invasion of cuba army faced difficulties in supplying rapidly expanding force even before they departed for cuba but by june corbin had made progress in resolving problems after lengthy delays army led by major general william rufus shafter sailed from florida on june 20

american control mckinley and miles also ordered an invasion of puerto rico which met little resistance when it landed in july distance from spain and destruction of spanish navy made resupply impossible and spanish government began to look for a way to end war peace and territorial gain thumb signing of treaty of paris mckinley s cabinet agreed with him that spain must leave cuba and puerto rico but they disagreed on philippines with some wishing to annex entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in area although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of philippines several prominent political leaders including democrats bryan and cleveland and newly formed american anti imperialist league made their opposition known mckinley proposed to open negotiations with spain on basis of cuban liberation and puerto rican annexation with final status of philippines subject to further discussion he stood firmly in that demand even as military situation on cuba began to deteriorate when american army was struck with yellow fever spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on august 12 and treaty negotiations began in paris in september 1898 talks continued until december 18 when treaty of paris was signed united states acquired puerto rico and philippines as well as island of guam and spain relinquished its claims to cuba in exchange united states agreed to pay spain 20 million equivalent to million in mckinley had difficulty convincing senate to approve treaty by requisite two thirds vote but his lobbying and that of

royalist counter revolution or a japanese takeover foreseeing difficulty in getting two thirds of senate to approve a treaty of annexation mckinley instead supported effort of democratic representative francis g newlands of nevada to accomplish result by joint resolution of both houses of congress resulting newlands resolution passed both houses by wide margins and mckinley signed it into law on july 8 1898 mckinley biographer h wayne morgan notes mckinley was guiding spirit behind annexation of hawaii showing a firmness in pursuing it president told cortelyou we need hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did california it is manifest destiny expanding influence overseas even before peace negotiations began with spain mckinley asked congress to set up a commission

legislature mckinley s actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over military after rebellion ended united states reaffirmed its commitment to open door policy which became basis of american policy toward china closer to home mckinley and hay engaged in negotiations with britain over possible construction of a canal across central america clayton bulwer treaty which two nations signed in 1850 prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there war had exposed difficulty of maintaining a two ocean navy without a connection closer than cape horn now with american business and military interests even more involved in asia a canal seemed more essential than ever and mckinley pressed for a renegotiation of treaty hay and british ambassador julian agreed that united states could control a future canal provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified mckinley was satisfied with terms but senate rejected them demanding that united states be allowed to fortify canal hay was embarrassed by rebuff and offered his resignation but mckinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to

on wool sugar and luxury goods mckinley supported it and it became law american negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with france and two nations approached britain to gauge british enthusiasm for bimetallism prime minister lord salisbury and his government showed some interest in idea and told american envoy edward o wolcott that he would be amenable to reopening mints in india to silver coinage if viceroy s executive council there agreed news of a possible departure from gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans and misgivings by indian administration led britain to reject proposal with international effort a failure mckinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced gold standard even without agreement agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to united states and gold from recent strikes in yukon and australia increased monetary supply even without silver coinage in absence of international agreement mckinley favored legislation to formally affirm gold standard but was initially deterred by silver strength in senate by 1900 with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions mckinley urged congress to pass such a law and was able to sign gold standard act on march 14 1900 using a gold pen to do so civil rights thumb left mckinley right of center flanked by georgia governor allen d candler front row

equality mckinley had spoken out against lynching while governor and most african americans who could vote supported him in 1896 mckinley s priority however was in ending sectionalism and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments although mckinley made some appointments of african americans to low level government posts and received some praise for that appointments were less than they had received under previous republican administrations blanche k bruce an african american who during reconstruction had served as senator from mississippi received post of register at treasury department this post was traditionally given to an african american by republican presidents mckinley appointed several black postmasters however when democrats protested appointment of justin w lyons as postmaster of augusta georgia mckinley asked lyons to withdraw he was subsequently given post of treasury register after bruce s death in 1898 president did appoint george b jackson a former slave to post of customs collector in presidio texas however african americans in northern states felt that their contributions to mckinley s victory were overlooked few were appointed to office administration s response to racial violence was minimal causing him to lose black support when black postmasters at georgia in 1897 and at lake city south carolina following year were assaulted mckinley issued no statement of condemnation although black leaders criticized mckinley for inaction supporters responded by saying there was little president could do to intervene critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events as harrison had done according to historian a before spanish american war negroes in spite of some mistakes regarded mckinley as best friend they ever had under pressure from black leaders mckinley required war department to commission black officers above rank of lieutenant mckinley toured south in late 1898 promoting sectional reconciliation he visited tuskegee institute and black educator booker t washington he also visited confederate memorials in his tour of south mckinley did not mention racial tensions or violence

victory in 1900 winning easy re election over bryan republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around country in 1899 and mckinley was optimistic about his chances at re election in 1900 mckinley s popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second only question about republican ticket concerned vice presidential nomination mckinley needed a new running mate as hobart had died in late 1899 mckinley initially favored elihu root who had succeeded alger as secretary of war but mckinley decided that root was doing too good a job at war department to move him he considered other prominent candidates including allison and cornelius n bliss but none were as popular as republican party s rising star theodore roosevelt after a stint as assistant secretary of navy roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment they fought bravely in cuba and roosevelt returned home covered in glory elected governor of new york on a reform platform in 1898 roosevelt had his eye on presidency many supporters recommended him to mckinley for second spot on ticket and roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to presidency in 1904 mckinley remained uncommitted in public but hanna was firmly opposed to new york governor ohio senator considered new yorker overly impulsive his stance was undermined by efforts of political boss and new york senator thomas c platt who disliking roosevelt s reform agenda sought to sideline governor by making him vice president when republican convention began in philadelphia that june no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support but roosevelt had broadest range of support from around country mckinley affirmed that choice belonged to convention not to him on june 21 mckinley was unanimously renominated and with hanna s reluctant acquiescence roosevelt was nominated for vice president on first ballot democratic convention convened next month in kansas city and nominated william jennings bryan setting up a rematch of 1896 contest candidates were same but issues of campaign had shifted free silver was still a question that animated many voters but republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party democrats knew war had been popular even if imperialism issue was less sure so they focused on issue of trusts and corporate power painting mckinley as servant of capital and big business as in 1896 bryan embarked on a speaking tour around country while mckinley stayed at home this time making only one speech to accept his nomination roosevelt emerged as campaign s primary speaker and hanna helped cause working to settle a coal miners strike in pennsylvania bryan s campaigning failed to excite voters as it had in 1896 and mckinley never doubted that he would be re elected on november 6 1900 he was proven correct winning largest victory for any republican since 1872 bryan carried only four states outside solid south and mckinley even won bryan s home state of nebraska second term soon after his second inauguration on march 4 1901 william and ida mckinley undertook a six week tour of nation traveling

additional security for trip on september 5 president delivered his address at fairgrounds before a crowd of some 50 000 people in his final speech mckinley urged reciprocity treaties with other

believed would advance cause after his failure to get close enough on fifth czolgosz waited next day at temple of music on exposition grounds where president was to meet public czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief and when he reached head of line shot mckinley twice in abdomen mckinley urged his aides to break news gently to ida and to call off mob that had set on czolgosz a request that may have saved his assassin s life mckinley was taken to exposition aid station where doctor was unable to locate second bullet although a primitive x ray machine was being exhibited on exposition

waited hours in rain in canton an equal number did same at stark county courthouse on september 18 following day a funeral service was held at first methodist church casket was then sealed and taken to mckinley house where relatives paid their final respects it was then transported to receiving vault at west lawn cemetery in canton to await construction of memorial to mckinley already being

a monument at his birthplace in niles 20 ohio schools bear his name there are several schools in united states named mckinley school nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for construction of mckinley memorials in year after his death phillips suggests significant number of major memorials to mckinley in ohio reflected expectation among ohioans in

jimmy carter legacy and historical image thumb upright official presidential portrait of william mckinley by harriet anderson stubbs murphy mckinley s biographer h wayne morgan remarks that mckinley died most beloved president in history however young enthusiastic roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor s death new president made little effort to secure trade reciprocity mckinley had intended to negotiate with other nations controversy and public interest surrounded roosevelt throughout seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of mckinley faded by 1920 according to gould mckinley s administration was deemed no more than a mediocre prelude to vigor and energy of theodore roosevelt s beginning in 1950s mckinley received more favorable evaluations nevertheless in surveys ranking american presidents he has generally been placed near middle often trailing contemporaries such as hayes and cleveland morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during mckinley s presidency profoundly affected nation s future he more followed public opinion than led it and that mckinley s standing has suffered from altered public expectations of presidency there has been broad agreement among historians that mckinley s election was at time of a transition between two political eras dubbed third and fourth party systems kenneth f warren emphasizes national commitment to a pro business industrial and modernizing program represented by mckinley historian daniel p argued that mckinley s personal control of 1896 campaign gave him opportunity to reshape presidency rather than simply follow party platform by representing himself as voice of people republican karl rove exalted mckinley as model for a sweeping political realignment behind george w bush in 2000s a realignment that did not happen some political scientists such as david mayhew questioned whether 1896 election truly represented a realignment thereby placing in issue whether mckinley deserves credit for it historian michael j argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see mckinley as key figure in transition from congressional domination of government to modern powerful president this change was an incremental process through late 19th and early 20th centuries phillips writes that mckinley s low rating is undeserved and that he should be ranked just after great presidents such as washington and lincoln he pointed to mckinley s success at building an electoral coalition that kept republicans mostly in power for a generation phillips believes that part of mckinley s legacy is men he included in his administration who dominated republican party for a quarter century after his death these officials included cortelyou who served in three cabinet positions under roosevelt and dawes who became vice president under coolidge other mckinley appointees who later became major figures include day whom roosevelt elevated to supreme court where he remained nearly twenty years and william howard taft whom mckinley had made governor general of philippines and who succeeded roosevelt as president after assassination present united states secret service came into existence when congress deemed it necessary that presidential protection be part of its duties united states secret service a controversial aspect of mckinley s presidency is territorial expansion and question of imperialism with exception of philippines granted independence in 1946 united states retains territories taken under mckinley territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as beginning of american empire morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of debate over rise of america as a world power he expects debate over mckinley s actions to continue indefinitely without resolution and notes that however one judges mckinley s actions in american expansion one of his motivations was to change lives of filipinos and cubans for better morgan alludes to rise of interest in mckinley as part of debate over more assertive american foreign policy of recent decades see
