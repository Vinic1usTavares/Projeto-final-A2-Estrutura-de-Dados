2002 03 south west indian ocean cyclone season was one of longest lasting and third most active season in south west indian ocean storms during season impacted mascarene islands seychelles madagascar and countries in southeastern africa season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck seychelles in september becoming most damaging storm there in 50 years next system atang was first named storm of season but was only a tropical depression it was named due to threat to an outer island of mauritius atang later struck tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in november resulting in unconfirmed deaths of fishermen first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was boura which brushed mascarene islands with gusty winds and rainfall in december cyclone crystal threatened to strike mauritius but instead veered eastward and later tropical storm delfina lasted from late december through early january 2003 delfina damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in mozambique and malawi killing 54 people in january 2003 severe tropical storm ebula continued steady activity forming in eastern portion of basin later tropical storm fari crossed southern madagascar with heavy rains causing flooding and mudslides that left 3 400 people homeless in february there were four simultaneous tropical cyclones in indian ocean three of which in basin cyclone gerry formed first and farthest west passing just east of mauritius and killing one person there cyclone hape formed shortly thereafter and tropical storm isha formed farther east having originated from australian basin cyclone japhet struck southern mozambique and produced widespread flooding in southeastern africa killing 25 people in march cyclone kalunde was strongest storm of season reaching 10 minute sustained winds of 215 km h 135 mph it struck rodrigues while weakening damaging 1 600 houses and causing an island wide power outage about a month later a subtropical cyclone named luma intensified southeast of madagascar and developed an eye lastly cyclone manou was only sixth may tropical cyclones on record making a rare landfall in southeastern madagascar killing 89 people and destroying thousands of houses season summary right thumb four tropical storms active on february 12 from left to right are gerry hape system that would become isha and fiona in australian region meteo france s meteorological office in reunion mfr is official regional specialized meteorological center for south west indian ocean tracking all tropical cyclones from east coast of africa to 90deg e at beginning of season mfr moved tropical cyclone year from august 1 to july 1 joint typhoon warning center jtwc which is a joint united states navy united states air force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for region also issued advisories for storms during season during season mfr issued advisories on 16 systems of which 13 intensified to reach tropical storm force winds meaning conditions were generally favorable for tropical cyclogenesis 13 systems with tropical storm force winds is only one short of most such storms since beginning of satellite tracking in 1967 68 season set in 1993 94 season this is four more than average of nine named storms in this season there were 24 days on which tropical cyclones were active slightly above normal but only one storm kalunde remained at that intensity for more than three days by contrast there were 68 days in which a tropical storm was active in basin which is 15 days above normal season began early and ended late only four seasons began earlier and four ended later than this season since start of satellite coverage in basin in addition to named storms and an unnamed tropical storm in september there was one non developing tropical depression on december 25 tropical depression 05 developed in northeastern portion of basin it moved to south and later southeast crossing into australian region on december 27 a day later jtwc issued its last advisory systems moderate tropical storm 01 in late august a weak low level circulation persisted near diego garcia it was associated with a trough near equator and initially remained disorganized due to high wind shear disturbance was located at a low latitude near equator and a ridge extending from eastern coast of africa imparted a general west southwest movement system was organized enough to be classified by mfr on september 4 at 2 5deg s subsequently system developed more convection as its circulation became better defined operationally mfr began issuing warnings on september 5 on tropical disturbance 01 and next day upgraded it to a tropical depression post analysis from mfr indicated that system reached peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph on september 6 same day that joint typhoon warning center jtwc initiated advisories on it as tropical cyclone 01s storm developed banding features but thunderstorms were sheared away from circulation on september 7 storm moved through seychelles an island nation in southern indian ocean before weakening mfr discontinued advisories on september 8 and jtwc followed suit next day while moving through seychelles storm produced a microburst that lasted for two hours across several islands producing wind gusts up to on praslin heavy rainfall affected praslin la and particularly mahe which reported in a 24 hour period damage on mahe was limited to landslides and some flooding on praslin high winds damaged roofs of over 50 houses and destroyed six homes while airport was also damaged winds damaged 50 power lines causing an island wide power outage high winds also downed about 30 000 trees which blocked roads but were quickly removed due to widespread tree damage cousin island a nature preserve was closed for about two weeks accounting for about 50 000 2002 usd 000 rupees in damage nationwide storm left 375 families homeless and damaged crop fields becoming most damaging in country in 50 years tropical depression atang convection persisted near a broad circulation on november 3 to west of diego garcia system moved westward and organized due to generally favorable conditions mfr classified it as tropical disturbance 02 on november 4 two days later agency upgraded it to tropical depression 2 and shortly thereafter jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 02s at that time storm was moving to southwest toward mauritius outer island of agalega developing improved outflow to emphasize threat meteorological service of mauritius named system atang despite it only being a tropical depression late on november 6 jtwc estimated peak winds of 85 km h 50 mph around same time that atang began a slow motion to southwest next day depression resumed a westward motion and became disorganized with several circulations and jtwc and mfr both discontinued advisories remnants of atang again turned to southwest and re intensified prompting jtwc and mfr to re issue advisories on november 9 by that time outflow improved although it maintained multiple circulations atang passed near north coast of madagascar on november 10 after turning to west and that day jtwc again discontinued advisories after another period of re organization agency again re issued advisories on atang on november 11 over mozambique channel next day system moved inland in southeastern tanzania and dissipated shortly thereafter in northern mozambique atang produced moderate but beneficial rainfall in cabo delgado province accessed via lexis nexis on 2013 04 28 landfall area does not usually experience tropical cyclones and damage in mozambique was minimal in tanzania there were unofficial reports that atang killed several fishermen and caused heavy rainfall with wind gusts to 148 km h 92 mph tropical cyclone boura a strong area of winds near equator developed an area of convection on november 14 to east northeast of diego garcia it quickly developed outflow and a distinct circulation becoming a tropical depression late on november 14 early on november 15 mfr upgraded system to tropical storm boura and later that day jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 03s with a ridge to southeast storm moved quickly southwestward easterly wind shear prevented significant intensification until circulation became established beneath convection on november 17 boura intensified to reach 10 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph making it a tropical cyclone jtwc upgraded boura to same intensity that day but in 1 minute winds or equivalent of a minimal hurricane cyclone intensified slightly further to peak winds of 130 km h 80 mph boura maintained its peak winds for about 18 hours during which wind shear began to increase cyclone weakened as it curved more to west a change due to a ridge to south jtwc estimated that boura maintained peak winds of 140 km h 85 mph initially storm retained good outflow and convection and boura passed just north of st brandon on november 19 producing of rainfall and wind gusts of 106 km h 66 mph while storm turned to west and northwest it interacted with ridge to south to produce wind gusts of 118 km h 74 mph and 111 km h 69 mph on mauritius and reunion respectively convection gradually diminished and on november 22 boura weakened to tropical depression status while jtwc discontinued advisories circulation continued to northwest devoid of convection after turning to northeast on november 25 boura dissipated a day later north of madagascar tropical cyclone crystal for several days in mid december tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a storm to form to southwest of diego garcia which was proven true when an area of convection formed in that area becoming a tropical disturbance on december 21 fourth of season on december 23 mfr upgraded disturbance to a tropical depression and later that day to tropical storm crystal storm moved southwestward toward mauritius due to a ridge to southeast strengthening was gradual and jtwc upgraded crystal to equivalent of a minimal hurricane late on december 24 next day an eye developed although dry air initially prevented much further intensification mfr upgraded crystal to tropical cyclone status on december 26 and that day cyclone passed just east of st brandon subsequently crystal intensified quickly after eye became clearer reaching peak winds of 150 km h 90 mph on december 27 around that time storm passed east of mauritius as it turned to south while rounding ridge after maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours crystal weakened gradually undergoing extratropical transition convection diminished over center and crystal weakened to tropical storm status on december 28 next day jtwc and mfr discontinued advisories labeling storm as extratropical remnants continued to southeast dissipating on january 3 after crossing into australian region while passing just east of st brandon crystal produced wind gusts of 91 km h 56 mph storm initially threatened to strike mauritius but effects were minimal due to island being on dry southwest quadrant of storm crystal produced wind gusts of 91 km h 56 mph rainfall reached although minimal precipitation occurred in northern mauritius severe tropical storm delfina in late december a tropical disturbance rapidly formed off northwest coast of madagascar by late on december 30 mfr classified it as a tropical disturbance system quickly intensified while moving westward becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern mozambique on december 31 delfina weakened while moving inland and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by january 1 however its remnants moved across country and into malawi later looping around and crossing back over mozambique when remnants reached mozambique channel they were reclassified as tropical disturbance 07 which moved southward over waters it re intensified into a tropical storm on january 8 before weakening next day becoming extratropical remnants persisted for several days dissipating on january 14 in both mozambique and malawi delfina dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding in former country over 18 000 houses were severely damaged or destroyed leaving thousands homeless storm damaged roads and bridges which disrupted relief efforts in aftermath and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in midst of an ongoing food shortage lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in mozambique and 47 people were killed by delfina in malawi flooding was not widespread although storm destroyed about 3 600 houses delfina killed eight people in country only two months after storm struck however cyclone japhet left damage and deaths in many of same areas that delfina affected severe tropical storm ebula an area of convection persisted on january 6 to southwest of diego garcia with an associated circulation it moved generally southward southwest within an area of generally favorable conditions becoming tropical disturbance 08 on january 7 thunderstorms increased and jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone early on january 8 next day mfr upgraded it to tropical storm ebula outflow became more pronounced and storm continued to intensify on january 10 jtwc upgraded ebula to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and estimated peak winds of 115 km h 75 mph just shy of tropical cyclone status subsequently increased wind shear imparted weakening after having spent much of its duration moving generally southward ebula turned to southeast on january 11 due to a ridge to south moving farther east thunderstorms diminished and jtwc discontinued advisories on january 12 that day mfr declared that ebula became extratropical and remnants dissipated on january 15 severe tropical storm fari an area of convection persisted on january 20 to east southeast of diego garcia quickly developing outflow due to minimal wind shear it moved to southwest and its circulation became better defined on january 23 mfr initiated advisories on tropical disturbance 09 and later that day jtwc issued a tcfa subsequently mfr upgraded disturbance to a tropical depression and jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 11s shortly thereafter system weakened and circulation became exposed from deep convection jtwc discontinued advisories on january 24 but mfr continued tracking disturbance as it moved to west after reaching an area of low wind shear thunderstorms again increased over center and jtwc re issued advisories on january 28 by that time system was nearing eastern madagascar and later that day mfr upgraded system to tropical storm fari early on january 29 mfr estimated peak winds of 95 km h 60 mph making fari a moderate tropical storm shortly thereafter storm made landfall on madagascar just south of mahanoro fari quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing country emerging into mozambique channel early on january 30 after storm turned to south mfr and jtwc declared fari extratropical on january 31 and remnants dissipated on february 2 tropical storm fari struck madagascar after country had experienced weeks of heavy rainfall causing widespread flooding in area where it moved ashore storm flooded crop fields that damaged most of banana and fruit trees storm left landslides that isolated marolambo and caused damage in other towns fari left 3 400 people homeless and caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis and diarrhea intense tropical cyclone gerry on february 5 mfr began tracking a tropical disturbance to east of madagascar s northern coast system moved to southwest before turning to north on february 7 by that day system had persistent convection around a weak circulation located in an area of low wind shear on february 8 jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 16s although initially circulation was broad and exposed from thunderstorms next day mfr upgraded depression to tropical storm status and meteorological services of mauritius named system gerry storm turned to south toward mauritius and steadily intensified on february 12 jtwc upgraded gerry to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and shortly thereafter mfr upgraded storm to a tropical cyclone around that time gerry began undergoing rapid deepening becoming an intense tropical cyclone early on february 13 while developing a well defined eye and outflow that day cyclone passed about 120 km 75 mi east of mauritius at that time jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 195 km h 120 mph and mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph subsequently gerry began weakening due to increasing wind shear with eye becoming disorganized later convection separated from deepest convection and cyclone weakened to tropical storm status on february 14 next day jtwc discontinued advisories and on february 16 mfr declared jerry extratropical remnants dissipated two days later early in its duration gerry passed just west of tromelin island producing tropical storm force winds and gusts to 111 km h 69 mph cyclone originally threatened to strike mauritius directly but due to a more east southeasterly motion gerry passed more to east storm forced closure of sir international airport along with schools and government offices accessed via lexis nexis on 2013 05 03 wind gusts on mauritius reached 144 km h 90 mph gerry dropped heavy rainfall peaking at at mare aux and it produced high waves along northern coast one person was killed who was electrocuted during storm s passage tropical cyclone hape around same time that tropical storm gerry was developing another area of convection to its east was organizing on february 7 system became a tropical disturbance and initially moved to north operationally mfr first began issuing advisories on february 9 for tropical disturbance 11 when system had a small center and accompanying convection by that time disturbance had turned to south and favorable conditions allowed for gradual development mfr upgraded system to tropical storm status late on february 9 although system was not named hape until 36 hours later on february 10 jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 17s an eye developed on february 11 suggesting quick intensification at 1800 utc that day jtwc and mfr upgraded hape to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and to tropical cyclone status respectively by that time cyclone had turned to east northeast due to a weakness in a ridge to north mfr estimated that hape reached peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph on february 12 and next day jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph later storm weakened and it turned to southeast when ridge re intensified outflow decreased due to interaction with cyclone gerry to west and hape weakened to tropical storm status on february 13 on february 15 jtwc discontinued advisories once circulation was exposed from deep convection next day mfr followed suit after circulation dissipated moderate tropical storm isha widespread convection in monsoon trough persisted across southeastern indian ocean in early february one area was tracked by jtwc on february 3 in australian basin southwest of indonesia system moved westward without development crossing into basin on february 8 next day mfr began tracking system as a tropical disturbance on february 11 system turned to southeast due to a ridge to north that day jtwc started issuing advisories on tropical cyclone 18s initially storm failed to intensify much due to a nearby upper level ridge on february 12 mfr upgraded system to a tropical storm and next day system was named isha outflow became more pronounced due to minimal wind shear jtwc briefly estimated peak 1 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph but mfr never estimated winds above 65 km h 40 mph isha weakened late on february 13 due to cooler waters dry air and stronger shear on february 14 jtwc discontinued advisories once there was little convection left and mfr estimated isha dissipated next day intense tropical cyclone japhet cyclone japhet developed on february 25 near southwest coast of madagascar and initially moved to northwest before turning to southwest with favorable conditions for development japhet quickly intensified in mozambique channel reaching maximum winds of 175 km h 110 mph sustained over 10 minutes this made it an intense tropical cyclone only sixth to occur in channel in 24 years after stalling briefly cyclone turned to northwest weakening slightly before striking mozambique just south of on march 2 japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland dissipating over zambia on march 6 along its path japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding rains occurred after an extended drought although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage notably around where storm moved ashore in two provinces in mozambique cyclone damaged or destroyed 25 000 houses leaving at least 23 000 people homeless flooding in zambia caused rivers to rise in mozambique several days after storm s passage there were 17 deaths in mozambique accessed via lexis nexis on 2012 08 22 further inland remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in zimbabwe killing eight people accessed via lexis nexis on 2012 08 22 intense tropical cyclone kalunde kalunde formed on march 3 from an area of convection southeast of diego garcia system slowly intensified while drifting to west becoming a moderate tropical storm on march 5 its intensification rate increased as it began a steady southwest movement kalunde underwent rapid deepening and developed an eye reaching peak intensity on march 8 around that time mfr estimated a minimum pressure of with winds of 215 km h 135 mph and jtwc estimated peak winds of 260 km h 160 mph this made kalunde strongest cyclone of year in basin it weakened after undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and on march 12 kalunde passed near rodrigues island as a weakening cyclone around that time storm turned to south weakening to a tropical storm on march 14 before becoming extratropical next day remnants of kalunde dissipated on march 16 when cyclone passed rodrigues it produced wind gusts estimated up to which caused an island wide power outage many roads were washed out and about 80 percent of drinking water was contaminated during storm s three day passage of island a total of of rain fell a total of 1 600 homes were damaged and total losses across island amounted to 3 15 million 2003 usd eur3 4 million subtropical depression luma a large low level circulation persisted off southwest coast of madagascar on april 6 on april 8 it became a subtropical depression according to mfr and moved to southwest before turning sharply to southeast that day jtwc briefly assessed a fair potential for development circulation became exposed on april 9 but when it began quickly intensifying next day mfr initiated advisories on subtropical depression luma by that time jtwc classified system as extratropical however system developed convection near center and became more of a tropical cyclone on april 11 luma developed an eye in center of thunderstorms prompting mfr to upgrade storm to peak winds of 130 km h 80 mph at that time storm was in an area of weak wind shear although increasing shear caused rapid weakening and for eye to dissipate early on april 12 luma became extratropical as it merged with an approaching cold front tropical cyclone manou late in season in april an area of convection formed southwest of diego garcia it gradually organized and there was a companion system to west that also showed signs of development eastern system was declared tropical disturbance 16 on may 2 and with a ridge to southeast it moved generally to southwest early in its duration system affected st brandon and mauritius with gusty winds on may 4 it intensified into tropical storm manou on may 4 after an initial strengthening phase storm weakened but later re intensified as it approached madagascar manou developed a well defined eye and reached peak winds only 19 km 12 mi from eastern madagascar coastline it reached tropical cyclone status at time only one of six in month since 1968 for about 12 hours cyclone stalled before turning to south and weakening after becoming extratropical on may 10 manou dissipated three days later manou struck madagascar a year after cyclone kesiny hit country in may 2002 representing first known occurrence of may tropical cyclone impacts in consecutive years when manou struck madagascar it produced gusts as strong as 211 km h 131 mph and heavy rainfall reaching in a 15 hour period both at vatomandry damage in country was heaviest there where 85 of buildings were destroyed and 23 people were killed manou destroyed about 24 500 houses nationwide leaving 114 480 people homeless storm destroyed large areas of crops and disrupted transportation including damaging road between vatomandry and brickaville manou injured 85 and killed 89 people throughout madagascar storm names a tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength if a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55dege then sub regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in madagascar assigns appropriate name to storm if a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55dege and 90dege then sub regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in mauritius assigns appropriate name to storm a new annual list is used every year
