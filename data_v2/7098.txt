sergei prokofiev s lieutenant kije kizhe music was originally written to accompany film of same name produced by belgoskino film studios in leningrad in 1933 34 and released in march 1934 it was prokofiev s first attempt at film music and his first commission in early days of sound cinema among various distinguished composers ready to try their hand at film music prokofiev was not an obvious choice for commission based in paris for almost a decade he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance characteristics at odds with cultural norms of soviet union by early 1933 however prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland and saw film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style after film s successful release five movement kije suite was first performed in december 1934 and quickly became part of international concert repertoire it has remained one of composer s best known and most frequently recorded works elements of suite s score have been used in several later films and in two popular songs of cold war era background expatriate composer thumb upright prokofiev in 1921 drawn by henri matisse sergei prokofiev graduated from saint petersburg conservatory in 1914 having by then acquired an early reputation as an avant garde composer his biographer israel nestyev asserts that second piano concerto of 1913 was prokofiev s ticket of admission to highest circles of russian modernism when first world war broke out in august 1914 prokofiev avoided military service possibly because he was only son of a widow during war years he continued to compose in may 1918 in period of upheaval following october revolution and beginning of civil war prokofiev obtained permission from bolshevik government to travel abroad and left for america his biographers have maintained that he did not flee country rather that he embarked on a concert tour which he extended when he became convinced that his career prospects would be better served in america and western europe he remained in america until march 1922 he then stayed briefly in small german town of ettal before moving to paris in october 1923 rather than treating prokofiev as a fugitive or exile moscow government chose to consider him as a general ambassador for soviet culture and composer returned compliment by registering in france as a citizen of soviet union new state formed on 20 december 1922 by russia and states of former russian empire prokofiev expressed support for political developments in what he still considered his homeland and was keen to resume contacts there he was accorded vip status when he paid his first visit to soviet union in 1927 for a recital tour further trips followed and in 1930 prokofiev took a flat in moscow although paris remained his principal home during this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with official soviet concept of art growth of film music in first years of silent film era from 1890s films were generally accompanied by live music often improvised provided by piano or pump organ in early 20th century larger cinemas began to use orchestras which would accompany film with out of copyright classical pieces or increasingly with original compositions score for 1916 classic birth of a nation compiled by joseph carl from various classical works and some original writing was a landmark in film music and inspired notable composers of day to provide scores for silent films among these were americans victor herbert and mortimer wilson from france darius milhaud and arthur honegger and germans gottfried huppertz and edmund meisel in 1927 developments in sound technology brought arrival of talking pictures in these accompanying music was originally recorded on a disc separately from film images but within two years movietone system enabled sound to be captured on film itself music could now be aligned specifically with film s on screen action so called diegetic approach early pioneers of this method were germans friedrich and karol who provided music for blue angel 1930 and murderer dimitri karamazov 1931 respectively by this time in soviet union young dimitri shostakovich had already begun his prolific career as a composer of film sound tracks with new babylon in 1929 and alone in 1931 when planning their proposed film lieutenant kije in 1932 belgoskino studios of leningrad asked expatriate prokofiev to write accompanying music in some respects prokofiev was a surprising choice he was at this stage better known abroad than in soviet union and had acquired a reputation for dissonance moreover his ballet le pas d acier had fared badly at moscow s bolshoi theatre in 1929 composer s first response was to refuse commission a member of production team recalled that prokofiev categorically rejected my proposal his time was scheduled far into future he had never written music for film and he didn t know what kind of sauce to put on it but attracted by story prokofiev quickly changed his mind and accepted seeing this first venture into film music as an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to appeal to a mass soviet audience 1934 film inception lieutenant kije was one of earliest sound films made in soviet union origin of story was a 1927 screenplay by critic and novelist yury tynyanov written for soviet film director sergei this project failed and recast his script into a novella that was published in january 1928 in early 1930s when belgoskino studios announced their interest in making film tynyanov produced a second script story has been described by prokofiev s biographer harlow robinson as a satire on stupidity of royalty and particularly russian terror of displeasing one s superior by his own account prokofiev was at this time restive and afraid of falling into a later critic thought kije story provided ideal material for this so often caustic and witty composer plot thumb upright tsar paul i in russian imperial palace while tsar paul i sleeps a dalliance between two courtiers ends with a shriek which tsar enraged he demands that his officials produce culprit or face banishment for life meanwhile a clerk s slip of pen while compiling a military duty roster results in inclusion in list of a fictitious officer lieutenant kije when tsar inspects list he is intrigued by this name and asks that officer be presented to him court officials are too terrified of tsar to admit that a mistake has been made and are in a dilemma until it occurs to them to blame kije for nocturnal disturbance they inform tsar who duly orders imaginary lieutenant flogged and sent to siberia when real culprit confesses kije is pardoned by tsar and reinstated in imperial court with rank of colonel courtiers in fear of tsar are forced to extend their creation s phantom career thus he supposedly marries princess after which tsar grants him lands and money and promotes him to general and commander of army when paul demands kije s immediate presence cornered officials announce that general kije has unfortunately died a lavish funeral is held with full military honours parsimonious tsar demands return of kije s fortune but is told by courtiers that kije has spent money on high living in fact they have stolen it tsar denounces kije as a thief and posthumously demotes him from general to private music despite his lack of experience in composing film music prokofiev began his kije score confidently later writing i somehow had no doubts whatever about musical language for film he told producers what is important to me is era internal meaning of each event personality of each hero and warned them not to expect mere musical illustrations he attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of action and acting period setting of film appealed to prokofiev robinson comments that kije score is one of several works including classical symphony love of three oranges cinderella and war and peace that show composer s fondness for eighteenth century language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy he interpreted story as more tragic than comic prokofiev had heard ravel s bolero in paris and had been much impressed by french composer s use of saxophone an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside france but which suited prokofiev s intentions perfectly composer gerard mcburney has pointed out haunting sounds of tenor saxophone that punctuate kije music critic ernest chapman refers to prokofiev s unfailingly witty and melodious score it comprises only about 15 minutes of music written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during film s duration to highlight specific moments in drama this approach was a departure in film music from established form of broad symphonic movements and was described by prokofiev s biographer daniel jaffe as well ahead of its time one of most celebrated film scores of that era production and reception history film directed by alexander was made at belgoskino studios where music was recorded under direction of isaak moscow premiere was held on 7 march 1934 after which film was released in london as tsar wants to sleep and in paris as le lieutenant nantes prokofiev did not rate film highly although he was pleased with his music after new york release in december 1934 critic for new york times described film as calculated to entertain lovers of detail and genuine atmosphere in semi historical films even introduction of a little slapstick comedy seems quite in keeping with russian tradition prokofiev s contribution to film is not acknowledged in this review suite composition soon after film s release prokofiev received an invitation from moscow radio symphony orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his kije film music probably first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work guiding light behind invitation was boris gusman assistant director of bolshoi theatre and a leading film critic gusman was a strong supporter of prokofiev s ambition to rehabilitate himself in soviet union and had negotiated with moscow orchestra for a series of concerts that would showcase returned composer s talent prokofiev s task was not straightforward film s 15 minutes of musical material was fragmentary and scored for a small chamber orchestra according to prokofiev s own account producing suite was a devilish job which he said gave me much more trouble than music for film itself since i had to find proper form re orchestrate whole thing polish it up and even combine some of themes he wanted suite to appeal to soviet audiences hearing concert music for first time in an article in izvestia in 1934 he wrote of such music above all it must be melodious moreover melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial simplicity should not be an old fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity he worked quickly and had finished piece by 8 july 1934 because it was published op 60 by his regular music publisher in paris french form of kije rather than russian kizhe was adopted in work s title instrumentation kije suite is scored for baritone voice optional piccolo two flutes two oboes two clarinets two bassoons tenor saxophone four horns cornet two trumpets three trombones tuba bass drum snare drum triangle cymbals tambourine sleigh bells celesta piano harp and strings structure five movements of suite are organised and titled as follows bolded capitals identify specified themes birth of kije a distant mournful fanfare a played on a cornet representing a bugle is followed by a brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo a passage for brass precedes introduction of a theme or leitmotif b associated with phantom kije which after a reprise of march and a c major crescendo is repeated on tenor saxophone an instrument relatively new to orchestra at that time cornet fanfare then returns to close movement romance principal theme c for this movement is based on an old song little grey dove is cooing for which prokofiev provided an optional part for baritone voice song theme is developed using a range of instruments before giving way to a second theme introduced by tenor saxophone this in turn is replaced as movement draws to its close with return of little grey dove tune now ornamented by birdsong kije s wedding movement begins with and is regularly visited by a broad ceremonial and somewhat pompous melody d played on brass and woodwind in between these formal sounding statements are a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and variations on kije theme which together give movement a celebratory feel both boisterous and sentimental troika thumb a troika a traditional russian sled combination principal melody in this movement e is taken from an old hussar song for which prokofiev provided an optional baritone part melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement after which pace sleigh bells rapid pizzicato strings and piano combine to give impression of a fast winter s journey by means of troika a traditional russian three horse sled ride is accompanied at regular intervals by song theme which brings movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase burial of kije this final movement is largely a melange of earlier themes a series of reminiscences of kije s imaginary life opening cornet fanfare returns as does kije s leitmotif together with little grey dove this time intertwined with wedding music in what orrin howard in a programme note for los angeles philharmonic describes as a wistful touching farewell music reaches its conclusion with a distant rendition of fanfare themes a opening fanfare b march c romance little grey dove d wedding e troika performance reception and adaptation history thumb boston opera house where 1942 ballet version was first shown prokofiev conducted first performance of suite in paris on 21 december 1934 piece received its american premiere on 14 october 1937 when serge koussevitsky conducted boston symphony orchestra this performance formed basis of first commercial recording of work issued in following year while prokofiev was in united states for boston premiere he was greatly sought after by film producers but although he was flattered and attracted by their offers he never composed a hollywood film score suite rapidly gained popularity particularly in us choreographer michel fokine used music in his ballet performed at boston opera house on 23 january 1942 a further ballet version was devised for moscow s bolshoi ballet in 1963 by alexander and olga tarasova with struchkova in a leading role music critic david gutman has called suite o ne of prokofiev s most popular compositions today and also one of most accomplished robinson rates kije suite among composer s greatest compositions alongside romeo and juliet and second violin concerto as accessible simple and melodic in his essential canon of classical music 2001 david remarks on how kije music has thrived in popular culture bits and pieces are used everywhere having begun life as a 1930s film soundtrack parts of suite began to appear in later films
