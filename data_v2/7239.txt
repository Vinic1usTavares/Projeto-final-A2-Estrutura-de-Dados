a motte and bailey castle is a fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised area of ground called a motte accompanied by an enclosed courtyard or bailey surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade relatively easy to build with unskilled labour but still militarily formidable these castles were built across northern europe from 10th century onwards spreading from normandy and anjou in france into holy roman empire in 11th century normans introduced design into england and wales following their invasion in 1066 motte and bailey castles were adopted in scotland ireland low countries and denmark in 12th and 13th centuries windsor castle in england is an example of a motte and bailey castle by end of 13th century design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification but earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries thumb 450px a reconstruction of english city of york in 15th century showing motte and bailey fortifications of old baile left

century and abandoned by 1202 this digital elevation model shows motte just left of centre with bailey to right north east of it a motte and bailey castle was made up of two structures a motte a type of mound often artificial topped with a wooden or stone structure known as a keep and at least one bailey a fortified enclosure built next to motte term motte and bailey is a relatively modern one and is not medieval in origin besteman p 212 word motte is french version of latin mota and in france word motte was initially an early word for a turf it then became used to refer to a turf bank and by 12th century was used to refer to castle design itself king 1991 p 38 word bailey comes from norman french baille or basse cour referring to a low yard lepage p 34 in medieval sources latin term castellum was used to describe bailey complex within these castles pounds p 22 one contemporary account of these structures comes from jean de colmieu around 1130 describing calais region in northern france de colmieu described how nobles would build a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible space on top of mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide inside enclosure is a citadel or keep which commands whole circuit of defences entrance to fortress is by means of a bridge which rising from outer side of moat and supported on posts as it ascends reaches to top of mound toy p 53 at durham castle contemporaries described how motte and bailey superstructure arose from tumulus of rising earth with a keep rising into thin air strong within and without with a stalwart house glittering with beauty in every part kenyon p 13 citing armitage 1912 pp 147 8 motte thumb motte and bailey defences of launceston castle in england mottes were made out of earth and flattened on top and it can be very hard to determine whether a mound is artificial or natural without excavation toy p 52 brown 1962 p 24 some were also built over older artificial structures such as bronze age barrows kenyon pp 9 10 size of mottes varied considerably with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height 10 feet to 100 feet and from in diameter toy p 52 this minimum height of for mottes is usually intended to exclude smaller mounds which often had non military purposes besteman p 213 in england and wales only 7 of mottes were taller than high 24 were between and 69 were less than tall kenyon p 4 citing king 1972 pp 101 2 a motte was protected by a ditch around it which would typically have also been a source of earth and soil for constructing mound itself brown 1962 p 29 a keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of motte some walls would be large enough to have a wall walk around them and outer walls of motte and wall walk could be strengthened by filling in gap between wooden walls with earth and stones allowing it to carry more weight this was called a garillum king 1991 p 55 smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building devries p 209 many wooden keeps were designed with or small balconies that projected from upper floors of building allowing defenders to cover base of fortification wall king 1991 pp 53 4 early 12th century chronicler lambert of ardres described wooden keep on top of motte at castle of ardres where first storey was on surface of ground where were cellars and granaries and great boxes tuns casks and other domestic utensils in storey above were dwelling and common living rooms of residents in which were larders rooms of bakers and butlers and great chamber in which lord and his wife slept in upper storey of house were garret rooms in this storey also watchmen and servants appointed to keep house took their sleep brown 1962 p 30 wooden structures on mottes could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege bailey bailey was an enclosed courtyard overlooked by motte and surrounded by a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch devries p 211 bailey was often kidney shaped to fit against a circular motte but could be made in other shapes according to terrain bailey would contain a wide number of buildings including a hall kitchens a chapel barracks stores stables forges or workshops and was centre of castle s economic activity meulemeester p 105 cooper p 18 butler p 13 bailey was linked to motte either by a flying bridge stretching between two or more popularly in england by steps cut into motte pounds p 17 typically ditch of motte and bailey joined forming a figure of eight around castle brown 1962 p 24 wherever possible nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted creating water filled moats artificial lakes and other forms of water defences brown 1989 p 23 in practice there was a wide number of variations to this common design brown 1962 p 26 a castle could have more than one bailey at warkworth castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed or alternatively several baileys could flank motte as at windsor castle devries p 212 some baileys had two mottes such as those at lincoln some mottes could be square instead of round such as at cabal trump instead of single ditches occasionally double ditch defences were built as seen at berkhamsted local geography and intent of builder produced many unique designs liddiard 2005 p 42 construction and maintenance thumb upright building motte of hastings castle in east sussex from bayeux tapestry various methods were used to build mottes where a natural hill could be used scarping could produce a motte without need to create an artificial mound but more commonly much of motte would have to be constructed by hand four methods existed for building a mound and a tower mound could either be built first and a tower placed on top of it tower could alternatively be built on original ground surface and then buried within mound tower could potentially be built on original ground surface and then partially buried within mound buried part forming a cellar beneath or tower could be built first and mound added later king 1991 pp 50 51 regardless of sequencing artificial mottes had to be built by piling up earth this work was undertaken by hand using wooden shovels and hand barrows possibly with picks as well in later periods pounds p 18 larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents because of volumes of earth involved largest mottes in england such as thetford are estimated to have required up to 24 000 man days of work smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1 000 pounds p 19 contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate or that they refer to construction of a smaller design than that later seen on sites concerned brown 2004 p 110 cooper p 15 taking into account estimates of likely available manpower during period historians estimate that larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build kenyon p 7 this contrasted favourably with stone keeps of period which typically took up to ten years to build pounds p 20 very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available as was case after norman invasion of england where local workforce had to be paid such as at clones in ireland built in 1211 using imported labourers costs would rise quickly in this case reaching ps20 mcneill pp 39 40 thumb left a cross section showing layers within motte at clifford s tower in york a marks 20th century concrete underpinnings of motte low walls enclosing base of motte are a 19th century addition type of soil would make a difference to design of motte as clay soils could support a steeper motte whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline where available layers of different sorts of earth such as clay gravel and chalk would be used alternatively to build in strength to design kenyon p 11 layers of turf could also be added to stabilise motte as it was built up or a core of stones placed as heart of structure to provide strength kenyon p 10 similar issues applied to defensive ditches where designers found that wider ditch was dug deeper and steeper sides of scarp could be making it more defensive although militarily a motte was as norman pounds describes it almost indestructible they required frequent maintenance pounds p 21 soil wash was a problem particularly with steeper mounds and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them over time some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding requiring repairs and stabilisation work cooper p 76 butler p 17 although motte and bailey castles are best known castle design they were not always most numerous in any given area van houts p 61 a popular alternative was ringwork castle involving a palisade being built on top of a raised earth rampart protected by a ditch choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain as mottes were typically built on low ground and on deeper clay and alluvial soils pounds p 17 creighton p 47 another factor may have been speed as ringworks were faster to build than mottes creighton p 47 some ringwork castles were later converted into motte and bailey designs by filling in centre of ringwork to produce a flat topped motte pounds p 14 reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear motte and bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious or easier to defend another theory is that like terpen in netherlands or and in lower rhineland raising height of castle was done to create a drier site history emergence of design thumb a bayeux tapestry scene depicting an attack on chateau de dinan in brittany shown with a wooden palisade surmounting motte motte and bailey castle is a particularly northern european phenomenon most numerous in normandy and britain but also seen in denmark germany southern italy and occasionally beyond pringle p 187 toy p 52 european castles first emerged in 9th and 10th centuries after fall of carolingian empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by magyars and norse king 1991 p 34 against this background various explanations have been put forward to explain origins and spread of motte and bailey design across northern europe there is often a tension among academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for rise of this design debord pp 93 4 one suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack angevins it is argued began to build them to protect against viking raids and design spread to deal with attacks along slav and hungarian frontiers nicolle p 33 kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 another argument is that given links between this style of castle and normans who were of viking descent it was in fact originally a viking design transported to normandy and anjou nicholson p 77 kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 motte and bailey castle was certainly effective against assault although as historian andre debord suggests historical and archaeological record of military operation of motte and bailey castles remains relatively limited brown 1962 pp 28 9 debord p 95 an alternative approach focuses on links between this form of castle and what can be termed a feudal mode of society spread of motte and bailey castles was usually closely tied to creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles lepage p 35 collardelle and mazard pp 72 3 yet another theory suggests that design emerged as a result of pressures of space on ringworks and that earliest motte and baileys were converted ringworks king 1991 p 37 finally there may be a link between local geography and building of motte and bailey castles which are usually built on low lying areas in many cases subject to regular flooding devries p 202 regardless of reasons behind initial popularity of motte and bailey design however there is widespread agreement that castles were first widely adopted in normandy and angevin territory in 10th and 11th centuries kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 nicolle p 33 initial development 10th and 11th centuries thumb upright reconstructed keep at saint sylvain d anjou france earliest purely documentary evidence for motte and bailey castles in normandy and angers comes from between 1020 and 1040 but a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence pushes date for first motte and bailey castle at vincy back to 979 castles were built by more powerful lords of anjou in late 10th and 11th centuries in particular fulk iii and his son geoffrey ii who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060 devries pp 203 4 many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards belying power and prestige of their builders hericher p 97 william conqueror as duke of normandy is believed to have adopted motte and bailey design from neighbouring anjou devries p 204 duke william went on to prohibit building of castles without his consent through et with his legal definition of castles centring on classic motte and bailey features of ditching banking and king 1991 p 35 by 11th century castles were built throughout holy roman empire which then spanned central europe they now typically took form of an enclosure on a hilltop or on lower ground a tall free standing tower german bergfried kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 largest castles had well defined inner and outer courts but no mottes purton p 195 motte and bailey design began to spread into alsace and northern alps from france during first half of 11th century spreading further into bohemia and austria in subsequent years purton pp 195 6 collardelle and mazard pp 71 78 jansen p 195 kaufmann and kaufmann p 110 this form of castle was closely associated with colonisation of newly cultivated areas within empire as new lords were granted lands by emperor and built castles close to local grod or town collardelle and mazard pp 71 78 jansen p 195 kaufmann and kaufmann p 110 motte and bailey castle building substantially enhanced prestige of local nobles and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating more prestigious hohenburgen built on high ground but this is usually regarded as unlikely purton p 196 in many cases were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within mounds thumb left reconstructed keep at germany in england william invaded from normandy in 1066 resulting in three phases of castle building in england around 80 of which were in motte and bailey pattern liddiard 2005 p 17 creighton 2005 p 48 first of these was establishment by new king of royal castles in key strategic locations including many towns liddiard 2005 p 18 brown 1962 p 22 these urban castles could make use of existing town s walls and fortification but typically required demolition of local houses to make space for them liddiard 2005 p 19 brown 1962 p 22 this could cause extensive damage records suggest that in lincoln 166 houses were destroyed with 113 in norwich and 27 in cambridge brown 1962 p 22 pounds 1994 p 208 second and third waves of castle building in late 11th century were led by major magnates and then more junior knights on their new estates liddiard 2005 pp 18 23 some regional patterns in castle building can be seen relatively few castles were built in east anglia compared to west of england or marches for example this was probably due to relatively settled and prosperous nature of east of england and reflected a shortage of unfree labour for constructing mottes liddiard 2005 p 25 in wales first wave of norman castles were again predominantly made of wood in a mixture of motte and bailey and ringwork designs pettifer p xiii norman invaders spread up valleys using this form of castle to occupy their new territories king 1991 pp 139 141 after norman conquest of england and wales building of motte and bailey castles in normandy accelerated as well resulting in a broad swath of these castles across norman territories around 741 motte and bailey castles in england and wales alone liddiard 2005 p 23 king 1991 p 47 further expansion 12th and 13th centuries thumb a vliedburg motte in netherlands having become well established in normandy germany and britain motte and bailey castles began to be adopted elsewhere mainly in northern europe during 12th and 13th centuries conflict through low countries encouraged castle building in a number of regions from late 12th century to 14th century besteman p 217 kenyon p 8 in flanders first motte and bailey castles began relatively early at end of 11th century meulemeester p 103 rural motte and bailey castles followed traditional design but urban castles often lacked traditional baileys using parts of town to fulfil this role instead meulemeester p 102 motte and bailey castles in flanders were particularly numerous in south along lower rhine a fiercely contested border besteman p 219 further along coast in friesland relatively decentralised egalitarian society initially discouraged building of motte and bailey castles although terpen raised dwelling mounds which lacked towers and were usually lower in height than a typical motte were created instead besteman p 215 by end of medieval period however terpen gave way to hege wieren non residential defensive towers often on motte like mounds owned by increasingly powerful nobles and landowners on zeeland local lords had a high degree of independence during 12th and 13th centuries owing to wider conflict for power between neighbouring flanders and friesland besteman p 217 zeeland lords had also built terpen mounds but these gave way to larger werven constructions effectively mottes which were later termed bergen king 1991 p 39 besteman p 216 sometimes both terpen and werven are called vliedburg or refuge castles nicholson p 77 during 12th and 13th centuries a number of terpen mounds were turned into werven mottes and some new werven mottes were built from scratch besteman p 216 around 323 known or probable motte and bailey castles of this design are believed to have built within borders of modern netherlands thumb left bass of inverurie in aberdeenshire in scotland a large mid 12th century motte and bailey castle in neighbouring denmark motte and bailey castles appeared somewhat later in 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere due to less feudal society stiesdal pp 210 213 kenyon p 8 except for a handful of mote and bailey castles in norway built in first half of 11th century and including royal residence in oslo design did not play a role further north in scandinavia ekroll p 66 norman expansion into wales slowed in 12th century but remained an ongoing threat to remaining native rulers in response welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles frequently motte and bailey designs usually in wood pettifer p xiv there are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under prince cadwgan ap bleddyn with first documentary evidence of a native welsh castle being at cymmer in 1116 king 1991 p 130 these timber castles including tomen y tomen y faerdre gaer penrhos were of equivalent quality to equivalent norman fortifications in area and it can prove difficult to distinguish builders of some sites from archaeological evidence alone pettifer p xiv motte and bailey castles in scotland emerged as a consequence of centralising of royal authority in 12th century simpson and webster p 225 david i encouraged norman and french nobles to settle in scotland introducing a feudal mode of landholding and use of castles as a way of controlling contested lowlands simpson and webster p 225 tabraham p 11 quasi independent polity of galloway which had resisted rule of david and his predecessors was a particular focus for this colonisation simpson and webster p 231 size of these scottish castles primarily wooden motte and bailey constructions varied considerably from larger designs such as bass of inverurie to smaller castles like balmaclellan tabraham p 16 thumb right motte left and bailey right of clough castle in ireland motte and bailey castles were introduced to ireland following norman invasion of ireland that began between 1166 and 1171 under first richard de clare and then henry ii of england with occupation of southern and eastern ireland by a number of anglo norman barons mcneill p 17 rapid norman success depended on key economic and military advantages their cavalry enabled norman successes in battles and castles enabled them to control newly conquered territories carpenter pp 220 1 new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions most of these were motte and bailey constructions many of them strongly defended carpenter p 221 o conor pp 173 179 unlike wales indigenous irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during period mcneill pp 74 84 between 350 and 450 motte and bailey castles are believed to remain today although identification of these earthwork remains can be contentious o conor p 173 a small number of motte and bailey castles were built outside of northern europe in late 12th century normans invaded southern italy and sicily although they had technology to build more modern designs in many cases wooden motte and bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed purton 180 italians came to refer to a range of different castle types as motta however and there may not have been as many genuine motte and bailey castles in southern italy as was once thought on basis of documentary evidence alone pringle p 187 in addition there is evidence of norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in egypt in 1221 during fifth crusade pringle p 190 conversion and decline 13th 14th centuries thumb stone shell keep and chemise on top of motte at gisors in france motte and bailey castles became a less popular design in mid medieval period in france they were not built after start of 12th century and mottes ceased to be built in most of england after around 1170 although they continued to be erected in wales and along marches pounds p 21 chatelain p 231 many motte and bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly in england many had been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by 12th century pounds pp 20 1 kenyon p 17 meulemeester p 104 in low countries and germany a similar transition occurred in 13th and 14th centuries one factor was introduction of stone into castle building earliest stone castles had emerged in 10th century with stone keeps being built on mottes along catalonia frontier and several including chateau de langeais in angers nicholson p 78 kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons liddiard 2005 p 53 king 1991 p 62 some existing motte and bailey castles were converted to stone with keep and gatehouse usually first parts to be upgraded brown 1962 p 38 shell keeps were built on many mottes circular stone shells running around top of motte sometime protected by a further chemise or low protective wall around base by 14th century a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses

1216 there were around 100 in country hulme p 213 king 1991 p 36 these massive keeps could be either erected on top of settled well established mottes or could have mottes built around them so called buried keeps bradbury p 121 ability of mottes especially newly built mottes to support heavier stone structures was limited and many needed to be built on fresh ground kaufmann and kaufmann p 111 concentric castles relying on several lines of baileys and defensive walls made increasingly little use of keeps or mottes at all king 1991 p 94 across europe motte and bailey construction came to an end at end of 12th century welsh rulers began to build castles in stone primarily in principality of north wales and usually along higher peaks where mottes were unnecessary in flanders decline came in 13th century as feudal society changed in netherlands cheap brick started to be used in castles from 13th century onwards in place of earthworks and many mottes were levelled to help develop surrounding low lying fields these levelled mottes are a particularly dutch phenomenon besteman p 214 kenyon p 8 in denmark motte and baileys gave way in 14th century to a castrum curia model where castle was built with a fortified bailey and a fortified mound somewhat smaller than typical motte stiesdal p 214 by 12th century castles in western germany began to thin in number due to changes in land ownership and various mottes were abandoned collardelle and mazard p 79 in germany and denmark motte and bailey castles also provided model for later or water castle a stronghold and bailey
