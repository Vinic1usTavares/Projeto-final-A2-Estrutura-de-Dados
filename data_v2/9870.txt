george herbert hirst 7 september 1871 10 may 1954 was a professional english cricketer who played first class cricket for yorkshire county cricket club between 1891 and 1921 with a further appearance in 1929 one of best all rounders of his time hirst was a left arm medium fast bowler and right handed batsman hirst played in 24 test matches for england between 1897 and 1909 touring australia twice he completed double of 1 000 runs and 100 wickets in an english cricket season 14 times second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team mate wilfred rhodes one of wisden cricketers of year for 1901 hirst scored 36 356 runs and took 2 742 wickets in first class cricket in tests he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets born in kirkheaton hirst first achieved success for yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little over his first few seasons his batting improved at expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman around 1900 his bowling re emerged when he discovered a method to make ball swing in air after he released it he was one of first bowlers to control swing of ball which batsmen found very difficult to counter making hirst s bowling far more successful from then on from 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles he set records in 1905 when he scored 341 runs in an innings against leicestershire still highest total for yorkshire as of 2015 and in 1906 when he completed an unprecedented and double of 2 000 runs and 200 wickets in many seasons he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness but his bowling remained successful until shortly before first world war hirst played in all england s home test series between 1899 and 1909 but his record for england was less impressive than his record for yorkshire and he may have suffered from playing in australia where match conditions did not suit him hirst returned to play for yorkshire after war but became a cricket coach at eton college in 1920 where he remained until 1938 after making occasional appearances in 1920 and 1921 he retired from regular first class cricket he maintained his connections with yorkshire for rest of his life coached young players and established an excellent reputation for developing players of all social backgrounds a popular player coach and personality with cricketers and spectators hirst died in 1954 aged 82 early life hirst was born on 7 september 1871 in brown cow inn kirkheaton a village close to huddersfield he was last of 10 children born to james hirst and his wife sarah maria woolhouse when his father died in 1880 hirst lived with his sister mary elizabeth woolhouse and her husband john berry in kirkheaton ellam p 76 after leaving school at 10 years of age hirst first worked for a hand loom weaver in a local cottage and then at a dyeing firm thomson p 27 he played rugby football as a full back during winter and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer by age of 15 hirst was playing regularly for kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper thomson p 26 his reputation grew when he was 18 he was a key player in kirkheaton team which won lumb challenge cup of 1889 in final watched by players from yorkshire county cricket club he took five wickets for 23 runs days later invited to take part along with another local player he appeared for yorkshire against cheshire in a non first class match in huddersfield he scored six runs in his only innings and took three wickets in match ellam pp 76 77 hirst played only intermittently for yorkshire over next couple of seasons but continued to develop as a cricketer signing as a professional for elland cricket club for 1890 season before joining mirfield in 1891 ellam p 77 during that season he made his first class debut for yorkshire against somerset in county championship he scored 15 runs and took two wickets in game first class cricketer thumb hirst catching in

season hirst joined huddersfield which played a higher standard of cricket yorkshire also gave him a longer run in first team early in season hirst appeared for yorkshire against marylebone cricket club mcc not considered a good batsman at this stage he batted at number 11 in first innings scored 20 and 43 not out and as a bowler took four wickets for 29 runs four for 29 and two for 58 his bowling performance particularly impressed sydney pardon editor of wisden cricketers almanack yorkshire needing to fill a vacant place in team played hirst 13 times in first class matches in 1892 hodgson p 55 he did not pass 30 runs in an innings again and averaged 16 15 with bat with ball he took 30 wickets at an average of 20 56 with a best performance of six for 16 against sussex wisden later noted that hirst until he tired later in season and was dropped from team bowled up to a certain point with excellent results over next few seasons hirst became a regular member of yorkshire side but although his performances were good enough to keep him in team he had few outstanding successes wisden noted for some time after his first season hirst s career was one of steady progress rather than of brilliant achievement hirst s batting remained undeveloped in 1893 he batted at number 10 and did not pass fifty in any one innings though he managed some useful scores thomson p 28 he averaged only 15 04 with bat but his bowling continued to make a good impression on critics he took 99 wickets at an average of 14 39 placing him third in yorkshire averages for season that year county won official county championship which had begun in 1890 for first time in 1894 hirst scored his maiden first class century against gloucestershire hitting an unbeaten 115 out of a partnership of 176 for ninth wicket although this was his only score over fifty wisden recorded how his batting often helped his team out of difficult situations thomson p 29 in total he hit 564 runs at an average of 16 58 with ball his record was similar to previous season he took 98 wickets at an average of 15 98 and his best figures came in a match against lancashire a feat appreciated by yorkshire supporters as fixture was always highly competitive thomson p 30 then in 1895 season hirst passed 100 wickets in season for first time securing 150 wickets at an average of 17 06 he established himself as an opening bowler for yorkshire assuming role from ted wainwright and developing a good partnership with bobby peel thomson p 22 against leicestershire he took a hat trick although primarily regarded as a bowler and while wisden later described his batting as being in temporary decline in 1895 hirst also scored 710 runs at an average of 19 18 with three fifties leading all rounder in 1896 yorkshire won their second county championship hirst hit a century against leicestershire and nine other scores over fifty this improvement in his batting took him past 1 000 runs for first time and his average of 28 05 was substantially higher than he had achieved previously with ball he took 104 wickets at more expensive average of 21 61 to complete double of 1 000 runs and 100 wickets for first time however some critics in yorkshire were unhappy that his batting had improved believing that extra effort involved would diminish his effectiveness as a bowler they considered a powerful bowling attack to be vital to team s success more so than a strong batting line up and expressed opinion that hirst should concentrate on one discipline rather than dividing his energy over next few seasons these fears were proven to some extent wisden noting in 1901 that he was a less effective bowler than previously in 1897 hirst completed double again he scored 1 535 runs at an average of 35 69 with a century and 11 fifties and took 101 wickets at an average of 23 22 these performances were good enough to earn him selection for players against gentlemen in prestigious matches at oval and lord s in both of which he scored half centuries for winter of 1897 98 hirst was selected as part of andrew stoddart s team to tour australia thomson p 33 team was outplayed and lost test matches 4 1 hampered by poor form of bowlers and ill health among team not least from stoddart himself who missed several matches following death of his mother hirst suffering from a strained leg for some of tour was ineffective as a bowler hard australian pitches favoured batsmen and did not suit hirst s style of bowling ellam p 78 in all first class matches on tour he took only nine wickets at very expensive average of 75 77 his batting was inconsistent and he scored 338 runs at an average of 21 12 his best scores came in minor matches nevertheless he was selected for england in four of five test matches his debut came in first match england s only victory when he scored 62 batting at number six in batting order despite bowling 41 overs in game he failed to take a wicket his maiden test match wicket came in following test but he took only two wickets in series in third test hirst scored 85 which remained highest test score of his career but in this series he reached double figures only once more when series ended hirst had scored 207 runs at an average of 29 57 hirst s poor form continued when he returned to england for 1898 season fatigue from continuous cricket and ongoing problems with his leg added to his difficulties and he had a poor season thomson p 34 his only score over fifty was an innings of 130 against surrey and he scored 567 runs at an average of 17 71 statistically he had one of his worst bowling seasons taking 36 wickets at 25 61 and never taking more than four wickets in an innings for yorkshire hirst s loss of form was offset by debut of wilfred rhodes also from kirkheaton who took 154 wickets in his first season in 1899 hirst showed a big improvement in his batting form scoring 1 630 runs his best tally to date at an average of 35 43 he increased his number of wickets to 82 at 24 75 and his form was good enough to earn selection for his first home test match against australia however it was only injuries to three other candidates that secured his place as a fast bowler and he was not selected in rest of series wisden noted it cannot be said that experiment was in any way a success hirst worked hard for his side his fielding indeed being perfection but as a bowler he did not cause australians any trouble when he played tourists in their game against yorkshire soon after test hirst took 13 wickets later in season he played for players against gentlemen though without any great success discovery of swerve hirst s batting continued to be more successful than his bowling to point where commentators regarded him as primarily a batsman who bowled occasionally ellam p 80 in 1900 he scored 1 960 runs at an average of 40 83 his best batting record to date but his total of wickets fell to 62 at an average of 26 90 his worst average until 1914 his only representative cricket came in end of season festival matches including a gentlemen v players match yorkshire won county championship first of three consecutive victories in which hirst played a leading role thomson p 36 after his achievements in season hirst was selected as one of wisden s cricketers of year citation described him as a confident batsman who could be relied upon in difficult batting conditions or when his team were under pressure but noted how his bowling had suffered as he improved as a batsman however around this time hirst began to develop his use of swing bowling known at time as swerve bowling previously ball occasionally swung through air without his deliberate intention after he released it but he now discovered a method to control swerve in certain atmospheric conditions thomson p 37 he never discussed how he achieved effect limiting his comments to sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t in 1901 season hirst s improvement in bowling brought him highest total of wickets in his career to date in a summer of sunny weather which brought a succession of good batting pitches thomson p 109 he took 183 wickets first time since 1897 he had passed 100 wickets at an average of 16 38 this placed him second in national averages behind rhodes he recorded a series of impressive bowling performances winning extravagant praise from wisden he took five wickets in an innings on 15 occasions and 10 wickets in a match five times including once against traditional rivals lancashire thomson pp 37 38 his batting continued to be successful and he completed his second double with 1 950 runs at 42 39 including his first double century 214 against worcestershire he was selected for gentlemen and players match at lord s and appeared in equivalent fixture in an end of season festival match test match regular success against australia left thumb upright alt three men in dark suits two sitting on chairs and third stood behind from left to right yorkshire team mates schofield haigh hirst and wilfred rhodes at marsden 1905 although both were invited neither hirst nor rhodes toured australia in winter of 1901 02 with archie maclaren s team as yorkshire committee wanted both players to be well rested before new season hirst was statistically less successful in 1902 but he nevertheless returned to test team summer was very wet resulting in many rain affected pitches known as sticky wickets which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult thomson p 111 hirst scored 1 413 runs in season at an average of 31 11 with two centuries he took fewer wickets than previous year partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers rhodes and schofield haigh who topped national first class bowling averages for season thomson p 39 in total hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20 33 during summer of 1902 australia toured england playing five test matches hirst made an impact on series around time of first test tourists endured a dispiriting spell of poor form and illness in first test england scored 376 for nine wickets hirst scored 48 and wisden described his partnership with johnny tyldesley of 94 in 80 minutes as turning point of innings in reply hirst and rhodes bowled out australia for 36 in conditions that umpires considered reasonable to bat in wisden described two yorkshiremen as bowling very well hirst had figures of three for 15 and rhodes returned seven for 17 however c b fry who played for england in match believed hirst to be more difficult to play and that while rhodes bowled well australian batsmen got themselves out as they hurried to other end and tried to hit rhodes without success well as rhodes bowled it was hirst who was responsible for debacle this is best instance i know of bowler at other end getting wickets for his colleague england side for this match was later described by some critics as greatest england team in history thomson p 40 rain prevented match from being completed and saved australia from almost certain defeat australian team s next game was against yorkshire hirst took four for 35 in tourist s first innings but in a low scoring game yorkshire were behind after first innings after australia had reached 20 for three wickets in their second innings hirst bowled victor trumper with what hirst believed was best delivery of his life and tourists last wickets fell quickly team were bowled out for 23 of which hirst took five wickets for nine runs as he made ball swing yorkshire lost five wickets in scoring 48 runs they required to win thomson pp 41 42 second test was badly affected by weather and hirst did not bat or bowl and in third test in sheffield lost by england he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets although he failed at sheffield hirst was leading all rounder in england and thus unlikely to be left out of team however england captain archie maclaren was engaged in a dispute with team selectors over composition of his side he was given only 12 players to choose from for fourth test fred tate was one of twelve and selectors probably included him as they believed maclaren could not possibly choose him in final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field side they wanted maclaren responded by dropping hirst to play tate out of anger towards selectors pitch was soft which would have favoured bowling of tate but wisden reported that while this offered some justification for dropping hirst it meant playing a bowler pure and simple in preference to a first rate all round man and result proved anything but happy tate bowled just 16 overs in game dropped a vital catch and was last man out as australia won match by three runs giving them an unassailable lead in series later writers claimed that tate s performance was responsible for losing match hirst was recalled for final test and played a vital role wisden said that he bowled as well as he had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse although australia recovered he had figures of five for 77 with len braund hirst then helped england to avoid follow on scoring 43 and according to wisden hitting with utmost freedom hirst took a further wicket as australia were dismissed for 121 england needing 263 to win were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from gilbert jessop gave england a chance hirst scored 58 not out making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in later stages of innings as wickets were lost ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when rhodes joined hirst it has been claimed that hirst said to rhodes we ll get em in singles but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all runs came in singles two yorkshiremen held their nerve to take england to a one wicket victory wisden described hirst as playing a great game noted coolness of his play under pressure and said that hirst s innings was in its way almost as remarkable as jessop s in four tests hirst scored 157 runs at an average of 39 25 and took nine wickets at an average of 23 11 apart from his test appearances hirst also played twice for players against gentlemen and played for same side against australians second tour of australia alt caricature of a cricketer with his hands in his pockets pelham warner captain of first mcc tour of australia thumb upright early in 1903 season hirst suffered a leg injury this coupled with other players absences was partly responsible for a poor start to season by yorkshire and although team recovered it could only achieve third place in county championship when hirst returned his bowling speed was reduced but during season he rediscovered his swing bowling thomson p 45 in completing first of 10 consecutive doubles he took 128 wickets at an average of 14 94 and scored 1 844 runs at an average of 47 28 for yorkshire he topped both batting and bowling averages and had third highest batting average in country thomson p 46 hirst played in two end of season games for players against gentlemen his 124 not out in second match was his only century in players versus gentlemen series in 1903 pelham warner who played for middlesex was chosen to captain first tour of australia to be sponsored by mcc in winter of 1903 04 according to warner hirst and rhodes were first two players to be selected as two best bowlers of present day in this country warner p 7 before tour critics claimed hirst would be unsuccessful citing his failure during his previous tour however warner later wrote hirst to say nothing of his batting bowled excellently throughout tour and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest he further described him as best all rounder in england and noted that tighter match better he plays warner pp 11 12 wisden was less convinced and report on tour said that as a bowler hirst though by no means failure he had been with mr stoddart s team six years before fell far below his english form while commenting on his batting record wisden report noted australian wickets i e pitches in fine weather are rather too fast to suit pulling and hook strokes of which he is such a master in england as he could not make ball swing in australia in same way it did in england warner p 55 hirst used leg theory bowling at leg stump with fielders close by on leg side frith p 20 in his second match of tour hirst scored 92 and used his pull shot more effectively than on other occasions warner p 65 he followed this with 66 in third match but did not take many wickets before first test warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in hot conditions his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells warner p 79 hirst played in all five test matches first two of which were won by england in first game hirst took two wickets in his first innings he scored a duck and was dropped by frank laver before he had scored in second he survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with tom hayward guided england to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194 warner p 132 hirst scored 11 runs in second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch badly affected by rain although this performance was not statistically impressive warner thought he bowled very well warner p 160 during third test hirst took three wickets and with innings of 58 and 44 was one of few successful england batsmen in a poor performance which enabled australia to win match warner p 198 england won crucial fourth match to ensure series victory hirst took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18 australia achieved a win in final match in which hirst scored 0 and 1 but after taking no wickets in first innings he achieved his best test figures of tour in second with five for 48 in test series hirst scored 217 runs at an average of 24 11 and took 15 wickets at an average of 30 06 he scored 569 runs at 33 47 and took 36 wickets at 24 50 over all first class games on tour his best bowling performance was five for 37 against tasmania warner described hirst as a very consistent batsman throughout tour warner p 197 and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in australian conditions than at home he was often unlucky warner p 253 dominant in county cricket thumb upright a caricature of hirst by leslie ward spy published in january 1903 caption reads yorkshire alt caricature of a cricketer holding a ball affected by injury after returning to england hirst completed another double in 1904 although a leg injury reduced pace and effectiveness of his bowling for much of season he scored 2 501 runs at an average of 54 36 highest aggregate and average of his career and took 132 wickets at 21 09 he became first yorkshire player to achieve double of 2 000 runs and 100 wickets a feat previously achieved only by gloucestershire trio of w g grace charlie townsend and gilbert jessop thomson p 50 most of his eight centuries were either against strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for team thomson p 51 in august hirst had a benefit match against lancashire from which he received ps3 703 worth around ps as of a very high sum for a benefit at time and his popularity was reflected in attendance over three days of 78 792 spectators hodgson p 56 yorkshire finished second to lancashire in county championship in 1904 but regained title in 1905 hirst s leg strain continued to cause him pain throughout season and again hampered his bowling thomson p 52 even so he took 110 wickets at 19 94 and passed 2 000 runs for second time scoring 2 226 runs at an average of 53 95 early in season hirst scored 341 against leicestershire highest score of his career and as of 2015 record individual innings by a yorkshire batsman on a good pitch for batting he began his innings when yorkshire had scored 22 for three wickets in reply to leicestershire s score of 419 batted just under seven hours and hit 53 fours and a six later that season he scored another double century hitting 232 not out against surrey only two other players reached double figures in yorkshire innings in same game hirst took five wickets for 43 runs thomson pp 52 53 hirst s leg injury kept him out of england side for first two test matches against australia although he would have been a certain selection had he been fit he was chosen in squad for second match but was left out on fitness grounds however hirst was not particularly successful in three tests he played that season hitting a highest score of 40 not out as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings in series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35 00 and took 6 wickets at 35 33 england won series 2 0 mainly due to all round efforts of hirst s yorkshire teammate stanley jackson who headed batting and bowling averages for series record breaking season and tests against south africa in 1906 hirst completed an unprecedented double of 2 000 runs and 200 wickets cricket writer a a thomson noted that both milestones were unusual individually and that such all round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of w g grace in 1870s thomson p 54 no other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double ellam p 82 hirst reached 1 000 run 100 wicket double by end of june two weeks faster than anyone else in history of first class cricket in total he scored 2 385 first class runs at an average of 45 86 and took 208 wickets at 16 50 hirst s contributions were particularly important in a close race for county championship kent were eventual champions after yorkshire lost a close game to gloucestershire but hirst performed well in two matches against kent he scored a century and took 11 wickets as yorkshire won first and took eight wickets and scored a match saving 93 in drawn second encounter against other title contenders lancashire and surrey he was likewise successful with both bat and ball earning praise from times and wisden for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches his captain lord hawke said it was not only what georgie hirst did but how he did it coming off i e succeeding when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against more formidable sides he scored six centuries two of which came in a record equalling performance against somerset he scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with ball he became only second man after bernard bosanquet to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in same first class match as of 2015 only one other man franklyn stephenson in 1988 has achieved feat battling a knee injury and exhaustion towards end of season it became increasingly difficult for hirst to perform hirst took his 200th wicket at end of august and commented that were his feat to be duplicated in future whoever does will be very tired thomson p 55 he also commented that his injuries only troubled him once season was over and it was a triumph of spirit over matter weather was poor during 1907 season resulting in a succession of pitches which suited spin bowling and were difficult to bat on in these circumstances hirst scored fewer runs than in previous season he did not score a century making 1 321 runs at 28 71 and prevalent type of pitches did not suit his bowling pace so that he took fewer wickets thomson p 58 even so he was second highest wicket taker in season and came fifth in bowling averages with 183 wickets at 15 29 hirst remained a first choice member of test team playing all three matches against south africa that summer in a series which england won 1 0 with other two games drawn although unsuccessful with bat achieving 46 runs in five innings with a top score of 17 in a low scoring second test hirst was one of few batsmen to

another double scoring 1 598 runs at 38 97 and taking 174 wickets at 14 05 but was not selected for any other representative games until end of season however he declined an invitation to tour australia with mcc team in 1907 08 final tests in 1909 season hirst was less successful possibly affected by his heavy workload with bat and ball in previous seasons his batting disappointed critics he scored 1 256 runs at 27 30 his lowest batting average since 1898 thomson pp 61 62 with ball he took 115 wickets at 20 05 his best performances came in more important matches such as those against lancashire and surrey he was selected for players against gentlemen taking seven wickets in game in test series against australia which england lost 2 1 hirst played in first four matches england won first game in which hirst took nine wickets on first day bowling throughout australian innings with colin blythe hirst took four for 28 australians were never comfortable wisden noted that hirst made ball swerve in his most puzzling fashion after england established a first innings lead australia were bowled out for 151 in their second innings with hirst taking five for 58 english opening batsmen scored 105 runs required for victory without being separated hirst and blythe took all wickets which fell to england in match a rare accomplishment and apart from a brief period bowled throughout match without resting however hirst was ineffective in rest of series and was left out of side for fifth and final test ellam p 83 in series he scored 52 runs at an average of 8 66 with a top score of 31 and took 16 wickets at 21 75 this ended his test career his final test record in 24 matches was 790 runs with three scores over fifty at an average of 22 57 and 59 wickets at an average of 30 00

some matches he bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets which cost 29 81 were his fewest since 1898 it was first time since 1902 he failed to complete double thomson p 72 his batting remained effective and he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances although his two centuries were against weaker bowling attacks of northamptonshire and somerset he scored 1 670 runs at 41 75 in june he was selected in a match to celebrate hundredth anniversary of current lord s ground playing for rest of england against mcc side which had toured

1939 for first time since first world war in period of hirst s coaching eton only lost once in 1920 to winchester a combination of hirst s technical knowledge playing experience and empathy with young people made him a very successful coach he taught technical proficiency but encouraged his pupils to play their natural game thomson p 81 his times obituary noted his professional capacity earned him respect of boys and his natural good humour and good manners gained him love of all when he retired a dinner was held in his honour at eton thomson p 85 while serving as eton coach hirst also worked with young yorkshire players during school holidays and maintained his coaching connection with county until shortly before his death despite differences in backgrounds of players hirst was equally respected at eton and when he acted as a coach to yorkshire team thomson p 84 at yorkshire hirst worked with young players in cricket nets at headingley bowes p 19 took charge of indoor trials during winter hutton p 20 and travelled with team as coach on a tour to jamaica in 1936 ellam p 86 many yorkshire players with vastly differing temperaments came under his influence and improved as players thomson p 82 one of hirst s most notable achievements as a coach was improving bowling of george macaulay to point where he became a key member of yorkshire team hodgson p 109 bill bowes who received coaching by hirst and went on to play for england described him as finest coach in world bowes p 147 len hutton another who was coached by hirst wrote i shall always think of george hirst as ideal coach he was a natural one guide philosopher and friend of every young fellow who has had a trial under him hutton p 21 part of hirst s success at eton came from his personality and ability to extract best from people bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him he could pass on technical knowledge in a way that was easy to comprehend backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point bowes described how he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating remedies style and technique thumb upright alt a cricketer about to hit a ball george hirst getting into position to pull a short ball photographed by george beldam hirst received little coaching as a batsman physically brave he was often at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting and when his team faced a crisis his usual approach was to bat aggressively although he could play defensively if required he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties thomson p 86 he played a variety of strokes but he favoured on drive and particularly pull and hook shots he was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him making it difficult to place fielders effectively while he was batting only in australia did this approach prove less successful he also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off in this position he took many catches often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well although hirst was a right handed batsman he bowled with his left arm at medium fast pace he was one of first bowlers to make ball swerve through air in a controlled fashion according to a a thomson hirst s development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as bernard bosanquet s invention of googly his bowling partnership with rhodes was particularly effective and established a formidable reputation hirst could not make ball swing in every match nor could he maintain it through a long innings however when he could achieve swerve even best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him his success was dependent on atmospheric conditions for example he could not swing ball much in australia he was particularly effective when bowling into wind sammy woods described facing hirst when ball was moving in air how devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw in from cover point hirst was not an especially quick bowler a little faster than medium pace with a long run up and a relaxed action he usually bowled over wicket meaning he bowled from right hand side of wickets and therefore angled ball across pitch after delivery ball swung through air at last minute and hurried through after pitching appearing to get faster a very accurate bowler he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in air over mid on main dangers to batsmen were risk of being bowled or hitting ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially placed fielders on leg side his ability to make ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches before hirst developed his technique bowlers often rubbed ball in dirt to remove shiny layer of ball unaware that this layer helped ball to swing hirst s wisden obituary records hirst in fact has been described as father of all modern seam and swing bowling hirst completed double 14 times more than any other cricketer except rhodes unusually for an all rounder for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler consequently he was a key member of yorkshire team his yorkshire captain lord hawke described hirst as greatest county cricketer of all time and journalist jim kilburn noted that no cricketer could capture heart and imagination and affections more firmly than george herbert hirst e w swanton described his typical style of play as grafting for victory without heroics swanton p 12 his record as a test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of australia which reduced effectiveness of his bowling and batting hirst gave impression of enjoying every game he played and many of captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to team lord hawke said that hirst s smile went right round his head and met at back thomson p 92 warner noted his wit helped team in difficult situations during tour of australia in 1903 04 hirst s times obituary said no why or wherefore no explanation of his great ability not even his record which adorns pages of wisden can adequately describe to those who had not fortune to see him play rich quality of george hirst type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire he played during golden age of cricket and he was one of most illustrious of his time hirst was noted for his honesty sportsmanship and enthusiasm thomson p 91 known as george herbert he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow kirkheaton born all rounder wilfred rhodes a much more dour character woodhouse p 183 two men were never good friends there may have been a degree of jealousy between them and rhodes did not appreciate hirst s jovial attitude hodgson p 70 rhodes was more tactically astute than hirst but hirst s enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to team rhodes when asked about hirst s ability to swing ball replied he was very good but he didn t know how to use it you know i had to set field for him so that he got best out of it a plain speaking man hirst could be firm and even outspoken at times swanton p 11 wisden said cricket was george hirst s life bowes wrote that hirst was loved as a player he was worshipped as a coach revered as a man his friends numbered thousands he gave his full life to cricket cricket gave a full life to him bowes also commented i never hope to meet a better coach or a better man bowes p 39 personal life on 1 january 1896 hirst married emma kilner in kirkheaton james their first
