battle of greece also known as operation marita is common name for invasion of allied greece by fascist italy and nazi germany in april 1941 during world war ii italian invasion in october 1940 which is usually known as greco italian war was followed by german invasion in april 1941 german landings on island of crete may 1941 came after allied forces had been defeated in mainland greece these battles were part of greater balkan campaign of germany following italian invasion on 28 october 1940 greece repulsed initial italian attack and a counter attack in march 1941 when german invasion known as operation marita began on 6 april bulk of greek army was on greek border with albania then a protectorate of italy from which italian troops had attacked german troops invaded from bulgaria creating a second front greece received a small reinforcement from british australian and new zealand forces in anticipation of german attack greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both italian and german troops as a result metaxas defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by germans who then outflanked greek forces at albanian border forcing their surrender british australian and new zealand forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with ultimate goal of evacuation for several days allied troops played an important part in containing german advance on thermopylae position allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate units defending greece german army reached capital athens on 27 april and greece s southern shore on 30 april capturing 7 000 british australian and new zealand personnel and ending battle with a decisive victory conquest of greece was completed with capture of crete a month later following its fall greece was occupied by military forces of germany italy and bulgaria hitler later blamed failure of his invasion of soviet union which had to be delayed on mussolini s failed conquest of greece theory that battle of greece delayed invasion of soviet union has been either refuted or downplayed by majority of historians who have accused hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally italy it nevertheless had serious consequences for axis war effort in north african theatre enno von rintelen who was military attache in rome emphasises from german point of view strategic mistake of not taking malta history greco italian war at outbreak of world war ii ioannis metaxas fascist style dictator of greece and former general sought to maintain a position of neutrality greece was subject to increasing pressure from italy culminating in italian submarine delfino sinking cruiser elli on 15 august 1940 italian leader benito mussolini was irritated that nazi leader adolf hitler had not consulted him on his war policy and wished to establish his independence he hoped to match german military success by taking greece which he regarded as an easy opponent on 15 october 1940 mussolini and his closest advisers finalised their decision in early hours of 28 october italian ambassador emanuele presented metaxas with a three hour ultimatum demanding free passage for troops to occupy unspecified strategic sites within greek territory metaxas rejected ultimatum refusal is commemorated as greek national holiday day but even before it expired italian troops had invaded greece through albania principal italian thrust was directed toward epirus hostilities with greek army began at battle of where they failed to break defensive line and were forced to halt within three weeks greek army launched a counter offensive during which it marched into albanian territory capturing significant cities such as korca and sarande neither a change in italian command nor arrival of substantial reinforcements improved position of italian army on 13 february general papagos commander in chief of greek army opened a new offensive aiming to take tepelene and port of vlore with british air support but greek divisions encountered stiff resistance stalling offensive that practically destroyed cretan 5th division after weeks of inconclusive winter warfare italians launched a counter offensive on centre of front on 9 march 1941 which failed despite italians superior forces after one week and 12 000 casualties mussolini called off counter offensive and left albania twelve days later modern analysts believe that italian campaign failed because mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to campaign an expeditionary force of 55 000 men failed to reckon with autumn weather attacked without advantage of surprise and without bulgarian support elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken mussolini had not considered warnings of italian commission of war production that italy would not be able to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949 during six month fight against italy hellenic army made territorial gains by eliminating italian salients greece did not have a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by british forces from defeated italian armies in north africa to man albanian battlefront greek command was forced to withdraw forces from eastern macedonia and western thrace because greek forces could not protect greece s entire border greek command decided to support its success in albania regardless of risk of a german attack from bulgarian border center frameless upright 1 1 center frameless upright 1 1 italian invasion and initial greek counter october 18 november 1940 greek counter offensive and november 1940 23 april 1941 hitler s decision to attack and british aid to greece britain was obliged to assist greece by declaration of 13 april 1939 which stated that in event of a threat to greek or romanian independence his majesty s government would feel themselves bound at once to lend greek or romanian government all support in their power first british effort was deployment of royal air force raf squadrons commanded by air commodore john d albiac that arrived in november 1940 with greek government consent british forces were dispatched to crete on 31 october to guard souda bay enabling greek government to redeploy 5th cretan division to mainland hitler decided to intervene on 4 november 1940 four days after british troops arrived at crete and lemnos although greece was neutral until italian invasion british troops that were sent as defensive aid created possibility of a frontier to german southern flank hitler s principal fear was that british aircraft based in greece would bomb romanian oil fields which was one of germany s most important sources of oil as hitler was already seriously considering launching an invasion of soviet union next year this increased importance of romanian oil as once germany was at war with soviet union romania would be reich s only source of oil at least until wehrmacht presumably captured soviet oil fields in caucasus as british were indeed contemplating using greek air fields to bomb romanian oil fields hitler s fears that his entire war machine might be paralyzed for a lack of oil should ploiesti oil fields be destroyed were to a certain extent grounded in reality however american historian gerhard weinberg noted enormous difficulties of air attacks on distant oil fields were not understood by either side at this time it was assumed on both sides that even small air raids could bring about vast fire and destruction furthermore massive italian defeats in balkans horn of africa and north africa had pushed fascist regime in italy to brink of collapse by late 1940 with mussolini becoming extremely unpopular with italian people and hitler was convinced that if he did not rescue mussolini fascist italy would be knocked out of war in 1941 weinberg wrote continuing italian defeats could easily lead to complete collapse of whole system mussolini had established and this was recognized at time it is not hindsight from 1943 if italy was knocked out of war then british would be able to use central mediterranean again and governors of french colonies in africa loyal to vichy regime might switch their loyalties to free french national committee headed by charles de gaulle as hitler had plans to ultimately use french colonies in africa as bases for war against britain and ultimately against united states as well potential loss of vichy control over its africa empire was seen as a problem by him furthermore after italy entered war in june 1940 danger of axis air and naval attacks had largely closed central mediterranean to british shipping except for supply convoys to malta in effect closing suez canal as british were forced to supply their forces in egypt via long cape route around africa british had made liberating italian east africa a priority to end possibility of italian naval and air attacks on british shipping on red sea which assumed greater importance because of dangers posed to british shipping in central mediterranean in turn decision by field marshal archibald wavell to deploy significant forces to horn of africa while as defending egypt lessened number of commonwealth forces available to go to greece through performance of italian armed forces had been less than impressive from german perspective denying british access to central mediterranean by stationing luftwaffe and kriegsmarine forces in italy made it crucial to keep italy in war hitler ordered his army general staff to attack northern greece from bases in romania and bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive british of mediterranean bases on 12 november german armed forces high command issued directive no 18 in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against gibraltar and greece for following january on 17 november 1940 metaxas proposed a joint offensive in balkans to british government with greek strongholds in southern albania as operational base british were reluctant to discuss metaxas proposal because troops necessary for implementing greek plan would seriously endanger operations in north africa in december 1940 german ambitions in mediterranean underwent considerable revision when spain s general francisco franco rejected gibraltar attack consequently germany s offensive in southern europe was restricted to greek campaign armed forces high command issued directive no 20 on 13 december 1940 outlining greek campaign under code designation operation marita plan was to occupy northern coast of aegean sea by march 1941 and to seize entire greek mainland if necessary to attack greece would require going through yugoslavia and or bulgaria regent of yugoslavia for boy king peter ii prince paul was married to a greek princess and refused german request for transit rights to invade greece king boris iii of bulgaria had long standing territorial disputes with greece and was more open to granting transit rights to wehrmacht in exchange for a promise to have parts of greece that he coveted in january 1941 bulgaria granted transit rights to wehrmacht during a meeting of british and greek military and political leaders in athens on 13 january 1941 general alexandros papagos commander in chief of hellenic army asked britain for nine fully equipped divisions and corresponding air support british responded that all they could offer was immediate dispatch of a token force of less than divisional strength this offer was rejected by greeks who feared that arrival of such a contingent would precipitate a german attack without giving them meaningful assistance british help would be requested if and when german troops crossed danube from romania into bulgaria greek leader general metaxas did not particularly want british forces on mainland of greece as he feared it would lead to a german invasion of his country and during winter of 1940 41 secretly asked hitler if he was willing to mediate an end to italo greek war british prime minister winston churchill strongly supported by chief of imperial general staff sir john dill and foreign secretary anthony eden had hopes of reviving salonika front strategy and opening a second front in balkans that would tie down german forces and deprive germany of romanian oil weather in winter of 1940 41 seriously delayed build up of german forces in romania and it was only in february 1941 that wehrmacht s twelfth army commanded by field marshal wilhelm list joined by luftwaffe s fliegerkorps viii crossed danube river into bulgaria lack of bridges on danube capable of carrying heavy supplies on romanian bulgarian frontier forced wehrmacht engineers to build necessary bridges in wintertime imposing major delays by 9 march 1941 5th and 11th panzer divisions were concentrated on bulgarian turkish border to deter turkey greece s balkan pact ally from intervening under heavy german diplomatic pressure prince paul had yugoslavia join tripartite pact on 25 march 1941 but with a proviso that yugoslavia would not grant transit rights to wehrmacht to attack greece as metaxas line protected greek bulgarian border wehrmacht generals much preferred idea of attacking greece via yugoslavia instead of bulgaria during a hasty meeting of hitler s staff after unexpected 27 march yugoslav coup d etat against yugoslav government orders for campaign in kingdom of yugoslavia were drafted as well as changes to plans for greece coup d etat in belgrade greatly assisted german planning as it allowed wehrmacht to plan an invasion of greece via yugoslavia american historians allan millett and williamson murray wrote from greek perspective it would have had been better if yugoslav coup d etat had not taken place as it would have forced wehrmacht to assault metaxas line without option of outflanking metaxas line by going through yugoslavia on 6 april both greece and yugoslavia were to be attacked british expeditionary force thumb australian soldiers in alexandria egypt embarking for greece little more than a month later british reconsidered winston churchill aspired to recreate a balkan front comprising yugoslavia greece and turkey and instructed anthony eden and sir john dill to resume negotiations with greek government a meeting attended by eden and greek leadership including king george ii prime minister alexandros koryzis successor of metaxas who had died on 29 january 1941 and papagos took place in athens on 22 february where it was decided to send an expeditionary force of british and other commonwealth forces german troops had been massing in romania and on 1 march wehrmacht forces began to move into bulgaria at same time bulgarian army mobilised and took up positions along greek frontier on 2 march operation lustre transportation of troops and equipment to greece began and 26 troopships arrived at port of piraeus on 3 april during a meeting of british yugoslav and greek military representatives yugoslavs promised to block struma valley in case of a german attack across their territory during this meeting papagos stressed importance of a joint greco yugoslavian offensive against italians as soon as germans launched their offensive by 24 april more than 62 000 empire troops british australians new zealanders palestine pioneer corps and cypriots had arrived in greece comprising 6th australian division new zealand 2nd division and british 1st armoured brigade three formations later became known as w force after their commander lieutenant general sir henry maitland wilson air commodore sir john d albiac commanded british air forces in greece prelude topography to enter northern greece german army had to cross rhodope mountains which offered few river valleys or mountain passes capable of accommodating movement of large military units two invasion courses were located west of kyustendil another was along yugoslav bulgarian border via struma river valley to south greek border fortifications had been adapted for terrain and a formidable defence system covered few available roads struma and nestos rivers cut across mountain range along greek bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications as part of larger metaxas line this system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications constructed along bulgarian border in late 1930s was built on principles similar to those of maginot line its strength resided mainly in inaccessibility of intermediate terrain leading up to defence positions strategy thumb winston churchill believed it was vital for britain to take every measure possible to support greece on 8 january 1941 he stated that there was no other course open to us but to make certain that we had spared no effort to help greeks who had shown themselves so worthy greece s mountainous terrain favored a defensive strategy while high ranges of rhodope epirus pindus and olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in many defiles although an invading force from albania could be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in high pindus mountains northeastern part of country was difficult to defend against an attack from north following a march conference in athens british believed that they would combine with greek forces to occupy haliacmon line a short front facing north eastwards along mountains and lower haliacmon river papagos awaited clarification from yugoslav government and later proposed to hold metaxas line by then a symbol of national security to greek populace and not withdraw divisions from albania he argued that to do so would be seen as a concession to italians strategically important port of thessaloniki lay practically undefended and transportation of british troops to city remained dangerous papagos proposed to take advantage of area s terrain and prepare fortifications while also protecting thessaloniki general dill described papagos attitude as and defeatist and argued that his plan ignored fact that greek troops and artillery were capable of only token resistance british believed that greek rivalry with bulgaria metaxas line was designed specifically for war with bulgaria as well as their traditionally good terms with yugoslavs left their north western border largely undefended despite their awareness that line was likely to collapse in event of a german thrust from struma and axios rivers british eventually acceded to greek command on 4 march dill accepted plans for metaxas line and on 7 march agreement was ratified by british cabinet overall command was to be retained by papagos and greek and british commands agreed to fight a delaying action in north east british did not move their troops because general wilson regarded them as too weak to protect such a broad front instead he took a position some west of axios across haliacmon line two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with hellenic army in albania and to deny german access to central greece this had advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options while allowing more preparation time but it meant abandoning nearly whole of northern greece which was unacceptable to greeks for political and psychological reasons line s left flank was susceptible to flanking from germans operating through monastir gap in yugoslavia rapid disintegration of yugoslav army and a german thrust into rear of vermion position was not expected german strategy was based on using so called blitzkrieg methods that had proved successful during invasions of western europe their effectiveness was confirmed during invasion of yugoslavia german command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into territory once thessaloniki was captured athens and port of piraeus became principal targets piraeus was virtually destroyed by bombing on night of 6 7 april disaster in piraeus harbour loss of piraeus and isthmus of corinth would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of british and greek forces defence and attack forces thumb lieutenant general sir thomas blamey commander of australian i corps lieutenant general sir henry maitland wilson commanding general of empire expeditionary force w force and major general bernard freyberg commander of new zealand 2nd division in 1941 in greece fifth yugoslav army took responsibility for south eastern border between palanka and greek border yugoslav troops were not fully mobilised and lacked adequate equipment and weapons following entry of german forces into bulgaria majority of greek troops were evacuated from western thrace by this time greek forces defending bulgarian border totalled roughly 70 000 men sometimes labelled greek second army in english and german sources although no such formation existed remainder of greek forces 14 divisions often erroneously referred to as greek first army by foreign sources was committed in albania on 28 march greek central macedonia army section comprising 12th and 20th infantry divisions were put under command of general wilson who established his headquarters to north west of larissa new zealand division took position north of mount olympus while australian division blocked haliacmon valley up to vermion range raf continued to operate from airfields in central and southern greece but few planes could be diverted to theatre british forces were near to fully motorised but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to greece s steep mountain roads they were short of tanks and anti aircraft guns and lines of communication across mediterranean were vulnerable because each convoy had to pass close to axis held islands in aegean despite british royal navy s domination of aegean sea these logistical problems were aggravated by limited availability of shipping and greek port capacity german twelfth army under command of field marshal wilhelm list was charged with execution of operation marita his army was composed of six units first panzer group under command of general ewald von kleist xl panzer corps under lieutenant general georg stumme xviii mountain corps under lieutenant general franz bohme xxx infantry corps under lieutenant general otto hartmann l infantry corps under lieutenant general georg lindemann 16th panzer division deployed behind turkish bulgarian border to support bulgarian forces in case of a turkish attack german plan of attack and assembly german plan of attack was influenced by their army s experiences during battle of france their strategy was to create a diversion through campaign in albania thus stripping hellenic army of manpower for defence of their yugoslavian and bulgarian borders by driving armoured wedges through weakest links of defence chain penetrating allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance once southern yugoslavia was overrun by german armour metaxas line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from yugoslavia thus possession of monastir and axios valley leading to thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver yugoslav coup d etat led to a sudden change in plan of attack and confronted twelfth army with a number of difficult problems according to 28 march directive no 25 twelfth army was to create a mobile task force to attack via nis toward belgrade with only nine days left before their final deployment every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise by evening of 5 april forces intended to enter southern yugoslavia and greece had been assembled german invasion thrust across southern yugoslavia and drive to thessaloniki thumb german advance until 9 april 1941 when 2nd panzer division seized thessaloniki at dawn on 6 april german armies invaded greece while luftwaffe began an intensive bombardment of belgrade xl panzer corps began their assault at 05 30 they pushed across bulgarian frontier into yugoslavia at two separate points by evening of 8 april 73rd infantry division captured prilep severing an important rail line between belgrade and thessaloniki and isolating yugoslavia from its allies on evening of 9 april stumme deployed his forces north of monastir in preparation for attack toward florina this position threatened to encircle greeks in albania and w force in area of florina edessa and katerini while weak security detachments covered his rear against a surprise attack from central yugoslavia elements of 9th panzer division drove westward to link up with italians at albanian border 2nd panzer division xviii mountain corps entered yugoslavia from east on morning of 6 april and advanced westward through struma valley it encountered little resistance but was delayed by road clearance demolitions mines and mud nevertheless division was able to reach day s objective town of on 7 april a yugoslav counter attack against division s northern flank was repelled and following day division forced its way across mountains and overran thinly manned defensive line of greek 19th mechanised division south of doiran lake despite many delays along mountain roads an armoured advance guard dispatched toward thessaloniki succeeded in entering city by morning of 9 april thessaloniki was taken after a long battle with three greek divisions under command of general bakopoulos and was followed by surrender of greek eastern macedonia army section taking effect at 13 00 on 10 april in three days it took germans to reach thessaloniki and breach metaxas line some 60 000 greek soldiers were taken prisoner greek yugoslav counteroffensive in early april 1941 greek yugoslav and british commanders met to set in motion a counteroffensive that planned to completely destroy italian army in albania in time to counter german invasion and allow bulk of greek army to take up new positions and protect border with yugoslavia and bulgaria on 7 april yugoslav 3rd army in form of five infantry divisions 13th 15th zetska 25th vardarska 31st kosovska and 12th jadranska divisions with jadranska acting as reserve after a false start due to planting of a bogus order launched a counteroffensive in northern albania advancing from debar and podgorica towards elbasan on 8 april yugoslav vanguard cavalry regiment crossed treacherous mountains and captured village of in river valley and 31st kosovska division supported by savoia marchetti s 79k bombers from 7th bomber regiment of royal yugoslav air force vvkj broke through italian positions in drin river valley vardarska division due to fall of skopje was forced to halt its operations in albania in meantime western macedonia army section under general tsolakoglou comprising 9th and 13th greek divisions advanced in support of royal yugoslav army capturing some 250 italians on 8 april greeks were tasked with advancing towards durres on 9 april zetska division advanced towards shkoder and yugoslav cavalry regiment reached drin river but kosovska division had to halt its advance due to appearance of german units near prizren yugoslav greek offensive was supported by s 79k bombers from 66th and 81st bomber groups of vvkj that attacked airfields and camps around shkoder as well as port of durres and italian troop concentrations and bridges on drin and rivers and durres tirana and zara between 11 13 april 1941 with german and italian troops advancing on its rear areas zetska division was forced to retreat back to river by italian 131st armoured division centauro where it remained until end of campaign on 16 april italian armoured division along with 18th infantry division messina then advanced upon yugoslav fleet base of kotor in montenegro also occupying and podgorica yugoslavs lost 30 000 men captured in italian counterattacks metaxas line metaxas line was defended by eastern macedonia army section led by lieutenant general konstantinos bakopoulos and comprising 7th 14th and 18th infantry divisions line ran for about along river nestos to east and then further east following bulgarian border as far as mount beles near yugoslav border fortifications were designed to garrison over 200 000 troops but there were only about 70 000 and infantry garrison was thinly spread some 950 men under command of major georgios of 14th division defended fort roupel thumb german infantry in greece germans had to break metaxas line in order to capture thessaloniki greece s second largest city and a strategically important port attack started on 6 april with one infantry unit and two divisions of xviii mountain corps due to strong resistance first day of attack yielded little progress in breaking line a german report at end of first day described how german 5th mountain division was repulsed in rupel pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties two german battalions managed to get within of fort rupel on 6 april but were practically destroyed of 24 forts that made up metaxas line only two had fallen and only after they had been destroyed in following days germans forts with artillery and dive bombers and reinforced 125th infantry regiment finally a high snow covered mountainous passage considered inaccessible by greeks was crossed by 6th mountain division which reached rail line to thessaloniki on evening of 7 april 5th mountain division together with reinforced 125th infantry regiment crossed struma river under great hardship attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective on 7 april heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw 72nd infantry division advanced from across mountains its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals medium artillery and mountain equipment only on evening of 9 april did it reach area north east of serres most fortresses like fort roupel and held until germans occupied thessaloniki on 9 april at which point they surrendered under general bakopoulos orders nevertheless minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them this gave time for some retreating troops to evacuate by sea although eventually broken defenders of metaxas line succeeded in delaying german advance capitulation of greek army in macedonia xxx infantry corps on left wing reached its designated objective on evening of 8 april when 164th infantry division captured xanthi 50th infantry division advanced far beyond towards nestos river both divisions arrived next day on 9 april greek forces defending metaxas line capitulated unconditionally following collapse of greek resistance east of axios river in a 9 april estimate of situation field marshal list commented that as a result of swift advance of mobile units his 12th army was now in a favourable position to access central greece by breaking greek build up behind axios river on basis of this estimate list requested transfer of 5th panzer division from first panzer group to xl panzer corps he reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to german thrust through monastir gap for continuation of campaign he formed an eastern group under command of xviii mountain corps and a western group led by xl panzer corps breakthrough to kozani by morning of 10 april xl panzer corps had finished its preparations for continuation of offensive and advanced in direction of kozani 5th panzer division advancing from skopje encountered a greek division tasked with defending monastir gap rapidly defeating defenders first contact with allied troops was made north of vevi at 11 00 on 10 april german ss troops seized vevi on 11 april but were stopped at pass just south of town during next day ss regiment reconnoitered allied positions and at dusk launched a frontal attack against pass following heavy fighting germans broke through defence by morning of 14 april spearheads of 9th panzer division reached kozani olympus and servia passes wilson faced prospect of being pinned by germans operating from thessaloniki while being flanked by german xl panzer corps descending through monastir gap on 13 april he withdrew all british forces to haliacmon river and then to narrow pass at thermopylae on 14 april 9th panzer division established a bridgehead across haliacmon river but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense allied fire this defence had three main components platamon tunnel area between olympus and sea olympus pass itself and servia pass to south east by channelling attack through these three defiles new line offered far greater defensive strength defences of olympus and servia passes consisted of 4th new zealand brigade 5th new zealand brigade and 16th australian brigade for next three days advance of 9th panzer division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions a ruined castle dominated ridge across which coastal pass led to platamon during night of 15 april a german motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked ridge but germans were repulsed by new zealand 21st battalion under lieutenant colonel neil macky which suffered heavy losses in process later that day a german armoured regiment arrived and struck coastal and inland flanks of battalion but new zealanders held after being reinforced during night of 15th 16th germans assembled a tank battalion an infantry battalion and a motorcycle battalion infantry attacked new zealanders left company at dawn while tanks attacked along coast several hours later new zealanders soon found themselves enveloped on both sides after failure of western macedonia army to defend albanian town of korca that fell unopposed to italian 9th army on 15 april forcing british to abandon mount olympus position and resulting in capture of 20 000 greek troops thumb australian anti tank gunners resting soon after their withdrawal from vevi area new zealand battalion withdrew crossing pineios river by dusk they had reached western exit of pineios gorge suffering only light casualties macky was informed that it was essential to deny gorge to enemy until 19 april even if it meant extinction he sank a crossing barge at western end of gorge once all his men were across and set up defences 21st battalion was reinforced by australian 2 2nd battalion and later by 2 3rd this force became known as allen force after brigadier tubby allen 2 5th and 2 11th battalions moved to area south west of gorge and were ordered to hold western exit possibly for three or four days on 16 april wilson met papagos at lamia and informed him of his decision to withdraw to thermopylae lieutenant general thomas blamey divided responsibility between generals mackay and freyberg during leapfrogging move to thermopylae mackay s force was assigned flanks of new zealand division as far south as an east west line through larissa and to oversee withdrawal through domokos to thermopylae of savige and forces and finally of lee force brigadier harold charrington s 1st armoured brigade was to cover withdrawal of savige force to larissa and thereafter withdrawal of 6th division under whose command it would come overseeing withdrawal of allen force which was to move along same route as new zealand division british australian and new zealand forces remained under attack throughout withdrawal on morning of 18 april battle of tempe gorge struggle for pineios gorge was over when german armoured infantry crossed river on floats and 6th mountain division troops worked their way around new zealand battalion which was subsequently dispersed on 19 april first xviii mountain corps troops entered larissa and took possession of airfield where british had left their supply dump intact seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled spearhead units to continue without ceasing port of volos at which british had re embarked numerous units during prior few days fell on 21 april there germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil withdrawal and surrender of greek epirus army as invading germans advanced deep into greek territory epirus army section of greek army operating in albania was reluctant to retreat by middle of march especially after tepelene offensive greek army had suffered according to british estimates 5 000 casualties and it was fast approaching end of its logistical tether general wilson described this unwillingness to retreat as fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to italians churchill also criticized greek army commanders for ignoring british advice to abandon albania and avoid encirclement lieutenant general georg stumme s xl corps captured florina vevi pass on 11 april but unseasonal snowy weather then halted his advance on 12 april he resumed advance but spent whole day fighting brigadier charrington s 1st armoured brigade at it was not until 13 april that first greek elements began to withdraw toward pindus mountains allies retreat to thermopylae uncovered a route across pindus mountains by which germans might flank hellenic army in a rearguard action an elite ss formation leibstandarte ss adolf hitler brigade was assigned mission of cutting off greek epirus army s line of retreat from albania by driving westward to metsovon pass and from there to ioannina on 13 april attack aircraft from 21 23 and 33 squadrons from hellenic air force rhaf attacked italian positions in albania that same day heavy fighting took place at kleisoura pass where greek 20th division covering greek withdrawal fought in a determined manner delaying stumme s advance practically a whole day withdrawal extended across entire albanian front with italians in hesitant pursuit on 15 april regia aeronautica fighters attacked rhaf base at paramythia 30 miles south of greece s border with albania destroying or putting out of action 17 vvkj aircraft that had recently arrived from yugoslavia thumb left retreating greek soldiers april 1941 general papagos rushed greek units to metsovon pass where germans were expected to attack on 14 april a pitched battle between several greek units and lssah brigade which had by then reached grevena erupted greek 13th and cavalry divisions lacked equipment necessary to fight against an armoured unit and on 15 april were finally encircled and overwhelmed on 18 april general wilson in a meeting with papagos informed him that british and commonwealth forces at would carry on fighting till first week of may providing that greek forces from albania could redeploy and cover left flank on 21 april germans advanced further and captured ioannina final supply route of greek epirus army allied newspapers dubbed hellenic army s fate a modern day greek tragedy historian and former war correspondent christopher buckley when describing fate of hellenic army stated that one experience d a genuine aristotelian catharsis an awe inspiring sense of futility of all human effort and all human courage on 20 april commander of greek forces in albania lieutenant general georgios tsolakoglou accepted hopelessness of situation and offered to surrender his army which then consisted of fourteen divisions papagos condemned tsolakoglou s decision to capitulate although lieutenant general ioannis and major general georgios had warned him a week earlier that morale in epirus army was wearing thin and combat stress and exhaustion had resulted in officers taking decision to put deserters before firing squads historian john keegan writes that tsolakoglou was so determined to deny italians satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that he opened a quite unauthorised parley with commander of german ss division opposite

early as 16 april german command realised that british were evacuating troops on ships at volos and piraeus campaign then took on character of a pursuit for germans it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with retreating british forces and foiling their evacuation plans german infantry divisions were withdrawn due to their limited mobility 2nd and 5th panzer divisions 1st ss motorised infantry regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of allied forces to allow an evacuation of main body of british forces wilson ordered rearguard to make a last stand at

true or not many greeks believed it and viewed soldier as a martyr evacuation of empire forces thumb in morning of 15 april 1941 wavell sent to wilson following message we must of course continue to fight in close cooperation with greeks but from news here it looks as if early further withdrawal necessary general archibald wavell commander of british army forces in middle east when in greece from 11 13 april had warned wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised major general freddie de guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers nevertheless british could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action suggestion had to come from greek government following day papagos made first move when he suggested to wilson that w force be withdrawn wilson informed middle east headquarters and on 17 april rear admiral h t baillie grohman was sent to greece to prepare for evacuation that day wilson hastened to athens where he attended a conference with king papagos d albiac and rear admiral in evening after telling king that he felt he had failed him in task entrusted to him prime minister koryzis committed suicide on 21 april

staged an airborne operation to seize bridges over corinth canal with double aim of cutting off british line of retreat and securing their own way across isthmus attack met with initial success until a stray british shell destroyed bridge 1st ss motorised infantry regiment lssah assembled at ioannina thrust along western foothills of pindus mountains via arta to missolonghi and crossed over to

000 empire including 2 000 cypriot and palestinian and yugoslav troops in kalamata who had not been evacuated while liberating many italian prisoners from pow camps greek navy and merchant marine played an important part in evacuation of allied forces to crete and suffered heavy losses as a result churchill writes aftermath triple occupation thumb italian german bulgarian italian territory on 13 april 1941 hitler issued directive no 27 including his occupation policy for greece he finalized jurisdiction in balkans with directive no 31 issued on 9 june mainland greece was divided between germany italy and bulgaria with italy occupying bulk of country see map opposite german forces occupied strategically more important areas of athens thessaloniki central macedonia and several aegean islands including most of crete they also occupied florina which was claimed by both italy and bulgaria bulgarians occupied territory between struma river and a line of demarcation running through alexandroupoli and west of evros river italian troops started occupying ionian and aegean islands on 28 april on 2 june they occupied peloponnese on 8 june thessaly and on 12 june most of attica occupation of greece during which civilians suffered terrible hardships many dying from privation and hunger proved to be a difficult and costly task several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against occupying forces and set up espionage networks battle of crete thumb german paratroopers land in crete on 25 april 1941 king george ii and his government left greek mainland for crete which was attacked by nazi forces on 20 may 1941 germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion and attacked three main airfields of island in maleme rethymno and heraklion after seven days of fighting and tough resistance allied commanders decided that cause was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from sfakia during night of 24 may george ii and his government were evacuated from crete to egypt by 1 june 1941 evacuation was complete and island was under german occupation in light of heavy casualties suffered by elite 7th fliegerdivision hitler forbade further large scale airborne operations general kurt student would dub crete graveyard of german paratroopers and a disastrous victory assessments greek campaign ended with a complete german and italian victory british did not have military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in north africa and balkans even if they had been able to block axis advance they would have been unable to exploit situation by a counter thrust across balkans british came very near to holding crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout eastern mediterranean in enumerating reasons for complete axis victory in greece following factors were of greatest significance german superiority in ground forces and equipment bulk of greek army was occupied fighting italians on albanian front german air supremacy combined with inability of greeks to provide raf with adequate airfields inadequacy of british expeditionary forces since imperial force available was small poor condition of hellenic army and its shortages of modern equipment inadequate port road and railway facilities absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between british greek and yugoslav forces turkey s strict neutrality and early collapse of yugoslav resistance criticism of british actions after allies defeat decision to send british forces into greece faced fierce criticism in britain field marshal alan brooke chief of imperial general staff during world war ii considered intervention in greece to be a definite strategic blunder as it denied wavell necessary reserves to complete conquest of italian libya or to withstand erwin rommel s afrika korps march offensive it prolonged north african campaign which might have been concluded during 1941 in 1947 de guingand asked british government to recognise its mistaken strategy in greece buckley countered that if britain had not honoured its 1939 commitment to greece it would have severely damaged ethical basis of its struggle against nazi germany according to heinz richter churchill tried through campaign in greece to influence political atmosphere in united states and insisted on this strategy even after defeat according to keegan greek campaign had been an old fashioned gentlemen s war with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side and vastly outnumbered greek and allied forces had rightly sensation of having fought good fight it has also been suggested british strategy was to create a barrier in greece to protect turkey only neutral country standing between an axis block in balkans and oil rich middle east but british intervention in greece was considered a fiasco martin van creveld believes that british did everything in their power to scuttle all attempts at a separate peace between greeks and italians to keep greeks fighting so as to draw italian divisions away from north africa freyberg and blamey also had serious doubts about feasibility of operation but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions campaign caused a furore in australia when it became known that when general blamey received his first warning of move to greece on 18 february 1941 he was worried but had not informed australian government he had been told by wavell that prime minister menzies had approved plan proposal had been accepted by a meeting of war cabinet in london at which menzies was present but australian prime minister had been told by churchill that both freyberg and blamey approved of expedition on 5 march in a letter to menzies blamey said that plan is of course what i feared piecemeal dispatch to europe and next day he called operation most hazardous thinking that he was agreeable australian government had already committed australian imperial force to greek campaign impact on operation barbarossa in 1942 members of british parliament characterised campaign in greece as a political and sentimental decision eden rejected criticism and argued that uk s decision was unanimous and asserted that battle of greece delayed operation barbarossa axis invasion of soviet union this is an argument that historians used to assert that greek resistance was a turning point in world war ii according to film maker and friend of adolf hitler leni riefenstahl hitler said that if italians hadn t attacked greece and needed our help war would have taken a different course we could have anticipated russian cold by weeks and conquered leningrad and moscow there would have been no stalingrad despite his reservations brooke seems also to have conceded that balkan campaign delayed offensive against soviet union bradley and buell conclude that although no single segment of balkan campaign forced germans to delay barbarossa obviously entire campaign did prompt them to wait on other hand richter calls eden s arguments a falsification of history basil liddell hart and de guingand point out that delay of axis invasion of soviet union was not among britain s strategic goals and as a result possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about operation marita in 1952 historical branch of uk cabinet office concluded that balkan campaign had no influence on launching of operation barbarossa according to robert main causes for deferring barbarossa s start from 15 may to 22 june were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring this does not answer whether in absence of these problems campaign could have begun according to original plan keegan writes antony beevor wrote in 2012 about current thinking of historians with regard to delays caused by german attacks in balkans that most accept that it made little difference to eventual outcome of barbarossa us army analyst richard hooker jr calculates that 22 june start date of barbarossa was sufficient for germans to advance to moscow by mid august and he says that victories in balkans raised morale of german soldier historian david glantz wrote that german invasion of balkans helped conceal barbarossa from soviet leadership and contributed to german success in achieving strategic surprise glantz states that while balkans operations contributed to delays in launching barbarossa these acted to discredit soviet intelligence reports which accurately predicted initially planned invasion date jack p greene agrees that other factors were more important as regards delaying of barbarossa but he also argues that panzer divisions which had been in service during operation marita had to undergo refit notes nevertheless hitler had given mussolini green light to attack greece six months earlier acknowledging mussolini s right to do as he saw fit in his acknowledged sphere of influence
