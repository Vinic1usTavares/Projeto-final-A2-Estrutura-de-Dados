lockheed senior prom was a classified black program conducted by united states air force in conjunction with lockheed corporation s skunk works for development and testing of a cruise missile using stealth technology based on company s have blue demonstrator six senior prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at area 51 in late 1970s despite this aircraft was not selected to enter production and program was terminated in early 1980s design and development following success of test programme for lockheed have blue stealth technology demonstrator aircraft united states air force awarded a contract to lockheed advanced development projects division skunk works for development of an unmanned aerial vehicle intended to act as prototype of a cruise missile that would apply have blue s faceted design in order to reduce radar cross section of missile by deflecting electromagnetic waves from radar transmitters away from their source instead of directly back at radar set s antenna parsch 2005 program began in 1977 with a reported budget of usd 24 000 000 richardson 2001 p 65 design of aircraft was closely based on that of have blue except scaled down merlin 2011 p 108 intended for launch from lockheed dc 130 hercules drone launcher aircraft original configuration of senior prom vehicle included winglets and a ventral fin aircraft was later modified to include a v tail and more slender wings closer in configuration to f 117 nighthawk stealth fighter radar absorbent material was applied to airframe as part of its stealth configuration in addition to faceting of design similar to that of have blue and f 117 sawtooth wing profile bore similarities to b 2 stealth bomber s planform senior prom vehicle was intended to be expendable however it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under fuselage merlin 2011 p 109 aircraft is believed to have been fitted with folding wings to facilitate carriage by launching aircraft and was powered by a single turbofan engine with air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that airframe would shield them from ground reducing aircraft s radar and infrared signatures testing and cancellation thumb right airframe of senior prom vehicle was based on that of have blue technology demonstrator illustrated here flight testing of senior prom vehicles began in october 1978 a total of six aircraft were built which completed a total of fourteen flights over duration of testing programme craft were reportedly capable of flying within of a sps 13 radar without generating a discernible return most testing took place at groom lake area 51 in nevada with a dc 130 hercules acting as launch aircraft there are also reports that some testing was conducted at edwards air force base in california with a b 52 stratofortress being used as launch platform while hangar 18 at groom lake test complex was reportedly constructed to house b 52 and senior prom combination peebles 1999 p 289 despite success of test programme senior prom was cancelled in 1982 reportedly one reason for cancellation of project was that size and configuration of senior prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on b 1 bomber sweetman 2004 pp 73 74 agm 129 acm a competing design to senior prom for cruise missile requirement had a more slender airframe with retractable wings which rendered it capable of internal carriage it began flight testing shortly after end of senior prom programme despite cancellation of programme in 1982 senior prom remained highly classified into 21st century there are rumours that a small number of senior prom aircraft configured for aerial reconnaissance were acquired by united states air force and were used in secret missions over eastern europe late in cold war over iraq during operation desert storm and over north korea there is no official confirmation of this being case references citations bibliography senior prom category 1970s united states experimental aircraft category cancelled military aircraft projects of united states category stealth aircraft category black projects category single engined jet aircraft category monoplanes category v tail aircraft category cruise missiles of united states category aircraft first flown in 1978
