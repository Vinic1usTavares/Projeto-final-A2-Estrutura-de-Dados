hoopoe starling fregilupus varius also known as reunion starling or bourbon crested starling is a species of starling which lived on mascarene island of reunion and became extinct in 1850s its closest relatives were rodrigues starling and mauritius starling from nearby islands and three apparently originated in southeast asia bird was first mentioned during 17th century and was long thought to be related to hoopoe from which its name is derived although a number of affinities have been proposed it was confirmed as a starling in a dna study hoopoe starling was in length its plumage was primarily white and grey with its back wings and tail a darker brown and grey it had a light mobile crest which curled forwards bird is thought to have been sexually dimorphic with males larger and having more curved beaks juveniles were more brown than adults little is known about hoopoe starling behaviour reportedly living in large flocks it inhabited humid areas and marshes hoopoe starling was omnivorous feeding on plant matter and insects its pelvis was robust its feet and claws large and its jaws strong indicating that it foraged near ground birds were hunted by settlers on reunion who also kept them as cagebirds nineteen specimens exist in museums around world hoopoe starling was reported to be in decline by early 19th century and was probably extinct before 1860s a number of factors have been proposed including competition and predation by introduced species disease deforestation and persecution by humans who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest taxonomy upright

birds of madagascar written by french governor etienne de flacourt although he mentioned a black and grey tivouch or hoopoe later authors have wondered whether this referred to hoopoe starling or madagascan subspecies of hoopoe upupa marginata though that bird resembles eurasian subspecies hoopoe starling was first noted on mascarene island of reunion then called bourbon by pere in 1669 but was not described in detail until french traveller sieur dubois s 1674 account hume j p 2014 pp 8 14 early settlers on reunion referred to bird as due to similarity of its crest and curved bill with that of hoopoe little was recorded about hoopoe starling during next 100 years but specimens began to be brought to europe during 18th century although species was first scientifically described by french naturalist philippe gueneau de montbeillard in 1779 edition of french naturalist comte de buffon s histoire naturelle it did not receive its scientific name until its designation by dutch naturalist pieter boddaert for book s 1783 edition boddaert named bird upupa varia its genus name is that of hoopoe and its specific name means variegated describing its black and white colour boddaert provided linnean binomial names for plates in buffon s works so accompanying 1770s plate of hoopoe starling by french engraver francois nicolas martinet is considered holotype or type illustration though plate may have been based on a specimen in national museum of natural history in paris this is impossible to determine today paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins some which only arrived during 19th century possibly female specimen mnhn 2000 756 one of most illustrated skins has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi circular shape unlike its appearance in life type illustration has a similarly shaped crest upright thumb left alt painting of brown and white bird on a branch with a shorter head tuft 1907 illustration by john gerrard keulemans based on a specimen in paris with a trimmed crest de flacourt s tivouch led early writers to believe that variants of bird were found on madagascar and cape of africa they were thought to be of genus upupa which received names such as upupa capensis and upupa madagascariensis a number of authors also allied bird with groups such as birds of paradise bee eaters cowbirds and choughs resulting in its reassignment to other genera with new names such as cristata and pastor upupa in 1831 french naturalist rene primevere lesson placed bird in its own monotypic genus a composite of upupa and latter a defunct genus name of chough french naturalist auguste vinson established in 1868 that bird was restricted to island of reunion and proposed a new binomial fregilupus borbonicus referring to former name of island hume j p 2014 pp 29 44 german ornithologist hermann schlegel first proposed in 1857 that species belonged to starling family sturnidae reclassifying it as part of genus sturnus s capensis this reclassification was observed by other authors swedish zoologist carl jakob sundevall proposed new genus name crested starling in 1872 yet fregilupus varius oldest name remains bird s binomial and all other scientific names are synonyms in 1874 after a detailed analysis of only known skeleton held at cambridge university museum of zoology british ornithologist james murie agreed that it was a starling english zoologist richard bowdler sharpe said in 1890 that hoopoe starling was similar to starling genus but did not note any similarities other than their crests thumb alt drawing of bird skeleton on a branch 1874 lithograph of only known skeleton by philibert charles berjeau in 1941 american ornithologist malcolm r miller found bird s musculature similar to that of common starling sturnus vulgaris after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at cambridge museum but noted that tissue was very degraded and similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings in 1957 american ornithologist andrew john berger cast doubt on bird s affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences after dissecting a spirit specimen at american museum of natural history some authors proposed a relationship with but japanese ornithologist hiroyuki morioka rejected this in 1996 after a comparative study of skulls in 1875 british ornithologist alfred newton attempted to identify a black and white bird mentioned in an 18th century manuscript describing a marooned sailor s stay on mascarene island of rodrigues in 1726 27 that it was related to hoopoe starling subfossil bones later found on rodrigues were correlated with bird in manuscript in 1879 these bones became basis for a new species necropsar rodericanus rodrigues starling named by british ornithologists albert gunther and edward newton although they found rodrigues bird closely related to hoopoe starling gunther and newton kept it in a separate genus due to present ornithological practice american ornithologist james greenway suggested in 1967 that rodrigues starling belonged in same genus as hoopoe starling due to their close similarity subfossils found in 1974 confirmed that rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling primarily its stouter bill warrants generic separation from fregilupus in 2014 british palaeontologist julian p hume described a new extinct species mauritius starling based on subfossils from mauritius which was closer to rodrigues starling than to hoopoe starling in its skull sternal and humeral features evolution in 1943 american ornithologist dean amadon suggested that sturnus like species could have arrived in africa and given rise to wattled starling cinerea and mascarene starlings according to amadon rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to asiatic starlings such as some sturnus species rather than to glossy starlings of africa and madagascan starling aurata based on their colouration a 2008 study by italian zoologist dario zuccon and colleagues analysing dna of a variety of starlings confirmed that hoopoe starling belonged in a clade of southeast asian starlings as an isolated lineage with no close relatives following cladogram shows its position thumb alt white bird with dark wing and tail feathers and a blue mask related bali myna which is similarly coloured and also has a crest an earlier attempt by another team could not extract viable hoopoe starling dna zuccon and colleagues suggested that ancestors of hoopoe starling reached reunion from southeast asia by using island chains as stepping stones across indian ocean a scenario also suggested for other mascarene birds its lineage diverged from that of other starlings four million years ago about two million years before reunion emerged from sea so it may have first evolved on landmasses now partially submerged extant relations such as bali myna and white headed starling have similarities in colouration and other features with extinct mascarene species since rodrigues and mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to hoopoe starling which appears closer to southeast asian starlings there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from asia to mascarenes with hoopoe starling latest arrival except for madagascar mascarenes were only islands in southwestern indian ocean with native starlings probably due to their isolation varied topography and vegetation description left thumb alt perching hoopoe starling museum specimen thumbtime 0 02 turnaround video of

confusion about which characteristics that were sexually dimorphic in species only three specimens were sexed all males with age and individual variation not considered male is thought to have been largest with a longer curvier beak in 1911 reunion resident eugene jacob de cordemoy recalled his observations of bird about 50 years before suggesting that only males had a white crest but this is thought to be incorrect a presumed female mnhn 2000 756 in paris museum appears to have a smaller crest a smaller and less curved beak and smaller primary coverts a juvenile specimen mhnt has a smaller crest and primary coverts with a brown wash instead of ash grey on crest lore and superciliary stripe and a light brown instead of ash brown back juveniles of some southeast asian starlings are also browner than adults vinson who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on reunion described crest as flexible disunited and forward curled barbs of various lengths highest in centre and able to be erected at will he compared bird s crest to that of a cockatoo and to tail feathers of a bird of paradise most mounted specimens have an erect crest indicating its natural position only illustration of hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by french artist paul philippe de jossigny during early 1770s jossigny instructed engravers under drawing that for accuracy they should depict crest angled forward from head not straight up hume believes that martinet did this when he made type illustration and it was derivative of jossigny s image rather than a life drawing jossigny also made only known life drawing of now extinct newton s parakeet psittacula exsul after a specimen sent to him from rodrigues to mauritius so this is perhaps also where he drew hoopoe starling murie suggested that only illustrations by martinet and jacques barraband were original since he was unaware of jossigny s drawing but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike behaviour and ecology upright thumb left alt painting of brown and white crested bird with a long beak on a branch under an overhanging rock 1910 illustration by eduard de maes little is known about behaviour of hoopoe starling according to francois levaillant s 1807 account of bird which included observations from a reunion resident it was abundant with large flocks inhabiting humid areas and marshes in 1831 lesson without explanation described its habits as similar to those of a crow its song was described as a bright and cheerful whistle and clear notes indicating a similarity to songs of other starlings vinson s 1877 account relates his experiences with bird more than 50 years earlier thumb upright alt drawing of separate bird bones 1874 lithograph of skeletal elements by berjeau like most other starlings hoopoe starling was omnivorous feeding on fruits seeds and insects its tongue long slender sharp and frayed may have been able to move rapidly helpful when feeding on fruit nectar pollen and invertebrates its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large indicating that it foraged near ground its jaws were strong morioka compared its skull to that of hoopoe and it may have foraged in a similar way probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak de montbeillard was informed of stomach contents of a dissected specimen consisting of seeds and berries of possibly eugenia a bush with sweet orange berries he noted that bird weighed and was fatter around june and july several accounts suggest that hoopoe starling migrated on reunion spending six months in lowlands and six months in mountains food may have been easier to obtain in lowlands during winter with birds breeding in mountain forests during summer hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities many other endemic species on reunion became extinct after arrival of humans and resulting disruption of island s ecosystem hoopoe starling lived with other now extinct birds such as reunion ibis mascarene parrot reunion parakeet reunion swamphen reunion owl reunion night heron and reunion pink pigeon extinct reunion reptiles include reunion giant tortoise and an undescribed leiolopisma skink small mauritian flying fox and snail tropidophora carinata lived on reunion and mauritius before vanishing from both islands relationship with humans thumb left alt dark bird with white head and long slender curved beak specimen in pisa charterhouse hoopoe starling was described as tame and easily hunted in 1704 french pilot engineer jean feuilley explained how birds were caught by humans and cats hoopoe starling was kept as a cagebird on reunion and mauritius and although bird was becoming scarcer a number of specimens were obtained during early 19th century it is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from mascarenes cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food such as bananas potatoes and and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas many individuals survived on mauritius after escaping there and it was thought that a feral population could be established however mauritian population lasted less than a decade final specimen on island last definite record of a live specimen anywhere was taken in 1836 specimens could still be collected on reunion during 1830s and possibly early 1840s there are nineteen surviving hoopoe starling specimens in museums around world including one skeleton and two specimens preserved in spirit with two in paris museum and four in troyes additional skins in turin livorno and caen were destroyed during world war ii and four skins have disappeared from reunion and mauritius which now have one each specimens were sent to europe beginning in second half of 18th century with most collected during first half of 19th century it is unclear when each specimen was acquired and specimens were frequently moved between collections it is also unclear which specimens were basis for which descriptions and illustrations only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur discovered in 1993 in a reunion grotto extinction thumb upright left alt painting of bright eyed hoopoe starling on a tree branch 1860s illustration by albert roussin several causes for decline and sudden disappearance of hoopoe starling have been proposed all connected to activities of humans on reunion who it survived alongside for two centuries an oft repeated suggestion is that introduction of common myna acridotheres tristis led to competition between these two starling species myna was introduced to reunion in 1759 to combat locusts and became a pest itself however hoopoe starling coexisted with myna for nearly 100 years and they may not have shared habitat black rat rattus rattus arrived on reunion in 1670s and brown rat rattus norvegicus in 1735 multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species like hoopoe starling rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs juveniles and nesting birds during mid 19th century reunion slit eared skink borbonicus became extinct due to predation by introduced wolf snake aulicum which may have deprived bird of a significant food source hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic hawaiian birds according to british ecologist anthony s cheke this was chief cause of hoopoe starling s extinction species had survived for generations despite other threats beginning in 1830s reunion was deforested for plantations former slaves joined white peasants in cultivating pristine areas after slavery was abolished in 1848 and hoopoe starling was pushed to edges of its former habitat according to hume over hunting was final blow to species with forests more accessible hunting by rapidly growing human population may have driven remaining birds to extinction in 1821 a law mandating extermination of grain damaging birds was implemented and hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops during 1860s various writers noted that bird had almost disappeared but it was probably already extinct by this time in 1877 vinson lamented that last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires no attempts to preserve species in captivity seem to have been made hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct mascarene species and was last of mascarene starling species to become extinct rodrigues and mauritius species probably disappeared with arrival of rats at least five species of aplonis starlings have disappeared from pacific islands with rats contributing to their extinction hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to reunion s rugged topography and highlands where it spent much of year hume j p 2014 pp 55 58 references works cited external links category birds described in
