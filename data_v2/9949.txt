film received praise from critics with moving picture world stating it is a picture which touches heart and arouses strongest emotions it can be readily understood how a man might become a maniac under such circumstances loss of a wife and daughter is sufficient to overthrow reason that a man should be a hermit afterward seems not unusual then comes excitement of runaway rescue of baby and discovery of his daughter with returning reason and love to follow during his declining years emotions will be strongly aroused by this picture and that will make it popular whatever touches heart is always popular and this seems to appeal with unusual power new york dramatic mirror offered minor praise for film for production and its acting see also list of american films of 1910 references
