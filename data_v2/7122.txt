tropical storm flossie yielded stormy weather to hawaii in late july 2013 sixth tropical cyclone and named storm of annual hurricane season flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off western coast of africa on july 9 tracking westward across atlantic with little development it passed over central america and into eastern pacific ocean on july 18 where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization by 0600 utc on july 25 wave acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later continuing westward flossie attained peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h on july 27 before entering central pacific ocean there unfavorable upper level winds established a weakening trend on july 30 flossie weakened to a tropical depression and by 1200 utc that same day storm degenerated into a remnant low northeast of kauai in advance of flossie tropical cyclone warnings and watches were placed into effect for various hawaiian islands in addition numerous flash flood watches were issued in fear of over a foot of precipitation ports and numerous facilities were closed to public and authorities opened shelters for refuge upon approach flossie threatened to become first tropical storm to make a direct hit on hawaii in two decades however system weakened prior to doing so flossie brought high surf to state leading to minor beach erosion gusty winds exceeded tropical storm threshold downing numerous power poles and trees as a result several thousand locals were without power for a few days storm produced several inches of rainfall across island with a peak of on mount waialeale though one man was injured due to lightnings no fatalities were reported in association with flossie damage totaled to 24 000 2013 usd as a consequence of lightning meteorological history on july 9 2013 a tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa tracking swiftly westward across atlantic it passed across central america on july 18 and emerged into eastern pacific ocean shortly thereafter early on july 21 a broad low pressure area formed in association with wave and national hurricane center nhc began monitoring disturbance for slow development into a tropical cyclone accordingly shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced over subsequent days prompting nhc to increase its chances for development to high category despite this satellite data from early on july 24 did not reveal a well defined circulation necessary for classification by that evening a combination of visible and microwave satellite imagery depicted an improvement of vortex and system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000 utc on july 25 while situated 980 miles 1 575 km west southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula depression tracked west to west northwest upon classification steered by a mid level ridge centered over southwestern united states deep convection increased in coverage and intensity over following hours leading to an increase in satellite intensity estimates at 0600 utc depression was upgraded to tropical storm flossie within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures flossie gradually intensified over next two days a mid level eye became observable in microwave imagery and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on july 27 at 1200 utc system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mb hpa 29 35 inhg thereafter flossie crossed 140th meridian west into central pacific ocean where central pacific hurricane center cphc assumed responsibility of system unfavorable upper level winds in association with an upper level trough began to impede system s organization around this time and it began a slow weakening trend in conjunction with high wind shear marginal ocean temperatures caused deep convection in association with flossie to weaken and become ragged as a result forecast called for continued weakening instead a brief reprieve in upper level winds allowed system to intensify to a secondary peak of 65 mph 100 km h by 1200 utc on july 28 an anticyclone northwest of system increased shear atop system once again by following day and dry air began to become ingested into circulation low level vortex became exposed to view and progressively ill defined as outflow boundaries in association with a previous convective burst impeded on low at 0000 utc on july 30 flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression after circulation became indistinguishable on satellite imagery twelve hours later system was declared a remnant area of low pressure at this time vortex was centered near northern coast of kauai preparations and impact thumb right tropical storm flossie over hawaii on july 29 upon entering central pacific ocean flossie prompted issuance of a tropical storm watch for hawaii and maui counties on july 27 this was upgraded to a tropical storm warning hours later while oahu was placed under a tropical storm watch due to threat of heavy rain forecast to reach in localized areas a flash flood watch was issued for all of hawaii valid between july 29 and 30 all maui county parks were closed due to storm as county authorities activated emergency operations along big island all courts and colleges were closed hawaii governor neil abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation three ports were closed including two on big island and one on maui under anticipation that flossie would become first tropical storm to make landfall in state since 1992 authorities opened 11 shelters across state including four on maui and seven on oahu in total 177 persons used these shelters a scheduled water outage in hanalei and waipa was postponed due to storm while still offshore flossie brought high surf to much of state upon passing narrowly by island gusty winds downed trees and power lines kahului reported a peak wind gust of during flossie more than 10 000 residences were without electricity across state with most outages concentrated in maui and big island heavy rains impacted several islands rainfall rates of an hour were recorded in haleakala along eastern side of maui a total of was reported in kaupo gap while a storm total peak of was observed on mount waialeale one man was injured in maui due to lightning damage from lightning across state amounted to 24 000 six vehicle accidents were reported and several roads required closure but overall damage from flossie was relatively minor see also
