behind it accompanied by a soundtrack of loud discordant buzzing noise masked figure holds up a hand with an irregularly blinking light film did not have any credits or claims to authorship messages many in commonly used ciphers and encryption systems have been found hidden in video and its sound spectrogram as well as images of tortured and mutilated people most of messages have been decoded by participants in an ongoing reddit thread and images sourced to notable murder investigations such as boston strangler they have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against united states although it has also been speculated that video is in reality a prank a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming film or video game or a student film after it first came to light in october it was found that it had been posted to youtube several months earlier along with a similarly threatening message in binary code poster of that video known as aetbx has suggested to inquiring journalists that gadgetzz is not telling truth about how it came to possess video internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in former zofiowka sanatorium outside otwock poland sometime between november 2013 and video s release three months after initial controversy an individual going by name of parker warner wright claimed to have created video he told daily dot that it was intended as an art project and released a sequel video 11b 3 1369 as a way of proving his identity he challenged viewers to create an exact duplicate of his plague doctor mask synopsis video begins with shaky footage showing a figure mostly concealed in shadow between two window sized openings in a brick wall through which leaves in trees can be seen blowing in wind these images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and hissing sounds figure holds their right hand to window signaling with three fingers then one and finally two figure remains in shadow with an insert showing it with cloaked arms spread as camera moves farther away and slowly circles to right after a jump cut lighting around figure improves revealing that figure is wearing an outfit that resembles a plague doctor costume a long dark long sleeved hooded cloak with its face masked by a long downward pointing dark leather beak and goggles figure holds up their right hand palm facing outward at shoulder height to reveal a blinking light in center of palm beeping noises appear on soundtrack in coordination with blinks figure eventually turns to its right to look at hand by this time leaves outside are still figure turns to look at camera now steady again briefly then back to its hand after a series of jump cuts in which they turn rapidly back and forth between two positions figure looks directly at camera and points to it a quick cut later costumed character is looking at camera again with hands at its sides after a few more jump cuts in which they turn to right and back again figure stands still then looks to its left slowly figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears then to their right as image seems to fragment briefly for remainder of video cloaked figure stands still with its back to wall with camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling image history on october 12 2015 john erik johny krahbichler founding editor of swedish tech blog gadgetzz posted about a creepy puzzle that had been sent to him via mail perhaps in june an envelope postmarked in warsaw and addressed to johny k care of site s post office box in helsingborg with no return address contained a really weird cd actually a dvd on it was written an alphanumeric string long enough to require two lines at first he assumed it was a product key he assumed it was some software someone had sent him to review he tested it out in a spare laptop and instead found video i was unsure what to think of it but i found it very odd he told washington post he said that he later reexamined it and started noticing codes and letters hidden all around video after making a minimal effort to decode it himself he gave up and posted about it to his blog complete with images of disc and envelope a few days later gizmodo ran a story on discovery lily hay newman of slate described experience of watching it for first time as creepy and unsettling likening it to experience of watching cursed videotape from 2002 film ring possible origins early investigations soon found that krahblicher was not first to make video public in may a user account identified as aetbx had posted it to youtube account s only post to site there it had been identified and described in binary code with a string of 0s and 1s as other users began commenting on it aetbx returned to ask why there was suddenly so much interest in his five month old posting some commenters speculated that he had in fact created it himself he vigorously denied it washington post contacted him by email he identified himself only as daniel from spain and said he had been sent video in mail as well his version he said was also sent to him via email from a girl he did not know who told him she found it on a park bench in an update to his original post krahblicher reported that someone found that even earlier than youtube posting it had been posted to paranormal board on 4chan later in daily dot he cast doubt on krahblicher s account saying anyone can fake a dvd two other leads on possible creators proved false around time krahblicher first posted about video blog of triton tv a student film group at university of california san diego posted a screenshot of video along with a title and description in binary reached for comment group said it no longer used that website and it had been hacked a few weeks earlier daily dot said image appeared to have been one of many posted by hacker at random a man named parker j wright replied to a reporter s query on twitter by saying he was not parker wright who had posted video to youtube on september 30 with note are you listening thumb left interior of zofiowka sanatorium similar to that used in video 2010 alt an empty room in an abandoned building with no finishes cement structural systems visible support columns in middle empty openings along a left brick wall through which a forest can be seen and cement blocks and tires piled on floor while identity of video creator remained unknown location at which it was filmed has been identified a polish internet user who was following story went to former zofiowka sanatorium near otwock a short distance south of warsaw one of rooms there had same fenestration and graffiti seen in video latter were not present in a photo of room taken in november 2013 suggesting video was made between then and april 2015 parker warner wright in late november after most of initial talk and speculation about video its creator and purpose had died down a twitter account was opened under name parker warner wright its owner claimed to have made video wright was not only person on internet actively claiming same thing at time and throughout last months of 2015 others posted their own videos in attempt to authenticate themselves at end of month wright announced that next video would be released in exactly 1 444 metric hours on his youtube channel at appointed time a new video titled 11b 3 1369 in black and white with occasional effects and inserts was published with their lies unlock our dissent underneath in description in it figure in plague doctor costume returned shown outside sanatorium in forest at first and later within soundtrack was quieter than that of first video and included some electronic tinkling noises which were synchronized with blinker on figure s hand later in video plague doctor figure is joined by a woman in a white dress with her face covered in bandages three weeks later daily dot published an interview with wright he told reporter mike wehner that he was a u s citizen who lives in poland and that videos were meant as an art project after finishing video in may 2015 he had left three copies two on discs in a subway and park in poland and last one posted to 4chan reporter mike wehner concluded thus that youtube user aetbx had no involvement in video s creation as a way of authenticating himself wright challenged visitors to his facebook page to replicate plague doctor mask which he claimed to have designed and built himself some commenters on wright s facebook page were skeptical of his claims pointing to differences in costume between two videos wright explained differences by saying he wanted and made a better cloak for second video krahbichler accepted wright s claims it would be too much of a hassle just to play along for this long and making up stories that fit so well he wrote shortly after second video was posted i believe it is very safe to say that is indeed creator in an early december exchange on facebook wright had told him he had chosen him as recipient since he had won business card lottery you handed me your business card at some point krahbichler speculated that wright had probably attended at least one of many tech shows where he had had a booth interpretations reddit users who responded to krahbichler s post found other coded messages hidden in video an encoded inscription on disc s menu was found to be 11b x 1371 which has been treated as video s title james billington of international business times wrote that some reported that video s audio sound ed like i would love to kill you being repeated over and over another user created a spectrogram of sound and found both text and images concealed within former had one in plaintext saying you are already dead rest were enciphered images depicted women being mutilated and tortured early fears that creator of video might be a serial killer were allayed when later research discovered that one of stills was from horror film bunny game one was from german film slasher and another was a picture of a victim of boston strangler most messages had a generally threatening tone a sound spectrogram of dvd s menu yielded a picture of a skull and more coded messages binary title of aetbx s youtube posting was muerte spanish for death and description similarly resolved to spanish text te queda 1 ano menos rendered in english as you have one less year triangle and square message near end of video was found to read ad homines in cipher latin for to attack or target men plague doctor costume led other readers to see video s threats as related to one message s plaintext read eagle infected will spread his disease we are antivirus will protect world body another read strike an arrow through heart of eagle year 1371 it was also suggested was one in which black death was ravaging europe single frame inserts were found to have morse code and other texts in common ciphers morse s plaintext was phrase red lips like tenth a sequence of 20 pairs of two digit characters was found to be latitude and longitude of white house in washington it was later noted that red lips phrase could be an intended anagram for kill president these were seen as a threat against united states in general and president barack obama in particular krahbichler reported that a cipher in video could be decoded to reveal message and that of message could be obama an african american krahbichler said that he believed that video contained a political message but was not a terrorist threat shortly after individual calling himself parker warner wright revealed himself as creator on twitter at end of november he said to those who had been working to decode texts you are no closer to understanding message however he allowed that it had been his intent that people work together to break codes not one individual could decipher whole possible purposes thumb right 175px a seventeenth century depiction of a plague doctor while video s was clearly threatening it remained too vague to draw any definitive conclusions about what makers intent might have been since it was publicized a few weeks before halloween there was speculation that it could be an internet prank related to holiday after initially being disturbed when threatening messages were decoded krahbichler said i m starting to think again it s just an elaborate joke however he did not think it was one aimed at him specifically since if sender knew me personally they would know i don t have expertise to crack it at least not whole thing other theory to gain support was that it was viral marketing to promote an upcoming movie or video game a redditor noted that film version of dan brown s novel inferno was beginning production at that time for a late 2016 release in story a rich villain makes a video warning of his plans to release a virus in order to reduce population growth in it he also wears a plague doctor costume likens himself to death and claims at same time to be cure moviepilot also reported on speculation that video was intended to promote upcoming season of syfy series 12 monkeys based on terry gilliam film of same name both concern a time traveler from future who is attempting to prevent outbreak of a devastating epidemic in present another redditor had observed that line you are already dead is used frequently in show as is a plague doctor costume he added that 3 1 2 signaled by figure s fingers at beginning of video could refer to show s upcoming third season video s polish origin further suggested a marketing gimmick according to one redditor from that country o ur fledgling video game studios don t have large budgets for standard advertisement s he wrote there had been a similarly creepy viral video in poland a few years ago he recalled that parodied a children s show he did not think same people were behind 11b x 1371 however as their clip s production values had been higher ultimately it seemed unlikely that any media company particularly major studios and television network making inferno and 12 monkeys would risk negative publicity that would come from using images in spectrograms and a suggested threat against a u s president another theory connected video to popular electronic musician skrillex in may when video had first been posted to internet he released a song called red lips shortly after krahbichler s original post he tweeted redlips redlips redlips it was speculated that it could be viral marketing for his work other musicians in that genre have been known to hide images in spectrograms or from some cds of unreleased work that he said had been stolen from his hotel room but if it was former possibility krahblicher noted problem is that hints towards works being promoted are fairly weak parker warner wright whom both krahblicher and daily dot believed to be creator of video said it and its sequel were first in a series of art projects he would not be specific on their themes or message i see my work as waves on ocean he told latter some people look for shells in it some surf others dive he had always intended for them to be a series regardless of whether they went viral or not currently there is a call for more and i aim to please he admitted however my art would move forward irrespective of external force i have a call from within i need to answer wright uploaded another video to his facebook page entitled on november 5 2016 three days prior to 2016 united states presidential election it features wright addressing a crowd while dressed like a military officer or dictator krahbichler theorized that video which he deemed very political might have a message related to election he also felt that date that wright posted video on his facebook page could be a reference to guy fawkes words remember remember 5th of november see also cicada 3301 identity claimed by a group about whom little else is
