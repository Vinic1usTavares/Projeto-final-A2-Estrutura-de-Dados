theobald of bec c 1090 18 april 1161 was a norman archbishop of canterbury from 1139 to 1161 his exact birth date is unknown some time in late 11th or early 12th century theobald became a monk at abbey of bec rising to position of abbot in 1137 king stephen of england chose him to be archbishop of canterbury in 1138 canterbury s claim to primacy over welsh ecclesiastics was resolved during theobald s term of office when pope eugene iii decided in 1148 in canterbury s favour theobald faced challenges to his authority from a subordinate bishop henry of blois bishop of winchester and king stephen s younger brother and his relationship with king stephen was turbulent on one occasion stephen forbade him from attending a papal council but theobald defied king which resulted in confiscation of his property and temporary exile theobald s relations with his cathedral clergy and monastic houses in his archdiocese were also difficult serving during disorders of stephen s reign theobald succeeded in forcing peace on king by refusing to consecrate stephen s son and heir eustace after eustace s death in 1153 stephen recognised his rival henry of anjou as his heir and later theobald was named regent of kingdom after stephen s death after a long illness theobald died in 1161 following which unsuccessful efforts were made to have him canonised as a saint theobald was patron of his successor thomas becket and a number of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks during his time as archbishop theobald augmented rights of his see or bishopric historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in historical record mainly because of fame of his successor early life family and background theobald s family was from area around near le bec in risle river valley barlow thomas becket p 11 modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop thomas becket as becket s family came from same part of normandy barlow thomas becket p 23 exact date of theobald s birth is unknown only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man saltman theobald pp 3 4 suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian his father was supposedly a knight but no contemporary reference gives his name barlow theobald oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest and later a bishop bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 401 theobald entered abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in late 11th or early 12th century while william was third abbot but as william was abbot from 1096 to 1124 that leaves a wide range of possible entry dates theobald was 266th monk admitted under william out of 346 historian saltman suggests that if admissions were spaced regularly throughout william s abbacy theobald would have become a monk in about 1117 but qualifies his estimate with statement that 1117 seems to be rather late life at bec in 1127 theobald was made prior of bec after boso succeeded william as abbot theobald became abbot in 1137 davis king stephen p 27 following boso s death in june 1136 monks of bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting archbishop of rouen hugh de who consequently threatened to void result bishop of evreux and brother of thurstan archbishop of york intervened with hugh and persuaded him to ratify election another problem then arose when hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from theobald which theobald refused to provide no previous abbot had made such a profession theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through intercession of peter venerable abbot of cluny allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh saltman theobald p 5 no documents survive from theobald s tenure as abbot nor is there any information on administration of monastery during his period of office except that 47 monks were admitted to bec while he was abbot theobald travelled to england on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy to supervise monastery s lands in england a trip that took place shortly before his selection as new archbishop of canterbury in 1138 saltman theobald p 6 appointment to canterbury in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen s own brother henry bishop of winchester who had helped stephen gain throne of england stephen feared that henry would be too powerful as archbishop and would attempt to control king barlow english church pp 94 97 election took place on 24 december stephen was present with papal legate alberic of ostia and a small group of barons and bishops but henry was absent overseeing ordination of deacons most historians consider that stephen arranged election s timing to ensure henry s absence henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen s concerns but also because waleran of meulan lay patron of bec was attempting to put his own man in one of most powerful positions in england waleran and his twin brother robert earl of leicester were henry s chief rivals for stephen s favour and henry disliked both of them intensely crouch reign of king stephen pp 91 92 although theobald was pious and well educated he had only become abbot year before and his election was probably influenced by reputation of his monastery which had already produced two archbishops of

england soon after his election theobald selected his brother walter to be archdeacon of canterbury and in 1148 promoted him to be bishop of rochester bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p

alexander s restoration to favour and nederman king stephen journal of medieval history pp 441 442 recently however that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that theobald took a more active role in council they base their view on a vita or life of 12th century mystic christina of markyate which narrates events and gives a more central role to theobald instead of henry of blois in challenging stephen s arrest of three bishops civil war theobald s actions in next few years are intertwined with history of stephen s ascension to throne following king henry i s death in 1135 succession was disputed between king s nephews stephen and his elder brother theobald ii count of champagne and henry s surviving legitimate child matilda usually known as empress matilda because of her first marriage to german emperor henry v king henry s only legitimate son william had died in 1120 after matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father who married her to geoffrey count of anjou all magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry s heir but when henry i died stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald ii or matilda could react norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy and theobald ii contented himself with his possessions in france but matilda was not resigned to loss and secured support of scottish king david her maternal uncle and in 1138 support of her half brother robert earl of gloucester an illegitimate son of henry i huscroft ruling england pp 71 73 after battle of lincoln in 1141 with stephen in captivity in bristol theobald did not immediately join empress he claimed that he needed to talk to stephen before switching his oath of fealty after consulting in person with stephen he secured permission to accept current conditions and then joined henry of blois who had switched sides at winchester in april for a legatine council held to depose stephen and crown matilda as queen attendance at council was sparse however and empress could not be crowned because she did not hold london davis king stephen p 52 after unsuccessful attempt to crown matilda those gathered at winchester had to flee before stephen s forces one of matilda s chief supporters her half brother robert of gloucester was captured during their flight theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments theobald then took a leading part in negotiations that led to exchange of robert for stephen which happened in november 1141 henry of blois having switched sides again then held another legatine council in westminster which reaffirmed stephen as king theobald ceremonially crowned stephen at canterbury during christmas court held there saltman theobald pp 17 18 matilda remained in england until 1148 disorders were at their peak between 1142 and 1148 but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned nor could stephen decisively defeat matilda s forces which meant that england remained divided in allegiance between two rivals but while matilda was in england her husband geoffrey was conquering normandy which he finally overran in 1144 huscroft ruling england pp 74 75 difficulties with henry of blois thumb 300px left a medieval plaque depicting henry of blois dating from around 1150 theobald s dealings with henry of blois bishop of winchester his suffragan bishop were strained because of henry s position as papal legate henry supported appointment of william fitzherbert as archbishop of york in 1141 which theobald opposed davis king stephen pp 101 103 although theobald spoke out against manner of election he took little active part in subsequent electoral disputes which resulted eventually in deposition of fitzherbert and his replacement at york by henry murdac saltman theobald pp 90 fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 6 york archbishops but in september 1143 henry s legatine powers lapsed when pope innocent ii who had made legatine appointment died celestine ii was elected on 26 september 1143 but he was an opponent of stephen and thus was not favourably inclined towards stephen s brother henry either to secure appointment as legate theobald travelled to rome in december 1143 arriving shortly before celestine s death on 8 march 1144 theobald was probably accompanied by nigel bishop of ely and roger de clinton bishop of coventry saltman theobald pp 19 22 before his death celestine forbade theobald to allow any change to be made in position of english crown since transfer of it had been justly denounced and matter was still under dispute quoted in davis king stephen p 62 this became papal policy and was a significant change from recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen s coronation in 1135 davis king stephen p 62 it essentially forbade theobald from crowning any successor to stephen especially while stephen was still alive saltman theobald p 37 after celestine s death theobald returned to england stopping at st denis abbey in paris to help abbot consecrate newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars theobald was only bishop present at ceremony whose diocese was not in france meanwhile henry of blois had arrived in rome and begun negotiations with new pope lucius ii over elevation of bishopric of winchester to an archbishopric it appears that lucius appointed a legate cardinal bishop of tusculum to travel to england and oversee project but lucius died before anything was accomplished disputes with stephen theobald was back in paris in may 1147 to meet with new pope eugene iii among issues probably discussed was theobald s dispute with bernard of st david s relations at this time between theobald and stephen seem to have been good saltman theobald p 24 but when eugene summoned english bishops to council of rheims in april 1148 king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated chichester hereford and norwich despite having been specifically refused permission theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat presumably accompanied by gilbert foliot who attended council with him barlow english church p 99 theobald had a number of reasons for defying king chiefly his obedience to pope s order commanding his attendance but also to keep papacy from favouring newly elected archbishop of york henry murdac in disputes between york and canterbury murdac was known to be close to his fellow cistercian eugene matthew king stephen pp 197 201 bethune bishop of hereford died during council and eugene nominated foliot as his successor at theobald s urging crouch reign of king stephen p 305 one of council s last acts was to suspend non attending bishops from their offices only english bishop specifically named was henry of blois but others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named henry of blois was singled out for special handling as papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by theobald eugene reserved to himself power to restore henry theobald appears to have reinstated most of bishops quickly as foliot wrote later in 1148 that only bishops of winchester durham worcester bath and exeter were still suspended theobald forgave bishops of exeter worcester and bath on 11 november 1148 according to later chronicler gervase of canterbury gervase also lists hilary of chichester as one of those forgiven by theobald on that date but as hilary attended council it is likely that this is an error durham may have been omitted because he was a suffragan bishop of archbishop of york and his reinstatement was in his archbishop s hands saltman theobald pp 26 27 king was angry with theobald for attending council even though archbishop intervened with eugene who was displeased with king for forbidding bishops attendance theobald persuaded eugene against excommunicating stephen asking pope to allow king to make amends for his behaviour but stephen was unimpressed with theobald s intercession he confiscated theobald s property and banished archbishop in september 1148 pope put england under interdict which was ignored except in canterbury at first theobald was in exile at st omer where he consecrated gilbert foliot as bishop of hereford saltman theobald p 28 he then returned to england and set himself up in framlingham which was held by hugh bigod an adherent of empress from there he conducted ecclesiastical business of england but theobald s presence in country posed a threat to stephen s authority and stephen quickly settled differences between two henry of blois had lost his legateship before celestine became pope but it was not until about 1150 that theobald was appointed legate by eugene iii perhaps owing to exhortations of bernard of clairvaux theobald held legatine powers in england until his death in 1161 in 1151 theobald held a legatine council in london barlow english church p 131 council was attended by king and eustace king s eldest son as well as other members of nobility council decreed eight canons or ecclesiastical statutes including ones condemning pillaging of church properties and imposition of financial levies on clergy another canon of council stated that bishops should no longer pursue violators of church property in royal courts but should use ecclesiastical courts instead other canons dealt with procedural matters arising from excommunications for abusing church property next year archbishop refused to crown eustace and was again exiled by stephen crouch normans p 273 who was attempting to secure succession for his son by imitating capetian dynasty of france which usually saw king s heir crowned during his father s lifetime although theobald claimed papal authority for refusal based on prohibition by celestine it was more probable that he and bishops had no desire to prolong civil war huscroft ruling england p 135 stephen demanded in april 1152 that theobald crown eustace but archbishop once again refused and went into exile in flanders theobald claimed that stephen had gained throne through perjury implying that if archbishop crowned eustace theobald would be perpetuating this crime english settlement history p 354 king and archbishop reached a truce in august in january 1153 henry of anjou matilda s son invaded england in pursuit of his claim to throne and with death of eustace in august 1153 stephen gave up theobald was instrumental in negotiations between henry and stephen that resulted in treaty of wallingford securing henry s succession to throne theobald was also present when henry of anjou met with stephen s second son william probably after eustace s death to settle william s lands and status after henry succeeded stephen amt accession of henry ii p 16 pope eugene iii forced stephen to reverse sentence of banishment and theobald returned to his see barlow english church pp 100 102 later it was mainly theobald and henry of blois who negotiated treaty ending civil war as neither stephen nor henry of anjou was interested in a compromise davis king stephen p 118 henry of blois and theobald who had previously found working together difficult managed to secure an end to disorders in england amt accession of henry ii p 13 under henry ii theobald was present at stephen s deathbed in october 1154 and stephen named him as regent until henry could take up crown crouch normans p 278 during six weeks before henry arrived archbishop had little difficulty in keeping peace amt accession of henry ii p 21 after henry s arrival theobald crowned henry and his wife eleanor of aquitaine on 19 december henry ii p and wallis house of lords p 73 at westminster abbey for most of remainder of theobald s life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese as well as attending royal court when henry was in england in january 1155 theobald helped to secure chancellorship for his protege thomas becket an action that barlow speculates happened because theobald hoped to secure more influence with king through becket if this was his hope barlow notes that it did not materialise although king and archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted both appear to have wished to minimise disputes and were willing to compromise to secure good relations as an example when pope adrian iv died in september 1159 two rival claimants for papal throne emerged king henry following custom of his grandfather henry i forbade bishops from recognising either claimant saltman theobald pp 41 45 eventually after henry weighed political factors he recognised pope alexander iii and it was only then that theobald also recognised alexander as pope saltman theobald pp 51 52 however not everything was always harmonious between king and archbishop in 1156 theobald supported efforts of osbert de bayeux who was accused of poisoning william archbishop of york to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in royal court crime had taken place during stephen s reign but stephen s death had prevented osbert from being tried in 1154 delay allowed shifting of trial to church courts which henry opposed although theobald s position displeased king no open rupture ensued alexander becket controversy journal of british studies pp 2 4 theobald himself admitted to papacy in 1154 that english custom was to try clergy for crimes in secular courts alexander becket controversy journal of british studies p 12 theobald called a church council at london in june 1160 which dealt partly with issues of papal schism his health was poor and he had to be taken to council in a litter a further cause of distress to theobald was what he saw as ingratitude of becket who did not visit ailing archbishop relations with his cathedral clergy theobald s cathedral chapter was composed of monks and he was considered abbot of monastery of christ church cathedral because of his episcopal duties regular running of cathedral was responsibility of prior at time of theobald s election there were about 140 monks in chapter and they seem to have expected that theobald being a monk himself would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs theobald began well sending a party of monks from cathedral to st martin s priory at dover which had been settled with canons instead of monks theobald replaced canons with monks theobald also refounded a collegiate church at south malling near lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter patriarchy and patrimony foundations of medieval english history p 78 theobald worked with his first prior jeremiah to eliminate clerical marriage in diocese but jeremiah had been elected during vacancy before theobald s election and monks had not secured papal permission for election of a new prior so eventually theobald decided to remove jeremiah and install his own choice as prior jeremiah appealed to papacy but theobald deposed him while appeal was ongoing and appointed walter durdent as prior innocent ii however appointed henry of blois to hear case and henry sided with jeremiah and ordered jeremiah s reinstatement theobald then refused to perform any services in cathedral until jeremiah was removed by chapter lack of services would have deprived monks of income and theobald s threat had desired effect as jeremiah resigned his office and left christ church for st augustine s abbey canterbury durdent was reinstalled as prior and remained in that position until he became bishop of coventry in october 1149 saltman theobald pp 56 59 at easter 1151 theobald took over management of chapter s estates as new prior walter parvus was not up to task at first there were no disputes but soon monks felt that theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty and asked that stewardship of estates be restored to parvus theobald refused and monks attempted to appeal to papacy their envoys however were caught by agents of archbishop and appeal went nowhere theobald then deposed parvus and appointed a new prior theobald s relations with monks after this point seem to have been without incident saltman theobald pp 59 62 relations with other monastic houses upright 220px left ruins of st augustine s abbey with canterbury cathedral behind thumb theobald also had a dispute with st augustine s abbey over right of archbishop to receive annual payments and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by archbishop which would have been uncanonical or were for other reasons dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which st augustine s continued to make payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments saltman theobald pp 66 69 another dispute with st augustine s concerned right of archbishops to have a say in election of new abbots and whether or not abbots would make a profession of obedience to archbishops this was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing abbots to profess obedience saltman theobald pp 73 75 conflict re surfaced in 1149 when some of monks of st augustine s led by their prior and sacrist refused to obey interdict placed on england by theobald and pope eugene iii theobald had two officials excommunicated and publicly flogged when previous abbot of st augustine s died in 1151 prior silvester paid king for right to administer abbey and to hold a free election for a new abbot monks then proceeded to elect silvester as new abbot but theobald refused to confirm election accusing silvester of buying office eventually however pope eugene iii ordered theobald to allow silvester to take up office which theobald did in august 1152 theobald and st augustine s also came into conflict over abbey s claims of exemption from archbishops oversight because it owed obedience directly to pope papal documents held at rome backed abbey but there were no english royal charters that gave abbey its liberty from archbishops theobald attempted to end confusion by legal actions both at rome and in england but record was mixed documents at rome clearly favoured abbey but at a royal council held at northampton in 1157 henry ii ruled in favour of theobald as part of settlement silvester as abbot was required to make a formal profession of obedience to theobald something he had been attempting to avoid since his election hayward some reflections historical research p 157 struggle with silvester was just one event in long history of dispute between canterbury and st augustine s knowles monastic order p 588 as well as st augustine s abbots of a number of other monasteries in diocese of canterbury are known to have professed obedience to theobald as documents recording events survive not only abbots and priors from within canterbury but some from other dioceses swore to obey theobald although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead most of these exceptions occurred because monastic house claimed exemption from oversight of their diocesan bishop and had a tradition of making those oaths to canterbury instead besides these events theobald also intervened in elections of some abbots although not always successfully he attempted to secure right of gilbert foliot to remain abbot of gloucester after foliot s election as bishop of hereford but a new abbot was elected by monks of gloucester theobald was more successful in securing election of william who had previously been a monk at christ church to be abbot of evesham over objections of some of monks of evesham saltman theobald pp 81 85 theobald also became embroiled in dispute between hilary bishop of chichester and walter de lucy abbot of battle abbey over hilary s claims to jurisdiction over abbey and abbey s counter claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision abbey had never received a papal exemption but relied instead on its royal foundation by king william i of england and its status as an or proprietary church of king warren henry ii pp 429 432 under king stephen abbey s claims prevailed but after stephen s death hilary excommunicated abbot who appealed to papacy theobald supported bishop who eventually secured a trial before king henry ii it was a minor setback for theobald when case was eventually decided in battle s favour mainly on basis of charters that were thought at time to be genuine but modern historians have come to believe were forged searle battle abbey english historical review pp 449 480 relations with other bishops theobald was instrumental in securing subordination of welsh bishoprics to canterbury his first act in this area was consecration of meurig as bishop of bangor in 1140 during which meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to canterbury bernard bishop of st david s contested theobald s right to consecrate meurig and instead asserted that st david s should be considered an archbishopric and that bernard should receive a pallium this went against last half century of precedent that canterbury had jurisdiction over four welsh sees a precedent that dated back to anselm s days when anselm had consecrated urban as bishop of llandaff in 1107 also in 1140 theobald consecrated uhtred as bishop of llandaff with uhtred also swearing to obey theobald likewise when theobald consecrated gilbert as bishop of st asaph in 1142 a similar profession of obedience was made saltman theobald pp 92 94 along with these consecrations theobald s legal efforts enabled him to withstand attempts of bernard to turn st david s into an archbishopric and when bernard was succeeded by david fitzgerald in 1148 theobald secured new bishop s profession of obedience to canterbury thus ending efforts to remove wales from canterbury s jurisdiction also in 1148 pope eugene decided in favour of canterbury and against claims of st david s securing canterbury s jurisdiction over wales duggan from conquest to death of john english church and papacy pp 101 102 theobald even maintained theoretical claim of canterbury to jurisdiction over irish sees by consecrating patrick as bishop of limerick in 1140 saltman theobald p 95 that however was last assertion of claim as in 1152 papal legate giovanni paparo reorganised irish dioceses and settled issue by appointing archbishop of armagh primate of ireland relations with bishops in england remained good with little activity in long running canterbury york dispute over primacy of britain theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see s primacy from celestine ii in 1143 1144 but at council of reims in 1148 eugene clarified that this primacy did not affect claims of york to be independent of canterbury because of unsettled election disputes during 1140s over see of york when it was contested between william of york and henry murdac theobald faced little challenge from either william or murdac as to traditional dispute between canterbury and york when william of york died in 1154 theobald secured york for his protege roger de pont l eveque further peace between two
