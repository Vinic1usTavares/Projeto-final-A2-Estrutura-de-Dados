columbia county and union township and north union township in schuylkill county named tributaries of creek include stony run and trexler run creek has some alkalinity and is slightly acidic main rock formations in watershed of it are mauch chunk formation pocono formation and pottsville formation a number of other rock formations occur in small areas of watershed as well main soils in watershed are leck kill soil and hazleton soil watershed of little catawissa creek has an area of a number of bridges cross creek there are a number of major roads in watershed of creek and most of creek is within several hundred meters of a road creek is a high quality coldwater fishery and class a wild trout waters in some places in other places it is a coldwater fishery and class d wild trout waters there are many species of fish inhabiting creek including brook trout brown trout and others creek has been surveyed at least nine times by pennsylvania fish and boat commission course thumb left little catawissa creek looking downstream immediately below mouth of stony run little catawissa creek begins in a narrow valley in conyngham township it flows east for a few miles in valley flowing roughly parallel to aristes ringtown road creek eventually exits conyngham township and columbia county upon exiting columbia county little catawissa creek enters union township schuylkill county it continues east and its valley becomes narrower and shallower over next several miles creek turns east northeast and its valley gets broader again it then turns abruptly north and passes through a ridge creek briefly turns northeast before turning north northeast after a few hundred feet approximately a mile downstream it receives its first named tributary trexler run at this point creek turns abruptly east northeast after some distance it begins meandering northeast for a few miles receiving tributary stony run it then begins meandering east for a few miles briefly entering north union township schuylkill county before reentering east union township shortly afterwards creek turns north northeast crosses into north union township again a few tenths of a mile downstream it reaches its

pennsylvania fish and boat commission between t431 upstream of mouth and t435 upstream of mouth a reservoir known as ringtown reservoir is on an unnamed tributary of little catawissa creek history and etymology thumb left sign for schuylkill county bridge no 95 over little catawissa creek little catawissa creek is named for fact that it is smaller than catawissa creek little catawissa creek was historically stocked with trout from near border between columbia county and schuylkill county downstream to mouth of creek creek was surveyed by pennsylvania fish and boat commission nine times between 1939 and 1985 first survey was performed in 1936 this was first time that creek was recommended for trout stocking creek was also surveyed by pennsylvania fish and boat commission several times in 1950s 1960s 1970s and 1980s a number of bridges have been built over little catawissa creek a steel stringer bridge was built over creek in 1914 and restored in 1939 this bridge is long

ringtown in 1853 little catawissa creek was used as an emergency water supply in early 1900s biology little catawissa creek is considered by pennsylvania department of environmental protection to be a high quality coldwater fishery between its headwaters and reservoir road between reservoir road and mouth of creek it is considered to be a coldwater fishery upper reaches of creek between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters schuylkill county are considered by pennsylvania fish and boat commission to be class a wild trout waters and rest of creek s length is considered to be approved trout waters upper reaches of creek were class a wild trout waters in 1976 before becoming class d wild trout waters in 1984 this change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup however creek rebounded to class a wild trout waters by 1997 creek is considered to be class d wild trout waters between t431 and t435 tributary trexler run is also considered to be class a wild trout waters throughout its length wild brook trout naturally reproduce in little catawissa creek however introducing rainbow trout into creek is forbidden although they were historically stocked there by pennsylvania fish and boat commission river chubs were historically present in creek but have disappeared reason for this disappearance is unknown between headwaters of little catawissa creek and upstream of its mouth at t431 there are three species of fish brook trout creek chub and eastern blacknose dace white suckers were also observed in this part of creek in 1976 there are twelve species of fish in creek between t431 and t435 including brook trout brown trout and green sunfish additionally numerous more have been historically observed in this stretch of creek but are not any more eight fish species including brown trout were observed on creek between t435 and its mouth during a 1976 survey brown trout ranged from biomass of wild trout in little catawissa creek upstream of t431 is this includes of brook trout that are less than long and of brook trout that are more than long trout in this part of creek range from biomass of wild trout in creek between t431 and is kilograms per hectare come from brown trout including from brown trout shorter than and from brown trout longer than 175 millimeters and come from brook trout over long brown trout range from long and brook trout range from long between headwaters of little catawissa creek and t431 there are 799 brook trout per square kilometer that are shorter than 175 millimeters and 23 per kilometer that are longer there are brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 millimeters long and 88 that are more than 175 millimeters long in creek between t431 and t435 there is one brook trout per kilometer that is less than 175 millimeters long and one per kilometer that is more than 175 millimeters long on other hand there are 197 brown trout per kilometer less than 175 millimeters long and 25 per kilometer that are more than 175 millimeters long there is one brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 millimeters long and one that is more than 175 millimeters long there are 230 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 millimeters long and 31 that are more than 175 millimeters long a 1997 report stated that little catawissa creek was a poor site for angling little catawissa
