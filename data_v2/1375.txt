them detroit red wings in a best of three series two games to none in march 1979 fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise leading scorer tom lysiak and four players to chicago black hawks for three players led by defenseman phil russell fletcher hoped addition of russell would help his team achieve playoff success buoyed by a franchise record ten game winning streak in

1973 74 but fell to 12 258 three years later and then 10 500 in 1977 78 concerns that low attendance could result in relocation of team surfaced by 1976 prompting politicians and players themselves to purchase tickets in a bid to stabilize franchise flames attempted to boost attendance in 1980 by signing jim craig goaltender of american olympic team that had won olympic gold medal following its miracle on ice victory over soviet union it was not successful as attendance fell to an average of 10 024 adding to flames financial woes was fact that omni coliseum was one of last major arenas in north america to be built without revenue generating luxury suites which led fletcher to describe facility as being out of date when it opened cousins announced he was seeking to sell club following flames exit from playoffs their final game a 5 2 loss against new york rangers was played in atlanta on april 12 1980 he claimed to have suffered significant financial losses on team while low
