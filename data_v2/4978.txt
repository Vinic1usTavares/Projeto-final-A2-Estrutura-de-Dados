yellowstone fires of 1988 collectively formed largest wildfire in recorded history of yellowstone national park in united states starting as many smaller individual fires flames quickly spread out of control due to drought conditions and increasing winds combining into one large conflagration which burned for several months fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and on september 8 1988 entire park closed to all non emergency personnel for first time in its history only arrival of cool and moist weather in late autumn brought fires to an end a total of or 36 percent of park was affected by wildfires thousands of firefighters fought fires assisted by dozens of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft which were used for water and fire retardant drops at peak of effort more than 9 000 firefighters were assigned to park with fires raging throughout greater yellowstone ecosystem and other areas in western united states staffing levels of national park service and other land management agencies were inadequate for situation more than 4 000 u s military personnel were soon brought in to assist in wildfire suppression efforts firefighting effort cost 120 million in losses to structures were minimized by concentrating firefighting efforts near major visitor areas keeping property damage down to 3 million as of no firefighters died while fighting yellowstone fires though there were two fire related deaths outside park before late 1960s fires were generally believed to be detrimental for parks and forests and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible however as beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in decades before 1988 a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions which proved highly successful in reducing area lost annually to wildfires in contrast in 1988 yellowstone was overdue for a large fire and in exceptionally dry summer many smaller controlled fires combined fires burned discontinuously leaping from one patch to another leaving intervening areas untouched intense fires swept through some regions burning everything in their paths tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by wildfires and some regions were left looking blackened and dead however more than half of affected areas were burned by ground fires which did less damage to hardier tree species not long after fires ended plant and tree species quickly reestablished themselves and natural plant regeneration has been highly successful yellowstone fires of 1988 were unprecedented in history of national park service and many questioned existing fire management policies media accounts of mismanagement were often sensational and inaccurate sometimes wrongly reporting or implying that most of park was being destroyed while there were temporary declines in air quality during fires no adverse long term health effects have been recorded in ecosystem and contrary to initial reports few large mammals were killed by fires though there has been a reduction in number of moose which has yet to rebound fire management policy development in united states thumb 1953 a firefighter hikes to a distant fire in eastern united states with its significant rainfall wildfires are relatively small and have rarely posed great risk to life and property as white settlements moved further west into drier areas first large scale fires were encountered range fires on great plains and forest fires in rocky mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever been seen in east a number of catastrophic fire events over years greatly influenced fire management policies worst loss of life in united states history due to a wildfire occurred in 1871 when peshtigo fire swept through wisconsin killing more than 1 500 people santiago canyon fire of 1889 in california and especially great fire of 1910 in montana and idaho contributed to philosophy that fire was a danger that needed to be suppressed great fire of 1910 burned destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression u s government land agencies including national park service generally followed fire management policies established by u s forest service which oversees majority of nation s before middle of 20th century most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times by 1935 u s forest service s fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 a m morning after they were first spotted firefighting crews were established throughout public lands and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons by 1940 firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations by beginning of world war ii more than 8 000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in united states though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting three are still used each year in yellowstone firefighting efforts were highly successful with area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of during 1930s to between and by 1960s need for lumber during world war ii was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable in 1944 u s forest service developed an ad campaign to help educate public that all fires were detrimental using a cartoon black bear named smokey bear this iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with catchphrase only you can prevent forest fires early posters of smokey bear misled public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human caused in yellowstone human caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning some researchers as well as some timber companies and private citizens understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems fire would help clean out understory and dead plant matter allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients native americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk as early as 1924 environmentalist aldo leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems and were necessary for natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species over next 40 years increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about benefits of wildfire to ecosystems in 1963 a group of ecologists consulted by national park service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore environmental balance in parks wilderness act of 1964 helped to address role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems by 1968 national park service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes service determined that fires that started naturally by lightning would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property service also decreed that under prescribed conditions controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn from 1972 national park service began allowing natural fires in yellowstone to burn under controlled conditions fires of this type were referred to as prescribed natural fires between 1972 and 1987 a total of 235 prescribed natural fires burned a relatively small under directives of new policy of these only 15 spread to more than five years prior to 1988 were much wetter than normal and this may have reduced area of fires during that period prescribed natural fire policy appeared to be an effective way to manage fires especially in yellowstone region contributing factors to fires thumb 1965 typical yellowstone lodgepole pine forest formal fire record keeping in yellowstone began in 1931 when heart lake fire burned despite its small extent it was largest fire in period from when park was created until 1988 research indicates that only two or three large fires occur on yellowstone plateau every 1 000 years previous major yellowstone fire was in early to mid 18th century well before arrival of white explorers yellowstone forests are dominated by lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100 years as a forest matures in yellowstone a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established lodgepole pines found throughout yellowstone plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur they are not found in large stands as in other forests in rocky mountains by 1980s much of lodgepole pine forests in yellowstone were between 200 and 250 years old and approaching end of their life cycle mountain pine beetle killed a number of trees in greater yellowstone ecosystem from late 1960s through mid 1980s this created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages this mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels that contributed to fires in addition winter season of 1987 1988 was drier than usual with greater yellowstone ecosystem receiving only 31 of normal snowpack however april and may 1988 were very wet and abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development by june rainfall stopped and little was recorded in entire greater yellowstone ecosystem for next four months by july worst drought in history of yellowstone national park began grasses and plants which grew well in early summer soon turned to dry tinder relative humidity levels fell further desiccating forest fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5 by mid august humidity levels were averaging below 20 and were recorded as low as 6 on one occasion to compound lack of rainfall majority of yellowstone s soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention a series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to rapid spread of a number of largest fires accumulated fuel old forests and unabated and exceptionally dry conditions spelled trouble for yellowstone however foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire season for greater yellowstone ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for july history provided little evidence to suggest that 1988 would be any different from previous 100 plus years park had existed but as major fires started to break out throughout rocky mountain region media began to take notice twenty small fires started in yellowstone by july and of those eleven went out on their own remainder were closely monitored in accordance with prescribed natural fire policies by july 15 fires throughout entire greater yellowstone ecosystem had burned and though this was not out of ordinary media focus on fires raging throughout american west influenced decision by park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on july 15 within a week after suppression efforts commenced fires had spread to include almost on parkland alone major fires in yellowstone in 1988 almost 250 different fires started in yellowstone and surrounding national forests between june and august seven of them were responsible for 95 of total burned area at end of july national park service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel and yet fires continued to expand smaller fires burned into each other propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain on august 20 single worst day of fires and later dubbed black saturday more than were consumed during one of many intense fires ash from fires throughout park drifted as far away as billings montana to northeast wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines and burning embers started new fires a mile 1 6 km or more ahead of main fires ground fires raced fuel ladder to forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over high on that single day more yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since establishment of park throughout summer fires made huge advances of a day and there were even occasions when more than in one hour were recorded one large group of fires was known as snake river complex these fires were in southern section of park in headwaters region of yellowstone and snake rivers largest fire in group was shoshone fire which was started by lightning on june 23 prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire it with little movement for several weeks then rapidly started expanding towards northeast on july 20 red fire started near lewis lake on july 1 and like shoshone fire advanced little for several weeks fire then moved northeast on july 19 and combined with shoshone fire in august as these two fires advanced towards grant village area evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection in midst of a large lodgepole pine forest grant village complex was first major tourist area impacted that season a number of small structures and some of campground complex were destroyed after red and shoshone fires combined they were referred to as shoshone fire since it was much larger mink fire started in bridger teton national forest from lightning on july 11 and burned north following yellowstone river valley after firefighters forced fire away from private lands mink fire eventually burned sections inside park after july 23 but was deemed to be a low risk since it was in a very remote section of park third largest fire was huck fire which started after a tree fell on a power line on august 20 near flagg ranch this fire burned primarily in john d rockefeller jr memorial parkway crossing yellowstone s southern border on august 30 snake river complex of fires burned more than before they were extinguished by wet weather in fall one of most striking events of this fire complex occurred on august 23 when intense fires swept across lewis river canyon propelled by winds of and gusting to mist fire started on july 9 in eastern section of park in absaroka mountains two days later clover fire started in same region and both fires combined and were renamed as clover mist fire on july 20 burning in rugged terrain this fire was very difficult to fight and on august 20 fire advanced from south towards small town of cooke city montana and continued to threaten town for several more weeks clover mist fire eventually consumed more than storm creek fire started on june 14 well north of park in absaroka beartooth wilderness and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to yellowstone then on august 20 fire moved rapidly to south also threatening town of cooke city this time from north an effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve fires of almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought fires to within a hundred yards of parts of town forcing evacuations on september 6 other major fire located in northern section of park was fire started in gallatin national forest on august 15 from embers from an unattended campfire fire initially moved north but then turned around a few days later and moved south threatening area near tower junction in northwest fan fire started on june 25 and was originally considered a threat to town of gardiner montana just outside park s north entrance it was most successfully fought of all 1988 fires though fire was not contained for a couple of months by mid august it was no longer considered a threat to lives and property largest fire in park was north fork fire both in terms of damage to structures and of area burned fire started on july 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in caribou national forest just outside park s western border north fork fire was only major fire that was fought from beginning since it started after prescribed fire policy was halted on july 15 fire spread towards northeast and by end of first week of august was threatening madison junction and nearby campground facilities fire then raced towards norris junction on august 20 firefighters there used water and foam to keep structures from being consumed by blaze fire continued its eastward advance along yellowstone plateau and on august 25 reached visitor facilities at canyon where land management agencies and u s military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures eastern flank of fire calmed down for several days then down sloping winds off yellowstone plateau forced flames along west side of fire towards town of west yellowstone montana there private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both town and an electrical power substation fire burned a substantial section of forest along madison river valley between september 5 and 7 a dry front pushed flames along southern section of north fork fire towards large old faithful visitor complex adjacent to upper geyser basin all non emergency personnel were ordered to be evacuated however political issues influenced national park service management directives and complex was not completely closed to incoming tourists with some visitors still arriving at old faithful not long before intense fire hit by mid afternoon an all out aerial bombardment with air tankers dropping fire retardant failed firefighters concentrated on structure protection especially those of historical significance such as old faithful inn using fire engines and portable water pumping systems to keep roofs and other surfaces of structures wet 1 200 firefighters including 120 military personnel dug fire lines and cleared away brush near structures winds crested up to as fire approached from west fires spread to forested sections near to but generally away from major structures but 19 small structures were destroyed and there was also extensive damage to an old dormitory fire was so intense that vehicles left near fire had their wheels melted windshields shattered and paint scorched though most of old faithful complex had been spared park service decided that for first time entire park would be closed to non emergency personnel on september 8 night of 9th and morning of september 10 north fork fire jumped a fireline along its northeastern flank and approached mammoth hot springs where a large concentration of historical structures as well as park headquarters is located rain and snow arrived in time to slow fires before they threatened complex by time north fork fire finally died down it was responsible for 60 of burned area within park more than colder weather bringing with it rain and snow on september 11 calmed fires down substantially throughout greater yellowstone ecosystem though fires continued to burn well into middle of november they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property many fire crews were sent home but additional manpower continued to arrive at yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by firefighting efforts hundreds of miles of firelines helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings finally on november 18 all fires in yellowstone were officially declared out fighting fires thumb firefighters on fireline near mammoth hot springs september 10 1988 1988 was a big year for wildfires in western united states with more than 72 000 fires reported during year including 300 rated as major firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to limit and consequently more than 6 000 u s military personnel assisted in fire fighting efforts nationwide with more than 600 assigned to yellowstone at height of fires more than 9 000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to yellowstone at one time and by time fires finally went out more than 25 000 had been involved in fire suppression efforts crews would normally work for two to three weeks be sent home and then return for one or two more tours of duty normal workday was as long as 14 hours assignments included digging firelines watering down buildings clearing undergrowth near structures and installing water pumps hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews as much of firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures no firefighters died in park as a result of fires but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside park a number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with more common complaints being fatigue headaches and smoke inhalation a few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area firefighters created of fireline by hand and with mechanized equipment such as bulldozers most of bulldozer work was done on north fork fire some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for safe operation of heavy equipment and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of impact they have on surface features additionally thin unstable ground near park s geothermal features could not be trusted to support weight of heavy equipment bulldozers are rarely used on fires in u s national parks some 120 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft were used to combat inferno aircraft logged more than 18 000 hours of flight time and dropped of fire retardant and of water on fires more than 100 fire engines were assigned to fire structural fire engines were used in building complexes where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings smaller wildland fire engines suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout park 120 million was spent fighting fires while structural losses were estimated at 3 million later analysis has shown that aside from concentrated fire suppression efforts near major tourist facilities firefighting work failed to stop what was likely an unstoppable force 2014 n w t fire season report what you need to know impacts on park vegetation and wildlife thumb in this 2006 image dead snags still stand almost 20 years after fires but lodgepole pines are thriving in understory thumb year after fires and for a number of years afterwards wildflowers were abundant in burned areas thumb a bull elk in a recently burned area fires in yellowstone left a mosaic of areas greatly affected and others less so inside fire perimeters large expanses of forest were completely untouched there were three major types of burning from an aesthetic viewpoint most destructive fires were canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests crown fires accounted for about 41 percent of all area that burned mixed fires burned both canopy and vegetation on ground or burned one or other as they spread through forest ground fires spread slowly along ground consuming smaller plants and dead plant material some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity contributing to loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned recovery from fires began almost immediately with plants such as appearing in a matter of days after a fire had passed while surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane regeneration in yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted though some small plants did not immediately re assume their pre fire habitats most did and vast majority of plants from existing sprouts which survived heat from fires there was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas especially between two and five years after fires seeds had little distance to travel even in severely burned areas much of most badly burned forest was within of less affected areas still most regeneration of plants and trees came from immediate sources either above or below ground lodgepole pines generally do not disperse their seeds more than so seed dispersal from less burned parts apparently had little effect on more severely burned areas in regions that did experience complete average depth of charred soil was only about half an inch 14 mm so few roots even of grasses were killed by fire this allowed rapid regeneration throughout ecosystem predominant tree in yellowstone lodgepole pine fared poorly from fires except in areas where heat and flames were very mild lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire research of test plots established after fires indicated that best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns regions with crown fires sometimes had highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5 years however rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less stands of dead lodgepole killed by fires may persist for decades rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife aspen became more widespread after fires occupying areas that had been dominated by conifers it had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal however aspen sprouts appeared two years after fires as far as from nearest known aspen trees aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk and many of newer aspen are consequently small except in areas that are harder for elk to get to resurgence of aspen after fires was a contrast to pre fire events as aspen had been increasingly scarce in park this might be a temporary event as conifers continue to grow and eventually crowd out other tree species contrary to media reports and speculation at time fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk of an estimated 40 000 50 000 36 mule deer 12 moose 6 black bears and 9 bison had perished of 21 grizzlies that were radio collared and had home ranges where fires happened only one was believed to have been lost grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas following year feeding on proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all dead wood moose had been declining in northern sections of park since 1960s but decline became more obvious after fires unlike elk which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses moose are more likely to be browsers consuming primarily woody food sources particularly willow and subalpine fir which were temporarily reduced by fires all ungulates experienced a high initial mortality winter after fires but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than fires themselves however moose populations unlike other ungulates have not rebounded in subsequent years rodents likely experienced highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape but also because of reduction in forest cover allowing would be predators less difficulty in spotting them approximately 100 dead fish were reported in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them aside from a temporary decrease in a few species of aquatic insects no long term impact has been observed on aquatic life in any of yellowstone s rivers or lakes air and water thumb smoky conditions obscured absaroka mountains smoke and airborne particulates from fires posed a threat to local communities on several occasions smoke and particulates were especially high in gardiner montana there monitoring stations maintained by montana department of health and environmental sciences and park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded this was also case near fires and on 7 occasions at mammoth montana location of park headquarters in no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous a number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of geothermal areas in aftermath of fires erosion was a particular concern especially as rains were heavy following year helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on fires and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped water level temporarily stream flow was also affected by water pumping operations more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate based fire retardant material polluted some streams but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires they are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by spring of 1989 structure damage thumb firefighters sprayed foam on structures in mammoth hot springs complex on september 10 1988 park service gave priority to life and property in their efforts to suppress fires of more than 1 000 structures located in park only 67 were destroyed there were 400 structures in old faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace major tourist locations in park such as one at old faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment especially at times of immediate danger fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non critical personnel at least once during fires of 38 backcountry patrol cabins used by park rangers and park staff only one lost to fires was at sportsman lake and it was rebuilt following summer however fires did a lot of damage to numerous campgrounds backcountry bridges and of power lines and 300 utility poles some of boardwalks used to keep tourists elevated above geothermal areas were also destroyed but were quickly replaced media coverage thumb news crews were required to wear nomex firefighting clothing whenever they were near fires since yellowstone is one of most famous national parks in world news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to media national park service received some 3 000 media requests not all of which two park public information officers were able to grant even with assistance of a staff of more than 40 employees 16 more park personnel were assigned role of liaisons with media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated by time fires were under control in mid november park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily media coverage of fires brought national park service more national attention than it had ever received and 1988 fire season has been called one of most important events in history of that agency lack of understanding of wildfire management by media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies some news agencies gave impression that most of park was being destroyed on august 30 an abc news interview with stanley mott apparently a tourist incorrectly identified him as director of national park service william mott in another story new york times stated that park service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out whereas that of u s forest service was to suppress all such fires a of policies of both agencies media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies sources quoted by washington post usa today and chicago tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated and one source commented that a september 8 1988 report by chicago tribune had more errors than facts on same day washington post associated smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with 1968 events in da nang vietnam giving impression of catastrophe fires had been very active in late july in early august fire managers reached a conclusion that fires would not likely expand much further due to a lack of fuel and director of national park service declared on august 11 that fires were contained when this optimistic announcement was followed by black saturday on august 20 and fire that threatened old faithful complex in early september media were again highly critical of park service and their policies fire management since 1988 as a result of research conducted after fires a new fire management plan for yellowstone was implemented in 1992 plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires increased staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations and allocated greater funding for fire management by 2004 further amendments to wildland fire management plan were added according to 2004 plan natural wildfires are allowed to burn so long as parameters regarding fire size weather and potential danger are not exceeded those fires that do exceed standards as well as all human caused fires are to be suppressed these changes are primarily updates of 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance increased fire monitoring through ground based and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed fire monitors first determine whether a fire is human caused or natural all human caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural while natural fires are monitored fire monitors map fire perimeter record local weather and examine types of fuels burning and amount of fuel available additionally they investigate rate of spread flame lengths fuel moisture content and other characteristics of each fire monitors relay information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions land management employees remove dead and hazardous fuels from areas as prioritized by hazard fuels reduction plan this is to ensure fires have less opportunity to threaten lives historical structures and visitor facilities as of 2007 fuel is reduced within 400 feet 120 m of structures and other high priority locations foresters and ecologists argue that large controlled burns in yellowstone prior to fires would not have greatly reduced area that was consumed in 1988 controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if they were allowed to burn with intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration consequently natural fires rather than controlled burns are park s primary maintenance tool since late 1970s some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out in rare circumstances natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed greater cooperation between federal and state agencies on a national level has been coordinated through national interagency fire center though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions as in 1988 fires protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts most important lesson learned is that a number of ecosystems including one that contains yellowstone are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires this was widely thought to be case well before 1988 and wildfires of that year drove conclusion home while large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities they are mandatory in a region such as greater yellowstone ecosystem if it is to be maintained in a natural manner notes references further reading external links this is a
