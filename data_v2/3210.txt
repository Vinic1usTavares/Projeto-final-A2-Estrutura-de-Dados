and thus lacks depth perception he says his art style is really a result of his deficiencies his is a style of labored simplicity with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing

legacy maus looms large not only over spiegelman s body of work but over comics medium itself while spiegelman was far from first to do autobiography in comics critics such as james campbell considered maus work that popularized it bestseller has been widely written about in popular press and academia quantity of its critical literature far that of any other work of comics it has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints though most often by those with little understanding of maus context in history of comics while maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into world of high art in public imagination criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture roots that spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote spiegelman s belief that comics are best expressed in a diagrammatic or iconic manner has had a particular influence on such as chris ware and his former student scott
