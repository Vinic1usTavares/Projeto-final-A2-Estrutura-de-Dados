notorious byrd brothers is fifth album by american rock band byrds and was released in january 1968 on columbia records album represents pinnacle of byrds late 60 s musical experimentation with band blending together elements of psychedelia folk rock country electronic music baroque pop and jazz with producer gary usher they made extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques including phasing flanging and spatial panning byrds also introduced sound of pedal steel guitar and moog modular synthesizer into their music making it one of first lp releases on which moog appears recording sessions for notorious byrd brothers took place throughout latter half of 1967 and were fraught with tension resulting in loss of two members of band rhythm guitarist david crosby was fired in october 1967 and drummer michael clarke left band midway through recording returning briefly before finally being dismissed after completion of album additionally original band member gene clark who had left group in early 1966 rejoined for three weeks during making of album before leaving again author ric menck has commented that in spite of these changes in personnel and conflict surrounding its creation notorious byrd brothers is band s most cohesive and ethereal sounding album statement notorious byrd brothers reached number 47 on billboard top lps chart and number 12 on uk album chart a cover of gerry goffin and carole king song goin back was released in october 1967 as lead single from album to mild chart success although notorious byrd brothers was critically praised at time of its release it was only moderately successful commercially particularly in united states album later came to be widely regarded as one of byrds best album releases as well as their most experimental and progressive byrds expert tim connors has commented that album s title evokes american old west background recording of notorious byrd brothers during latter half of 1967 was marked by severe internal dissolution and acrimony byrds began recording sessions as a four piece band consisting of roger mcguinn david crosby chris hillman and michael clarke same line up that had recorded their two previous albums by time of album s release however only mcguinn and hillman remained in group first line up change occurred when drummer michael clarke quit group over disputes with crosby and other band members over his playing ability and his apparent dissatisfaction with material three songwriting members of band were providing he was replaced temporarily by noted session drummers jim gordon and hal blaine david crosby was then fired by mcguinn and hillman and replaced by a former member of byrds gene clark who stayed on board for just three weeks before leaving again prior to gene clark rejoining band michael clarke had also returned from his self imposed exile only to be informed by mcguinn and hillman that he was once again an ex byrd after album was completed amid so many changes in band personnel mcguinn and hillman needed to rely upon outside musicians to complete album among these hired musicians was clarence white who had also played on group s previous lp his contributions to this and byrds younger than yesterday and sweetheart of rodeo albums along with his friendship with hillman eventually led to his being hired as a full time member of band david crosby s dismissal thumb david crosby was fired from byrds midway through recording sessions for album david crosby was fired by mcguinn and hillman in october 1967 as a result of friction arising from among other things crosby s displeasure at band s wish to record goffin king composition goin back crosby felt that recording song was a step backwards artistically especially when band contained three active songwriters another factor that contributed to crosby s dismissal was his controversial song triad a risque composition about a menage a trois that was in direct competition with goin back for a place on album he eventually gave tune to jefferson airplane who included a version of song on their 1968 album crown of creation although byrds did record triad song s daring subject matter compelled mcguinn and hillman to prevent it from being released at time track eventually surfaced on band s 1987 archival compilation album never before and was later added to notorious byrd brothers as a bonus track on 1997 columbia legacy reissue crosby had also annoyed other members of byrds during their performance at monterey pop festival when he gave lengthy in between song speeches on a number of controversial subjects including jfk assassination and benefits of giving lsd to all statesmen and politicians in world he further irritated his bandmates at monterey by performing with rival group buffalo springfield filling in for ex member neil young his stock within band deteriorated still further following commercial failure of his song lady friend when it was released as a side of a byrds single in july 1967 his absence from many of recording sessions for notorious byrd brothers represented final straw for mcguinn and hillman and crosby would soon find himself an ex byrd with a handsome severance package and time to associate with his new musical partner stephen stills it has been suggested that horse on cover of album was unkindly intended to represent crosby although this has been denied by both mcguinn and hillman much to crosby s chagrin mcguinn and hillman reworked his unfinished song draft morning following his departure and included it in final running order for album awarding themselves a co writing credit in process in end crosby ended up playing on about half of notorious byrd brothers appearing on his own three songs plus change is now and old john robertson crosby also appears on several of bonus tracks included on 1997 reissue including triad universal mind decoder and an early version of goin back gene clark s return following crosby s departure gene clark was asked to rejoin band clark had originally left byrds in early 1966 due to his fear of flying and his tendency towards anxiety and paranoia his debut solo album co produced by byrds then current producer gary usher with both clarke and hillman playing on it had been a critical success but a commercial failure and clark was currently inactive clark rejoined byrds in october 1967 for three weeks during which time he and band performed on smothers brothers comedy hour television program lip syncing goin back and mr spaceman byrds also played several live dates with clark during a tour of midwest following final concert of tour clark s fear of flying again became a problem when it prevented him from taking a flight to new york with his bandmates and as a result he left band soon after it has been debated by biographers and band historians just how involved clark was in recording of notorious byrd brothers clark himself claimed during a 1988 interview for radio station 97 that he was involved in recording of goin back and some other songs from same period although he didn t specify what his contributions might have been there is also studio documentation and eyewitness accounts to suggest that clark contributed backing vocals to goin back and space odyssey one of those eyewitnesses john noreen of l a folk rock band rose garden has stated in an interview that he clearly remembers being at columbia recording studios during sessions for album and seeing clark record his backing vocals this has been corroborated by rose garden s drummer bruce who has claimed that clark s voice can be heard most clearly on mono mix of goin back that was released as a single however if clark is present on either space odyssey or goin back his contributions are not obvious and must have been buried very low in mix by producer gary usher byrds lead guitarist roger mcguinn cannot remember whether clark contributed to album or not but he has admitted that it is possible mcguinn has however gone on record as stating that he wrote song get to you with clark and that writing credits on album are mistaken they should have read mcguinn clark rather than mcguinn hillman music production despite its troubled genesis album contains some of band s most gentle and ethereal music as well as some of its most progressive and experimental in a 2002 interview mcguinn said it was kind of beatles inspired and cited their album revolver as an influence available at rock s backpages subscription required lyrically it attempted to deal with many contemporary themes such as peace ecology freedom drug use alienation and mankind s place in universe album as a whole represented apex of mcguinn crosby hillman songwriting partnership and took musical experimentation of original byrds to its farthest logical extreme mixing folk rock country psychedelia and jazz often within a single song band and producer gary usher also used a number of innovative studio based production techniques on album in particular making heavy use of phasing spatial panning and rotary speaker effects thumb a moog modular synthesizer similar to one used during recording of notorious byrd brothers band also began experimenting with moog modular synthesizer on a number of tracks making notorious byrd brothers one of very first rock albums to feature instrument mcguinn had first discovered moog during monterey pop festival where instrument s inventor robert moog had set up a booth to demonstrate his new creation to musicians who were performing at festival being something of an electronics buff mcguinn was eager to experiment with synthesizer in recording studio although reportedly hillman failed to share his enthusiasm for instrument although mcguinn and usher played moog parts on song space odyssey themselves they ceded instrument s other appearances on album to electronic music pioneer and session musician paul beaver album also featured pedal steel guitar playing of session musician red rhodes which represented first use of instrument on a byrds recording this use of pedal steel along with clarence white s countrified guitar playing foreshadowed country rock direction that band would explore on their next album sweetheart of rodeo songs album s opening track artificial energy features a prominent horn section and as such can be seen as a stylistic relative of lady friend and so you want to be a rock n roll star two earlier byrds songs that made use of brass song deals with dark side of amphetamine use and it was chris hillman who initially suggested that band should write a song about speed title was suggested by drummer michael clarke and his input in creation of song was sufficient to afford him a rare writing credit although song s lyrics initially seem to be extolling virtues of amphetamines tale turns darker in final verse when it becomes apparent that drug taker has been imprisoned for murdering a homosexual man as evidenced by song s final couplet i m coming down off amphetamine and i m in jail cause i killed a queen although press had accused byrds of writing songs about drugs in past specifically with eight miles high and 5d fifth dimension when band finally did record a song unequivocally dealing with drugs it was largely ignored by journalists artificial energy is followed on album by poignant and nostalgic goffin king song goin back with its chiming 12 string rickenbacker guitar and polished harmony singing band biographer johnny rogan has described song as providing a sharp contrast to negativity and violence of opening track song s lyrics describe an attempt on part of singer to reject cynicism that comes with being an adult in favor of innocence of childhood thematically song recalled title of byrds previous album younger than yesterday and understated pedal steel guitar playing of red rhodes gives track a subtle country flavor a second goffin king composition wasn t born to follow also displays country and western influences albeit filtered through band s psychedelic and garage rock tendencies song s country leanings are underscored by criss crossing musical dialogue between electric guitar and pedal steel rural ambiance is further heightened by striking imagery of lyrics which outline need for escape and independence a subject perfectly in keeping with hippie ethos of day another song on album that deals with need to escape confines of society is david crosby s dolphin s smile song was an early example of crosby s penchant for using nautical imagery in his songs a thematic trait he would utilize in future compositions including wooden ships and lee shore theme of unfettered idyllic bliss is further explored in hillman penned natural harmony like goin back natural harmony conveys a sense of longing for innocence of youth albeit filtered through awareness raising properties of psychedelic drugs it has been suggested by some commentators that song exhibits strong influence of crosby s writing style with its laid back jazzy feel and dreamy high tenor vocal part mcguinn and hillman composition change is now with its lyrics advising listener to live life to full represents a celebration of philosophy of carpe diem popularly translated as seize day within this context song s lyrics explored a number of other themes including epiphenomenalism communalism and human ecology quasi philosophical nature of song prompted mcguinn to flippantly describe it in a 1969 interview as another one of those guru spiritual mystic songs that no one understood an early instrumental recording of song listed under its original working title of universal mind decoder was included as a bonus track on 1997 reissue of notorious byrd brothers change is now is notable for being only song on album to feature both crosby and future byrd clarence white together on same track draft morning is a song about horrors of vietnam war as well as a protest against conscription of men into military during conflict song was initially written by crosby but he was fired from byrds shortly after he had introduced it to rest of band however work had already begun on song s instrumental backing track by time of crosby s departure controversially mcguinn and hillman decided to continue working on song despite its author no longer being a member of band having only heard song s lyrics in their original incarnation a few times mcguinn and hillman couldn t remember all of words when they came to record vocals and so decided to rewrite song with their own lyrical additions giving themselves a co writing credit in process this angered crosby considerably since he felt with some justification that mcguinn and hillman had stolen his song despite its troubled evolution draft morning is often considered one of crosby s best songs from his tenure with byrds lyrically it follows a newly recruited soldier from morning of his induction into military through to his experiences of combat and as such illustrates predicament faced by many young american men during 1960s song also makes extensive use of battlefield sound effects provided for band by los angeles comedy troupe firesign theatre another of crosby s songwriting contributions to album tribal gathering was for many years assumed to have been inspired by human be in a gathering of tribes a counter culture happening held in san francisco s golden gate park on january 12 1967 however in recent years crosby has revealed that song was actually inspired by another hippie gathering held at elysian park near los angeles on march 26 1967 played in a jazzy 5 4 time signature song s vocal arrangement was greatly influenced by music of four freshmen a vocal group that crosby had admired as a youngster another song on album that uses a 5 4 time signature albeit with occasional shifts into 3 4 time is mcguinn and clark composition get to you song recounts a plane trip to london england just prior to advent of autumn but identity of enigmatic you mentioned in song s title is not specified in lyrics and thus can be interpreted as either a waiting lover or as city of london itself although clark helped to co write song he had left byrds by time it was recorded and therefore does not appear on track old john robertson which had already been issued some six months earlier as b side of lady friend single was another country tinged song that looked forward to band s future country rock experimentation song was inspired by a retired film director who lived in small town near san diego where hillman grew up john s robertson was something of an eccentric figure around town regularly wearing a stetson hat and sporting a white handlebar moustache which gave him appearance of a character out of old american west in song hillman recalls children of town and their cruel laughter at this colorful figure as well as combination of awe and fear that he elicited in townsfolk during recording of song crosby switched instruments with hillman to play bass instead of his usual rhythm guitar track also makes liberal use of studio effects known as phasing and flanging particularly during song s orchestral middle section and subsequent verse version of old john robertson found on b side of lady friend single is a substantially different mix from version that appears on notorious byrd brothers album final track on album space odyssey is a musical retelling of arthur c clarke s short story sentinel which was also inspiration for stanley kubrick s 1968 film 2001 a space odyssey song makes extensive use of moog modular synthesizer and features a droning dirge like melody reminiscent of a sea shanty since space odyssey predates release of 2001 a space odyssey mcguinn and his co writer robert j composed lyrics that referred to a pyramid being found on moon as was case in sentinel however pyramid was replaced by a rectangular monolith in both film and accompanying novelization release and reception notorious byrd brothers was released on january 15 1968 in united states catalogue item cl in mono cs 9575 in stereo and on april 12 1968 in uk catalogue item 63169 in mono s 63169 in stereo however there is some evidence to suggest that u s release date may have been brought forward to january 3 1968 regardless album s appearance during first month of 1968 surprised many fans of band who had been led to believe by contemporary press reports that album was still in planning stages it peaked at number 47 on billboard top lps chart during a chart stay of 19 weeks but fared better in united kingdom where it reached number 12 spending a total of 11 weeks on uk chart album s front cover photograph was taken by guy webster who had also been responsible for cover of byrds turn turn turn album goin back single was released ahead of album on october 20 1967 and reached number 89 on billboard hot 100 but failed to chart in uk album is notable for being last byrds lp to be commercially issued in mono in united states although subsequent albums continued to be released in both mono and stereo variations overseas album was almost universally well received by music press upon release with jon landau in newly launched rolling stone magazine noting that when byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant landau went on to praise byrds musical eclecticism before stating their music is possessed by a never ending circularity and a rich child like quality it has a timelessness to it not in sense that you think their music will always be valid but in sense that it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether crawdaddy magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of album with sandy pearlman describing it as enchantingly beautiful pete johnson in his review for los angeles times summed up album as 11 good songs spiked with electronic music strings brass natural and supernatural voices and familiar thick texture of mcguinn s guitar playing in a contemporary review published in esquire music critic robert christgau described notorious byrd brothers as simply best album byrds have ever recorded christgau grouped it with contemporary releases by love forever changes and beach boys wild honey remarking i t s hard to believe that so much good can come out of one place i e los angeles in uk record mirror gave album a rare five star rating commenting hard though it was for byrds to follow up their near perfect younger than yesterday album they ve done it with this fantastic disc melody maker was also complimentary about album describing it as a beautiful selection representing us pop at its finest beat instrumental concluded their review by stating it s true to say that byrds are one of two best groups in world nobody can say any different with proof of this album in 1997 rolling stone senior editor david fricke described album as byrds finest hour and work of a great rock roll band in every special sense of word on his official website robert christgau again commented on album declaring that notorious byrd brothers along with its follow up sweetheart of rodeo is one of most convincing arguments for artistic freedom ever to come out of american rock parke puterbaugh writing for rolling stone website in 1999 remarked on presence of burbling moog synthesizers and purring steel guitars on album which he ultimately described as a brilliant window onto an unforgettable place and time legacy over years notorious byrd brothers has gained in reputation and is often considered group s best work while contentious incidents surrounding its making have been largely forgotten album managed to capture band at height of their creative powers as they pushed ahead lyrically musically and technically into new sonic territory band biographer johnny rogan has written that byrds greatest accomplishment on album was in creating a seamless mood piece from a variety of different sources bound together by innovative studio experimentation although album is widely regarded as band s most experimental its running time of a little under 29 minutes also makes it their briefest album was voted fourth best album ever in a 1971 zigzag magazine readers poll and 1977 edition of critic s choice top 200 albums book ranked it at number 154 in a
