jus oborn it was group s follow up to their eponymous album electric wizard oborn described release as a reaction to music on earlier album which he had felt was not as heavy as he wanted group to sound songs on come my fanatics were described by lee dorrian rise above records owner as breaking from traditional doom metal style with an unpolished and chaotic approach thematic elements of album draw from 1970s horror films biker movies and writings of h p lovecraft there are three songs about leaving earth to avoid an impending environmental disaster album release was followed by a tour with band cathedral and positive reviews from heavy metal magazines metal hammer terrorizer and kerrang come my fanatics continued to receive praise in retrospective reviews with terrorizer declaring it wake up that uk doom scene needed and dorrian describing it as turning point of everything production background prior to recording with electric wizard lead singer jus oborn was mostly interested in death metal genre after listening to black sabbath under influence of mushrooms he was inspired to take his music in a different direction at time oborn was a member of a group called eternal who were drifting apart oborn said i had a vision of doing doom stuff rest of guys were just into alice in chains after forming in 1993 electric wizard recorded their self titled debut album which was released in 1996 allmusic editor eduardo rivadavia described album as impressive but considered electric wizards music to be pretty standard doom fare for time oborn was not happy with recording of electric wizard finding it lighter sounding than they had wanted he said we went to a big fancy studio and we were like oh no we ve gotta do as we re told this led to sound of their follow up album come my fanatics oborn said it had to sound right this time about recording period oborn said our country wasn t in a great state and metal was totally fucked at that point we were really making a musical statement when you re younger everything is a reaction against world recording oborn found producer rolf startin who shared band s desire for rawness and feeling listed in yellow pages startin was prepared to build studio around band supplying band with vintage amplifiers come my fanatics was recorded at red dog studios in july 1996 oborn later described album s production as very technically inept and said it was very difficult to deliberately do things badly it just happened it was exactly sound we were trying to create some songs on album contain samples from films such as return trip which contains a sample of film cannibal ferox horror film samples came from video nasties passed under table at market stall in wimborne in dorset where members of group lived song b phase inducer is an instrumental track with an introduction that came about by accident when band experimented with a drum bass sampler in studio oborn said group were quite impressed even though we didn t like music he mentioned specific albums such as six million ways to die seemed quite brutal in use of samples and that was something we thought we could bring to our music album s closing track solarian 13 is also an instrumental track music and themes thumb left jus oborn stated sound of come my fanatics was in response to first album not being as heavy sounding as expected rise above records owner lee dorian stated that group s sound on record somehow managed to break mould of traditional doom metal noting that previous doom metal groups are very morose and slow and heavy which can be very off putting while electric wizard had a guitar sound that had a completely unpolished approach to way they present themselves dan franklin writing for quietus stated group s style of music was completely contrary to surprisingly spiritual tendencies of trouble and others noting its thick chaotic and crushing sound a 29 second sample of electric wizards s wizard in black featuring groups use of sampling echoed these statements noting that album somehow upped sonic ante through a wall of sludge so thick that even most experienced of metal heads couldn t help but be overwhelmed by its power dorian also found album difficult on a first listen stating music on album draws influences from 1970s horror films biker movies and works of h p lovecraft oborn had read lovecraft since his early teenage years and admired his work particularly idea that art should be otherworldly and have this sense of fear and something beyond our understanding i took that as more of an influence than literally talking about tentacle headed monsters which only crosses surface level oborn also said come my fanatics was conceived as a piece of escapism developed from an insular underground feeling that we were heading to our doom as a planet and no one overground had a fucking clue about it he stated that final three songs on album b phase inducer son of nothing and solarian 13 were a concept about leaving earth because it was so fucked up he said ethic was that planet was heading towards an environmental disaster and release come my fanatics was released in january 1997 by rise above records album did not reach chart in united kingdom label s founder lee dorian had previously tried to promote doom metal music in united kingdom through compilation albums such as dark passages featuring bands including penance revelation and mourn to define a british scene dorian later said release of come my fanatics was turning point of everything terrorizer echoed these statements in 2012 calling album wake up that uk doom scene needed and proved it wasn t just about frilly shirts and gothic morbidity come my fanatics received several re releases in 1999 rise above re released it on 19 april 1999 with new artwork new cover depicts anton lavey and his disciples and is based on still from a 1971 television documentary called power of witch to create cover oborn paused his videotaped copy of documentary and traced image from his television screen he added space background later music cartel distributed album in united states in 1999 come my fanatics was released in japan with bonus track return to sun of nothingness both electric wizard and come my fanatics were re packaged as a single release in 1999 in finland album charted in 2011 charting at number 28 on chart touring and follow up after initial 1997 release of album electric wizard toured united kingdom with cathedral in february 1997 and in europe with labelmates mourn this was planned to be followed with a tour supporting blood divine in early april with orange goblin which electric wizard later dropped out of following release of come my fanatics group released ep 1998 their next studio album dopethrone was not released until four years later oborn said of hiatus i would safely say there was a period where we split up we just didn t tell anybody reception on its release come my fanatics received positive reviews from heavy rock magazines terrorizer kerrang and metal hammer metal hammer called album a right while terrorizer said this is out there in orbit with hawkwind s space ritual and that s a compliment in its own way they are but wiz have made a great stoner doom record kerrang stated electric wizard have delivered one of most punishingly heavy albums in recent memory concluding that classic is only word for it from retrospective articles and reviews guardian said oborn s vision of creating heaviest music imaginable was put firmly into practice for 1997 s still astonishing come my fanatics a record that was so devastatingly slow heavy and obnoxious that it made everything else around it sound anaemic and pedestrian allmusic called it absolutely colossal and essential doom noting it was somewhat less immediate than its predecessor even most experienced of metal heads couldn t help but be overwhelmed by its power and that tracks such as doom mantia and son of nothing would test patience of uninitiated listeners before drifting into focus through billowing clouds of smoke but ultimate religious experience is well worth lengthy conversion process in an overview of bands discography harry sword of noisey declared that come my fanatics was when electric wizard really hit home its turgid doom imbued with sleazy cosmic reach and a blackened punkish energy and that it ushered in a new era for doom engineering a full on scuzz attack that felt cosmic in reach and was anchored by a very human rage oborn later stated that come my fanatics is his favourite of group s earlier material he said i can t honestly remember doing it so it is like listening to another band and i do like that album a lot i remember doing dopethrone and it was particularly hard work and a miserable experience so i don t look at it fondly track listing all songs by electric wizard lyrics by jus oborn personnel credits adapted from liner notes jus
