want it to be somebody else s decision in an interview with popeater lovato said of video it was actually really freezing cold in rain you could see your breath and i was in rain for only a short time my whole band was out there for an hour and a half it was one of hardest things i ve ever had to do on a shoot but it went by so quickly i had a body suit on underneath my clothes so there s a little fun fact for you i was trying not to break my focus pretty much entire shoot because i was really in that zone thinking a lot about position i was in a year ago thinking about situation and how much i wanted to get all that emotion off my chest steve helling of people magazine wrote that lovato shows her mature side in video saying that it s hard not to notice that 16 year old camp rock star is growing up video begins in a tour bus with lovato s band she is seen sitting next to a window in back of bus where she precedes to sing first lines as song progresses she walks out of bus in rain holding an umbrella she walks out of parking lot and into an amusement park where she stands in front of a carousel in rain as she continues to sing after second chorus lovato and her band perform in
