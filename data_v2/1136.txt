page 139 since preservation railway has operated as a tourist attraction expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages in 1976 an extension was opened along former mineral line from abergynolwyn to new station at nant gwernol in 2001 preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of tywyn wharf station took place including a much expanded facility for narrow gauge railway museum fictional skarloey railway which formed part of railway series of children s books by rev

and construction up to 1866 slate quarrying began in hills above tywyn in 1830s but although many small quarries and test levels were established only one major quarry was developed in region at bryn eglwys north east of town underground working began in early 1840s richards 1999 page 195 and by 1847 quarry was being worked by local landowner john finished slates were sent by packhorse to wharf at transferred to boats for a river trip to aberdyfi or anglicised aberdovey still commonly used and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited quarry s output boyd 1965 pages 62 63 in 1861 outbreak of american civil war cut off supplies of cotton to mills of north west of england and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests one such owner was william mcconnel of lancashire who in 1859 had purchased hall near dolgellau north of tywyn in january 1864 mcconnel formed aberdovey slate company which leased land including bryn eglwys from landowner lewis morris of machynlleth boyd 1988 page 9 thumb left remains of bryn eglwys quarry in 2008 alt large spoil heaps of slate appear on hillside in a heavily wooded area in foreground is a small stone house without a roof mcconnel set about improving bryn eglwys to increase its output he focused on providing rail transport for isolated quarry and in april 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase land necessary to build a railway towards tywyn and onwards to port of aberdyfi construction was well underway by july 1864 drummond 2015 page s 9 11 standard gauge aberystwyth and welsh coast railway was expanding rapidly from its base at machynlleth however and in 1863 had reached tywyn so mcconnel decided to build his line from quarry to tywyn as nearest point where slate could be transferred to standard gauge railway this was despite line s initial isolation from rest of system because of difficulties in bridging estuary of afon dyfi to south boyd 1965 page 64 an act of parliament 28 and 29 vict cap allowing company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given royal assent on 5 july 1865 boyd 1988 page page 11 and company appointed james swinton spooner as engineer for construction he laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from tywyn to quarry and work quickly got underway by september 1866 construction had advanced to point where board of trade inspector captain henry tyler could make an initial inspection and report boyd 1965 page 65 tyler s report led to an unusual alteration as it was discovered that internal width of was only but railway s passenger carriages were wide leaving only clearance on either side which was less than minimum required clearance of to alleviate this problem mcconnel proposed that doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and track slewed off centre beneath bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on side with doors which would allow passengers to get out of carriages if train stopped underneath a bridge tyler agreed to this arrangement and to this day all carriages on talyllyn have doors on one side only an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared albeit for different reasons with neighbouring corris railway boyd 1965 pages 68 69 tyler also required that improvements be made to railway s first two steam locomotives as locomotive no 1 suffered from excessive vertical motion and no 2 was said to suffer from horizontal oscillation no 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce rear overhang and springs on no 2 were adjusted and crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation boyd 1965 page 70 tyler did not approve opening until his listed improvements were completed although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865 drummond 2015 page 17 during november of that 1866 tyler returned to tywyn and re inspected railway following which subject to some further minor improvements he approved its formal opening for passenger service first public passenger timetable was

returning on cambrian railways trains rolt 1998 pages 24 25 last two decades of 19th century saw a decline in demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times including bryn eglwys where by 1890 production had halved to a year in 1896 production at penrhyn quarry in north wales one of largest producers of slate was stopped due to labour disputes resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries mcconnel expanded production at bryn eglwys to take advantage of sudden demand but only with aim of maximising profits during remainder of his lease which was to expire in 1910 he built new trial levels without proper provision for removal of overburden and pushed limits of safe working in existing chambers as mcconnel s lease drew to its close there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling quarry s equipment haydn jones era 1911 1950 bryn eglwys quarry was primary employer in abergynolwyn district so its closure caused significant distress in 1910 local landowner henry haydn jones was elected liberal mp for merioneth he understood importance of bryn eglwys and at end of year he purchased quarry company for just over ps5000 quarry re opened in january 1911 boyd 1965 pages 72 73 though haydn jones did not have capital to invest in quarry first workings reopened were on broad vein which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and therefore difficult to sell lack of an available market for this output forced quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from narrow vein but because haydn jones could not afford to open new workings into narrow vein he resorted to dangerous practice of narrowing columns that supported roofs of underground chambers this practice had begun under mcconnel s ownership and haydn jones continued it throughout his ownership of quarry a brief construction boom after first world war saw production return to around per year 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic as britain recovered from war and tourism gained in popularity talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats ransom 1996 page 130 an unusual tourist service offered by railway was to hire a slate wagon which would be left at abergynolwyn at end of day tourists would return to tywyn in wagon powered by gravity this service was discontinued in early 1930s boyd 1965 pages 116 117 additional income from tourist trade defrayed some of costs of operating railway but never enough for it to make a profit during haydn jones ownership lease on bryn eglwys expired in 1942 but was extended on an annual basis october 1942 bradshaw s guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on monday wednesday and fridays taking 45 minutes in each direction no passenger service was provided on other days overnight on 26 december 1946 several weakened support columns in quarry gave way resulting in a significant collapse quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately haydn jones had promised to continue operating railway as long as he was alive and so despite closure of quarry railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget in 1947 british railway system was nationalised and talyllyn was one of few operating railways not included reasons for this are unclear but it is significant that all official mention of railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that line was simply forgotten by officialdom boyd 1965 pages 73 74 between 1947 and 1949 railway ran a passenger service two days a week in 1949 haydn jones who owned slate quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from recently lifted corris railway on 2 july 1950 haydn jones died and closure of railway

birmingham post newspaper suggesting that a rescue of talyllyn be undertaken he received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 october 1950 at imperial hotel in birmingham around 70 people including patrick whitehouse attended meeting with rolt proposing formation of a committee to look into acquisition of railway with support of meeting committee with rolt as chairman and whitehouse as secretary met for first time on 23 october and immediately entered into negotiation with haydn jones executors rolt 1965 pages 52 53 transfer of ownership to committee was legally complex but both parties agreed that all shares in railway company would be transferred from haydn jones estate to a new company called talyllyn holdings ltd whose board consisted of two directors from executors and two from committee transfer took place on 8 february 1951 at which point newly formed talyllyn railway preservation society effectively took control of

major overhaul to enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives nos 3 and 4 were purchased from recently closed corris railway in 1951 and named sir haydn and edward thomas respectively because both railways were built to unusual gauge of it was relatively easy to adapt corris locomotives to work on talyllyn no 3 became first new locomotive to travel on railway for over 80 years in 1951 but it frequently derailed and on inspection it turned out that talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch 13 mm wider than official gauge a deliberate policy by old company to accommodate long wheelbase of talyllyn both talyllyn and dolgoch had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on wide of gauge track this problem was eventually cured by relaying railway to its correct gauge and altering talyllyn s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally shortening locomotive s fixed wheelbase boyd 1988 page 260 no 4 was unserviceable when it arrived but

from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to railway that summer with more than 57 500 passengers carried and this increase in revenue in turn enabled railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience rolt 1965 pages 61 62 following year locomotive no 1 talyllyn returned to steam after an extensive overhaul mitchell and eyres 2005 page 25 an important development during this period was establishment of narrow gauge railway museum at tywyn wharf station first exhibit for what was to become museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by guinness from their recently closed st james s gate brewery railway in 1954 preservation society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around united kingdom were acquired to form

proved to be a decade of consolidation for talyllyn pendre works underwent several much needed expansions adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room modern machine tools

popularity railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction by early 1960s tywyn wharf station was in need of major improvements before preservation station had contained only a fan of sidings which meant that there was no way for locomotive of an arriving train to run round carriages as a result trains were pushed from behind as far as pendre where locomotive could be moved past carriages to front of train a loop was installed at wharf for first time in august 1952 to avoid having to propel trains to pendre boyd 1965 page 77 but in winter of 1964 65 a major upgrade of station was carried out this improved track layout and extended original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop mitchell and eyres 2005 page 19 as passenger numbers continued to grow during late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed especially as rebuilt no 1 was not performing well talyllyn s unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on line unaltered mitchell and eyres 2005 page 87 so in 1969 a gauge steam locomotive was purchased from bord na mona irish

named tom rolt after preservation society s first chairman was put into service on 6 may 1991 bate 2001 pages 234 237 during this period further expansions of both tywyn wharf and pendre stations were undertaken and abergynolwyn station which had been rebuilt as part of nant gwernol extension in 1970s was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at eastern end of line thomas 2002 page 35 one major anomaly remained in railway s operations 1889 regulation of railways act had required amongst other measures that all british passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes mcconnel had secured an exemption for talyllyn railway on basis that low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that cost of compliance would bankrupt enterprise but by end of 1990s railway inspectorate was insisting that talyllyn be brought into compliance with act a little over 100 years after it had passed by 2001 railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with necessary equipment
