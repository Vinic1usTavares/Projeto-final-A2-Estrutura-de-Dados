january 2011 when gaga released part of lyrics on her twitter account white shadow revealed that before they returned to europe for 2010 dates of monster ball tour gaga had taken leave for few days to be with her ailing grandfather after he died gaga told white shadow that she wrote a song about her grandfather s death and its impact on her gaga spoke to jon pareles of new york times about story behind song edge of glory was about how when my grandma was standing over my grandfather while he was dying there was this moment where i felt like he had sort of looked at her and reckoned that he had won in life like i m a champion we won our love made us a winner they were married 60 years i thought about that idea that glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it s okay to go you don t have any more words to say more business more mountains to climb you re on cliff you tip your hat to yourself and you go that s what it was for me in that moment when i witnessed it more information in regards to edge of glory was revealed by gaga in an interview with google where she explained song as being about one s final moments on earth before death another inspiration for song was actor sylvester stallone s 1976 film rocky which is gaga s favorite film singer felt that song was about looking at life directly with feeling that he or she is a champion like emotion displayed by character rocky balboa in film on may 5 2011 interscope sent out an e mail to radio stations across united states which stated that edge of glory was to be released on monday may 9 2011 as first of two promotional single for born this way it was to serve as first song in countdown to born this way promotion on itunes store however after its release to digital stores edge of glory started selling a considerable amount of digital downloads prompting gaga to make it third single from born this way on her twitter account gaga revealed cover for single it showed gaga topless with her mouth open wearing her facial prosthetics from born this way cover and her hair wildly cascading around her recording and composition edge of glory features synthesizers executed in a style influenced by smooth jazz as well as inclusion of a saxophone solo song is less electronic and more straightforward pop and lyrics deal more with romance than individual inspiration garibay revealed that song was recorded in gaga s natural vocal tone and required just one take she requested him to add sound of heartbeat at start of track garibay said that decision to add a saxophone solo was a bold move for gaga since contemporary hit radio did not have any song with a saxophone solo on their song playlists a pop electro rock and disco song edge of glory opens with gaga s vocals over a keyboard singing line there ain t no reason you and me should be alone tonight yeah baby tonight yeah baby according to mtv s jocelyn vena song s production evokes late 80s early 90s adult contemporary pop when big choruses were norm for songs jason lipshultz from billboard stated song leans upon sunny electronica that sounds big on chorus where gaga sings i m on edge of glory and i m hanging on a moment of truth evan sawdey of website popmatters found several rock elements in composition of song vena also felt that what made song stand out from others on radio was saxophone solo by clemons right in middle of track as gaga belts out i m on edge with you robert copsey from digital spy said that musical composition is a mixture of loud sounding electric guitars and club beat influenced synths song and album ends with a long coda with sound of saxophone fading out according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by sony atv music publishing edge of glory is written in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute set in key of a major it follows basic chord progression of a e d for verse and a e fm d progression for chorus while gaga s voice spans from a3 to d5 gaga s reference for saxophone solo was e street band and bruce springsteen she ultimately asked clarence clemons from e street band to play instrument clemons told rolling stone that in january 2011 he was contacted by gaga s management and they wanted him to play on born this way since call was on a friday clemons replied that he could record it on coming monday or tuesday but gaga was adamant to have him at new york recording studio on that day itself clemons flew from florida to new york and reached recording studio in manhattan at midnight gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks one of them being edge of glory she simply told clemons we ll put tape on and you just play recording concluded by 3 a m after a few takes clemons added that he was surprised to get paid since he would have done it for free i can never believe something that feels so good earns me money critical reception edge of glory was met with general acclaim from critics while previewing song matthew perpetua from rolling stone wrote a positive review this one sounds crazy in print but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it perpetua added that there is an element of cheesiness in song but nevertheless it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it he complimented inclusion of clemons as an inspired touch that amplifies song s eighties stadium rock vibe and clemons actual performance was described as amazing and among best of his career in another review perpetua noted that edge of glory is an immediate pop anthem fellow rolling stone journalist jody rosen complimented hook chorus and clemens saxophone playing on song jocelyn vena from mtv news asserted that song showed a softer side to gaga as opposed to her previous singles from born this way willa paskin from new york was impressed with track saying if first two tracks off forthcoming born this way were all jangly dance rock this is as smooth as an 80s jam straight off flashdance soundtrack and it has saxophone breakdown to prove it paskin also believed that song had potential to be a summer hit but could face competition from singer katy perry s single last friday night t g i f thumb upright gaga performing edge of glory during born this way ball tour in 2012 jason lipshutz of billboard wrote that edge of glory was risk taking but it s focused on romance rather than individual inspiration lewis corner of digital spy awarded song with five out of five stars and wrote gaga belts over a chorus tastier and more filling than a meatball sub stuffed with stadium sized beats and massive techno synths while side of sax solo courtesy of late clarence clemons is bound to seduce many a into bringing out their rarely used nowadays air sax kevin o donnell of spin noted that in song gaga goes back to basics he also called song a four on floor anthem with loads of references to 80s pop music and concluded thankfully edge of glory proves gaga hasn t let her global celebrity get best of her art and she s still capable to cranking out straightforward dance ready jams like just dance or poker face both andy gill of independent and james reed of boston globe praised clarence clemons saxophone solo in edge of glory nardine saad from los angeles times asserted that edge of glory was less shock provoking than her previous releases saad also felt that track was slower and less electro in its composition than judas her then current single priya elan of nme wrote that song felt like a pop moment without gaga trying too hard to address social issues or religious conflicts elan also complimented clemons saxophone addition similar sentiments were expressed by fellow nme writer dan martin who found track to be gleaming calling it most ecstatic pop serenade gaga has ever come up with robert copsey from digital spy commented that song is a straight up fists in air feel good anthem that is less cheesy than born this way but equally if not more euphoric however he found opening bar of song similar to that of cher s 2002 single song for lonely megan gibson from time was disappointed with single feeling that it was not particularly good and called music as trite uninspiring and bland matthew cole from slant magazine was polarized with song stating that while it lowered his expectations for album he expressed that saxophone solo was admittedly a high point and one of more original ideas that gaga has had of late sal cinquemani from same publication felt that song isn t retro so much as retrograde starting off with some crafty art of noise synth tones before morphing into what sounds like theme song to an early 90s sitcom or an inspirational sports flick as sung by bonnie tyler greg kot of chicago tribune also gave a mixed review about song calling it a springsteen on steroids bombast and adding that it features clarence clemons doing almost a parody of a clarence clemons sax solo accolades edge of glory was nominated in category for song of year at 38th people s choice awards at end of 2011 slant magazine listed edge of glory as eighth best song of year with ed gonzalez from website commenting that song is a study in radical contrast that once you sift aside its deliberately dated effects and legacy of late clarence clemons is deep down an incredibly delicate ballad yes everyone expects gaga to make her confessions on dance floor but who knew she could make her shouts whisper it was placed at same rank by billboard and at position seven by rolling stone in september 2013 saxophone solo ranked number two on vh1 s list of 15 greatest guest solos in rock history chart

concept she added i just know that we ll be feeling very fishy gaga told mtv uk that she had already written treatment for video adding that it s her favorite e online reported that a casting call for video was made where agents looked for a puerto rican or dominican origin male other roles included a male or female on air reporter a doctor role reminiscent to one in american show dr 90210 and a group of military men for scenes involving rifles music video director was confirmed as joseph kahn but interscope records later confirmed that kahn and gaga parted ways due to collaborative misunderstandings gibson confirmed that there was some issues on set which resulted in kahn being replaced as director gaga s creative team haus of gaga were later chosen to direct video instead chancler haynes kahn s on set editor revealed that mermaid themed performance of song on le grand journal was actual theme of video and included sets built for a hospital scene brooklyn bridge and a big underwater mermaid scene however at last minute before shooting gaga changed her mind regarding whole concept leading to a disagreement with kahn and hence it was cancelled she then shot scenes with clarence clemons in a new york city set she later explained that her idea was to create a sweater set of a video she wanted to acknowledge herself and success she had experienced in her music career with a simplified video showing her dancing outside her new york apartment from her early days music video premiered on june 16 2011 on eighth season of us reality television show so you think you can dance synopsis gaga s wardrobe throughout entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by gianni versace dress consists of a s m inspired outfit with heavy gold jewelry studs on leather and vibrant nail polish and lipstick notable in video is absence of back up dancers elaborate choreography or a symbolic plot components that have all been predominant in gaga s other music videos aside from gaga herself clemons is only other person to appear in video video begins with gaga slowly appearing from behind a building on a deserted street corner whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights coming from windows of buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from drains when first verse of song begins gaga emerges from window of an apartment onto fire escape a long take follows of gaga strutting through red lit district singing line i got a reason that you should take me home tonight and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes gaga does not remove it and shot spans to her walking backside gesturing viewer to follow video consists mostly of interchanging shots of gaga dancing and singing on street on fire escape and on steps in front of apartment building with clemons near end of video after clemons saxophone solo gaga crouches in front of building s steps and kisses sidewalk video concludes with a close up of gaga s face before she re enters through window into her smokey apartment reception both jocelyn vena from mtv and christian blauvelt from entertainment weekly commented on similarity of music video with broadway musical rent vena also compared visuals with those for madonna s 1986 single papa don t preach and michael jackson s 1984 single billie jean she concluded by saying that music video still manages to shine mostly because of its simplicity in another review james montgomery from mtv also found similarities between video and musicals rent and west side story blauvelt was initially surprised to see simplistic approach of video since her previous releases had provocative visuals he added that video seemed a clear homage to gaga s inspirations like madonna concluding that all references in edge of glory are so overt there s no way it could be shameless cribbing sal cinquemani of slant magazine gave video a positive review calling it a visual triumph with breathtaking art direction and a gray blue black color palette carefully calibrated by gaga s vibrant lipstick and nail polish a red painted stripe on curb and gold of her jewelry and studs on her leather not to mention clarence clemons s brass video was compared to michael jackson s way you make me feel janet jackson s when i think of you and pleasure principle and film crimes of passion all of them being 1980s videos and films he did however criticize gaga s half convincing lip synching writing for washington post sarah anne hughes called video shockingly simple amos barshad from new york liked straight approach gaga took with video and although he called it boring compared to gaga s previous efforts he felt video worked well because of simplicity jarett wieselman from new york post tried to understand what actually went wrong with production and came to conclusion that mutual disagreements between gaga and kahn led to video being a piece of rubbish he deemed whole issue surrounding production as foolish in end agreeing that it was foolish of us to expect that gaga would never stumble because despite preternatural image constantly presented she is only human after all rolling stones daniel kreps gave a mixed review of video calling song over top with a lackluster and understated video doses leah collins was more neutral in her review questioning if gaga was simply swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured same nyc backdrop of fire escapes and brown stone steps or just attempting to be saving a metric on budget while reviewing video for vancouver sun collins compared gaga s look in video to a hooker from 1982 american science fiction film blade runner live performances gaga first performed an acoustic jazz version of song at radio 1 s big weekend in carlisle cumbria in may 15 2011 another piano version of song was performed a week later on season finale of saturday night live where singer wore a metallic black dress knee high boots and a semi circular

each other took a breath and then jumped off edge of stage landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks as steam shot up high in air len melisurgo from star ledger felt that performance was too sexually suggestive for audience of american idol and wondered whether gaga went just a little too far for a family oriented show that s geared toward a younger audience conversely adam graham from mtv news listed it as one of gaga s most memorable television performances thumb lady gaga performing edge of glory at 2011 muchmusic video awards on may 27 2011 gaga performed edge of glory on good
