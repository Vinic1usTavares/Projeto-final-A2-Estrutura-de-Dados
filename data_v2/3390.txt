nelson said video s production was ambitious stating it s an incredible challenge to make a creative clip of a song without artist he goes onto say that coolio helped enormously because he was first to commit to his role as bellboy nelson says that coolio s role provides thread that weaves together entire concept of video yvette lang who executive produced clip for f m rocks described filming to be like a big party to show their support for shakur ice t s role as hotel concierge was not originally intended at first there was a comedian set to play his role but he ended up cancelling at last

imprisonment commenting clip itself practically invites that kind of scrutiny hotel setting and explicit sex echo shakur s own crimes which involved sodomy occurring in a hotel nelson denies these
