a dutch proposal to build new battleships was originally tendered in 1912 after years of concern over expansion of imperial japanese navy and withdrawal of allied british warships from china station only four coastal defense ships were planned but naval experts and tweede kamer lower house of parliament believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for nederlands indie netherlands east indies abbr nei so a royal commission was formed in june 1912 royal commission reported in august 1913 it recommended that koninklijke marine royal netherlands navy acquire nine dreadnought type battleships to protect nei from attack and help guarantee country s neutrality in europe five of these would be based in colony while other four would operate out of netherlands seven foreign companies submitted designs for contract naval historians believe that a 26 850 long ton 27 280 tonnes ship whose design was submitted by german firm friedrich krupp germaniawerft would have been eventually selected royal commission s proposal led to a debate between senior officers in navy and koninklijke royal netherlands army over how to best protect nei and question of how cost of ships should be split between netherlands and nei also was not settled until july 1914 after considering recommendations dutch government decided to acquire four battleships and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into dutch parliament in august 1914 however this was withdrawn following outbreak of first world war that month a new royal commission into dutch defense needs held after war did not recommend that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered background during early years of 20th century dutch became concerned about their ability to defend their colonial empire in

navy part i 359 four coast defense ships were projected in one of two major bills to come before house of representatives in 1912 breyer battleships and battle cruisers ed holland and belgium specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280 mm 11 inch and ten 102 mm 4 inch guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a belt of 152 mm 6 inch and turret armor of 203 mm 8 inches two triple expansion engines generating 10 000 indicated horsepower would drive ships through water at one ship of this design was very close to being authorized in 1912 but it was felt by experts and house of representatives that netherlands would be better served by constructing dreadnoughts of a type similar to spanish further plans for coast defense ships were shelved pending findings of a royal commission formed on 5 june 1912 its goal was to assess steps needed to improve defenses of east indies meanwhile in september 1912 navy minister hendrikus contacted german firm friedrich krupp germaniawerft and asked them to prepare a design for dreadnought battleships suited to nei germaniawerft submitted their design to royal netherlands navy on 25 september 1912 van

that international relations were deteriorating in pacific and there was an increased risk of nei becoming involved in a war between western and asian powers as a result commission argued that netherlands should develop a powerful fleet of warships to enforce dutch neutrality and offer a credible defense should any nation attack nei or home country itself van dijk netherlands indies and

sturton netherlands 366 it was also recommended that fleet include six torpedo cruisers believed by to be closer to large destroyers eight destroyers a role which would be filled by fret class eight torpedo boats also already completed though they were old eight large submarines and two large minelayers this ambitious plan was estimated to cost nearly 000 000 each year for next 35 until 1949 adding up to about 000 000 this would triple navy s budget commission recommended that cost of fleet be partially offset by reducing size of koninklijk nederlands leger royal dutch east indies army as navy would provide a stronger defense from attack than army could van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 103 105 requirement for nine battleships was determined by defense needs of both netherlands and nei commission recommended that four battleships be active at all times in nei with a fifth ship held in reserve there remaining four battleships would be based in netherlands ships

need a significant manpower expansion of 2 800 sailors to crew all of proposed battleships commission believed that it was unlikely that sufficient dutch citizens would volunteer and that as a result indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in nei strong segregation between white and indonesian sailors was to be maintained to maximum extent practical for unit efficiency van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 102 one member of commission chief accountant of ministry of finance a van objected to report s conclusions he provided a note to queen wilhelmina which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced their views on other members of commission moreover he believed that proposed fleet would be inadequate given rapid naval expansion being undertaken by major powers and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace this note was included as an appendix to commission s report royal commission s proposals were extensively debated hendrick van kol who was one of leaders of social democratic workers party argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through nei waters en route to other destinations other critics of plan believed that it would be unwise for netherlands to join naval arms race which was taking place in europe at time and that competition between major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either netherlands or nei dutch army also opposed development of a strong fleet in nei arguing that a land force centered on java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing size of army to fund fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections governor general of nei alexander willem frederik idenburg argued that both a stronger army and navy were necessary and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in indies he believed that cost of this alternative could be managed by reducing planned battleship force in european waters to three small ships van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 106 other supporters of proposal led by onze vloot our fleet naval advocacy association argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending nei as loss of colonial empire would greatly damage dutch economy and reduce country s prestige van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 111 112 dutch naval staff also

all ships were to be permanently stationed in nei and none would be used in european waters ships were larger than those proposed by commission however idenburg opposed this decision and unsuccessfully argued for at least a fifth battleship to be built in october 1913 it was rumored that government was about to order first ship and that it would be paid for by a loan borne by nei van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 108 design germaniawerft submitted a revised battleship design designated project no 753 to dutch navy on 4 march 1913 well before royal commission reported back to government as requested new design mounted its main armament in superfiring turrets other changes included an increase in number of guns to sixteen a faster maximum speed different armor protection replacement of two of side launching torpedo tubes with a single stern tube and an increase in number of rounds carried for each gun from 60 to 100 for main armament and 100 to 150

netherlands navy part iii 399 specified speed was faster than normal for contemporary battleships and their belt armor protection was relatively thin these characteristics were meant to aid ships in fighting on java sea with good visibility common in that area naval battles could and most likely would be fought at a longer range than would be feasible in other areas like north sea meaning that more shells would strike deck rather than belt eleven firms or groups of firms were invited to tender to build ships with proposals due on 4 june 1914 proposals were received from seven firms germaniawerft blohm voss ag vulcan in cooperation with bethlehem steel and ag weser from germany as well as british firms sir w g armstrong whitworth co fairfield shipbuilding and engineering company

and great war 1914 1918 101 102 public debate on this issue was centered on questions of who should pay for ships and who would make greatest profits from nei remaining under dutch rule arguments against nei paying for ships included that resources required were needed to fund economic and social development and that cost of ships would increase opposition to dutch rule thereby worsening security situation in east indies some critics of plan also argued that it was unreasonable to expect dutch subjects in nei to pay for ships intended to prolong colonial rule van dijk netherlands indies and great war 1914 1918 108 109 in contrast onze vloot published pamphlets which claimed that dutch rule was seen as beneficial in nei and that both white and native residents of islands would

accepted an offer made by representatives of dutch business community to contribute 120 000 guilders towards cost of a second battleship once parliament approved funding for first ship despite this government continued to delay submitting a plan for defense of nei to parliament though work continued on it main difficulty remained question of how to pay for fleet minister of colonies thomas b believed that nei s population needed to be sheltered from cost of ships to extent possible so that funding for welfare projects was not reduced or taxes increased from what were already high levels in 1914 he settled on a plan under which necessary revenue would be raised through increasing taxes on export duties and freight moved by privately owned railways and ships van dijk netherlands indies
