was an augustinian friary on site from thirteenth century then an almshouse for housing retired freemen then a soup kitchen was built next to almshouse in nineteenth century before site acquired its current function as a working office building also serves as basis of inner city project of national trust this project takes people of ages 12 25 and over 50 out to countryside in order to increase appreciation of city s natural surroundings building is of architectural interest because it still retains architectural elements from many previous centuries including a 14th century sacristy wall and 16th century tower connected with king s council of north it is also one of only two intact 17th century brick buildings that survive in city other being alderman fenwick s house newman steve 2005 newcastle upon tyne augustinian friary 1291 1539 in 13th century newcastle upon tyne had a population of around 4 000 and it was difficult for four parish churches to care for needs of such a large population baglee christopher 1971 holy jesus hospital a short history northern history booklet no 14 page 5 priests were expected to be educators doctors and counsellors as well as meeting spiritual needs of their parishioners therefore in 1291 land was donated by william baron of wark on tweed to found an augustinian friary on land on which museum now stands thumb richard ii issued a proclamation banning dumping of waste near friary site augustinian friars were originally an order of hermits in northern italy who pope alexander iv first congregated into a single body in 1256 order spread to france and then to england after being invited by richard de clare 6th earl of hertford to found clare priory in suffolk by river stour on 3 september 1249 de clare was able to obtain a writ of protection for friars from king brethren were clothed in black and observed rule of st augustine of hippo friars had been in england since 1250 and they helped by preaching and healing in community mackenzie 1827 pp 132 134 friary was also used as a lodgings house because it was on one of main roads to north on day that king edward i passed through newcastle in december 1299 brethren each received three shillings and four pence 3s 4d in 1306 king also granted monastery additional lands to enlarge burial ground richard ii directed bailiffs of city to issue a proclamation against dumping waste near site apparently some local people threw filth and garbage in a certain way that led near to house of austin friars to their great annoyance and peril it is possible that site was used by english kings before its later use as a temporary seat for council of north after dissolution of monasteries henry bourne an 18th century historian of newcastle upon tyne wrote of site kings of england since conquest kept house in it whence they came with an army royal against scotland and since suppression of monasteries made a magazine and store house for north parts bourne 1736 bourne also suggests that use of site as a religious centre might predate friary he wrote same authority tells us also that there was an ancient religious house founded by kings of northumberland and that several of them were buried here but it cannot be true that they built any thing for st austin for they came not into england till long after conquest in year 1252 dissolution of monasteries 1539 thumb elizabeth i decreed that kings council of north meet at friary site for 20 days of year in 1539 friary was seized by crown along with five others in area including dominican monastery of

for this purpose elizabeth i decreed that council spend 20 days a year there it appears that in 1551 site was granted to john dudley 1st duke of northumberland as parcel of tynemouth monastery in 1553 richard benson occurs as keeper of this house for crown for a fee of 40s per annum in map of city by john speed in 1610 site appears as kings it was much dilapidated by 1595 during confused period of english civil war it passed into hands of corporation area became known as kings manor which was a short lived counterpart to famous king s manor at york military drills were performed by townspeople

was constructed sometime between dissolution and union of crowns but exact date is not known it was probably constructed as a strong room to store munitions or provide a secure location if city walls were breached this turned ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before law to be punished much about tower has changed wall to right of door is

home acquired under patronage of king including manor and castle of and castle of st andrews home died in whitehall london in 1611 without a male heir and thus his earldom and barony became extinct a

occasional ventures such as newcastle inner city project by their frequent mention in national trust communications merely serve to underline how few of their type trust has to call on for report she argues that although aim of introducing town dwellers to countryside is laudable respectful and serious suggestion might be made though that a person or person s might be usefully employed also with objective of raising national trust people s understanding of and confidence in their ability to visit and enjoy or at least encounter city evans et al 1996 p 111 however collins and kay cite research
