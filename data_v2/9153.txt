bengal slow loris nycticebus bengalensis or northern slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris native to indian subcontinent and indochina its geographic range is larger than that of any other slow loris species considered a subspecies of sunda slow loris n coucang until 2001 phylogenetic analysis suggests that bengal slow loris is most closely related to sunda slow loris however some individuals in both species have mitochondrial dna sequences that resemble those of other species due to introgressive hybridization it is largest species of slow loris measuring from head to tail and weighing between like other slow lorises it has a wet nose rhinarium a round head flat face large eyes small ears a vestigial tail and dense woolly fur toxin it secretes from its brachial gland a scent gland in its arm differs chemically from that of other slow loris species and may be used to communicate information about sex age health and social status bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal occurring in both evergreen and deciduous forests it prefers rainforests with dense canopies and its presence in its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem it is a seed disperser and pollinator as well as a prey item for carnivores its diet primarily consists of fruit but also includes insects tree gum snails and small vertebrates in winter it relies on plant exudates such as sap and tree gum species lives in small family groups marks its territory with urine and sleeps during day by curling up in dense vegetation or in tree holes it is a seasonal breeder reproducing once every 12 18 months and usually giving birth to a single offspring for first three months mothers carry their offspring which reach sexual maturity at around 20 months bengal slow loris can live up to 20 years species is listed as vulnerable on iucn red list and is threatened with extinction due to a growing demand in exotic pet trade and traditional medicine it is one of most common animals sold in local animal markets in traditional medicine it is primarily used by wealthy to middle class urban women following childbirth but also to treat stomach problems broken bones and sexually transmitted diseases it is also hunted for food and suffers from habitat loss wild populations have declined severely and it is locally extinct in several regions it is found within many protected areas throughout its range but this does not protect them from rampant poaching and illegal logging critical conservation issues for this species include enhancing protection measures stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws and increased connectivity between fragmented protected areas taxonomy and phylogeny thumb left alt an old drawing of a bengal slow loris sitting on a branch with another moving between branches in background bengal slow loris was long considered a subspecies until it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 nycticebus bengalensis commonly known as bengal slow loris or northern slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate in slow loris genus nycticebus formerly considered a subspecies of sunda slow loris n coucang it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist colin groves it is difficult to distinguish from other species in its genus to help clarify species and subspecies boundaries and to establish whether morphology based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships phylogenetic relationships within genus nycticebus have been investigated using dna sequences derived from mitochondrial markers d loop and cytochrome b although most of recognized lineages of nycticebus including n pygmaeus n menagensis and n javanicus were shown to be genetically distinct analysis suggested that dna sequences from some individuals of n coucang and n bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization as tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern thailand precise origin of one of n coucang individuals was not known this hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared variations in mitochondrial dna sequences between n bengalensis and n coucang and suggested that there has been gene flow between two species anatomy and physiology thumb right bengal slow loris has large eyes round head and short ears as shown in this illustration from mid 19th century bengal slow loris is largest species of slow loris weighing and measuring between from head to tail it has a skull length of more than it has dense woolly brown gray fur on its back and white fur on its underside it also has a clear dark stripe that runs up to top of its head but does not extend laterally towards ears its forearm and hand are almost white limbs of pelvis vary in color from brown to nearly white and feet are always pale moulting may cause seasonal variations in color of dorsal surface like other slow lorises its tail is vestigial and it has a round head and short ears it has a rhinarium moist naked surface around nostrils of nose and a broad flat face with large eyes its eyes reflect a bright orange eye shine on its front feet second digit is smaller than rest big toe on its hind foot opposes other toes which enhances its gripping power its second toe on hind foot has a curved toilet claw that animal uses for scratching and grooming while other nails are straight in addition to being smaller than bengal slow loris sympatric sunda slow loris also differs in its coloring it does not have pale areas of head nape and shoulders and its overall color is a tawny or golden brown pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus is much smaller with a skull length less than it also lacks dark dorsal stripe of bengal slow loris has dark brown fur and longer ears bengal slow loris has a small swelling on ventral side of its elbow called brachial gland which secretes a pungent clear oily toxin that animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and it has been shown that almost half of several dozen volatile or semi volatile chemicals present do not occur in closely related pygmy slow loris most predominant component was phenolic compound m authors of study suggest that chemically complex oils may help lorises communicate with each other allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex age health and nutritional status and dominance behavior and ecology thumb right bengal slow loris will gouge bark of bastard myrobala tree to obtain exudates an important food source especially in winter seasons preferred habitats of bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions and include evergreen and semi evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous dense canopies it can also be found in bamboo groves it prefers habitats with larger diameter tall trees with a large crown depth defined as length along main axis from tree tip to base of crown these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance and decreased risk of predation because of its preference for dense forests it acts as a good indicator of ecosystem s health species acts as an important seed disperser and pollinator as well as a prey item for several carnivores bengal slow loris feeds on plant exudates such as sap gums resins and particularly those from family fabaceae even though species does not have keeled nails it will scrape plant actively breaking its surface this behavior resembles that of marmosets and fork marked lemurs exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in bark winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates bastard myrobala terminalia a deciduous tree common in southeast asia is a preferred source for exudates but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families moraceae artocarpus fabaceae acacia bauhinia lecythidaceae arborea and although it will feed on large insects such as katydids and crickets gum snails small birds and reptiles it is primarily frugivorous lianas of flowering plant genus bauhinia are a commonly used food source a nocturnal animal bengal slow loris has excellent night vision enhanced by a tapetum lucidum a layer of tissue in eye that reflects visible light back through retina it sleeps during day curled up in a ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes males and females mark their territory with urine species is known to live in small family groups animals may practice social grooming reproduction bengal slow loris is not a seasonal breeder unlike pygmy slow loris females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle females reproduce every 12 18 months and have a six month gestation because they are not seasonal breeders females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old making possible for females to produce two offspring per year females typically give birth to a single offspring although twins rarely occur this differs from sympatric pygmy slow loris which commonly has twins mother carries her young about three months before they become independent although they may be temporarily left on branches while mother searches for food sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20 months of age species is known to live up to 20 years distribution species has largest geographic range of all slow loris species and is native to northeast india bangladesh and indochina cambodia laos burma vietnam southern china and thailand it is only nocturnal primate found in northeast indian states which include assam mizoram nagaland meghalaya manipur and tripura it is found in parts of yunnan and in southwest guangxi in china and has been recorded in chittagong hill tracts in bangladesh it is known from 24 protected areas in vietnam and is distributed across most of thailand in burma it has been reported from chin hills and pegu populations in laos have been recorded in north central and southern portions of country bengal slow loris is sympatric shares its range with pygmy slow loris in southeast of china vietnam and laos bengal slow loris is also sympatric with sunda slow loris on southern peninsula of thailand in 2001 groves reported existence of hybrids between these two species in this region conservation listed as data deficient as recently as 2006 on iucn red list bengal slow loris was evaluated in 2008 by international union for conservation of nature iucn as vulnerable a decision based solely on habitat loss due to lack of sufficient field data it is found within numerous protected areas within its range however poaching and illegal logging are rampant while conservation measures are not species specific species can be found in at least 43 protected areas in northeast india 14 conservation areas in laos and 24 protected areas in vietnam it can be found at national park in bangladesh and 80 of its range in china is protected species has been listed in schedule i of indian wildlife protection act of 1972 and in june 2007 it was transferred along with all other slow loris species to cites appendix i which forbids international commercial trade most severe threats facing species are wildlife trade trapping for exotic pets and use in traditional medicine and deforestation slash and burn agriculture has also resulted in destruction of its habitat and road construction is another factor in its decline hunting has been found to be most severe when nearby urban human populations increase enhancing protection measures enforcing current wildlife protection laws and improving connectivity between protected areas are factors considered critical to ensure survival of this species species is commonly sold as a pet and to zoos throughout southeast asia in cambodia it was reported in 2006 as one of most common mammals found in shops and stalls found in hundreds and selling for us 0 85 to us 6 25 in same year it was found selling for us 2 50 to us 6 30 at bazaars in china county in yunnan province and us 70 in thailand bengal slow loris is used in traditional medicine in all of these countries selling for us 15 in vietnam and is also eaten in vietnam animal is predominantly used to prepare treatments for women after childbirth stomach problems healing wounds and broken bones and in treatment of sexually transmitted diseases primary users are wealthy to middle class women in urban areas habitat and population trends throughout its geographic range slow lorises are in serious decline their habitat has been seriously degraded and growing human populations will add increasing pressure in countries like bangladesh only 9 of original forest cover was still present in 2000 in northeastern cambodia forests are being cleared at an increasing rate with a loss of 6 of natural forest between 1999 and 2000 within those same years myanmar and thailand lost 14 and 26 of their natural forest respectively in vietnam only 30 of original forest cover remains due to deforestation caused by vietnam war and only 10 of that includes closed canopy forests habitat destruction remains rampant and all slow loris populations within its borders are significantly depleted populations have been declared locally extinct in southern quang nam province and parts of highlands and same is expected in song thanh and kon cha rang nature reserves in india dense forest canopy has been depleted by as much as 55 in some areas and is rapidly disappearing as early as 1987 indo china region had reportedly lost 75 of natural habitat for slow lorises in 1992 population size was estimated between 16 000 and 17 000 individuals based on available habitat however recent publications report that few individuals remain due a reduced geographic range bengal slow loris may be restricted to a few isolated populations and is in serious threat of becoming locally extinct in parts of assam and meghalaya in arunachal pradesh its population is declining and under threat population density has been estimated between 0 03 and 0 33 individuals per km2 in assam india according to a study published in 2006 a survey in 2007 at wildlife sanctuary and wildlife sanctuary in tripura india yielded an encounter rate of 0 22 individuals km with seven of nine sightings occurring within and most of animals found at a height of and near interior of wet deciduous forest in 2008 species abundance was measured at 0 18 individuals km at gibbon wildlife sanctuary in assam since 1990s china s forests have declined significantly in yunnan and guangxi provinces primary forests are few and isolated and secondary forests have been severely degraded yunnan has lost 42 of its forests and 2 000 or less slow lorises remain in guangxi bengal slow loris is nearly extinct it has been extirpated in county and only a few individuals are left in jingxi and references literature cited bengal slow loris category mammals of bangladesh category mammals of myanmar
