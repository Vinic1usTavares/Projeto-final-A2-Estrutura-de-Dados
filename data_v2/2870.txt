was first of iau recognized dwarf planets to be discovered since pluto in 1930 its naming as a dwarf planet was delayed by several years due to controversy over who should receive credit for its discovery a california institute of technology caltech team headed by michael e brown first noticed object but a spanish team headed by jose luis ortiz moreno were first to announce it and so normally would receive credit brown accused spanish team of fraud using caltech observations without credit to make their discovery while ortiz team accused american team of political interference with international astronomical union iau iau officially recognized californian team s proposed name haumea over name proposed by spanish team ataecina in september 2008 discovery and announcement 160px thumb right michael e brown 160px thumb right precovery images of haumea were recorded as early as 1955 at palomar observatory on december 28 2004 mike brown and his team discovered haumea on images they had taken with 1 3 m smarts telescope at palomar observatory in united states on may 6 2004 while looking for what he hoped would be tenth planet caltech discovery team used nickname santa among themselves because they had discovered haumea on december 28 2004 just after christmas however it was clearly too small to be a planet because it was significantly smaller than pluto and brown did not announce discovery instead he kept it under wraps along with several other large trans neptunian objects tnos pending additional observation to better determine their natures when his team discovered haumea s moons they realized that haumea was more rocky than other tnos and that its moons were mostly ice they then discovered a small family of nearby icy tnos and concluded that these were remnants of haumea s icy mantle which had been blasted off by a collision on july 7 2005 while he was finishing paper describing discovery brown s daughter lilah was born which delayed announcement further on july 20 caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce discovery at a conference following september in this haumea was given code k40506a at around that time pablo santos sanz a student of jose luis ortiz moreno at instituto de astrofisica de andalucia at sierra nevada observatory in southern spain claims to have examined backlog of photos that ortiz team had started taking in december 2002 he says that he found haumea in late july 2005 on images taken on march 7 9 and 10 2003 he further said that in checking whether this was a known object team came across brown s internet summary describing a bright tno much like one they had just found googling reference number for object k40506a on morning of july 26 they found caltech observation logs of haumea but according to their account those logs contained too little information for ortiz to tell if they were same object ortiz team also checked with minor planet center mpc which had no record of this object wanting to establish priority they emailed mpc with their discovery on night of july 27 2005 titled big tno discovery urgent without making any mention of caltech logs next morning they again accessed caltech logs including observations from several additional nights they then asked reiner stoss at amateur astronomical observatory of mallorca for further observations stoss found precovery images of haumea in digitized palomar observatory slides from 1955 and located haumea with his own telescope that night july 28 within an hour ortiz team submitted a second report to mpc that included this new data again no mention was made of having accessed caltech logs data was published by mpc on july 29 in a press release on same day ortiz team called haumea tenth planet on july 29 2005 haumea was given its first official label temporary designation 2003 el61 with 2003 based on date of spanish discovery image on september 7 2006 it was numbered and admitted into official minor planet catalogue as 136108 2003 el61 reaction to announcement same day as mpc publication brown s group announced discovery of another kuiper belt object more distant and brighter and apparently larger than pluto as tenth planet announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall possibility of similar events with that discovery when mpc told them that their observational data was publicly accessible and they realized that not only haumea data but by that time their eris data had been publicly accessed same day ortiz announced discovery of haumea brown submitted his own draft with data on first of its moons that he had discovered on january 26 2005 to astrophysical journal brown though disappointed at being scooped congratulated ortiz team on their discovery he apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of haumea with his announcement of eris and explained that someone had accessed their data and he was afraid of being scooped again ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed data upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at sierra nevada observatory that had accessed his observation logs day before discovery announcement logs which included enough information to allow ortiz team to precover haumea in their 2003 images brown came to suspect fraud he emailed ortiz on august 9 and asked for an explanation ortiz responded saying that brown s penchant for hiding objects had alienated other astronomers and harmed science see timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moons to verify typical time scale of observation and publication of discoveries on august 15 caltech team filed a formal complaint with iau accusing ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of caltech data and asked mpc to strip them of discovery status ortiz later admitted he had accessed caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object brown began to wonder if spanish team had actually identified haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log noting that ortiz team claimed to have sat on their data for a period of 28 months until brown s upload of his abstract then coincidentally identified haumea within six days prior to accessing his abstract official naming thumb 200px a representation of iberian goddess ataecina which had been proposed as a name for dwarf planet iau protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to mpc with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination and that credited discoverer has priority in naming it this was ortiz et al and they proposed name ataecina an iberian goddess of underworld she is equivalent of roman goddess proserpina who was in turn one of pluto s lovers however as a chthonic deity ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in a stable orbital resonance with neptune see astronomical naming conventions and haumea s resonance if know of by spanish team was unstable following guidelines established by iau that classical kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation in september 2006 caltech team submitted formal names from hawaiian mythology to iau for both 136108 2003 el61 and its moons in order to pay homage to place where satellites were discovered names were proposed by david rabinowitz of caltech team haumea is tutelary goddess of island of hawaii where mauna kea observatory is located in addition she is identified with papa goddess of earth and wife of wakea space which is appropriate because 2003 el61 is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock without thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known kuiper belt objects lastly haumea is goddess of fertility and childbirth with many children who sprang from different parts of her body this corresponds to swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off dwarf planet during an ancient collision two known moons also believed to have been born in this manner were thus named after two of haumea s daughters hiiaka and namaka dispute over who had discovered object delayed acceptance of either name on 17 september 2008 iau announced that two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets committee on small body nomenclature csbn and working group for planetary system nomenclature wgpsn had decided on caltech proposal of haumea at csbn outcome of voting was very close eventually being decided by a single vote however date of discovery was listed on announcement as march 7 2003 location of discovery as sierra nevada observatory and name of discoverer was left blank aftermath brian g marsden head of mpc at harvard who had supported brown on previous naming disputes again supported brown saying that sooner or later posterity will realise what happened and mike brown will get full credit he went on to state in reference to name of discoverer which was left blank in iau listing that it s deliberately vague about discoverer of object we don t want to cause an international incident he called whole controversy worst since early 17th century dispute over who found four biggest satellites of jupiter between galileo galilei and simon marius ultimately won by galileo ortiz team objected suggesting that if ataecina were not accepted iau could at least have chosen a third name favoring neither party and accusing iau of political bias rumors appeared that dagda name of a god from irish mythology and a neutral name was indeed proposed by a member of but was not used in end ortiz went on to say i am not happy i think iau decision is unfortunate and sets a bad precedent spanish newspaper abc went on to call decision a us conquest asserting that politics played a major role as us had 10 times more astronomers in iau than spain had immediately after announcement of name brown noted that it is unusual to be allowed to name an object without being acknowledged as its official discoverer but declared that he is pleased with outcome and that he think s this is as good a resolution as we ll get he did get full recognition for discovery of two moons hiiaka and namaka on fifth anniversary of discovery he wrote a blog post with his thoughts on importance of discovery but did not mention any events regarding controversy references external links mike brown s planets haumea mike brown s blog on controversy la historia de ataecina vs haumea pablo sanz s
