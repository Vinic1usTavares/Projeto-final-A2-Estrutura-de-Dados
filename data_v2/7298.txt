production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was

hiatus in 1999 he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as biggest british hit in history of cinema with earnings equalling 363 million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to his golden globe nominated performance were varied with salon com s stephanie zacharek criticising that grant s performance stands as an emblem of what s wrong with notting hill what s maddening about grant is that he just never cuts crap he s become one of those actors who s all shambling self caricature from his twinkly crow s feet to time lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out film provided both its stars a chance to satirise woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grant s turn as a faux journalist who sits through a dull press junket with what new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fish out of water mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at box office and garnered its actor producer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in los angeles times said if he d been on titanic fewer lives would have been lost if he d accompanied robert scott to south pole explorer would have lived to be 100 that s how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures adding caddish roles 2000 2004 while promoting woody allen s small time crooks 2000 on nbc s today show in 2000 grant told host matt lauer it s my millennium of bastards small time crooks starred grant in words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant faux pygmalion art dealer david who is one of sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation in 2000 grant also joined supervisory board of im ag powerful munich based film and media company in 2001 his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget jones s diary was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a star s polished posh and nice poster image as any comic turn in memory film adapted from helen fielding s novel of same name was an international hit earning 281 million worldwide he was according to washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind male god s countenance that he knows all too well in 2002 grant s immaculate comic performance bbc as trust funded womaniser will freeman in film adaptation of nick hornby s best selling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy award nominated screenplay about a boy 2002 was determined by washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote acid comedy of grant s performance carries film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after blockbuster star wars episode ii attack of clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of 129 million globally film earned grant his third golden globe nomination while london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of magazine s men of year 2002 his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and self awareness new york observer concluded film gets most of its laughs from evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words and with an english accent besides in end film comes over as a messy delight thanks to skill generosity and good sport punching bag panache of mr grant s performance about a boy also marked a notable change in his boyish look now 41 he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment

romantic comedy and accumulated 246 million at international box office it marked directorial debut of richard curtis who told new york times that grant adamantly tempered characterisation of role to make his character more authoritative and less charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much self confidence that he plays british prime minister as if he took role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on contrary called his performance an bachelor spin on tony blair as star flirted with himself in paroxysm of self love that has become his acting style in 2004 he reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than 262 million commercially mid career experimentation 2006 2015 thumb grant in brussels october 2008 gone from screen for two years grant next re teamed with paul weitz about a boy for black comedy

mr grant takes mr cowell s villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his self aggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy self loathing boston globe proposed that this just may be great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as preening bad guy as he was as bumbling good guy in 2007 he starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and music industry called music and lyrics associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that s simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play piano dance a few mannered steps and studied mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has been pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley lesser known member of 1980s pop duo wham film with its revenues totalling 145 million allowed him to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed up lead character according to san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely right note

in his late fifties has turned out to have a gift for conveying what happens to an individual when charm curdles into something considerably darker grant was nominated for several awards for his performance including primetime emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie screen persona grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a one trick pony eric fellner co owner of working title films and a long time collaborator said his range hasn t been fully tested but each performance is unique many of grant s films in 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films he was adept at plugging into stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic mugging stuttering fluttering eyelids she added he s got more tics than benny hill his penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson opined in new biographical dictionary of film that grant equated merely itchy mannerisms with screen acting david thomson a new biographical dictionary of film london little brown 2002 p 352 published in new york by knopf on his choice of roles grant has said grant s screen persona in his films of 2000s gradually developed into a cynical self loathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with observation that finally gone were self conscious aren t i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget jones s diary and about a boy and dreads possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frederic chopin in james lapine s biopic film impromptu in 2012 he played six incredibly evil characters in epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said personality grant has expressed boredom with playing celebrity in press and is known in media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough he has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a 2007 vogue profile referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique he has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend box office numbers saying it s so destructive to filmmaking process what was wrong with way they used to release films more slowly let them build director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that s gorgeous and kind of woolly and filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a self confessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role someone who works hard to make it look easy though that isn t a trait he admires in himself he is noted by co workers for

paparazzo for news of world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at daily mail and news of world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks nee wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that cameron s inaction could be explained by self interest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win election so that was my submission to parliament that cameron s either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdoch s journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists 20 per cent of met has taken from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and what s wrong with that anyway it doesn t hurt anyone particularly grant s article attracted considerable interest due to both revelatory content of taped conversation and novelty of his turning tables on a tabloid journalist whilst allegations regarding news of world continued to receive coverage in broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio 4 it was only with revelation that voicemail of by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that coverage turned from media
