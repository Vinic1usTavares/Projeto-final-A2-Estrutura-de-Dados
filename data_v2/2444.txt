called meta breed and series main antagonist ebon is an unusually powerful meta human as a living shadow he is able to create inter dimensional portals and can manipulate pure darkness and shadows as well as transport others to various locations of his choice production series was produced by warner bros animation based on milestone media dc comics character static its supervising producer was alan burnett and scott was main producer under executive production of jean and sander schwartz production team was mostly composed of people who were involved with batman animated series and superman animated series but also included static s co creator denys cowan although show hired comic series co creator dwayne mcduffie as story editor and writer mcduffie had no direct involvement on development of static shock idea of a static cartoon first emerged with dc s editor in chief jenette kahn during time mcduffie was working for milestone under kahn in 1993 kahn proposed to adapt some milestone comics burnett was hired to write a pilot episode for an x men esque series with milestone superheroes called new guard after attempts to produce several other milestone projects static was eventually series they went for by time milestone and dc drafted their contract over dc distributing milestone comics characters were from separate fictional universes however when crossovers between static shock and other dc animated series were suggested it was established that they were from same dc animated universe rather than having to muck around with multiple dimensions or whatever although mcduffie stressed that show remains loyal to spirit and tone of comic book some changes were done because of its timeslot and target audience of pre teens for example guns appeared less frequently richie is not portrayed as homosexual and he is virgil s confidant instead of frieda virgil is also younger in animated series his costumes and use of his powers are different than original and his mother is dead in show despite fact that she is alive in comics latter change was done because producers had intention to focus on a strong complex relationship between an african american father and son nevertheless mcduffie was concerned by change because he originally intended to oppose stereotype of black people not having a complete nuclear family however mcduffie said that it worked out okay as crew could use absence of virgil s mother to create a couple of great stories virgil s father robert for all intents and purposes is a new character as he was reconceptualized as a social worker same goes for richie who is described as an amalgam of different characters from original comic for villains was reused from static comics edwin alva was brought from another milestone s series hardware and group meta breed was created for tv series third season of show saw some of biggest changes in addition to richie s superhero powers and a new opening static changed his costume cowan stated that change was done to give his clothes a feel of comic book while mcduffie said it represented a growth that virgil was passing through this maturation made possible to explore some of darker places in his world to have more varied conflicts as villains have also become more mature he described it is as a natural outgrowth of all that as is new more naturalistic look of show this change followed second season premiere big leagues when static meets batman and robin burnett said after that show everybody went let s go in that direction writer john semper jr commented of course i always lean toward dramatic but same old light hearted static spirit is still there richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into story and producers wanted to keep chemistry between voice actors lamarr and marsden there was also a positive response from children in focus groups so t he answer seemed pretty obvious series music director was richard wolf while he stanley clarke and max gousse were composers and kennard ramsey was orchestrator for action sequences wolf wanted to use real adrenaline pumping beat of 125 beats per minute however hip hop music usually only reached 110 beats predominant score was electronica with some hip hop type and dmx type vocals r b and classic hip hop melodies were also used depending on scenes and each character had a specific theme wolf composed opening theme for first two seasons starting from third season show had a new opening theme written by master p and lil romeo and performed by latter release static shock
