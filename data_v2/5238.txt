make an ideal subject to base a game on later virgin agreed to issue game in a september 1992 interview for french magazine generation 4 charles cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for revolution s third game after 1992 s lure of temptress and 1994 s then upcoming beneath a steel sky game would be set in paris with a templar story line following month cecil visited paris to research templars after reading holy blood and holy grail he was certain there was enough known about templars to make them a good subject for a game cecil dave cummins and jonathan howard began work on story and design cecil and cummins attended a film writing course and their script was read by alan drury a senior bbc scriptwriter and dramatist revolution artist steve ince created initial location sketches for game before working on beneath a steel sky he was promoted to producer halfway through project despite releasing pc version virgin was not interested in publishing game on playstation feeling that only 3d games would sell for console as a result cecil contacted sony computer entertainment who agreed to release game for console in north america broken sword was renamed to circle of blood cecil was uneasy about name change feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was in 1998 however thq published game on playstation platform under its original broken sword shadow of templars title thumb left upright charles cecil creator and director of broken sword series alt a man in a white shirt one of cecil s goals was to depart from humorous adventure games more popular at time such as lucasarts monkey island series by creating a game with good pacing and a complex storyline a reason he thought knights templar would be an ideal subject unlike lucasarts games which used a question and answer conversation system broken sword offered conversation icons that would not reveal to player what protagonist was about to say cecil s intention was to make game more cinematic but not resemble interactive movies of that time he felt that they were mimicking movies he wanted to create two protagonists who would exchange ideas helping drive game along he made george american and nico french to appeal to us and european markets team at revolution had high expectations for broken sword but there was significant competition revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games but believed they needed to utilise best of other creative industries eoghan cahill and neil breen of dublin s don bluth studios drew backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in photoshop introductory sequence and main characters were done by animator mike burgess who worked for red rover animation studio game s graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films cecil contacted composer barrington pheloung who agreed to create game s score around time of game s release pheloung stated virgin would probably have been happy with a main theme and a few cues but i thought that rather than creating an orchestral score like for a movie i could make one which interacted with game so i ve written over three hours of music which is unique in genre and over 400 cues he scored music for orchestra and added structural elements by breaking it up into sampled pieces revolution had already cast hazel ellerby as nicole collard but had trouble finding a voice actor for george stobbart hazel who went to guildhall school of music and drama in london suggested her former schoolmate from guildhall rolf saxon as george charles offered him job and saxon accepted remaining credited voice actors in original are rachel atkins david bannerman rosy clayton jack elliott steve hodson david holt peter kenny richard matthew marsh colin mcfarlane don gavin muir paul panting and andrew wincott cecil was game s director and writer tony warriner and david sykes designer programmers and noirin carmody executive producer game uses

directors and screenwriters from films such as harry potter casino royale and x men in july 2008 cecil said he was conversing with small studios from los angeles although he was interested in making a film he believed that it was not necessary since series was already successful and a bad film could only damage its reputation cecil said that he was not prepared to give somebody he doesn t know editorial control and that should film be created he would write it himself he wanted any adaptation to be true to source material a film that enhances game rather than cashes in on it in may 2009

lot of affection and a number of them know a lot about brand as well however he restated his opinion that it would be much better not to have a movie at all than to have a bad movie while cecil said that revolution s main focus was upcoming broken sword serpent s curse he added that he was sure there would be a film at some point he also said that he was sure it will be really good because they
