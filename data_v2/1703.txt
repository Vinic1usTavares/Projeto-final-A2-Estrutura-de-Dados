keegan up front and started to become frustrated and disillusioned in club emergence of liverpool native jimmy case further reduced kennedy s chances of playing up front but paisley felt kennedy could perform as a midfielder and after kennedy replaced an injured peter cormack against middlesbrough on 1 november he went on to make number five shirt his own for rest of decade his new position allowed

much brain we didn t gel on pitch alan blamed nerves for his difficulty in finding kennedy with accurate passes kennedy also began to face problems off pitch resulting in both he and jimmy case being arrested after they attacked a hotelier who had confused kennedy for his namesake alan pair plead guilty to affray and were fined ps150 each despite this and other similar incidents kennedy did manage to avoid his off field antics affecting his form or discipline on pitch kennedy later said it was a good friendship but we were bad for each other liverpool finished two points clear of second place
