hms thunderer was one of two turret ships built for royal navy in 1870s she suffered two serious accidents before decade was out and gained a reputation as an unlucky ship for several years afterward ship was assigned to mediterranean fleet in 1878 and was reduced to reserve in 1881 before being recommissioned in 1885 thunderer returned home in 1887 and was again placed in reserve she rejoined mediterranean fleet in 1891 but was forced to return to uk by boiler problems following year ship became a coast guard ship in wales in 1895 and was again placed in reserve in 1900 thunderer was taken out of service in 1907 and sold for scrap in 1909 background and description thumb left right elevation and plan from brassey s naval annual 1888 devastation class was designed as an enlarged ocean going version of earlier gardiner pp 81 82 ships had a length between perpendiculars of and were long overall they had a beam of and a draught of devastation class ships displaced their crew consisted of 358 officers and ratings they proved to be steady gun platforms and good seaboats albeit quite wet forward their low forecastle caused them problems with head seas and limited their speed in such conditions chesneau kolesnik p 23 thunderer had two humphry tennant two cylinder horizontal direct acting steam engines using steam provided by eight rectangular boilers each engine driving a single propeller engines were designed to produce a total of for a speed of burt p 12 but thunderer reached a maximum speed of from during her sea trials parkes p 200 ship carried a maximum of of coal enough to steam at thumb left thunderer s forward turret as first constructed with manual ramming devastation class was armed with four rml rifled muzzle loading guns one pair in each of gun turrets positioned fore and aft of superstructure shortly after completion thunderers forward turret s weapons were replaced by more powerful rml guns parkes p p 13 while both gun turrets were rotated by steam power new forward guns were loaded by hydraulic power unlike original guns which were hand worked thunderer was first ship to have hydraulic loading gear parkes pp 195 96 from 1874 forward turret alone was converted to hydraulic power operation for training turret traverse elevation and ramming this allowed turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28 aft turret remaining hand worked as a comparison hodges p 19 power operation was considered successful although it was later implicated in 1879 explosion devastation class ships had a complete wrought iron waterline armour belt that was 12 inches thick amidships and tapered to outside armoured citadel towards ends of ship armour plates were tapered to a thickness of at their bottom edges respectively and they extended from upper deck to below waterline armoured citadel protected bases of gun turrets funnel uptakes and crew s quarters sides of citadel were 12 inches thick around bases of turrets and 10 inches thick elsewhere turrets were protected by two plates separated by a layer of teak with turret face having thicker armour parkes pp 195 199 magazine were protected by a 6 inch forward bulkhead and a one aft conning tower ranged in thickness from 9 to 6 inches in thickness ships had a complete upper deck that was reinforced by another thick inside citadel construction and career thumb thunderer at anchor before 1879 thunderer fifth ship of her name to serve in royal navy colledge p 351 was laid down on 26 june 1869 at pembroke dockyard wales silverstone p 272 construction was subsequently halted for a time in 1871 to modify ship to improve her stability and buoyancy by extending breastwork to cover full width of hull which increased ship s freeboard amidships and provided additional accommodation for crew ship was launched on 25 march 1872 by mrs mary meyrick wife of thomas meyrick mp two years later she was transferred to portsmouth dockyard to finish fitting out phillips pp 199 201 thumb left inspection of boilers after their explosion on 14 july 1876 thunderer suffered a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people one of her boilers burst as she proceeded from portsmouth harbour to stokes bay to carry out a full power trial explosion killed 15 people instantly including her commanding officer around 70 others were injured of whom 30 later died this was royal navy s most deadly boiler explosion through whole century a model representing failed boiler was made and is now in science museum london explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and safety valve had corroded in place when steam stop valve to engines was closed pressure in boiler rose and could not be released mcewen pp 182 84 four box boilers were last in service in navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure for more modern boilers of boiler was repaired and ship was completed on 26 may 1877 at a cost of 428 parkes p 195 thunderer was commissioned in may 1877 for service with reserve fleet particular service squadron and was then assigned to channel squadron during this time she was fitted with experimental torpedoes parkes p 202 she sailed for mediterranean in 1878 under command of captain alfred chatfield phillips p 202 thumb left diagrams showing how gun burst ship suffered another serious accident in january 1879 when left 12 inch 38 ton gun in forward turret exploded during gunnery practice in sea of marmora killing 11 and injuring a further 35 muzzle loading gun had been double loaded following a misfire according to admiral of fleet e h seymour both turret guns were being fired simultaneously and evidently one did not go off it may seem hard to believe such a thing could happen and not be noticed but from my own experience i understand it men in turret often stopped their ears and perhaps their eyes at moment of firing and then instantly worked run in levers and did not notice how much guns had recoiled this no doubt occurred both guns were at once reloaded and rammer s indicator working by machinery set fast and failed to show how far new charge had gone parkes p 198 accident contributed to royal navy changing to breech loading guns which could be more conveniently worked from inside turrets gardiner p 98 fragments of destroyed gun were re assembled and displayed to public at woolwich arsenal committee of inquiry decided that gun had been double loaded but this view was widely questioned including by sir william palliser designer of palliser shell used by these guns palliser s view instead was that shot had been obstructed by a portion of millboard disc rammed above shell hydraulic power ramming was thought to be implicated in double loading as telescopic hydraulic rammer had not made double loading obvious as a manual ramrod would have done one piece of evidence supporting double loading theory was presence of an additional stud torn from a palliser shell found amongst wreckage within turret thunderer was then regarded as an unlucky ship and was placed in reserve at malta in 1881 and had her machinery overhauled her armament was augmented with a pair of torpedo launchers and a half dozen 1 inch 25 mm nordenfelt guns on hurricane deck she was recommissioned in 1885 and remained with mediterranean fleet until she was paid off at chatham dockyard parkes pp 201 02 future king george v served aboard thunderer in 1885 86 phillips p 208 ship was assigned to portsmouth reserve in january 1888 before beginning a major modernisation following year her guns were replaced by four breech loading 10 inch guns to improve her defence against torpedo boats her nordenfelt guns were replaced by six quick firing qf 6 pounder and eight qf 3 pounder hotchkiss guns thunderers machinery was replaced by inverted triple expansion steam engines and cylindrical boilers their increased output of increased her speed to and their more economical consumption of coal allowed coal storage to be reduced to parkes p 201 ship rejoined mediterranean fleet in march 1891 but was forced to return home in september 1892 with persistent boiler problems and she was reduced to chatham reserve thunderer became guard ship at pembroke dock in may 1895 and remained there until she returned to chatham reserve in december 1900 ship was refitted there as an emergency ship in 1902 but was taken out of service five years later thunderer was sold for scrap for ps19 500 on 13 september 1909 winfield lyon p 255 devastation class became more popular among civilian population and in royal navy as ships got older rear admiral john wilson a former captain of ship stated in a meeting of royal united services institute discussing most acceptable types of battleship in 1884 i also agree with my friend captain colomb that we have no type of ship to my fancy equal to or good old thunderer give me thunderer hull of thunderer she had bad engines she was not arranged as i would like inside she was badly gunned as we all know and she had not enough light gun or sufficient armaments but she carried of coal could steam at 10 knots from here to cape and could fight any ship of her class on salt
