admiralty control but after being fitted with defensive equipment was allowed to continue normal operations in november 1941 ship rescued german survivors of engagement between kormoran and hmas sydney centaur was relocated to australia s east coast in october 1942 and used to transport materiel to new guinea in january 1943 centaur was handed over to australian military for conversion into a hospital ship as ship s small size made her suitable for operating in maritime southeast asia refit including installation of medical facilities and repainting with red cross markings was completed in march and ship undertook a trial voyage transporting wounded from townsville to brisbane then from port moresby to brisbane after replenishing in sydney centaur embarked 2 12th field ambulance for

of 332 aboard died in attack 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later incident resulted in public outrage as attacking a hospital ship is considered a war crime under 1907 hague convention protests were made by australian and british governments to japan and efforts were made to discover people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal in 1970s probable identity of attacking submarine i 177 became public reason for attack is unknown with theories that centaur was in breach of international conventions that should have protected her that i 177s commander was unaware that centaur was a hospital ship or that submarine commander knowingly attacked a protected vessel wreck of centaur was found on 20 december 2009 a claimed discovery in 1995 had been proven to be a

milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 25 hospital ship refit at beginning of 1943 centaur was placed at disposal of australian department of defence for conversion to a hospital ship conversion was performed by united ship services in melbourne australia and was initially estimated to cost 000 smith three minutes of time p 21 cost increased to almost 000 for a variety of reasons it was originally intended for ship to travel between ports in new guinea and townsville queensland australia increasing casualty numbers in new guinea campaign meant that hospitals in queensland would quickly become unable to deal with quantity of casualties and nature of their injuries so a longer voyage to sydney was required army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities hot water made available to all parts of ship through installation of a rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas and

runs between east coast of australia and new guinea carrying materiel milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 26 1943 with commencement of hostilities between japan and british empire it became clear that three hospital ships currently serving australia manunda wanganella and oranje would not be able to operate in shallow waters typical of maritime southeast asia so a new hospital ship was required smith three minutes of time p 19 of australian merchant navy vessels able to operate in this region none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship and a request to british ministry of shipping placed centaur at disposal of australian military on 4 january 1943 conversion work began on 9 january and centaur was commissioned as an australian hospital ship on 1 march

responsibility although centaurs sinking was a war crime no one was tried for sinking hospital ship investigations into attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948 and included interrogation of commanders of submarines operating in australian waters at time their superiors plus junior officers and crewmen from submarines who had survived war several of investigators suspected that nakagawa

australian hospital ship centaur pp 196 214 historians were divided on which submarine was responsible milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur pp 214 5 in royal australian navy 1942 1945 published in 1968 as part of series detailing australian official history of world war ii george hermon gill concluded that either i 178 or i 180 was responsible former was more likely as she had served in australian waters longest of any japanese submarine at time but had claimed no kills in three month period surrounding centaurs sinking in 1972 german military historian jurgen rohwer claimed in chronology of war at sea that i 177 torpedoed centaur based on a japanese report stating that i 177 had attacked a ship on 14 may 1943 in area hospital ship had sunk rohwer and hummelchen

and i 177s role in loss of centaur dennis et al oxford companion to australian military history p 124 nakagawa who died in 1991 refused to speak about attack on centaur following war crimes

attack was a breach of tenth hague convention of 1907 and as such was a war crime frame no pleasure cruise p 187 sinking of centaur drew strong reactions from both prime minister curtin and general douglas macarthur curtin stated that sinking was an entirely inexcusable act undertaken in violation of convention to which japan is a party and of all principles of common humanity adam smith australian women at war p 174 macarthur reflected common australian view when he stated that sinking was an example of japanese limitless savagery all in pp 134 5 politicians urged public to use their rage to fuel war effort and centaur became a symbol of australia s determination to defeat what appeared to be a brutal and uncompromising enemy milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p of veterans affairs sinking of centaur commemoration australian government produced posters depicting sinking which called for australians to avenge nurses by working to produce materiel purchasing war bonds or enlisting in armed forces people also expressed their sympathy towards crew with several efforts to fund a new hospital ship established councillors of caulfield victoria organised a fund to replace lost medical equipment opening with a donation of aups2 000 those who worked on centaurs conversion contributed money towards a replacement and employees of ansett airways pledged to donate an hour s pay towards fitting out of such a replacement with some people unable to believe that japanese would be so ruthless rumours began to spread almost immediately after news of attack was made public most common rumour was that centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos at time of her sinking with japanese made aware of this prior to her departure frame no pleasure cruise p 177 this stemmed from an incident involving ambulance drivers weapons during loading in sydney military reaction attack was universally condemned by australian servicemen who commonly believed that attack on centaur had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status jenkins battle surface p 282 similar reactions were expressed by other allied personnel united states army air forces

milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur pp 189 92 conversion was performed although efforts by department of navy admiralty and authorities in new zealand and united states of america caused completed conversion to be undone cost of roundabout work came to ps12 500 and kept manunda out of service for three months milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 192 on 9 june 1943 communications between combined chiefs of staff on subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to manunda incident as a response to attack on centaur with conclusion that attack was work of an irresponsible japanese commander and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering removal of hospital ship markings milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 191 when consideration was made that ambulance drivers weapons incident just prior to centaur s voyage may have been partially responsible for attack it led to tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship quasi medical staff like repatriation teams were no longer permitted on hospital ships ambulance drivers had to transfer from regular army to australian army medical corps before they were allowed aboard although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition goodman our war nurses p 197 official protests after consultation with australian armed forces general macarthur admiralty and australian government an official protest was sent milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 187 this was received by japanese government on 29 may 1943 at around same time international committee of red cross sent a protest on behalf of major allied red cross organisations to japanese red cross on 26 december 1943 a response to australian protest arrived it stated that japanese government had no information justifying allegation made and therefore took no responsibility for what happened reply counter protested that nine japanese hospital ships had been attacked by allies although these claims were directed against united states not australia although several later exchanges were made lack of progress saw british government inform australian prime minister on 14 november 1944 that no further communications would be made on loss of centaur milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 194 theories for attack torpedo attacks in australian waters were common at this time with 27 japanese submarines operating in australian waters between june 1942 and december 1944 jenkins battle surface p 286 these submarines attacked almost 50 merchant vessels with 20 ships confirmed to be sunk as result of a japanese attack plus 9 more unconfirmed this was part of a concentrated effort to disrupt supply convoys from australia to new guinea milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 68 several actions on centaurs part may have contributed to her demise centaur was under orders to sail well out to sea until reaching great barrier reef her course keeping her between from shore milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 87 centaurs master believing he had been given a route intended for a merchant vessel set a course closer to land but on seaward side of in depth milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 88 also centaur was sailing completely illuminated with exception of two bow floodlights which had been switched off as they interfered with visibility from bridge there are three main theories as to why centaur was attacked legitimate target this theory stems from various rumours spreading after centaurs sinking if centaur had been in breach of hague convention of 1907 and someone had informed japanese of this i 177 may have been under valid orders to attack milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 232 when centaur left sydney her decks were packed with green uniformed men and as field ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other army uniforms by badge insignia and colouration of cloth band ringing hat a distant observer could have concluded that hospital ship was transporting soldiers milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur pp 75 85 those witnessing loading in sydney would have seen ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard and could have come to a similar conclusion if a spy or informant had passed this information to japanese i 177 could have been lying in wait main flaw in this theory is question of how nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine new route selected milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 233 similar but later rumours included that during her first voyage centaur had transported soldiers to new guinea or japanese prisoners of war back to australia for interrogation and consequently had been marked as a legitimate target by japanese milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 227 centaur had carried 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from new guinea but as they were all wounded personnel transporting them on a hospital ship was legal milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 65 mistaken target this theory states that nakagawa was unaware that vessel he was attacking was a hospital ship and that sinking was an unfortunate accident jenkins battle surface p 280 this view was supported by several japanese officers both before and after revelation that nakagawa was responsible amongst them was lieutenant commander orita who took command of i 177 after nakagawa orita did not hear anything from crew about having sunk a hospital ship not even rumours and believed that if i 177 had knowingly attacked centaur he would have learned this from crew s gossip when compared to other contemporary australian hospital ships centaur was smallest approximately a third of size of manunda or wanganella centaur was also slightly shorter than i 177 observation of centaur was made through a periscope and submarine officers attest that at optimum range of attack for world war ii era japanese submarines some officers would not be able to clearly identify a target ship s profile or hull markings jenkins battle surface p 283 with centaurs bow floodlights out and with observation of target made through periscope there is a possibility nakagawa would not have seen hospital ship s markings if he had been in wrong position apart from two bow floodlights centaur was lit up brilliantly to attack i 177 would have had to approach from abeam of centaur which was illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon intentional target this theory states that nakagawa was fully aware that his target was a hospital ship and decided to sink her regardless either on his own initiative or on a poor interpretation of his orders milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 235 researchers speculate that as nakagawa was approaching end of his tour in australian waters and had only sunk a single enemy vessel 8 742 ton freighter limerick he did not want to return with disgrace of a single kill other claims include that nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for casualties inflicted by allies during battle of bismarck sea or may have expected praise for sinking of an enemy naval vessel milligan and foley australian hospital ship centaur p 236 in february 1944 while in command of i 37 nakagawa ordered machine gunning of survivors from three british merchant vessels torpedoed by his submarine on 22 february on 24 february and on 29 february his defence that he was acting under orders from vice admiral shiro takasu was not accepted and he was sentenced to four years imprisonment at prison as a class b war criminal jenkins battle surface p 284 these incidents showed that nakagawa was willing to ignore laws of war shipwreck following world war ii several searches of waters around north stradbroke and moreton islands failed to reveal centaurs location it was believed that she had sunk off edge of continental shelf to a depth at which royal australian navy did not have capability to search for a vessel of centaurs size department of defence navy findings of search for ex army hospital ship ahs centaur some parties also believed that rippon s calculated point of sinking was inaccurate either intentionally or through error several points were incorrectly identified as location where centaur sank first was in war diary situation report entry for hospital ship s sinking which gives east of rippon s position milligan foley australian hospital ship centaur p 239 according to milligan and foley this likely occurred because an estimated distance from brisbane
