character yearns for bullfighter s presence with erotic heartbreak in an interview with mtv s kurt loder on set of music video madonna said that when she was initially writing take a bow inspiration for song was an actor but she wanted male character in video to be a matador instead because she wanted video to be about an obsessive tragic love story that doesn t work out in end and a matador would be more visually effective in expressing emotion of song thumb left plaza de toros de ronda where bullfighting scenes were shot madonna arrived in ronda in november 1994 with a team of 60 people and wanted to shoot at in city however her request was rejected by real de of ronda royal cavalry brotherhood of ronda who considered it as a desecration of arenas if madonna would have filmed there

in her underwear as she watches munoz on television in bullring torero kills bull and then comes home and physically and emotionally abuses madonna video can be viewed as a statement on classism supposing bullfighter feels threatened and angered by aristocrat s station resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her style of music video has been compared to spanish director

collection 2009 analysis and impact like some of madonna s previous music videos such as la isla bonita and like a prayer religious imagery plays a big role in music video in book madonna s drowned worlds use of catholic imagery in video is discussed author santiago fouz hernandez points out that unlike madonna s previous music videos much of religious imagery is associated with torero not madonna due to fact that religious images are a strong part of bullfighting ritual it has also been argued that in video madonna subverts gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting this is achieved through feminization of matador and emphasis on madonna s character and also through madonna s dominant gaze as she watches matador perform roger beebe one of authors of medium cool music videos from to cellphones noted that video was an example of how music image and lyrics of a song possesses their own temporality he explained that graceful nature of song was contrast to repetitive scenes in video which he felt indicated that protagonist has long been engaging in activities including demoralizing sex scenes in madonna as postmodern myth author georges claude guilbert felt video defied feminists of marilyn frye and adrienne rich variety who see in video a disgusting example of passe female submissiveness madonna responded to this criticism by stating i don t believe that any organization should dictate to me what i can and cannot do artistically guilbert also noted usage of religious iconography in video especially dubious representation of virgin he explained that most of times madonna and torero make love through television screen implying that one of their purity had to be maintained always when discussing take a bow npr multimedia senior producer keith jenkins said music video with its rich sensually framed sepia tones doesn t leave much to imagination but rather it becomes your imagination with madonna s vision drill ed into your brain unlocking your waking eye carol vernallis author of experiencing music video aesthetics and cultural context noted that video exemplified lyrics of song she clarified that scenes featuring madonna and munoz dressing up and putting on their gloves pointed to storyline and lyrics that appeared later lyrics being all world loves a clown during that line munoz as torero is seen with a fatuous expression which vernallis deduced as beginning of story of possession and fame in video when madonna sings i ve always been in love with you she appeared in video as sometimes adolescent and sometimes middle aged for vernallis it was not clear if imagery was literal or figurative of lyrics embodying a lasting affection as separate parts of madonna s psyche or as exaggerated claims of a groupie author also noted that scene where madonna pricks her hand with a needle makes her relationship with torero as more ambiguous costumes and melody in video reminded vernallis of 1904 opera madame butterfly by giacomo puccini although with an inverted plotline scenes showing madonna in an enclosed room with a single light bulb also drew comparisons to glenn close s character in 1987 psychological thriller film fatal attraction another observation by vernallis was about power struggle it showed in video with madonna gradually losing and relegated to one corner of room take a bow video was a source of inspiration for justin timberlake s music video for his 2006 single sexyback according to timberlake he decided to work with director michael haussman on his sexyback video because take a bow is one of his favorite madonna videos he went on to say even today i still remember visuals images how he captured her a lot of times madonna seems like she s person in control and in that video she seemed vulnerable it was a cool thing to see according to director dave meyers music video for britney spears 2009 single radar is a tribute to madonna s take a bow video when speaking of spears and radar video meyers explained we were looking for a way to take her into a contemporary classy environment i felt empowered by referencing madonna s take a bow video britney hasn
