55 cancri is a binary star system located 41 light years away from sun in zodiac constellation of cancer it has bayer designation rho1 cancri r1 cancri 55 cancri is flamsteed designation abbreviated 55 cnc system consists of a k type star designated 55 cancri a also named copernicus and a smaller red dwarf 55 cancri b five extrasolar planets designated 55 cancri b c d e and f named galileo brahe lipperhey janssen and harriot respectively are believed to orbit 55 cancri a nomenclature 55 cancri is system s flamsteed designation it also bears bayer designation r1 cancri latinised to rho1 cancri and bright star catalogue designation hr 3522 two components are designated a and b though a is itself sometimes referred to as 55 cancri first planet discovered orbiting 55 cancri a was designated hr by its discoverers though it is more commonly referred to as 55 cancri b under rules for naming objects in binary star systems it should be named 55 cancri ab and this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with secondary star 55 cancri b other planets discovered were designated 55 cancri c d e and f in order of their discovery in july 2014 international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars nameexoworlds an iau worldwide contest to name exoplanets and their host stars iau org 9 july 2014 process involved public nomination and voting for new names nameexoworlds process in december 2015 iau announced winning names were copernicus for 55 cancri a and galileo brahe lipperhey janssen and harriot for its planets b c d e and f respectively final results of nameexoworlds public vote released international astronomical union 15 december 2015 winning names were those submitted by royal netherlands association for meteorology and astronomy of netherlands they honor astronomers nicolaus copernicus galileo galilei tycho brahe and thomas harriot and spectacle makers and telescope pioneers hans lipperhey and janssen nameexoworlds approved names iau originally announced winning name was lippershey for 55 cancri d in january 2016 in recognition that his actual name was lipperhey with lippershey an error introduced in 19th century exoplanet name was corrected to lipperhey by iau and that name was submitted to official sites that keep track of astronomical information in 2016 iau organized a working group on star names wgsn to catalog and standardize proper names for stars in its first bulletin of july 2016 wgsn explicitly recognized names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by executive committee working group public naming of planets and planetary satellites including names of stars adopted during 2015 nameexoworlds campaign this star is now so entered in iau catalog of star names stellar system 55 cancri system is located fairly close to solar system gaia astrometry satellite measured parallax of 55 cancri a as 79 4274 milliarcseconds corresponding to a distance of 12 59 parsecs 41 06 light years 55 cancri a has an apparent magnitude of 5 95 making it just visible to naked eye under very dark skies red dwarf 55 cancri b is of 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 au one thousand times distance from earth to sun despite their wide separation two stars appear to be gravitationally bound as they share a common proper motion primary star 55 cancri a has a spectral type of v indicating a main sequence or subgiant star it is smaller in radius and slightly less massive than sun and so is cooler and less luminous star has only low emission from its chromosphere and is not variable in visible spectrum but it is variable in x rays it is more enriched than sun in elements heavier than helium with 186 solar abundance of iron it is therefore classified as a rare super metal rich smr star this abundance of metal makes estimating star s age and mass difficult as evolutionary models are less well defined for such stars age estimates for 55 cancri a include 7 4 8 7 billion years and 10 2 2 5 billion years a hypothesis for high metal content in smr dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk this would pollute star s external layers resulting in a higher than normal metallicity lack of a deep convection zone would mean that outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements observations of 55 cancri a in submillimeter region of spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust upper limit on emissions within 100 au of this star is about 850 at a wavelength of 850 mm this limits total mass of fine dust around star to less than 0 01 of earth s mass however this does not exclude presence of an asteroid belt or a kuiper belt equivalent secondary 55 cancri b is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than sun there are indications that component b may itself be a double star though this is uncertain planetary system thumb left comparison of orbits of inner planets of 55 cancri a black with planets of solar system 55 cancri system was first known to have four and later five planets and may possibly have more innermost planet e transits 55 cancri a as viewed from earth next planet b is non transiting but there is tentative evidence that it is surrounded by an extended atmosphere that does transit star in 1997 discovery of a 51 pegasi like planet orbiting 55 cancri a was announced together with planet of tau bootis and inner planet of upsilon andromedae planet was discovered by measuring star s radial velocity which showed a periodicity of around 14 7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78 of mass of jupiter these radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted for by this planet which could be explained by gravitational influence of a more distant object in 1998 discovery of a possible dust disk around 55 cancri a was announced calculations gave disk radius at least 40 au similar to kuiper belt in solar system with an inclination of 25deg with respect to plane of sky however discovery could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious caused instead by background galaxies thumb solar system compared with planetary system of 55 cancri note this depiction was made before planets e and f were discovered after making further radial velocity measurements a planet orbiting at a distance of around 5 au was announced in 2002 this planet received designation 55 cancri d at time of discovery planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity close to 0 1 but this value was increased by later measurements even after accounting for these two planets a periodicity at 43 days remained possibly due to a third planet measurements of star suggested that this was close to star s rotation period which raised possibility that 43 day signal was caused by stellar activity this possible planet received designation 55 cancri c thumb left artist s rendition of 55 cnc s planets 55 cancri e was announced in 2004 with 8 3 earth masses it is a large super earth which was originally thought to have an orbital period of 2 8 days though it was later found that this was an alias of its true period of 0 74 days by observations of e transiting in 2011 this planet was first known instance of a fourth extrasolar planet in one system and was shortest period planet until discovery of psr j1719 1438 b measurements that led to discovery of this planet also confirmed existence of 55 cancri c in 2005 jack wisdom combined three data sets and drew two distinct conclusions that 2 8 day planet was an alias and that there was a neptune scale planet with a period near 261 days fischer et al 2008 reported new observations that they said confirmed existence of 2 8 day planet as first reported by mcarthur et al 2004 and a 260 day neptune sized planet as first reported by wisdom 2005 however dawson and 2010 concluded that 2 8 day planet was indeed an alias as suggested by wisdom 2005 and that correct period was 0 days in 2007 fisher et al confirmed existence of 260 day planet proposed in 2005 by wisdom this planet 55 cancer f was first occurrence of a fifth extrasolar planet in one system with a similar mass to c it has a 260 day orbit towards inner edge of 55 cancri a s habitable zone planet itself is not thought to be conducive to life but hypothetical moons in principle could maintain at least microbial life planet e s eccentricity is poorly defined varying values between 0 and 0 4 does not significantly improve fit so an eccentricity of 0 2 was assumed taking interactions between planets into account results in a near zero orbital eccentricity astrometric observations with hubble space telescope measured an inclination of 53deg of outer planet d though this result relies on precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9deg to line of sight and a possible detection of transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 cancri b would if confirmed imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge on between them no measurement of c s nor f s inclination has been made it had been thought that with five planets system cannot deviate far from coplanar in order to maintain stability an attempt to measure spin orbit misalignment of innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit but this interpretation of data has since been challenged by a subsequent study with noted inconsistencies between implied and measured stellar rotation approximate ratios of periods of adjacent orbits are proceeding outward 1 20 1 3 1 6 1 20 nearly 1 3 ratio between 55 cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance rather than a genuine mean motion resonance more planets are possible within stable zone between f and d at 0 9 to 3 8 au with eccentricities below 0 4 given hypothetical planet g of up to 50 earth masses stable mean motion resonance regions lie at 3f 2g 2g 1d and 3g 2d as for space outside d s orbit its stability zone begins beyond 10 au though there is a stability zone between 8 6 9 au due to a 2 1 resonance communication a meti message was sent to 55 cancri it was transmitted from eurasia s largest radar 70 meter 230 foot eupatoria planetary radar message was named cosmic call 2 it was sent on july 6 2003 and it will arrive at 55 cancri in may 2044 see also 51 pegasi kepler 11 lists of exoplanets mu psr b1257 12 upsilon
