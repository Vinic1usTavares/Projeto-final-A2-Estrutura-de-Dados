galileo di vincenzo de galilei ref https com humanities biography of galileo galilei biography of galileo galilei biography of galileo galilei ref 15 february 1564 8 january 1642 was an italian astronomer physicist and engineer sometimes described as a polymath from pisa galileo has been called father of observational astronomy father of modern physics father of scientific method thomas hobbes critical assessments volume 1 preston king 1993 p 59 and father of modern science galileo studied speed and velocity gravity and free fall principle of relativity inertia projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology describing properties of pendulums and hydrostatic balances inventing thermoscope and various military compasses and using telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects his contributions to observational astronomy include telescopic confirmation of phases of venus observation of four largest satellites of jupiter observation of saturn s rings and analysis of sunspots galileo s championing of heliocentrism and copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime when most subscribed to geocentric models such as tychonic system he met with opposition from astronomers who doubted heliocentrism because of absence of an observed stellar parallax matter was investigated by roman inquisition in 1615 which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish and absurd in philosophy and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places sense of holy scripture galileo later defended his views in dialogue concerning two chief world systems 1632 which appeared to attack pope urban viii and thus alienated him and jesuits who had both supported galileo up until this point he was tried by inquisition found vehemently suspect of heresy and forced to recant he spent rest of his life under house arrest while under house arrest he wrote two new sciences in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials early life and family galileo was born in pisa then part of duchy of florence italy on 15 february 1564 first of six children of vincenzo galilei a famous lutenist composer and music theorist and giulia nee who had married in 1562 galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority john gribbin fellowship gilbert bacon harvey wren newton and story of scientific revolution overlook press 2008 p 26 value of well measured or quantified experimentation an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm as well as results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment three of galileo s five siblings survived infancy youngest michelangelo or michelagnolo also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during galileo s young adulthood michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father s promised dowries to their brothers in law who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions these financial burdens may have contributed to galileo s early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income when galileo galilei was eight his family moved to florence but he was left with jacopo borghini for two years he was educated from 1575 to 1578 in abbey about 30 km southeast of florence name galileo tended to refer to himself only by his first name at time surnames were optional in italy and his given name had same origin as his sometimes family name galilei both his given and family name ultimately derive from an ancestor galileo bonaiuti an important physician professor and politician in florence in 15th century his descendants had come to refer to themselves as galilei in his honor in late 14th century who was galileo galilei galileo bonaiuti was buried in same church basilica of santa croce in florence where about 200 years later his more famous descendant galileo galilei was also buried robin santos doak galileo astronomer and physicist capstone 2005 p 89 when he did refer to himself with more than one name it was sometimes as galileo galilei a reference to his being a member of of lincei an elite pro science organization in italy it was common for mid sixteenth century tuscan families to name eldest son after parents surname hence galileo galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor galileo bonaiuti italian male given name galileo and thence surname galilei derives from latin galilaeus meaning of galilee a biblically significant region in northern israel because of that region adjective galilaios greek galilaios latin galilaeus italian galileo which means galilean has been used in antiquity particularly by emperor julian to refer to christ and his followers against after this adjective has been adopted as a name with a meaning similar to jesus or christian biblical roots of galileo s name and surname were to become subject of a famous pun in 1614 during galileo affair one of galileo s opponents dominican priest tommaso caccini delivered against galileo a controversial and influential sermon in it he made a point of quoting acts ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven children thumb upright galileo s elder daughter virginia was particularly devoted to her father despite being a genuinely pious roman catholic galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with marina gamba they had two daughters virginia born 1600 and livia born 1601 and a son vincenzo born 1606 because of their illegitimate birth their father considered girls if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries which would have been similar to galileo s previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters their only worthy alternative was religious life both girls were accepted by convent of san matteo in arcetri and remained there for rest of their lives virginia took name maria celeste upon entering convent she died on 2 april 1634 and is buried with galileo at basilica of santa croce florence livia took name sister and was ill for most of her life vincenzo was later legitimised as legal heir of galileo and married career as a scientist although galileo seriously considered priesthood as a young man at his father s urging he instead enrolled in 1580 at university of pisa for a medical degree in 1581 when he was studying medicine he noticed a swinging chandelier which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs to him it seemed by comparison with his heartbeat that chandelier took same amount of time to swing back and forth no matter how far it was swinging when he returned home he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together it was not until work of christiaan huygens almost one hundred years later that nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece asimov isaac 1964 asimov s biographical encyclopedia of science and technology up to this point galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician however after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine he created a thermoscope a forerunner of thermometer and in 1586 published a small book on design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented which first brought him to attention of scholarly world galileo also studied disegno a term encompassing fine art and in 1588 obtained position of instructor in accademia delle arti del disegno in florence teaching perspective and chiaroscuro being inspired by artistic tradition of city and works of renaissance artists galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality while a young teacher at accademia he began a lifelong friendship with florentine painter who included galileo s lunar observations in one of his paintings in 1589 he was appointed to chair of mathematics in pisa in 1591 his father died and he was entrusted with care of his younger brother michelagnolo in 1592 he moved to university of padua where he taught geometry mechanics and astronomy until 1610 during this period galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science for example kinematics of motion and astronomy as well as practical applied science for example strength of materials and pioneering telescope his multiple interests included study of astrology which at time was a discipline tied to studies of mathematics and astronomy theory of tides thumb upright 8 left galileo galilei portrait by domenico tintoretto cardinal bellarmine had written in 1615 that copernican system could not be defended without a true physical demonstration that sun does not circle earth but earth circles sun galileo considered his theory of tides to provide such evidence this theory was so important to him that he originally intended to call his dialogue on two chief world systems dialogue on ebb and flow of sea reference to tides was removed from title by order of inquisition for galileo tides were caused by sloshing back and forth of water in seas as a point on earth s surface sped up and slowed down because of earth s rotation on its axis and revolution around sun he circulated his first account of tides in 1616 addressed to cardinal orsini his theory gave first insight into importance of shapes of ocean basins in size and timing of tides he correctly accounted for instance for negligible tides halfway along adriatic sea compared to those at ends as a general account of cause of tides however his theory was a failure if this theory were correct there would be only one high tide per day galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at venice instead of one about 12 hours apart galileo dismissed this anomaly as result of several secondary causes including shape of sea its depth and other factors albert einstein later expressed opinion that galileo developed his fascinating arguments and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of motion of earth galileo also dismissed idea known from antiquity and by his contemporary johannes kepler that moon caused tides galileo also took no interest in kepler s elliptical orbits of planets james robert voelkel composition of kepler s astronomia nova princeton university press 2001 p drake essays on galileo and history and philosophy of science volume 1 university of toronto press 1999 p 343 galileo continued to argue in favour of his theory of tides also in dialogue fourth considering it ultimate proof of earth s motion controversy over comets and assayer in 1619 galileo became embroiled in a controversy with father grassi professor of mathematics at jesuit collegio romano it began as a dispute over nature of comets but by time galileo had published assayer il saggiatore in 1623 his last salvo in dispute it had become a much wider controversy over very nature of science itself title page of book describes galileo as philosopher and matematico of grand duke of tuscany because assayer contains such a wealth of galileo s ideas on how science should be practised it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto early in 1619 father grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet an astronomical disputation on three comets of year 1618 which discussed nature of a comet that had appeared late in november of previous year grassi concluded that comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from earth and since it moved in sky more slowly than moon it must be farther away than moon grassi s arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article discourse on comets published under name of one of galileo s disciples a florentine lawyer named mario guiducci although it had been largely written by galileo himself galileo and guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken correct approach to study of comets had been proposed at time by tycho brahe in its opening passage galileo and guiducci s discourse gratuitously insulted jesuit christoph scheiner and various uncomplimentary remarks about professors of collegio romano were scattered throughout work jesuits were offended and grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own astronomical and philosophical balance under pseudonym lothario purporting to be one of his own pupils assayer was galileo s devastating reply to astronomical balance it has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature in which s arguments are subjected to withering scorn it was greeted with wide acclaim and particularly pleased new pope urban viii to whom it had been dedicated in rome in previous decade barberini future urban viii had come down on side of galileo and lincean academy galileo s dispute with grassi permanently alienated many of jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas and galileo and his friends were convinced that these jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation evidence for this is at best equivocal however controversy over heliocentrism thumb cristiano banti s 1857 painting galileo facing roman inquisition in whole world prior to galileo s conflict with church majority of educated people subscribed either to aristotelian geocentric view that earth was center of universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around earth or tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism opposition to heliocentrism and galileo s writings combined scientific and religious objections scientific opposition came from tycho brahe and others and arose from fact that if heliocentrism were true an annual stellar parallax should be observed though none was at time only in 1838 friedrich bessel was able to observe it accurately copernicus and aristarchus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because stars were so distant however tycho had countered that since stars appeared to have measurable angular size if stars were that distant and their apparent size was due to their physical size they would be far larger than sun in fact it is not possible to observe physical size of distant stars without modern telescopes in tycho s system stars were a little more distant than saturn and sun and stars were comparable in size religious opposition to heliocentrism arose from biblical references such as psalm 93 1 96 10 and 1 chronicles 16 30 which include text stating world also is established it can not be moved in same manner psalm 104 5 says he lord laid foundations of earth that it should not be moved forever further ecclesiastes 1 5 states sun also rises and sun goes down and hurries to its place where it rises and joshua 10 14 states sun stand still on galileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609 sidereus nuncius 1610 in december 1613 grand duchess christina of florence confronted one of galileo s friends and followers benedetto castelli with biblical objections to motion of earth according to maurice finocchiaro this was done in a friendly and gracious manner out of curiosity prompted by this incident galileo wrote a letter to castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts and that bible was an authority on faith and morals not on science this letter was not published but circulated widely two years later galileo wrote a letter to christina herself that expanded his arguments previously made in eight pages to forty pages by 1615 galileo s writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to roman inquisition by father niccolo lorini who claimed that galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret bible which was seen as a violation of council of trent and looked dangerously like protestantism lorini specifically cited galileo s letter to castelli galileo went to rome to defend himself and his copernican and biblical ideas at start of 1616 monsignor francesco ingoli initiated a debate with galileo sending him an essay disputing copernican system galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in action against copernicanism that followed according to maurice finocchiaro ingoli had probably been commissioned by inquisition to write an expert opinion on controversy and essay provided chief direct basis for inquisition s actions essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism it borrowed primarily from arguments of tycho brahe and it notedly mentioned tycho s argument that heliocentrism required stars to be much larger than sun ingoli wrote that great distance to stars in heliocentric theory clearly proves fixed stars to be of such size as they may surpass or equal size of orbit circle of earth itself essay also included four theological arguments but ingoli suggested galileo focus on physical and mathematical arguments and he did not mention galileo s biblical ideas in february 1616 an inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be foolish and absurd in philosophy and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places sense of holy scripture inquisition found that idea of earth s movement receives same judgement in philosophy and in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith pope paul v instructed cardinal bellarmine to deliver this finding to galileo and to order him to abandon opinion that heliocentrism was physically true on 26 february galileo was called to bellarmine s residence and ordered to abandon completely opinion that sun stands still at center of world and earth moves and henceforth not to hold teach or defend it in any way whatever either orally or in writing decree of congregation of index banned copernicus s de revolutionibus and other heliocentric works until correction bellarmine s instructions did not prohibit galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea so long as he did not advocate for its physical truth for next decade galileo stayed well away from controversy he revived his project of writing a book on subject encouraged by election of cardinal maffeo barberini as pope urban viii in 1623 barberini was a friend and admirer of galileo and had opposed admonition of galileo in 1616 galileo s resulting book dialogue concerning two chief world systems was published in 1632 with formal authorization from inquisition and papal permission earlier pope urban viii had personally asked galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in book and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism he made another request that his own views on matter be included in galileo s book only latter of those requests was fulfilled by galileo whether unknowingly or deliberately simplicio defender of aristotelian geocentric view in dialogue concerning two chief world systems was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool indeed although galileo states in preface of his book that character is named after a famous aristotelian philosopher simplicius in latin simplicio in italian name simplicio in italian also has connotation of simpleton this portrayal of simplicio made dialogue concerning two chief world systems appear as an advocacy book an attack on aristotelian geocentrism and defence of copernican theory unfortunately for his relationship with pope galileo put words of urban viii into mouth of simplicio most historians agree galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by reaction to his book however pope did not take suspected public ridicule lightly nor copernican advocacy galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters pope and was called to rome to defend his writings in september 1632 he finally arrived in february 1633 and was brought before inquisitor vincenzo to be charged throughout his trial galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of condemned opinions and initially he denied even defending them however he was eventually persuaded to admit that contrary to his true intention a reader of his dialogue could well have obtained impression that it was intended to be a defence of copernicanism in view of galileo s rather implausible denial that he had ever held copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in dialogue his final interrogation in july 1633 concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell truth but he maintained his denial despite threat sentence of inquisition was delivered on 22 june it was in three essential parts galileo was found vehemently suspect of heresy though he was never formally charged with heresy relieving him of facing corporal ronald l ed galileo goes to jail and other myths about science and religion no 74 harvard university press 2009 77 namely of having held opinions that sun lies motionless at centre of universe that earth is not at its centre and moves and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to holy scripture he was required to abjure curse and detest those opinions he was sentenced to formal imprisonment at pleasure of inquisition on following day this was commuted to house arrest which he remained under for rest of his life galileo galileo stanford encyclopedia of philosophy brief biography his offending dialogue was banned and in an action not announced at trial publication of any of his works was forbidden including any he might write in future thumb portrait attributed to murillo of galileo gazing at words e pur si muove and yet it moves not legible in this image scratched on wall of his prison cell according to popular legend after recanting his theory that earth moved around sun galileo allegedly muttered rebellious phrase and yet it moves a 1640s painting by spanish painter bartolome esteban murillo or an artist of his school in which words were hidden until restoration work in 1911 depicts an imprisoned galileo apparently gazing at words e pur si muove written on wall of his dungeon earliest known written account of legend dates to a century after his death but stillman drake writes there is no doubt now that famous words were already attributed to galileo before his death after a period with friendly piccolomini archbishop of siena galileo was allowed to return to his villa at arcetri near florence in 1634 where he spent part of his life under house arrest galileo was ordered to read seven penitential psalms once a week for next three years however his daughter maria celeste relieved him of burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself it was while galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works two new sciences here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier on two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials published in holland to avoid censor this book has received high praise from albert einstein galileo is father of modern physics indeed of modern science albert einstein quoted in stephen hawking ed p 398 on shoulders of giants as a result of this work galileo is often called father of modern physics he went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia so he was permitted to travel to florence for medical advice dava sobel argues that prior to galileo s 1633 trial and judgement for heresy pope urban viii had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life in this context sobel argues that problem of galileo was presented to pope by court insiders and enemies of galileo having been accused of weakness in defending church urban reacted against galileo out of anger and fear death thumb left tomb of galileo santa croce florence galileo continued to receive visitors until 1642 when after suffering fever and heart palpitations he died on 8 january 1642 aged 77 grand duke of tuscany ferdinando ii wished to bury him in main body of basilica of santa croce next to tombs of his father and other ancestors and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour thumb upright 0 5 middle finger of galileo s right hand these plans were dropped however after pope urban viii and his nephew cardinal francesco barberini protested because galileo had been condemned by catholic church for vehement suspicion of heresy monumental tomb of galileo institute and museum of history of science florence italy retrieved 15 february 2010 he was instead buried in a small room next to novices chapel at end of a corridor from southern transept of basilica to sacristy he was reburied in main body of basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour during this move three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains section of room vii galilean iconography and relics museo galileo accessed on

on line 27 may 2011 scientific contributions scientific methods galileo made original contributions to science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics more typical of science at time were qualitative studies of william gilbert on magnetism and electricity galileo s father vincenzo galilei a lutenist and music theorist had performed experiments establishing perhaps oldest known non linear relation in physics for a stretched string pitch varies as square root of tension these observations lay within framework of pythagorean tradition of music well known to instrument makers which included fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale thus a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science and young galileo could see his own father s observations expand on that tradition galileo was one of first modern thinkers to clearly state that laws of nature are mathematical in assayer he wrote philosophy is written in this grand book universe it is written in language of mathematics and its characters are triangles circles and other geometric figures his mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers which galileo learned when he studied philosophy his work marked another step towards eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion a major development in human thought he was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation in order to perform his experiments galileo had to set up standards of length and time so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion this provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning galileo showed a modern appreciation for proper relationship between mathematics theoretical physics and experimental physics he understood parabola both in terms of conic sections and in terms of ordinate y varying as square of x galileo further asserted that parabola was theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in absence of air resistance or other disturbances he conceded that there are limits to validity of this theory noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of earth could not possibly be a parabola but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to range of artillery of his day deviation of a projectile s trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight astronomy thumb galileo showed doge of venice how to use telescope fresco by giuseppe thumb it was on this page that galileo first noted an observation of moons of jupiter this observation upset notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around earth galileo published a full description in sidereus nuncius in march 1610 thumb phases of venus observed by galileo in 1610 based only on uncertain descriptions of first practical telescope which hans lippershey tried to patent in netherlands in 1608 galileo in following year made a telescope with about 3x magnification he later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification with a galilean telescope observer could see magnified upright images on earth it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass he could also use it to observe sky for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose on 25 august 1609 he demonstrated one of his early telescopes with a magnification of about 8 or 9 to venetian lawmakers his telescopes were also a profitable sideline for galileo who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade he published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in march 1610 in a brief treatise entitled sidereus nuncius starry messenger kepler s supernova tycho and others had observed supernova of 1572 ottavio s letter of 15 january 1605 to galileo brought 1572 supernova and less bright nova of 1601 to galileo s notice galileo observed and discussed kepler s supernova in 1604 since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax galileo concluded that they were distant stars and therefore disproved aristotelian belief in immutability of heavens jupiter s moons on 7 january 1610 galileo observed with his telescope what he described at time as three fixed stars totally invisible by their smallness all close to jupiter and lying on a straight line through it observations on subsequent nights showed that positions of these stars relative to jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars on 10 january galileo noted that one of them had disappeared an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind jupiter within a few days he concluded that they were orbiting jupiter he had discovered three of jupiter s four largest moons he discovered fourth on 13 january galileo named group of four medicean stars in honour of his future patron cosimo ii de medici grand duke of tuscany and cosimo s three brothers later astronomers however renamed them galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer these satellites were independently discovered by simon marius on 8 january 1610 and are now called io europa ganymede and callisto names given by marius in his mundus iovialis published in 1614 galileo s observations of satellites of jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to principles of aristotelian cosmology which held that all heavenly bodies should circle earth and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that galileo could have discovered such a thing his observations were confirmed by observatory of christopher clavius and he received a hero s welcome when he visited rome in 1611 galileo continued to observe satellites over next eighteen months and by mid 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods a feat which kepler had believed impossible venus saturn and neptune from september 1610 galileo observed that venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of moon heliocentric model of solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since orbit of venus around sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face earth when it was on opposite side of sun and to face away from earth when it was on earth side of sun on other hand in ptolemy s geocentric model it was impossible for any of planets orbits to intersect spherical shell carrying sun traditionally orbit of venus was placed entirely on near side of sun where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases it was however also possible to place it entirely on far side of sun where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases after galileo s telescopic observations of crescent gibbous and full phases of venus ptolemaic model became untenable thus in early 17th century as a result of his discovery great majority of astronomers converted to one of various geo heliocentric planetary models such as tychonic capellan and extended capellan models each either with or without a daily rotating earth these all had virtue of explaining phases of venus without vice of refutation of full heliocentrism s prediction of stellar parallax galileo s discovery of phases of venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to two stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo heliocentrism galileo observed planet saturn and at first mistook its rings for planets thinking it was a three bodied system when he observed planet later saturn s rings were directly oriented at earth causing him to think that two of bodies had disappeared rings reappeared when he observed planet in 1616 further confusing him ron historical background of saturn s rings jet propulsion laboratory california institute of technology nasa retrieved on 11 march 2007 galileo also observed planet neptune in 1612 it appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars he did not realise that it was a planet but he did note its motion relative to stars before losing track of it sunspots thumb galileo s telescopes at museo galileo florence galileo made naked eye and telescopic studies of sunspots chapter 2 p 77 drawing of large sunspot seen by naked eye by galileo and shown in same way to everybody during days 19 20 and 21 august 1612 their existence raised another difficulty with unchanging perfection of heavens as posited in orthodox aristotelian celestial physics an apparent annual variation in their trajectories observed by francesco and others in 1612 1613 also provided a powerful argument against both ptolemaic system and system of tycho brahe a dispute over claimed priority in discovery of sunspots and in their interpretation led galileo to a long and bitter feud with jesuit christoph scheiner in middle was mark to whom scheiner had announced his discovery and who asked galileo for his opinion in fact there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by david fabricius and his son johannes moon thumb galileo s moon illustrations from sidereus nuncius published in venice 1610 on november 30th 1609 galileo aimed his telescope at moon while not being first person to observe moon through a telescope english mathematician thomas harriot had done it four months before but only saw a strange galileo was first to deduce cause of uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters in his study he also made topographical charts estimating heights of mountains moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere as aristotle claimed and hardly first planet an eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into heavenly as put forth by dante galileo is sometimes credited with discovery of lunar libration in latitude in 1632 although thomas harriot or william gilbert might have done it before milky way and stars galileo observed milky way previously believed to be nebulous and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from earth to be clouds he located many other stars too distant to be visible with naked eye he observed double star in ursa major in 1617 in starry messenger galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light essentially unaltered in appearance by telescope and contrasted them to planets which telescope revealed to be discs but shortly thereafter in his letters on sunspots he reported that telescope revealed shapes of both stars and planets to be quite round from that point forward he continued to report that telescopes showed roundness of stars and that stars seen through telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter he also devised a method for measuring apparent size of a star without a telescope as described in his dialogue concerning two chief world systems his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to star and measure maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure star from his measurements of this distance and of width of rope he could calculate angle subtended by star at his viewing point in his dialogue he reported that he had found apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5 6 arcseconds like most astronomers of his day galileo did not recognise that apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion and did not represent true sizes of stars however galileo s values were much smaller than previous estimates of apparent sizes of brightest stars such as those made by tycho brahe and enabled galileo to counter anti copernican arguments such as those made by tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable other astronomers such as simon marius giovanni battista riccioli and martinus hortensius made similar measurements of stars and marius and riccioli concluded smaller sizes were not small enough to answer tycho s argument engineering thumb galileo s geometrical and military compass thought to have been made c 1604 by his personal instrument maker marc antonio mazzoleni galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering as distinct from pure physics between 1595 and 1598 galileo devised and improved a geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors this expanded on earlier instruments designed by niccolo tartaglia and del monte for gunners it offered in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately a way of quickly computing charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials as a geometric instrument it enabled construction of any regular polygon computation of area of any polygon or circular sector and a variety of other calculations under galileo s direction instrument maker marc antonio mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses which galileo sold along with an instruction manual he wrote for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in use of compasses for 120 lire in 1593 galileo constructed a thermometer using expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube thumb left a replica of earliest surviving telescope attributed to galileo galilei on display at griffith observatory in 1609 galileo was along with englishman thomas harriot and others among first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars planets or moons name telescope was coined for galileo s instrument by a greek mathematician giovanni at a banquet held in 1611 by prince federico cesi to make galileo a member of his accademia dei lincei rosen edward naming of telescope 1947 in 1610 he used a telescope at close range to magnify parts of insects by 1624 galileo had used a compound microscope he gave one of these instruments to cardinal in may of that year for presentation to duke of bavaria and in september he sent another to prince cesi played a role again in naming microscope a year later when fellow academy member giovanni faber coined word for galileo s invention from greek words micron meaning small and skopein skopein meaning to look at word was meant to be analogous with telescope van helden al galileo timeline last updated 1995 galileo project retrieved 28 august 2007 illustrations of insects made using one of galileo s microscopes and published in 1625 appear to have been first clear documentation of use of a compound microscope in 1612 having determined orbital periods of jupiter s satellites galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits one could use their positions as a universal clock and this would make possible determination of longitude he worked on this problem from time to time during remainder of his life but practical problems were severe method was first successfully applied by giovanni domenico cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys this method for example was used to survey france and later by zebulon pike of midwestern united states in 1806 for sea navigation where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer such as that of john harrison longitude true story of a lone genius who solved greatest scientific problem of his time dava sobel penguin 1996 late in his life when totally blind galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock called galileo s escapement although no clock using this was built until after first fully operational pendulum clock was made by christiaan huygens in 1650s galileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding in 1630 mario guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a scheme by to cut a new channel for river near florence physics thumb galileo e viviani 1892 tito thumb dome of cathedral of pisa with lamp of galileo galileo s theoretical and experimental work on motions of bodies along with largely independent work of kepler and rene descartes was a precursor of classical mechanics developed by sir isaac newton galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums it is popularly believed thanks to biography by vincenzo viviani that these began by watching swings of bronze chandelier in cathedral of pisa using his pulse as a timer later experiments are described in his two new sciences galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is i e that its swings always take same amount of time independently of amplitude in fact this is only approximately true as was discovered by christiaan huygens galileo also found that square of period varies directly with length of pendulum galileo s son vincenzo sketched a clock based on his father s theories in 1642 clock was never built and because of large swings required by its verge escapement would have been a poor timekeeper galileo is lesser known for yet still credited with being one of first to understand sound frequency by scraping a chisel at different speeds he linked pitch of sound produced to spacing of chisel s skips a measure of frequency in 1638 galileo described an experimental method to measure speed of light by arranging that two observers each having lanterns equipped with shutters observe each other s lanterns at some distance first observer opens shutter of his lamp and second upon seeing light immediately opens shutter of his own lantern time between first observer s opening his shutter and seeing light from second observer s lamp indicates time it takes light to travel back and forth between two observers galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile he was unable to determine whether or not light appeared instantaneously galileo galilei two new

similarly inconclusive result i bernard cohen roemer and first determination of velocity of light 1676 isis 31 1940 327 379 we now know that speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods with human shutter openers on earth galileo put forward basic principle of relativity that laws of physics are same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line regardless of its particular speed or direction hence there is no absolute motion or absolute rest this principle provided basic framework for newton s laws of motion and is central to einstein s special theory of relativity falling bodies a biography by galileo s pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of same material but different masses from leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass this was contrary to what aristotle had taught that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones in direct proportion to weight while this story has been retold in popular accounts there is no account by galileo himself of such an experiment and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place an exception is drake who argues that experiment did take place more or less as viviani described it experiment described was actually performed by simon stevin commonly known as and jan cornets de groot although building used was actually church tower in delft in 1586 galileo galilei falling bodies experiment last accessed 26 december 2011 however most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced in any case observations that similarly sized objects of different weights fell at same speed is documented in works as early as those of john philoponus in sixth century and which galileo was aware of lemons don s drawing physics 2 600 years of discovery

comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration as long as resistance of medium through which it was falling remained negligible or in limiting case of its falling through a vacuum he also derived correct kinematical law for distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest namely that it is proportional to square of elapsed time d t 2 prior to galileo nicole oresme in 14th century had derived times squared law for uniformly accelerated change and domingo de soto had suggested in 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated soto however did not anticipate many of qualifications and refinements contained in galileo s theory of falling bodies he did not for instance recognise as galileo did that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity galileo expressed time squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words adhering to standards of day it remained for others to re express law in algebraic terms he also concluded that objects retain their velocity in absence of any impediments to their motion thereby contradicting generally accepted aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so called violent unnatural or forced motion so long as an agent of change mover continued to act on it philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by john philoponus and jean buridan galileo stated imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction then we know from what has been more fully explained in preceding pages that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual provided plane has no limits this was incorporated into newton s laws of motion first law for direction of motion newton s is straight galileo s is circular for example planets motion around sun which according to him and unlike newton takes place in absence of gravity dijksterhuis e j mechanization of world picture iv 121 oxford university press 1961 mathematics while galileo s application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative his mathematical methods were standard ones of day including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion square root method passed down from fibonacci and archimedes analysis and proofs relied heavily on theory of proportion as set forth in fifth book of euclid s elements this theory had become available only a century before thanks to accurate translations by tartaglia and others but by end of galileo s life it was being superseded by algebraic methods of descartes concept now named galileo s paradox was not original with him his proposed solution that infinite numbers cannot be compared is no longer considered useful legacy later church reassessments galileo affair was largely forgotten after galileo s death and controversy subsided inquisition s ban on reprinting galileo s works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works excluding condemned dialogue in florence in 1741 pope benedict xiv authorised publication of an edition of galileo s complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of dialogue in 1758 general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from index of prohibited books although specific ban on uncensored versions of dialogue and copernicus s de revolutionibus remained all traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from index interest in galileo affair was revived in early 19th century when protestant polemicists used it and other events such as spanish inquisition and myth of flat earth to attack roman catholicism interest in it has waxed and waned ever since in 1939 pope pius xii in his first speech to pontifical academy of sciences within a few months of his election to papacy described galileo as being among most audacious heroes of research not afraid of stumbling blocks and risks on way nor fearful of funereal monuments discourse of his holiness pope pius xii given on 3 december 1939 at solemn audience granted to plenary session of academy discourses of popes from pius xi to john paul ii to pontifical academy of sciences 1939 1986 vatican city p 34 his close advisor of 40 years professor robert leiber wrote pius xii was very careful not to close any doors to science prematurely he was energetic on this point and regretted that in case of galileo robert leiber pius xii stimmen der zeit november 1958 in pius xii frankfurt 1959 p 411 on 15 february 1990 in a speech delivered at sapienza university of rome cardinal ratzinger later pope benedict xvi cited some current views on galileo affair as forming what he called a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep self doubt of modern age of science and technology goes today some of views he cited were those of philosopher paul feyerabend whom he quoted as saying church at time of galileo kept much more closely to reason than did galileo himself and she took into consideration ethical and social consequences of galileo s teaching too her verdict against galileo was rational and just and revision of this verdict can be justified only on grounds of what is politically opportune cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with feyerabend s assertions he did however say it would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on basis of such views on 31 october 1992 pope john paul ii expressed regret for how galileo affair was handled and issued a declaration acknowledging errors committed by catholic church tribunal that judged scientific positions of galileo galilei as result of a study conducted by pontifical council for culture in march 2008 head of pontifical academy of sciences nicola announced a plan to honour galileo by erecting a statue of him inside vatican walls in december of same year during events to mark 400th anniversary of galileo s earliest telescopic observations pope benedict xvi praised his contributions to astronomy a month later however head of pontifical council for culture gianfranco ravasi revealed that plan to erect a statue of galileo on grounds of vatican had been suspended impact on modern science according to stephen hawking galileo probably bears more of responsibility for birth of modern science than anybody else and albert einstein called him father of modern science stephen hawking galileo and birth of modern science

uffizi florence galileo s early works describing scientific instruments include 1586 tract entitled little balance la describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water and 1606 printed manual le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare on operation of a geometrical and military compass his early works on dynamics science of motion and mechanics were his circa 1590 pisan de motu on motion and his circa 1600 paduan le mechanics former was based on aristotelian archimedean fluid dynamics and held that speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to excess of a body s specific weight over that of medium whereby in a vacuum bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights it also subscribed to impetus dynamics in which impetus is self dissipating and free fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration galileo s 1610 starry messenger sidereus nuncius was first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope it reported his discoveries of galilean moons roughness of moon s surface existence of a large number of stars invisible to naked eye particularly those responsible for appearance of milky way differences between appearances of planets and those of fixed stars former appearing as small discs while latter appeared as points of light galileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled letters on sunspots suggesting sun and heavens are corruptible letters on sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of full set of phases of venus and his discovery of puzzling appendages of saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance in 1615 galileo prepared a manuscript known as letter to grand duchess christina which was not published in printed form until 1636 this letter was a revised version of letter to castelli which was denounced by inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with scripture in 1616 after order by inquisition for galileo not to hold or defend copernican position galileo wrote discourse on tides discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare based on copernican earth in form of a private letter to cardinal orsini in 1619 mario guiducci a pupil of galileo s published a lecture written largely by galileo under title discourse on comets discorso delle comete arguing against jesuit interpretation of comets in 1623 galileo published assayer il saggiatore which attacked theories based on aristotle s authority and promoted experimentation and mathematical formulation of scientific ideas book was highly successful and even found support among higher echelons of christian church following success of assayer galileo published dialogue concerning two chief world systems dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo in 1632 despite taking care to adhere to inquisition s 1616 instructions claims in book favouring copernican theory and a non geocentric model of solar system led to galileo being tried and banned on publication despite publication ban
