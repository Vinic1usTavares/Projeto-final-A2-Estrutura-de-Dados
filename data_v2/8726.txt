thumb daylight precision bombing advocates carl a spaatz muir s fairchild and donald m wilson at maxwell air force base in 1946 bomber mafia were a close knit group of american military men who believed that long range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war derogatory term bomber mafia was used before and after world war ii by those in military who did not share their belief and who were frustrated by insistence of men that heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding after world war ii 20 years of foundational work by bomber mafia resulted in separation of united states air force from army to become an independent military arm bomber mafia s strategic doctrine changed by war and experience helped shape mission of new air force and its strategic air command many years later a related term fighter mafia described those within air force that favoured light weight fighters good at dog fighting instead of heavy missile firing fighters origins developed over years 1926 1929 at air corps tactical school acts at langley field in virginia a forward looking doctrine of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by brigadier general william billy mitchell who advocated a greatly expanded role for bomber force after graduating from acts in 1931 mitchell protegee harold l george stayed at school to refine and teach new bombing theory soon recruiting as teachers his former students haywood s hansell donald wilson and laurence s kuter as fellow bomber advocates these four instructors core of us bomber advocacy argued that an enemy s army and navy could be defeated intact due to destruction of industrial and military targets deep within enemy held territory braxton leon e wagner arthur h 2012 birth of a legend bomber mafia and 17 pp 65 66 this theory was first espoused by italian general giulio douhet though his ideas included terror bombing of population centers that american theorists eschewed griffith charles 1999

york simon schuster pp 49 50 in contrast american theorists devised a strategy of pin point bombing that targeted enemy economy and production of weapons howard d 1999 warden and air corps tactical school what goes around comes around airpower journal fall 1999 though unproven major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly with minimal casualties and that grinding static trench warfare as seen in world war i could be avoided in november 1932 when british lord president of council stanley baldwin said bomber will always get through he was talking about terror bombing of cities us bomber mafia agreed with baldwin only in that bomber would prevail in its mission they intended mission to be against military and industrial targets not populations to effect this doctrine united states army air corps would be required to expend majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self defending heavy bombers and in training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions acts officers who believed in heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other air corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft would take away from proposed large fleet of heavy bombers moreover men realized that united states government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet to implement these changes acts instructors began to instill a sense in their students that a separate and independent air arm of type described earlier by mitchell to be called united states air force was way forward as a compromise first step general headquarters ghq air force was established within army air corps in 1935 commanded by general frank m andrews a strategic bombing advocate andrews staffed command with like minded officers such as henry h hap arnold james c 2001 electronic combat support for an expeditionary air force

col donald wilson of acts and a bomber mafia member is credited with term became primary airpower strategy of united states in planning for world war ii members of bomber mafia produced two airpower war plans awpd 1 and awpd 42 that guided wartime expansion and deployment of army air forces opposition term bomber mafia came from sometimes bitter debates between united states army staff and air corps men who observed and argued with insistence by instructors and students of acts that heavy bombers were new primary weapon of war and that a separate air arm was required to command them for first few years strongest voice at acts against bomber doctrine was captain later general george c kenney who called for use of air power to attack enemy fighting units on ground he advocated close coordination of air and ground forces with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers kenney left acts in 1929 and heavy bomber filled vacancy murray 1998 p 174 doctrine also ran counter to theories of billy mitchell himself who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations griffith p 13 as an expert in use of air units to aid artillery and infantry gordon p saville held to concept of tactical air power through his time as acts instructor from 1934 to 1936 later saville successfully implemented his ideas in mediterranean theater captain claire lee chennault senior instructor in fighter tactics at acts was a vocal air corps officer who challenged bomber mafia for more than a decade he was forced into early retirement in 1937 leaving precision bombing advocates unopposed severs 1997 teaching of fighter pursuit tactics declined though earle e partridge and hoyt s vandenberg continued to discuss role of fighter murray 1998 p 124 other opposition was more subtle usaac fighter projects officer lieutenant benjamin s kelsey appreciated that a large bomber fleet would be able to perform many military tasks not just strategic bombing and felt that force s doctrine should remain flexible to meet any demand because of his lower rank he was in no position to challenge bomber mafia and instead strove to work around their restrictions on pursuit aircraft kelsey formulated a new interceptor class of aircraft in order to sustain his idea that a well armed fighter aircraft could successfully attack enemy bombers and that given drop tanks for long range it could defend friendly bombers all way to target and back bomber mafia through a failure of imagination in not expanding doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success miller p 41 would not accept either of these concepts they believed heavy bomber fleet could protect itself and thus they contributed to delay in development of a long range escort fighter until two years into war however doctrine nonetheless became foundation for separation of air force from army and basis for modern airpower theory hansell concurred that both theorists and authors of awpd 1 war plan of which he was both made a serious mistake in neglecting long range fighter escort in their ideas hansell haywood s jr 1979 air plan that defeated hitler ayer press p 22 hansell wrote it was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable but no one could quite conceive how a small fighter could have range of bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability

of primacy of unescorted daylight strategic bombing was proved wrong lee 1997 pp 219 220 fleets of heavy bombers were not able to achieve victory without cooperation of army and navy and required protection of long range fighters for deep penetration missions overall casualties in war were not minimal and victory did not come significantly quicker precision in bombing was not achieved until long range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved as opponents had warned strategic bombing concept however was a major factor in eventual victory and became first core doctrine of independent united states air force its proponents continued to promote doctrine into nuclear age forming strategic air command to carry out a vision modified to fit needs of cold war and
