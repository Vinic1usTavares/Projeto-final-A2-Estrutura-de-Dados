of anglo saxon antiquities at cambridge university museum of archaeology and ethnology from 1923 to 1957 and over course of his lifetime wrote twenty four books on various subjects becoming particularly well known for his advocacy of dowsing born in somerset to a wealthy family lethbridge was educated at trinity college cambridge during course of which he attended an expedition to jan mayen island becoming part of first group to successfully climb beerenberg after a failed second expedition to arctic circle he became involved in archaeology in his capacity as keeper of anglo saxon antiquities at cambridge university museum of archaeology and ethnology lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around britain his claims regarding existence of iron age hill figures on wandlebury hill in cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within archaeological community with most archaeologists believing that lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature lethbridge s methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox and in turn he became increasingly critical of archaeological profession after resigning from university museum in 1957 lethbridge moved with his wife to branscombe devon there he devoted himself to researching paranormal phenomena publishing a string of books on subject aimed at a popular rather than academic audience most of this involved his research into use of pendulums for dowsing although in other publications he championed witch cult hypothesis of margaret murray articulated stone tape theory as an explanation for ghost sightings and argued that extraterrestrial species were involved in shaping human evolution in this he came to embrace and perpetuate esoteric ideas of earth mysteries movement although his work in parapsychology was derided and ignored as pseudo scientific by academic establishment he attracted a cult following and his work was posthumously championed by esotericists like colin wilson and julian cope in 2011 he was made subject of a biography by terry welbourn early life youth 1901 21 thomas charles lethbridge was born on 23 march 1901 his parents violet lethbridge nee murdoch and her

and jan mayen 1921 23 in october 1921 lethbridge enrolled at trinity college cambridge intent on studying geology and geography finding geology to be crushingly dull he rarely attended lectures and took little interest in his studies instead spending much of his time shooting fishing and sailing he graduated with a third class ba in june 1923 left thumb 250px lethbridge was part of first expedition to climb beerenberg on jan mayen pictured during his studies lethbridge decided to join an expedition to visit jan mayen island in arctic circle alongside fellow cambridge students james musters and william bristowe and a don from st john s college cambridge geologist james wordie although initially planning to travel independently they decided to join a norwegian expedition led by and accompanied by swiss mountaineer and paul louis mercanton expedition set sail from bratvaag aboard two ships in august 1921 and upon arriving at jan mayen they became first team to successfully climb beerenberg bears mountain during expedition lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by excavating at an abandoned eskimo settlement times recognised expedition as mountaineering event of year at cambridge lethbridge had entered into a romantic relationship with sylvia robertson a clergyman s daughter and they were engaged to be married in march 1922 in mid 1922 he went on a sailing voyage around hebrides in scotland with his fellow trinity student geoffrey walford in summer 1923 lethbridge was part of a second expedition led by wordie designed to explore eastern coast of greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat edward sabine s pendulum gravity experiments sailing from newcastle they stopped first at bergen and then jan meyen before getting stuck in pack ice with food reserves running low crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears before they eventually aborted mission and returned home archaeological career becoming keeper of anglo saxon antiquities 1923 47 during his student years lethbridge had frequented cambridge university museum of archaeology and ethnology where he had befriended its curator louis clarke upon lethbridge s graduation clarke offered him honorary position of keeper of anglo saxon antiquities at museum lethbridge took up voluntary and unpaid post being able to subsist on his family s finances there lethbridge befriended archaeologist cyril fox aiding in fox s excavation of devil s dyke in cambridgeshire lethbridge s archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers in turn lethbridge derided archaeological establishment being frustrated by how long it took them to accept what he deemed to be facts and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be instinct and common sense there were exceptions to his scorn for instance he developed a friendship with t d kendrick an anglo saxon art historian who then worked as keeper of british museum in london over course of his career at museum lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of excavation process thumb left museum of archaeology and ethnology in february 1924 lethbridge married sylvia robertson in a ceremony held at salisbury cathedral together they moved into a house known as lodge in waterbeach there their first two sons were born christopher john in march 1925 and hugh in july 1926 in 1927 they moved to mount blow a house in shelford designed by architect edwin lutyens it was there that sylvia gave birth to a daughter belinda mary in april 1930 sylvia suffered from mental illness however resulting in repeated hospitalisation lethbridge meanwhile devoted much of his time to yachting around british isles sometimes taking family members with him over course of 1930s he self published a series of books featuring his own sketches and engravings of maritime scenes he also deepened his interest in paranormal during this period coming to believe that an acquaintance of his was a genuine psychic and observing an unidentified flying object in bracknell in 1937 wordie organised an expedition to north west greenland to investigate cosmic radiation at high latitudes and great altitudes he assembled a team of ten men nine of whom were from cambridge university among them lethbridge and two other archaeologists setting sail in june 1937 lethbridge undertook excavations of eskimo sites at island cary island north west island and isbjorn island on returning home in october 1937 it was decided that various geographical features encountered would be named after team members and thus two lakes on baffin island were named lethbridge lakes during trip lethbridge became particularly interested in design of eskimo boats resulting in self publication of his 11 page booklet umiak european ancestry of women s boat in 1937 he followed this with a second book fishermen of durness 1938 in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat making and fishing as second world war loomed british admiralty commissioned lethbridge to undertake a reconnaissance mission to iceland to analyse german naval activity around country which he carried out in summer 1939 lethbridge however treated mission with contempt spending much of time visiting sites that interested him such as locations mentioned in icelandic sagas back in britain he self published a short volume discussing his icelandic journey news from tili as war broke out lethbridge organised transfer of much of museum s collections to caves for safe keeping while also becoming a warden of air raid precautions he also led rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable construction of raf for royal air force meanwhile lethbridge s wife sylvia had been having affairs with various men and he himself had begun an affair with sylvia s younger cousin mina who was a secretary at museum couple divorced in june 1943 and in november lethbridge sold mount blow to pay a settlement to sylvia he married mina in july 1944 at oban and together they moved from cambridge to a farm on scottish island of kerrera where lethbridge excavated some local caves but couple found life on kerrera too isolated and soon returned to cambridge despite lethbridge s dislike of place and most of university staff whom he worked alongside he nevertheless continued his archaeological investigations excavating an anglo saxon cemetery at on heath and involving himself in investigation of newly unearthed mildenhall treasure being individual responsible for locating its probable discovery spot he was among first to take an interest in cemeteries of mid anglo saxon period believing that lack of pagan objects such as weapons reflected fact that those buried in two seventh century cemeteries were among earliest anglo saxon christians in january 1948 lethbridge received word that his son hugh had committed suicide after suffering post traumatic stress disorder during his time in armed forces major publications and gogmagog 1948 57 1948 also saw publication of lethbridge s first major book merlin s island essays on britain in dark ages a collection of six essays on various elements of early medieval britain representing lethbridge s unorthodox and eclectic approach it was aimed at a popular rather than academic audience and although some academic reviewers were critical it received much qualified praise this was followed in 1950 by herdsman and hermits celtic seafarers in northern sea in which he returned to his interest in seafaring and boats containing a foreword by kendrick it was published by bowes and bowes in 1952 lethbridge published coast wise craft which again looked at boat building but was aimed at a general rather than specialist readership that same year thames and hudson published lethbridge s boats and boatmen as part of their past in present series edited by archaeologist jacquetta hawkes in 1954 andrew melrose published lethbridge s painted men a book about picts of northern britain it was deemed to be his last conventional book within archaeological and academic community as part of his increasing public profile bbc invited him to give third talk in their second series of myth or legend which he devoted to question of whether europeans had arrived in americas prior to christopher columbus in particular he looked at claims that st brendan and thorfinn had made journey across atlantic over several seasons he also carried out excavations of wheelhouses at south uist and on one occasion was visited at site by queen elizabeth ii and prince philip duke of edinburgh lethbridge s next project focused on searching for a chalk hill figure that was reported to have once existed on wandlebury hill in gog magog hills cambridgeshire towards end of 1954 he began investigating site inserting metal rods into ground to determine where he believed turf had once been removed to expose chalk below he believed that he had revealed three large figures a warrior a hooded goddess and a sun god asserting them to be likely 3000 years old and then began excavation to remove turf and reveal figures lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery reporting on it to times and being interviewed by london evening news however many archaeologists were sceptical of lethbridge s methodology and existence of hill figures they believed that soft patches of chalk were result of chalk solifluction and were only interpreted as human made figures through lethbridge s vivid imagination council for british archaeology brought together a committee to assess lethbridge s findings composed of i w cornwall w f grimes christopher hawkes and stuart piggott with aid of geologist f e committee concluded that shapes lethbridge had discovered were natural having been formed during last ice age however hawkes disagreed with his colleagues and believed that while not proven lethbridge s conclusions could not be disproved lethbridge stuck by his original ideas and wrote a book aimed at a general audience gogmagog buried gods on basis of them it was published by routledge and kegan paul in 1957 but received no supportive reviews in may 1957 egyptologist margaret murray involved herself in gogmagog debate championing lethbridge s ideas against academic fraternity in a letter she sent to times w f grimes responded by claiming that she was out of touch with contemporary scholarship later life embracing parapsychology 1957 64 as a result of widespread rejection of his gogmagog claims lethbridge became increasingly critical of academic and professional archaeological community believing that an attitude of what he called trade unionism had caused most archaeologists to reject independent thought as a result he decided to resign and move away from cambridge in late 1957 relocating to branscombe in southern devon he and mina set up home in hole house a fortified building that dated to early modern period and angered some of locals by banning fox hunters from crossing his land lethbridge came to believe that hole house was haunted describing unexplained noises and smells there this increased his interest in paranormal and he decided to devote much of his time to investigating such phenomena in what he deemed to be a scientific manner lethbridge believed that ghosts were projections stored in rock and other material substances and which echoed particularly emotional or traumatic events that either happened in past or will happen in future he focused many of his experiments on dowsing using a pendulum coming to believe that length of string used and number of oscillations could be used to determine type of object being detected his first book on subject of what he often termed odd was ghost and ghoul published in 1961 by routledge and kegan paul in this work he argued that mind was separate from brain he believed that mind was connected to an ancestral collective mind which everyone inherited many of ideas expressed in work were akin to those of carl jung richard semon and amy warburg although it is not clear if lethbridge had been aware of this beforehand an extract was subsequently published in january 1963 edition of fantastic stories of imagination he followed this work with witches investigating an ancient religion 1962 which articulated a form of murray s witch cult hypothesis but also contained many digressions and anecdotes unrelated to that topic returning to themes present in ghost and ghoul lethbridge published ghost and divining rod in 1963 in which he discussed his progress with his pendulum experiments on basis of this bbc filmed a short documentary titled ghost hunting with t c lethbridge in may 1964 in which lethbridge was filmed repeating his pendulum experiences in his garden final years 1965 71 lethbridge s next book was esp beyond time and distance published in 1965 it dealt with theme of extra sensory perception and articulated lethbridge s argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object and that they could be detected using pendulum dowsing in 1966 he published a step in dark which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works early that year lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease an affliction that had resulted from his obesity in both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society while in other correspondences with individuals in united states he championed authenticity of kensington runestone and westford knight in 1969 lethbridge published monkey s tail in which he discussed darwinian evolution although agreeing that evolution of species was an objective fact he nevertheless argued that there was a blueprint for existence and that genetic memory was a reality in a sequel published in 1969 legend of sons of god a fantasy lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding earth s evolutionary development echoing many of claims made by erich von daniken in chariots of gods 1968 lethbridge argued that late prehistoric stone circles of british isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft in this his work has been cited as an anticipation of earth mysteries movement that expanded across britain in following decade lethbridge s heart condition worsened to extent that he was unable to attend his mother s funeral in 1970 he eventually required 24 hour care and was transferred to nuffield hospital in exeter where he died in his sleep on 30 september 1971 his body was interred at family plot in heytesbury wiltshire as branscombe house was owned by lethbridge family trust mina was obliged to move out after her husband s death and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity mina also collected together lethbridge s unfinished book with help of writer colin wilson together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by routledge in 1976 as power of pendulum reception and legacy archaeologist niall finneran asserted that lethbridge had a distinguished if fairly unspectacular reputation within british archaeology prior to his adoption of fringe theories various colleagues expressed critical praise of his work in this field for instance lethbridge s fellow anglo saxon archaeologist audrey meaney noted that his observations on features in cemeteries he excavated around cambridge were perspicacious but in advance of his time another anglo saxon archaeologist sam lucy later noted that lethbridge s observation that those buried with anglo saxon material culture need not have been ethnically descended from continental migrants was while largely ignored by his contemporaries widely accepted in scholarship by end of 20th century however his embrace of unorthodox and pseudo scientific views later led to professional archaeologists becoming increasingly critical of his work as his biographer terry welbourn noted lethbridge s peers came to view him as being too radical a loose cannon and maverick on his death glyn daniel described lethbridge as a colourful stimulating provocative and often controversial figure in british archaeology who represented one of last of that invaluable band of dilettante scholars and devoted amateurs of whom we have had so many in britain although stating that lethbridge only emerged as a semi professional for a short time he praised much of lethbridge s writing for its freshness and an eager restless sense of enquiry an anonymously authored obituary in antiquaries journal referred to strength and honesty of lethbridge s character as a man and singleness of purpose that united all his work as experimental testing of what he found by observation seeing these as unifying characteristics behind his divergent research interests according to historian ronald hutton as a result of both his unorthodox ideas and his contempt for professionalism in all fields lethbridge s status as a scholar never really rose above that of an unusually lively local antiquary his books continue to be largely ignored by academics into 21st century describing lethbridge as one of most compelling figures in 20th century british archaeology finneran believed that at start of 21st century lethbridge was best known for his advocacy of dowsing as such finneran asserted that lethbridge s true legacy lay outside of conventional archaeology and could instead be located within earth mysteries movement lethbridge s work continued to attract interest from parapsychologists after his death author m b devot drew heavily on ghost and ghoul in his spirits of field and hearth times no 53 mb devot a life in hedgerow in 1978 author colin wilson devoted part one of his book mysteries to a discussion of lethbridge s ideas in 2003 a group of admirers of his work calling themselves sons of t c lethbridge
