2009 north korean nuclear test was underground detonation of a nuclear device conducted on monday 25 may 2009 by democratic people s republic of korea north korea conducts nuclear test bbc 25 may 2009 this was its second nuclear test first test having taken place in october 2006 kim sam n korea appears to have conducted nuclear test source yonhap new agency 2009 05 25 following nuclear test pyongyang also conducted several missile tests a scientific paper later estimated yield as 2 35 kilotons test was nearly universally condemned by international community following test united nations security council passed resolution 1874 condemning test and tightening sanctions on country it was widely believed that test was conducted as a result of succession crisis in country after kim jong il suffered a stroke in summer of 2008 arrangements were made for his third son kim jong un to take power upon his death it is believed north koreans conducted nuclear test to show that even in a time of possible weakness it did not intend to give up its nuclear weapons program background north korea officially democratic people s republic of korea or dprk had threatened to conduct a second nuclear test in protest after united nations security council adopted a presidential statement condemning country after it launched a rocket which it claimed was carrying 2 satellite on 5 april 2009 launch was condemned by several nations describing it as an intercontinental ballistic missile test test also came after recent messages stating that north korea had miniaturized nuclear warheads for medium range missiles and that country had been recognized by analysts as a fully fledged nuclear power in june 2009 after it was announced that kim jong un was to be intended successor of north korean leader kim jong il u s government analysts speculated that purpose of nuclear test was to establish north korea as a nuclear power within kim jong il s lifetime north korean statements without citing a specific time pyongyang notified both washington d c and beijing of test about an hour before actual detonation which occurred around 10 00 korea standard time kst monday u s state department promptly contacted four other six party talks members state run korean central news agency kcna released an announcement claiming in part that quotation democratic people s republic of korea successfully conducted one more underground nuclear test on may 25 as part of measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians current nuclear test was safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control and results of test helped satisfactorily settle scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology this was interpreted as referring to disputes over low yield of 2006 test seismic activity south korea and japan reported seismic activity at 09 50 kst 00 50 utc united states geological survey reported a magnitude 4 7 earthquake at a depth of zero and put center of tremor about northwest of and northeast of pyongyang within a few kilometres of country s 2006 nuclear test site earthquake shakes north korea cnn 24 may 2009 japan meteorological agency measured seismic activity at magnitude 5 3 korea institute of geoscience mineral resources reported seismic activity in same area but far stronger than in 2006 russian defence ministry confirmed it had detected a nuclear detonation in north korea and was analysing data to determine yield geophysical service of russian academy of sciences has registered underground nuclear explosion conducted in north korea on 25 may 2009 registration time of this explosion was 0 54 am gmt 4 54 a m moscow time with magnitude 5 0 in china tremors were felt in prefecture of which borders north korea and forced students in some local schools to be evacuated test is believed to have taken place at mantapsan in vicinity of p korean which was site of nuclear test held in 2006 analysis of test yield analysts have generally agreed that nuclear test was successful despite uncertainty of exact yield u s intelligence community assessed that north korea probably had conducted a nuclear test with a yield of a few kilotons comprehensive test ban treaty organization preparatory commission assessed yield at only slightly larger than 2006 test which was one kiloton based on readings from 23 seismic stations preparatory commission estimated blast to have a seismic magnitude of 4 52 corresponding to an explosive yield of 2 4 kilotons compared to a seismic magnitude of 4 1 corresponding to a yield of 0 8 kilotons for 2006 blast ramstad evan and jay solomon peter spiegel korean blast draws outrage wall street journal 26 may 2009 accessed 11 june 2009 archived 2009 08 02 russia placed yield of test significantly higher at 10 to 20 kilotons this was approximately yield of fat man and trinity bombs developed by united states during world war ii however russians had also previously estimated a far higher yield of 5 to 10 kilotons when other sources estimated a yield of 0 5 to 0 9 kilotons in 2006 test as well defense minister lee sang hee of south korea said that more data were needed but that yield might be between 1 and 20 kilotons analyst martin kalinowski at university of hamburg estimated yield at being from 3 to 8 kilotons still a very successful test when compared with 2006 test hans m kristensen of federation of american scientists cautioned that early news media reports about a hiroshima size nuclear explosion seem to be overblown bulletin of atomic scientists asserted that blast was more powerful than 2006 test though put yield between 2 and 6 kilotons but likely less than 4 kilotons and far short of a hiroshima type device group concluded that bomb failed to detonate correctly but even so potential of this weapon should not be dismissed however after subsequent nuclear test in 2013 federal institute for geosciences and natural resources a state run geology research institute in germany estimated yield ranging from a minimum of 5 kilotons to maximum of 12 kilotons and 2006 test ranging from minimum of 700 tons to maximum of 2 kilotons instead with relevant statistics similarly university of science and technology of china has estimated yield of this test to be at with an error margin of 1 9kt 5 to 8 9kt while presenting their estimation for nuclear test in 9 september 2016 lack of radionuclide confirmation in june 2009 preparatory commission for comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization ctbto announced that no radionuclides had been detected that could be associated with 25 may event at time of test ctbto global network included 40 radionuclide sampling stations in addition united states reported that no radionuclides were detected by aircraft over sea of japan east sea of korea and south korea also reported that no radionuclides were detected by contrast radionuclides were detected in at least two locations after 2006 event lack of detection does not mean that event was non nuclear it is reasonable for a nuclear test with this yield buried deep enough in appropriate rock to not yield remotely detectable radionuclides but it makes it more difficult to prove whether test was nuclear science vol 324 19 june 2009 page 1499 verification experts puzzled over north korea s nuclear test by daniel north korea

this was reaffirmed on 1 june 2009 by defense secretary robert m gates who said at a news conference with his philippine counterpart during a brief visit to manila we have seen some signs that they may be doing something with another 2 missile but at this point it s not clear what they re doing yonhap news agency reported on 2 june 2009 that north korea was readying as many as three medium range missiles according to some analysts rodong missiles at a missile base in region province northeast of capital of pyongyang in addition a south korean defence ministry spokesman said that signs that
