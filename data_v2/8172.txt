hayrick butte is a tuya a type of subglacial volcano in linn county oregon located in willamette national forest near santiam pass it lies adjacent to cinder cone hoodoo butte which has a ski area hayrick butte likely formed when lava erupted underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet producing flat top with near vertical walls along ice contact margin as lava cooled and hardened hayrick butte has a nearly flat plateau about across and steep walls rising about above its surroundings a cartographer accidentally switched names for nearby hoodoo butte and hayrick butte word hoodoo usually refers to rock piles and pinnacles like those observed at hayrick butte compared to hoodoo hayrick is less popular for recreation though it can be climbed and there are hiking snowshoeing and snowmobile routes surrounding butte its north facing slope has subalpine forests with mountain hemlock and fir which are common in cascades geography hayrick butte is located in linn county in u s state of oregon close to santiam pass it forms part of united states geological survey topographic map for three fingered jack volcano hayrick butte lies south of three fingered jack near hoodoo butte sand mountain field potato butte and black butte with belknap crater and mount washington further to south it is also within mckenzie ranger district of willamette national forest according to geographic names information system hayrick butte has an elevation of in 1980 willamette national forest gazetteer listed its elevation as butte has a width of about hayrick butte is located next to hoodoo ski area in response to a new master plan at hoodoo ski bowl in 1995 united states forest service released a draft environmental impact statement for surroundings forest service argued that development at hoodoo butte and hayrick butte would require excavating and or blasting of soil and rock on hayrick butte which would potentially exacerbate erosion of local soil removal of this soil and rock would also substantially limit future revegetation further reducing soil productivity in area forest service statement also asserted that development of new trails would not lead to significant scenic resource effects and that any landform modification from a proposed snow play area would only have moderate and short term effects ecology oregon department of fish and wildlife determined in early 1990s that there was potential for peregrine falcon nests at hayrick butte though it was considered low quality habitat because of its lack of suitable ledges and high amounts of human disturbance according to a 2003 paper hayrick butte has a rich forest on its steep north facing slope with mountain hemlock and mature fir trees at an elevation of subalpine forests like these usually occur above elevations of in cascades in areas with cool wet climates mean precipitation for these zones ranges from with cool summers and cold snowy winters dense forests are less common at higher elevations switching to patchy forest stands separated from each other by shrubs or meadows geology north sister of three sisters volcano complex and mount washington mark isolated volcanic centers among highly mafic rich in magnesium and iron platform of central high cascade arc about 4 5 million years ago eruption of mafic lava filled a subsiding pliocene depression creating modern mafic high cascades compared to eruptive products at and near north sister lava deposits at mount washington have a greater abundance of incompatible elements elements unsuitable in size and or charge to cation sites of minerals of which it is included nearby lava dome and tuya subglacial volcano hogg rock shows more similarity to basaltic andesite deposits at north sister which are poorly enriched in incompatible elements part of high cascades that extends south from mount jefferson to santiam pass includes shield volcanoes lava domes and cinder cones high elevation of matuyama aged rocks east of santiam pass coupled with exposure of brunhes aged rocks to west imply presence of a northward trending normal fault hayrick butte is of late pleistocene age like hogg rock hayrick butte is an andesite lava dome with a flat top suggesting that it is also a tuya or a subglacial volcano both volcanic features have been eroded by glaciation leaving glassy margins and jointing both hayrick butte and hogg rock produced porphyritic andesite lava with plagioclase and orthopyroxene and trace levels of phenocrysts with olivine hayrick butte also served as a barrier for hoodoo butte during pleistocene glaciation blocking advancement of glacial ice from eroding hoodoo s summit crater most lava domes in cascades occur in clusters or surrounding just a few major volcanic centers there are roughly 190 known domes in state of oregon with 40 located near mount jefferson 22 near tumalo volcanic highland 28 near three sisters and close to 60 surrounding mount mazama hayrick butte however is more isolated from other volcanoes hayrick butte along with benchmark butte formed more than from any major stratovolcano hildreth 2007 likewise writes that hayrick is clearly separated from major clusters or evolved centers hayrick butte has a normal magnetic polarity like hogg rock and other andesite lava domes in area it has lower incompatible element abundances than surrounding andesitic rock deposits a 1992 element abundance analysis of hayrick butte andesite samples from margin of volcano shows a silicon dioxide silica level of 60 1 percent aluminum oxide level of 18 4 percent calcium oxide level of 6 24 percent iron ii oxide level of 5 55 percent and sodium oxide level of 4 42 percent magnesium oxide made up 3 3 percent of samples with potassium oxide levels at 1 08 percent and manganese ii oxide phosphorus pentoxide and titanium dioxide all below 1 percent additional studies from 1980 and 1983 exhibit similar levels of silica in samples from hogg rock and hayrick butte at about 59 to 60 percent human history according to cartographer stuart allen an early cartographer accidentally switched names for nearby hoodoo butte and hayrick butte word hoodoo refers to rock piles and pinnacles like those observed at hayrick butte while hayrick is a synonym for haystack a more fitting name for hoodoo butte which has a profile that resembles a haystack shape whether or not this error actually occurred remains unclear but names remain to present day recreation obsidian climb school and eugene mountain rescue offer climbing classes and field sessions at hayrick butte a backcountry snowshoeing trail runs for from hoodoo ski area rising about in elevation over its course route travels between hayrick and hoodoo butte offering views of mount washington there is an avalanche hazard near hayrick s base an old roadbed next to trail travels up hoodoo butte to hoodoo butte plateau and butte s summit where a historic fire cleared many trees there are snowmobile routes down old santiam pass wagon road to south and forest road 2690 to east as well as a geocache at hayrick s summit of bulletin in bend described hayrick as antisocial compared to family friendly ski area of hoodoo butte citing its tall nearly vertical walls tuya is also surrounded by cliffs william sullivan of register guard wrote that hayrick offered breathtaking views of mount jefferson big lake hoodoo butte mount washington and black butte hayrick butte is also visible from lake loop trail near santiam pass references sources external links category tuyas of united
