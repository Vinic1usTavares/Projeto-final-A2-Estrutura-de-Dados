best known under pen name herge was employed as editor and illustrator of little twentieth a children s supplement to twentieth century a staunchly roman catholic conservative belgian newspaper based in herge s native brussels which was run by abbe norbert wallez in 1929 herge began adventures of tintin comic strip for revolving around exploits of fictional belgian reporter tintin wallez ordered herge to set his first adventure in soviet union as anti socialist propaganda for children tintin in land of soviets to set his second adventure in belgian congo to encourage colonial sentiment tintin in congo and to set his third adventure in united states to use story as a denunciation of american capitalism tintin in america wallez was subsequently removed from paper s editorship following a scandal although herge was convinced to stay on condition of a salary increase in preparing broken ear herge developed new habit of keeping plot notes and ideas in a notebook he also began making cuttings of photographs and other images from magazines and newspapers filing them away for future use he used them as a basis for many of drawings in broken ear 250px thumb left paraguayan troops in 1932 during chaco war herge used broken ear to allude to real events that had recently taken place in south america fictional countries of san theodoros and nuevo rico were based on real countries bolivia and paraguay while gran chapo war depicted in strip was an allusion to chaco war 1932 35 that was waged between bolivian and paraguayan forces over lucrative oil fields in gran chaco region name gran chapo was a pun on french grand chapeau meaning big hat while name nuevo rico was a pun on nouveau riche and name of nuevo rican capital city was a pun on sans meaning without manners herge s character basil of arms company ltd basil in 1937 edition was a thinly veiled allusion to real life greek weapons seller basil zaharoff of vickers armstrong who profited from conflict by supplying arms to both paraguay and bolivia herge had learned about conflict and western corporations profiting from it through two issues of anti conformist belgian magazine la crapouillot mortar shell which covered news stories ignored by mainstream media it is also likely that he had read richard s 1930 book zaharoff l europeen mysterieux zaharoff mysterious european which had been referenced in la crapouillot herge s arumbaya fetish was based on design of a genuine peruvian statue in brussels royal museums of art and history a pre columbian chimu statue it was made of wood and dated to between 1200 and 1438 ce whereas herge had access to speakers of mandarin when creating blue lotus he had no access to speakers of indigenous languages and as such arumbaya language that he developed was entirely fictitious he based its structure largely on dialect spoken in marolles area of brussels mixed with spanish endings and constructions in developing arumbaya s rivals bibaros he was influenced by anthropological accounts of head shrinking among jibaros tribes when leslie lonsdale cooper and michael turner translated book into english they renamed bibaros as a pun on rum baba pudding explorer ridgewell found living among arumbayas is based upon british explorer colonel percy harrison fawcett who mysteriously disappeared into amazon jungle in 1925 in crafting story herge was possibly influenced by maltese falcon as there are similarities in their plots original publication thumb right 150px a scene from broken ear on cover of le petit vingtieme broken ear was first serialised in le petit vingtieme from december 1935 under title tintin et milou chez les arumbayas tintin and snowy among arumbayas from 7 february 1937 story was also serialised in french catholic newspaper coeurs vaillants in 1937 it was collected in a single hardcover volume and published by editions casterman under title l oreille broken ear for this collected edition one small change was made minor character of carajo was renamed caraco because word carajo is spanish slang for penis broken ear introduced character general alcazar to series who went on to become a recurring character who appeared in three further adventures as noted by herge biographer harry thompson broken ear is first story in tintin series to start and finish in home surroundings and first to deal with hunt for a specific object it also marks last story in which tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity and first time that adventures featured tintin s flat at 26 labrador road in which chinese mementos from blue lotus are visible influenced by films of alfred hitchcock herge inserted an illustration of himself into second frame he also made reference to contemporary news stories in book having a radio announcer discuss ongoing second italo ethiopian war at start of story this was removed in colour edition at end of story herge killed off ramon and alonso and depicted them being dragged to hell by devils killing of story s antagonists was something not repeated in future stories this upset editors of coeurs vaillants who asked herge to change scene annoyed at their request he later commented on surface it cost me nothing but that kind of addition was really difficult for me for their serialisation of story he replaced that particular frame with one in which tintin souls of ramon and alonso for god second version 1943 in 1940s and 1950s when herge s popularity had increased he and his team at studios herge redrew and coloured many of original black and white tintin adventures using clear line drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with new tintin stories being created broken ear was first of these early adventures to undergo and colouration and this second edition was published as a 62 page volume by casterman in 1943 unlike some of earlier adventures broken ear was not redrawn save for a few minor revisions to reduce length of book various sections were excised including a dream sequence that appeared in original as colouration process was new to series use of colour in broken ear is more basic than in later volumes as book progresses it is evident that herge lost interest and rushed task for instance resorting to using block colour backgrounds without any detail later publications and legacy casterman republished original black and white version in 1979 in a french language collected volume with cigars of pharaoh and blue lotus second part of collection in 1986 casterman published a facsimile version of original herge returned to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent adventures such as syldavia and borduria based largely on yugoslavia and nazi germany in king ottokar s sceptre and based on indonesia in flight 714 to sydney he also re used other elements pioneered in broken ear in his later adventures a parrot in castafiore emerald a ravine crash in calculus affair a fireball and vivid dream in seven crystal balls and a firing squad in tintin and picaros tintin returned to san in tintin and picaros in which characters pablo and ridgewell also made a reappearance in 1979 palace of fine arts in brussels held an exhibition marking fifty years of adventures of tintin as part of this they included artefacts that featured in series with broken eared peruvian statue that inspired herge s arumbaya fetish as centre piece of show however they feared that it might be stolen so a replica was exhibited rather than genuine article imitating events of broken ear a thief broke in and stole statue a letter was then sent to le soir in which an individual alleging to be thief stated that item would be returned if herge returned to scene of crime at a certain time with a copy of book under his right arm herge did so but carried book under his left arm thief never appeared and replica fetish was never recovered critical analysis thumb 150px chimu statuette from museum which was copied into adventure by herge jean marc and randy lofficier described broken ear as a blue lotus lite noting that it shared many elements with previous adventure although they also considered it to be more reminiscent of earlier more caricatured books like tintin in congo and tintin in america with inclusion of comical natives and absurdist elements like comical bombs they nevertheless thought that it exhibited a marked improvement in herge s use of plotting noting that story was clearly structured praising very effective dramatic story with plenty of twists overall they awarded broken ear two stars out of five harry thompson felt that broken ear had a slightly lacklustre quality to it and was disappointing due to fact that various elements don t gel well together he believed that artistic quality and use of research deteriorated as adventure progressed although it had most complex plot yet by a long way philippe goddin asserted that in story tintin develops from a classic reporter to an investigative journalist michael farr described broken ear as a moral condemnation of capitalism imperialism and war although felt that it was not as perfectly constructed as blue lotus being less detailed and realistic he thought that image in which ramon and alonso drown in sea and are dragged to hell by demons was truly medieval and represented most fanciful image in entire series he also opined that herge s depiction of south american militaries was full of humour and that detail was generally very accurate biographer benoit peeters thought that broken ear was a return to pure adventure from quasi documentary realism of blue lotus and that in this adventure politics remains in second line and that instead herge let narrative rip and succeeds marvellously elsewhere he praised work as having a formidable dynamism and an unequaled vitality containing a revolution in narrative structure he thought that it served as a perfect metaphor for theories of german philosopher walter benjamin published in work of art in age of mechanical reproduction 1936 which herge had not read literary critic tom mccarthy thought that balthazar was an example of interesting minor characters that imbue adventures commenting that his down at heel garret speaks volumes of loneliness and semi realised artistry he also opined that diamond within fetish was clitoris of arumbaya describing it as their pleasure wrapped up in a fetish he also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between ramon and alonso believing that scene in which a bullet was fired into ramon s buttocks was symbolic of anal sex writing in liberation philosopher michel serres opined that broken ear was a treatise on fetishism literary critic jean marie apostolides of stanford university believed that broken ear established a anthropology that would remain throughout rest of series as part of this apostolides argued herge distances himself from western values and looks at his own society as an outsider accomplishing what roger caillois called sociological revolution he felt that comic was more contrived and more superficial than previous adventures and that here tintin loses his position as sole point of identification for reader with other characters becoming more identifiable opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout story i e real and fake fetish alonso and ramon he thought that character of ridgewell was a kind of tintin grown old among natives solitary and ill humored noting that ridgewell s position among arumbayas was akin to tintin s position among ba in congo apostolides also argued that in comic alcazar was a religious figure who attained a sacred quality through spilling of blood in his revolt against general tapioca s government as part of this he argued that threats of assassination would make him a martyr or a holy king adaptations broken ear is one of adventures of tintin that were adapted for first series of animated herge s adventures of tintin by belgian studio belvision in 1957 directed by ray goossens and written by michel greg broken ear was divided up into six 5 minute black and white episodes that diverted from herge s original plot in a variety of ways it was also adapted into a 1991 episode of adventures of tintin television series by french studio ellipse and canadian animation company nelvana directed by stephane bernasconi thierry wermuth voiced character of tintin episode deviates significantly from original story line passage containing tintin s drunkenness has been ignored entirely keeping character consistent with how it is seen in rest of series upright conscientious and of commendable moral standards besides political narratives almost ubiquitously present in latter part of original album have also been largely overlooked tintin s conflict with military was also replaced with one with alonso perez and ramon bada references notes footnotes bibliography external
