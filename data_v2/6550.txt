roots of shaktism a hindu denomination that focuses worship upon shakti or devi hindu divine mother penetrate deeply into india s prehistory from devi s earliest known appearance in indian paleolithic settlements more than 20 000 years ago through refinement of her cult in indus valley civilization her partial eclipse during vedic period and her subsequent resurfacing and expansion in sanskrit tradition it has been suggested that in many ways history of hindu tradition can be seen as a reemergence of feminine hawley p 2 shaktism as it exists today began with literature of vedic age further evolved during formative period of hindu epics reached its full flower during gupta age 300 700 ce and continued to expand and develop thereafter see a devi mahatmya an important text in shaktism was

years ago images of goddess are everywhere in india you ll find them painted on sides of trucks pasted to dashboards of taxis on walls of shops you ll often see a color painting of goddess prominently displayed in hindu homes usually picture is hung high on wall so you have to crane your neck backward looking up toward her feet in india goddess worship is not a cult it s a religion an extraordinarily spiritually and psychologically mature tradition millions of people turn every day with heartfelt yearning to mother of universe johnsen b p 11 13 19 early origins to date earliest mother goddess figurine unearthed in india near allahabad belongs to upper paleolithic and carbon dates to approximately 20 000 23 000 bce also belonging to that period are some collections of colorful stones marked with natural triangles discovered near in uttar pradesh they are similar to stones still worshiped as devi by tribal groups in area moreover they may demonstrate connections to

world archeology and a precursor to great indus valley civilization subramuniyaswami p 1211 in harappa and mohenjo daro major cities of indus valley civilization female figurines were found in almost all households indicating presence of cults of goddess worship foulston pp 4 5 most figurines are naked and have elaborate fowler p 90 some figurines have ornaments or horns on head and a few are in poses that expose genitals kinsley a p 215 several small circular objects with holes in middle possibly representing yoni were also found kinsley a pp 215 216 foulston abbot p 5 objects and images found suggest that goddess cults of indus valley civilization were associated with fertility kinsley a p 16 p 45 a seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle it probably suggests an association between female figure and crops and possibly implies a ritual sacrifice where blood of victim was offered to goddess for ensuring agricultural productivity littleton p 732 kinsley a p 218 bhattacharya links archaeological discoveries of indus valley civilization to present day shaktism of later hindu religion bhattacharyya a p 16 other scholars like david kinsley and lynn foulston acknowledge some similarities between cult of goddess in indus valley civilization and shaktism but think that there is no conclusive evidence that proves a link between them foulston p 4 kinsley a p 217 according to bhattacharya later indus valley population centers of harappa and mohenjo daro c 3300 1600 bce sheltered a mixed population major section of which came from adjacent villages to seek their fortune in great cities they also brought with them their own cults and rituals female principle of agricultural communities which formed basis of harappan i e indus valley religion some of cults and rituals of simpler peoples were adopted by higher but probably not in original unsophisticated form they were given an aristocratic colour that reflected their worshipers more elevated position in society bhattacharyya b p 148 as these philosophies and rituals evolved in northern reaches of subcontinent additional layers of goddess focused tradition were expanding outward from sophisticated dravidian civilizations of south cult of female principle was a major aspect of dravidian religion bhattacharyya notes concept of shakti was an integral part of their religion and their female deities eventually came to be identified with puranic parvati durga or kali cult of sapta matrika or seven divine mothers which is an integral part of shakta religion may also be of dravidian inspiration bhattacharyya a pp 25 26 philosophical development shaktism as we know it began with literature of vedic age further evolved during formative period of hindu epics reached its full flower during gupta age 300 700 ce and continued to expand and develop thereafter vedas as indus valley civilization slowly declined and dispersed its peoples mixed with other groups to eventually give rise to vedic civilization c 1500 600 bce female divinity continued to have a place in belief and worship but generally in a more subordinate role with goddesses serving principally as consorts to great gods most important of female deities mentioned in vedas is ushas number of hymns in vedas are dedicated exclusively to her three divine mothers mentioned in rig veda from whom vedic gods took their birth are aditi prithvi and saraswati prithvi continued to exist in later hinduism as bhudevi goddess of earth foulston p 6 according to bhattacharyya it may be said that aditi was most ancient mother of gods whose features had already become obscure even in vedic age harappan mother goddess was probably reflected in vedic conception of aditi thought to be a goddess of yore even in rigveda itself bhattacharyya a pp 37 53 indeed vedic descriptions of aditi are vividly reflected in countless so called lajja gauri idols depicting a faceless lotus headed goddess in birthing posture that have been worshiped throughout india for millennia bolon p 7 in first age of gods existence was born from non existence quarters of sky were born from she who crouched with legs spread earth was born from she who crouched with legs spread and from earth quarters of sky were born rigveda x 72 3 4 cited in doniger p 38 historically recurrent theme of devi s all encompassing pan sexual nature arises explicitly for first time in such declarations as aditi is sky aditi is air aditi is all gods aditi is mother father and son aditi is whatever shall be born rigveda i 89 10 cited in bhattacharyya a p 36 also significant is appearance in famous rig vedic hymn devi sukta of two of hinduism s most widely known and beloved goddesses vac identified with present day saraswati and sri now better known as lakshmi in hymn still recited by thousands of hindus each day goddess unambiguously declares i am sovereign queen treasury of all treasures chief of all objects of worship whose all pervading self manifests all gods and goddesses whose birthplace is in midst of causal waters who in breathing forth gives birth to all created worlds and yet extends beyond them so vast am i in greatness rigveda devi sukta mandala x sukta 125 cited in kali pp 213 217 upanishads great kena upanishad c 750 500 bce tells an early tale in which devi appears as shakti or essential power of supreme brahman it begins with vedic trinity of agni vayu and indra boasting and posturing in flush of a recent victory over a demon hoard until they suddenly find themselves bereft of divine power in presence of a mysterious yaksha or forest spirit when indra tries to approach and question yaksha it disappears replaced by devi in form of a highly adorned yakshini it was uma daughter of indra said to her who was that yaksha she replied it is brahman it is only through victory of brahman that you have thus become great after that indra and devas realized truth having known brahman through such direct experience kena upanisad iii 11 iv 3 cited in muller and in sarma pp xxix xxx thumb a yakshini or forest deity form devi assumed in kena upanishad as dynamic aspect of brahman shunga empire 2nd 1st century bce musee guimet paris significantly bhattacharyya notes that a study of extant yaksha and yakshini images of this period shows that later images of gods and goddesses were shaped after them bhattacharya a p 68 canonical shakta upanishads are much more recent most dating between 13th and 18th centuries and generally relate to sectarian matters of srividya worship while their archaic sanskrit usages tend to create impression that they belong to a hoary past not one of verses cast in vedic mold can be traced to a vedic source krishna warrier pp ix x epic period while no goddess of a purely shakta character is mentioned in great vaishnava epic ramayana c 200 bce 200 ce mahabharata c 400 bce 400 ce is full of references that confirm ongoing vitality of shakta worship bhattacharyya p 77 devi is also mentioned in and there are many verses in vedas regarding various forms of goddess main goddess of pantheon held as durga central goddess mahabharat great epic thus refers to goddess residing in goddess who is fond of wine and meat and worshiped by hunting peoples ongoing process of goddess worshiping indigenous peoples coming into fold of caste system also brought with it a religious reflex of great historical consequence bhattacharyya pp 73 81 however it is in epic s durga iv 6 and vi 23 that devi is first revealed in her true character comprising numerous local goddesses combined into one all powerful female principle bhattacharyya p 75 meanwhile great tamil epic canto xxii cited in bhattacharyya a p 78 c 100 ce was one of several literary masterpieces amply indicating currency of cult of female principle in south india during this period and once again idea that lakshmi saraswati parvati etc represent different aspects of same power bhattacharyya a pp 78 79 puranas taken together with epics vast body of religious and cultural compilations known as puranas most of which were composed during gupta period c 300 600 ce afford us greater insight into all aspects and phases of hinduism its mythology its worship its theism and pantheism its love of god its philosophy and superstitions its festivals and ceremonies and ethics than any other works winternitz m vol i p 529 some of more important shakta oriented puranas include devi purana and kalika purana in which devi is described as prakriti to whom world owes its origin while she does not owe her origin to anything bhattacharyya a p 164 by far however most important puranas from shakta standpoint are markandeya purana brahmanda purana and devi bhagavata purana from which key shakta scriptures are drawn devi mahatmya thumb 200px devi portrayed as mahishasura mardini slayer of buffalo demon a central episode of devi mahatmya and one of most famous in all of hindu mythology by far most important text of shaktism is devi mahatmya also known as durga chandi or chandi path found in markandeya purana composed some 1 600 years ago text wove together diverse threads of already ancient memory and created a dazzling verbal tapestry that remains even today central text of hindu goddess kali p xvii here for first time various mythic cultic and theological elements relating to diverse female divinities were brought together in what has been called crystallization of goddess tradition as earliest hindu scripture in which object of worship is conceptualized as goddess with a capital g coburn p 16 devi mahatmya also marks birth of independent shaktism i e cult of female principle as a distinct philosophical and denominational entity influence of cult of female principle had already placed goddesses by sides of gods of all systems as their consorts and symbols of their energy or shakti but entire popular emotion centering round female principle was not exhausted so need was felt for a new system entirely female dominated as system in which even great gods like vishnu or shiva would remain subordinate to goddess this new system containing vestiges of hoary antiquity varieties of rural and tribal cults and rituals and strengthened by newfangled ideas of different ages came to be known as shaktism bhattacharyya a p 108 lalita sahasranama thumb left sri lalita tripurasundari parvati enthroned with her left foot upon sri chakra holding her traditional symbols sugarcane bow flower arrows noose and goad within hindu genre of literally thousand name hymns extolling names deeds and associations of a given deity sri lalita sahasranama stotra or hymn to thousand names of auspicious goddess lalita is a veritable classic widely acknowledged for its lucidity clarity and poetic excellence joshi front flap lalita sahasranama is part of brahmanda purana but its specific origins and authorship are lost to history based upon textual evidence it is believed to have been composed in south india not earlier than 9th or later than 11th century ce text is closely associated with another section of brahmanda purana entitled great narrative of lalita which extols deeds of goddess in her form as lalita tripurasundari in particular her slaying of demon text operates on a number of levels containing references not just to devi s physical qualities and exploits but also an encoded guide to philosophy and esoteric practices of kundalini yoga and srividya shaktism in addition every name and group of names within sahasranama is considered to have high value independent of its content and are often prescribed in or to accomplish particular purposes suryanarayana p 44 ff devi gita late puranic age saw beginnings of bhakti new religious movements of personalistic theistic devotionalism that would come to full fruition between 1200 and 1700 ce and still in many ways define mainstream of hindu religious practice devi gita is an important milestone as first major shakta theistic work to be steeped in bhakti brown b p 17 devi gita is final and best known portion of vast 11th century scripture known as devi bhagavata purana a text exclusively dedicated to devi in her highest iconic mode as supreme world mother bhuvaneshvari beyond birth beyond marriage beyond any possible subordination to shiva indeed purana s most significant contribution to shakta theological tradition is ideal of a goddess both single and benign brown b pp 10 320 devi bhagavata purana retells tales of devi mahatmya in much greater length and detail embellishing them with shakta philosophical reflections while recasting many classic tales from other schools of hinduism particularly vaishnavism in a distinctly shakta light devi bhagavata was intended not only to show superiority of goddess over various male deities but also to clarify and elaborate on her nature on her own terms goddess in devi bhagavata becomes less of a warrior goddess and more a nurturer and comforter of her devotees and a teacher of wisdom this development in character of goddess culminates in devi gita which repeatedly stresses necessity of love for goddess with no mention of one s gender as primary qualification a view inspired by devotional ideals of shaktism brown b pp 8 21 samkhya and vedanta as first millennium wound to an end religious movements of south began to exert tremendous influence on north and southern contribution to shaktism s emergence was significant korravai tamil goddess of war and victory was easily identified with durga who was also identified with of kerala and eternal virgin enshrined in kanyakumari she was invoked in one or another of her nine forms navadurga or as tamil tradition also associates her with saraswati or vac as also with sri and lakshmi thus in durga devotee visualised triple aspects of power beneficence and wisdom in addition many southern temples included shrines to sapta matrika and from earliest period south had a rich tradition of cult of village mothers concerned with facts of daily life bhattacharyya a p 111 dualistic metaphysics of tantric traditions indicates influence of samkhya on tantra flood p 69 dasgupta speculates that tantric image of a wild kali standing on a slumbering shiva was inspired from conception of prakriti as a dynamic agent and purusha as a passive witness kripal pp 148 149 shakta philosophy also elaborated samkhya theory on phases of cosmic evolution tattvas by expanding number of phases from 25 to 36 tattvas it is worthy of note that this scheme of tattvas enables shakta philosophy to solve conundrum as to how brahman becomes changing universe and how one can become many in shakta cosmogony central idea is that shakti issues out of absolute and is not different from brahman being rather kinetic aspect of brahman dikshitar p 90 tantras in most schools of shaktism tantras a large genre of ritual manuals dating from as early as 7th century ce and as late as 19th century are central scriptures tantras devised two main paths of sadhana to reach same goal shankarnarayanan a p 140 thumb left sri yantra shown here in three dimensional projection known as sri meru or maha meru used mainly in rituals of srividya shakta sects is central to most tantric forms of shaktism lineages generally favor external worship puja murtis etc and permit use of panchamakara lit five substances referencing certain controversial forms of worship at various levels under controlled circumstances and lineages generally prefer internal worship meditative techniques etc and essentially disapprove of panchamakara under any circumstances proper path is generally determined by guru based upon a given devotee s personal nature i e as a pasu i e an ordinary person not particularly given to spiritual pursuits and mainly preoccupied with worldly matters a vira an active and vigorous spiritual seeker qualified to heroically engage more intensive forms of sadhana or a sattvic divya a holy natured person having already achieved an extremely high level of spiritual maturity and various other factors around 800 ce adi shankara legendary sage and preceptor of advaita vedanta system implicitly recognized shakta philosophy and tantric liturgy as part of mainstream hinduism in his powerful and still hugely popular hymn known as or waves of beauty shankara while not a shakta in sectarian sense had a soft corner for shakta religion perhaps due to its popularity among masses another important shakta text often attributed to shankara is hypnotically exquisite mahishasura mardini stotra a 21 verse hymn derived from devi mahatmya that constitutes one of greatest works ever addressed to supreme feminine power g g legend of while authorship of stotram is popularly attributed to shankara many scholars have disputed claim for further discussion of mahishasura mardini stotram as well as a transcription and translation of hymn see mahishasura mardini shakti sadhana org an alternative translation can be found at org by thirteenth century tantras had assimilated a very large number of cults of various origins regional tribal and sectarian and had assumed a completely shakta character from fourteenth century onward shakta tantric cults had become woven into texture of all religious practices current in india their spirit and substance infusing regional and sectarian vernacular as well as sanskrit literature bhattacharyya a p 154 rise of popular shaktism in 18th and 19th centuries a good number of shakta tantric works were composed that attempted to make tantric ideas popular among masses notable examples include tantra characterized by its special modernism and liberal outlook especially towards women works of prolific and erudite bhaskararaya most outstanding contributor to shakta philosophy also belong to this period and remain central to srividya practice even today bhattacharyya a pp 187 great tamil composer dikshitar 1775 1835 a srividya adept set one of that tradition s central mysteries majestic puja to music in a classical song cycle known as kritis dikshitar thus threw open doors of srividya to all those who are moved to approach divine mother through devotional music b p 103 in meantime an even greater wave of popular shaktism was swelling in eastern india with passionate shakta lyrics of ramprasad sen 1720 1781 which opened not only a new horizon of shakti cult but made it acceptable to all irrespective of caste or creed more than 80 shakta poets appeared in bengal after ramprasad and by 1900 number of shakta lyrics exceeded 4 000 and tradition still survives bhattacharyya a pp 191 92 from this point onward shaktism was evolving as a liberal universal religion that touched nearly every aspect of indian life evolution achieved a completeness in great shakta saint sri ramakrishna paramahamsa 1836 1886 who held from his shakta experience that aim of all religions was same and that difference between personal and impersonal god was no more than that between ice and water bhattacharyya a pp 200 201 another major advocate of shaktism in this period was sir john woodroffe 1865 1936 a high court judge in british india and father of modern tantric studies whose vast oeuvre bends over backward to defend tantras against their many critics and to prove that they represent a noble pure ethical system in basic accord with vedas and vedanta his complete works are still in print and remain influential to this day urban p 135 ramakrishna s chief disciple swami vivekananda 1863 1902 inherited from ramakrishna shakta oriented synthetic outlook which insisted on cult of shakti in programme of national regeneration and in fact regarded country as living image of divine mother an image that resonated throughout india s struggle for independence another of india s great nationalists sri aurobindo 1872 1950 later reinterpreted doctrine of shakti in a new light by drawing on tantric conception of transforming mortal and material body into something pure and divine and setting a goal of complete and unconditional surrender to will of mother bhattacharyya a pp 202 203 citing aurobindo sri life divine pondicherry 1939 modern developments in certain regards bhattacharyya notes shaktism has so infused mainstream hinduism that it has ceased to be a sectarian religion and presents no difficulty for anyone to accept its essence bhattacharyya a pp 203 204 thumb left cover art for dvd release of 1975 film jai santoshi ma extraordinary popularity of which bred

2006 as her film brought her to life santoshi ma quickly became one of most important and widely worshiped goddesses in india taking her place in poster art form in altar rooms of millions of hindu

new devotees could immediately recognize many of her characteristic moods and attributes and feel them deeply because she shared them with other goddesses long since familiar to them some scholars also identify a shakta influence in increasing visibility of hindu female saints and gurus through web sites world tours and devotional groups across globe devotional publications and videos while some of these teachers represent conservative and patriarchal lineages of mainstream hinduism pechilis notes that others for example mata and mother meera operate in a strongly feminine mode that is
