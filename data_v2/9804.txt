typhoon sarah was among deadliest typhoons on record in western pacific ocean killing around 2 000 people it formed during peak of busy 1959 pacific typhoon season near guam and moved generally to west northwest continued observations from hurricane hunters allowed joint typhoon warning center jtwc to track sarah from its origins to its peak as a powerful typhoon with maximum sustained winds estimated at 305 km h 190 mph on september 15 shortly thereafter typhoon struck small japanese island of miyako jima where barometric pressure fell to second lowest on record for country sarah turned to north and northeast weakening from its peak intensity on september 17 typhoon made landfall just west of busan south korea with winds of 185 km h 115 mph nation s strongest landfall at time and only to be surpassed by typhoon maemi in 2003 sarah later became extratropical over japanese island of hokkaido on september 18 although remnants persisted for several days crossing into russian far east and later dissipating on september 23 on miyako jima sarah damaged all of crops and destroyed about 6 000 houses damage was estimated at 2 million and there were seven deaths damage prompted japan meteorological agency to give sarah special name of miyakojima typhoon however effects were worst in south korea and sarah was described as worst typhoon there in 50 years wind gusts there

meteorological history on september 10 a tropical disturbance persisted within intertropical convergence zone near pohnpei when hurricane hunters approached system at 02 00 utc on september 11 they observed a center with several small circulations about 130 km 80 mi east of guam on that basis joint typhoon warning center classified system as tropical depression sarah depression passed near or just north of guam as tracked by radar by late on september 11 hurricane hunters were reporting flight level winds of 95 km h 60 mph early on september 12 jtwc upgraded sarah to a tropical storm after circulation became better defined storm exhibited a parabolic trajectory that was slightly to west of typical september storm it moved westward initially but gradually curved to northwest a hurricane hunters flight at 14 15 utc on september 12 observed a 65 km 40 mi eye diameter prompting jtwc to upgrade sarah further to typhoon status with maximum sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph after becoming a typhoon sarah quickly intensified at 08 00 utc on september 13 hurricane hunters reported flight level winds of 185 km h 115 mph subsequent analysis estimated that typhoon attained these winds at 00 00 utc that day at 12 00 utc on september 14 jtwc estimated that sarah intensified to equivalent of a category 5 on saffir simpson scale based on aircraft estimates typhoon intensified further and late on september 14 hurricane hunters reported flight level winds of 250 km h 155 mph estimating surface winds of 315 km h 195 mph intensity was adjusted slightly downward in a post analysis with peak winds of 305 km h 190 mph at 06 00 utc on september 15 about 415 km 260 mi east of taiwan in addition typhoon attained a minimum barometric pressure of about three hours after sarah reached peak winds typhoon moved directly over miyako jima an island of japan east of taiwan sarah weakened while curving to north and it passed west of okinawa late on september 15 winds dropped quickly by 24 hours after peak intensity sarah s winds had decreased from 305 km h 190 mph to 185 km h 115 mph typhoon turned and accelerated to northeast toward korean peninsula re intensifying slightly by late on september 16 winds increased to 215 km h 130 mph while sarah passed just east of jeju island typhoon weakened again to winds of 185 km h 115 mph by 00 00 utc on september 17 that day sarah made landfall a few miles west of busan south korea at that intensity this made sarah strongest typhoon to strike country since records began in 1904 and it remained as such until typhoon maemi surpassed it in 2003 typhoon very quickly emerged into sea of japan its circulation becoming poorly defined on september 18 sarah became extratropical after moving over northern japanese island of hokkaido
