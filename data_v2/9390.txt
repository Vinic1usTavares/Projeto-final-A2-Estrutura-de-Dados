salyut 6 lit salute 6 dos 5 was a soviet orbital space station eighth flown as part of salyut programme launched on 29 september 1977 by a proton rocket station was first of second generation type of space station salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary advances over earlier soviet space stations which it nevertheless resembled in overall design these included addition of a second docking port a new main propulsion system and station s primary scientific instrument bst 1m multispectral telescope addition of second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned progress freighters possible for first time early salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage aside from limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their soyuz spacecraft nor could propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply consequently once consumables launched with station were used up its mission had to be concluded and as a result manned missions had a maximal duration of three months progress spacecraft could now bring fresh supplies and propellant and also be used to dispose of waste which was then destroyed once spacecraft was deorbited five crew residencies took place over station s lifespan in late 1977 early 1978 late 1978 mid 1979 mid 1980 and early 1981 including cosmonauts from warsaw pact countries as part of intercosmos programme these crews were responsible for carrying out primary missions of salyut 6 including astronomy earth resources observations and study of effect of spaceflight on human body following completion of these missions and launch of its successor salyut 7 salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 july 1982 almost five years after its launch description salyut 6 launched on a proton rocket on 29 september 1977 marked switch from engineering development stations to routine operations and united most effective elements from each of previous stations its navigation system made up of delta semi automatic computer to depict station s orbit and system to control its orientation was based on that used on salyut 4 as was its power system which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels together producing a peak of 4 kilowatts of power over 51 m2 station s thermal regulation systems which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators was also derived from that used on salyut 4 in addition salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on salyut 3 and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station thumb left salyut 6 with progress p and soyuz f spacecraft most important feature on salyut 6 however was addition of a second docking port on aft end of station which allowed two spacecraft to be docked at once this in turn allowed resident crews to receive shorter visiting expeditions whilst they remained on board and for crew handovers to take place in addition it allowed soyuz spacecraft that had exceeded their operating lifespan to be returned to earth and replaced by fresh ones soyuz 7k used from 1972 to 1981 had a maximal operating lifespan of three months such handovers with one expedition vacating station only after next had arrived permitted long sought after aim of continuous occupation to move a step closer very first long duration crew to visit station broke a long standing endurance record set on board american skylab station staying 96 days in orbit whilst longest expedition lasted 185 days some of visiting expeditions were flown as part of intercosmos programme with non soviet cosmonauts visiting station vladimir remek of czechoslovakia first space traveller not from us or ussr visited salyut 6 in 1978 and station hosted cosmonauts from hungary poland romania cuba mongolia vietnam and east germany rearward of two ports was fitted with plumbing to allow station to be refueled by unmanned progress spacecraft these freighters which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep station replenished helped ensure that crew were always able to carry out useful scientific work aboard station in all twelve progress flights delivered over 20 tonnes of equipment supplies and fuel addition of extra docking port caused adoption of almaz derived twin chamber propulsion system first used on salyut 3 and 5 with two engine nozzles each producing 2 9 of thrust mounted peripherally on either side of aft port salyut 6 introduced a unified propulsion system with both engines and station s control thrusters running on unsymmetrical and nitrogen tetroxide drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks allowing refueling capabilities of visiting progress tankers to be exploited to maximal effect entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at rear of station which had same diameter as main pressurized compartment however replacement of soyuz engine used on previous stations with bay meant that station kept an overall length similar to its predecessors main engines could not be fired if rear docking port was in use hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by visiting spacecraft salyut 6 s propulsion system experienced a serious malfunction during second crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again for remainder of station s lifespan as a consequence it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments after each crew residency ended it was necessary for progress and tks spacecraft to boost station into a high orbit so it wouldn t decay until next residency began to enable spacewalks salyut 6 was equipped with an inward opening eva hatch on side of forward transfer compartment which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to system used on salyut 4 this compartment contained two new semi rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency finally station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts with machinery being soundproofed crews being provided with designated cots for sleeping and equipping of station with a shower and extensive gymnasium instruments primary instrument carried aboard station was bst 1m multispectral telescope which could carry out astronomical observations in infrared ultraviolet and submillimetre spectra using a 1 5 metre diameter mirror which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around telescope could be operated only when salyut 6 was on night side of earth and had its cover closed for rest of time second major instrument was 6m multispectral camera which carried out earth resources observations an improved form of a camera first tested on soyuz 22 camera captured an area of 165 x 220 kilometres with each image down to a resolution of 20 metres each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200 frame cassettes which required regular replacement due to fogging effects of radiation salyut 6 also featured a kate 140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140 millimetres which captured images of 450 x 450 kilometres with a resolution of 50 metres in visible and infrared spectra which could be operated either remotely or by resident crews photographic capabilities of station were therefore extensive and soviet ministry of agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine capabilities of cameras to further expand its scientific capabilities salyut 6 was equipped with 20 portholes for observations two scientific airlocks to expose equipment to space or eject rubbish and various pieces of apparatus to carry out biological experiments later on during flight a progress spacecraft delivered an external telescope radio observatory which incorporated a directional antenna and five radiometers antenna was deployed on rear docking assembly with controller remaining inside station and was used for both astronomical and meteorological observations support craft thumb right original progress variant which was first used to resupply salyut 6 in 1978 salyut 6 was primarily supported by manned soyuz spacecraft which carried out crew rotations and would also have been used in event of an emergency evacuation ferries docked automatically to station making use of new igla automatic docking system and were used by departing crews to return to earth at end of their flight station was first to be able to be resupplied by newly developed unmanned progress freighters although they could only dock at rear port as front port lacked plumbing used to refuel propulsion system freighters docked automatically to station via igla and were then opened and emptied by cosmonauts on board whilst transfer of fuel to station took place automatically under supervision from ground in addition to soyuz and progress spacecraft after final crew had left salyut 6 was visited by an experimental transport logistics spacecraft called kosmos 1267 in 1982 transport logistics spacecraft known as tks was originally designed for almaz programme and proved that large modules could dock automatically with space stations a major step toward construction of stations such as mir and international space station resident crews station received 16 cosmonaut crews including six long duration crews with longest expedition lasting 185 days resident crew missions were identified with an eo prefix whilst short duration missions were identified with ep on 10 december 1977 first resident crew yuri romanenko and georgi grechko arrived on soyuz 26 and remained aboard salyut 6 for 96 days on 15 june 1978 vladimir kovalyonok and aleksandr ivanchenkov soyuz 29 arrived and remained on board for 140 days vladimir lyakhov and valery ryumin soyuz 32 arrived on 25 february 1979 and stayed 175 days on 9 april 1980 leonid popov and valery ryumin soyuz 35 arrived for longest stay on salyut 6 185 days while aboard on 19 july they sent their greetings to olympians and wished them happy starts in live communication between station and central lenin stadium where opening ceremony of 1980 summer olympics was held they appeared on stadium s scoreboard and their voices were translated via loud speakers a repair mission consisting of leonid kizim oleg makarov and gennady strekalov soyuz t 3 worked on space station for 12 days starting on 27 november 1980 on 12 march 1981 last resident crew vladimir kovalyonok and viktor
