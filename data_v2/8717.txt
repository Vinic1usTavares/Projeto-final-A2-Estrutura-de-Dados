into musical equivalents of blended hip hop traditional jazz and other contemporary genres on his approach to project luhrmann said question for me in approaching gatsby was how to elicit from our audience same level of excitement and pop cultural immediacy toward world that fitzgerald did for his audience and in our age energy of jazz is caught in energy of hip hop luhrmann also stated that jeymes samuel was one of individuals he worked with on soundtrack he served as film s executive music consultant he further described his collaborations with producers of album during an interview

contributing to project it was an honor to work with baz luhrmann on his amazing adaptation of one of most extraordinary books ever written movie is highly glamorous and exciting rick nowels and i were thrilled to write song for film on april 2 2013 amy winehouse s father used his twitter profile to claim that beyonce had not informed him of her plans to cover back to black and that he wanted income from song to go to his amy winehouse foundation he wrote i don t know this but what if beyonce gave ps100 000 to foundation do you know how many kids that would help just putting it out there he later added let me repeat this is first i have heard of beyonce doing amy s song kia makarechi of huffington post noted that beyonce did not use song on a personal record so it was slightly curious for winehouse to ask her for a donation winehouse later used his twitter account to write i like beyonce s cover and have no however upon hearing full length track he wrote on his twitter profile i just heard andre part of back to black terrible he should have let beyonce do it all music and lyrics daily telegraph described film s music as a decidedly modern mix of 21st century rap rock and pop jody rosen of rolling stone commented that album s songs have a consistent mood of noirish doomed romance several songs feature influences from electronic music which was also present on soundtrack for luhrmann s romeo juliet other musical elements featured on album include electronica hip hop and rock music with jazz age sounds kathy mccabe of australia s daily telegraph noted inclusion of orchestral flourishes in most of songs instrumentally horn driven sounds with loping bass beats and house music synths are used in songs songs themes include partying murder and heartache help to drive story s point home illusionary love excess of leisure classes and curse of money as noted by cristina jaleru of associated press entertainment weeklys adam carlson concluded that soundtrack s songs reflected that it is set nearly a century in past he noted that it contains all honking brass and a preference for tempos that slide up scale like liquor getting hot just as they hit chorus logan smithson of webzine popmatters commented that an important function of a soundtrack is to maintain a cohesive sound a general theme to piece tracks together and make it sound like a single piece of work rather than a collection of songs he felt that soundtrack accomplished this feat although artists come from a mixture of genres and backgrounds he further noted great gatsby soundtrack does its job of capturing sound of roaring 20s a fusion of horns brings era to life with a modern twist jazzy melodies are captured by bryan ferry orchestra some songs certainly have a neo soul vibe going reminiscent of late amy winehouse songs opening song 100 bill by jay z contains a chopped and screwed beat and electro rap elements and is written from perspective of a modern day gatsby it begins with a speech by leonardo dicaprio while throughout song jay z is backed by samples of a children s choir and a 20s jazz horn in song he raps about being remembered pitfalls of wealth as well as comparing rich people from 1920s and 21st century back to black written by mark ronson and amy winehouse originally appeared on her 2006 album of same name it was last song added to album after jay z

electropop and hip hop elements and 1920s style dance music as well as use of a ukulele a little party never killed nobody all we got is a swing hip hop and dubstep song which references novel s viewing parties held by gatsby young and beautiful was written by del rey and rick nowels musically it is a lush ballad which contains del rey s sweeping vocals accompanied by dreamy strings and canned percussion lyrically song is written from perspective of daisy buchanan gatsby s lover and it talks about being young forever going to parties nostalgia and vulnerability as shown in lyrics

heart wrenching wail where wind blows contains soul vocals performed by coco o and contains an old time piano sampling with a whirring drum n bass circular beat and jazzy keys r kurt osenlund of slant magazine commented that song has instrumentals of a cole porter classic but vocals akin to those of jennifer hudson jim farber of new york s daily news noted that she sings with doll like vocals of betty boop crazy in love credited to beyonce shawn carter jay z rich harrison and eugene record originally appeared on her 2003 album dangerously in love it was chosen for inclusion on album as it

and strings kill and run which contains electronica elements and is performed by sia was compared with adele s songs most notably with skyfall because of its lush and languid sound backed by strings

jeffries gave album a 4 out of 5 star rating he praised album writing in his review buying into luhrmann s vision is always issue but here music is crafted enough inspired enough and deep enough that it s worth diving into without reservations luckily you can wring all that disappointment and despair out of your fine stylish suit after surfacing kelly of american songwriter gave soundtrack a 3 5 out of 5 score writing that songs from soundtrack create a resemblance of movie s plot adding it mirrors many aesthetic elements of film augments general storyline and adds depth and personality to

moments and forgettable ones popmatters logan smithson gave album a 6 out of 10 score writing that soundtrack avoids sticking to only one genre stating that different styles on soundtrack were made in sacrifice while album did receive positive reviews there was also mixed ones elysa gardner of usa today gave album a 3 5 out of 4 star rating noting that better songs on soundtrack are ones that do not mention events in film jim farber of daily news questioned why album did not include blues a sound as key to 20s as jazz he added y ou could accuse modern artists of indulging in a bit of dress up for these tracks even so they hit desired party tone one that even 90 years later still has sass paula mejia of consequence of sound gave album a 3 out of 5 star rating saying in her review that soundtrack is like a sampler album that people from grammys give out to people like her who are not notable enough to attend concluding that she is not completely satisfied with album s content laura snapes of pitchfork media gave album a 4 out of 10 score stating that album s songs do not fit theme of movie except for together and hearts a mess thomas corner of chicago sun times described album as an anachronistic hootenanny adding with nods to roaring 20s without attempts at replicating them most performances are restrained and pull at various taut threads of gatsby s unraveling eric henderson of slant magazine gave a mixed review writing that great gatsby speaks on duke and ella s behalf when it says it don t mean a thing period drew mcweeny of hitfix gave album a negative review saying that it was probably weakest for any of luhrmann films describing it as a non stop wallpaper of guest appearances by people who are famous in present and none of it sticks katie hasty of same publication also gave a negative review of album describing it as a vehicular manslaughter which combines different music elements in ways that demean all genres she also commented that struggle of now ness is pertinent to one of soundtrack s few achievements and concluded elegance of suggestion from its better songs is disrupted by its obnoxious neighbors bloomberg l p s mark beech gave album a similarly negative review heavily criticizing production by jay z and referring to album as a commercial shotgun marriage that threatens to go awry damaging credibility of both movie and brands he did
