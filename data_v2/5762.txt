laid for a crossing accordingly israelis attacked egyptian forces in and around chinese farm determined egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for israelis who suffered heavy losses israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway only managing to seize an important crossroad on second day suffering from a lack of infantry israelis brought up paratroopers during night of october 16 17 they were tasked with clearing anti tank defenses for armor but they became pinned down by heavy egyptian fire paratroopers drew egyptian attention long enough for israelis to move bridging equipment to canal undetected armored forces later extricated paratroopers egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on october 17 it initially succeeded but was pushed back by israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting entire day seriously depleted by continuous fighting egyptians relinquished control of routes to canal opening them up to israelis battle is remembered as one of most costly and brutal battles of war background on october 6 1973 egypt launched operation badr intending to cross suez canal and establish bridgeheads on opposite bank of sinai peninsula which had been occupied by israel since 1967 coordinated with a syrian assault on golan heights crossing achieved tactical surprise and was a success thereafter counterattacks by israeli reserves were unsuccessful by october 10 fighting along front had come to a lull egyptians dug in and hoped to wear down israelis by attrition while remaining within range of their ground surface to air missiles which provided air cover from west bank of canal while israelis focused on directing their main efforts against syrians in golan and reorganizing their battered forces israeli failures led to replacement of chief of israeli southern command major general shmuel gonen with chaim bar lev although gonen was retained as his aide hammad 2002 pp 85 1996 pp 27 55 situation changed when sadat in face of protests from his senior commanders ordered an offensive to seize strategic sinai mountain passes hoping to relieve israeli pressure on syrians resulting offensive was ill planned and ill executed culminating in heavy egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives this gave israelis initiative to launch a counteroffensive hammad 2002 pp 237 1996 pp 55 2002 pp 485 490 on october 14 immediately following egyptian offensive israeli chief of staff david elazar presented general

designated crossing point lay near to deversoir at northern end of great bitter lake on suez canal israelis had to open principal route to deversoir and secure a corridor stretching north of crossing site known as yard paratroopers and armor would then cross canal to establish a after which bridges would be laid with at least one to be operational by morning of october 16 israelis would then cross to west bank and attack south and west with end goal of reaching suez thus encircling and cutting off two egyptian divisions on east bank southern command allotted 24 hours for setting up of bridgehead and 24 hours for israeli forces to reach suez with latter expected to be under israeli control by october 18 at latest it would soon be shown that execution of operation stouthearted men

near great bitter lake and south of deveroir where fort lakekan part of bar lev line was located second road codenamed tirtur ran north of akavish it too connected artillery road to lexicon but provided a direct route to yard lexicon tirtur junction fell on fort matzmed this fortification which consisted of two strongpoints apart had been captured on october 9 by a small assault force while fort lakekan had been evacuated without any combat on october 8 importance of both fortifications lay in their control of lexicon akavish and lexicon tirtur junctions both forts however were in designated buffer zone long between second and third armies it was believed this area would not need defending as it was both adjacent to great bitter lake a natural obstacle and most of it lay outside range of egyptian sams thus they were left unoccupied by local egyptian commander who chose not to extend his defenses southwards egyptian negligence to occupy and defend both forts would greatly assist israelis in operation stouthearted men hammad 2002 pp 295 296 pp 308 2002 pp 493 494 just north of lexicon tirtur junction was village of al galaa prior to 1967 six day war village had

lexicon tirtur junction to confront any egyptian movements towards crossing site just south of crossroads entire company was wiped out after it was ambushed by egyptian infantry of 16th brigade company commander was killed and most of his men were casualties unbeknownst to matt meanwhile israeli artillery batteries opened fire on landing site on west bank delivering around 70 tons of shells

repulsed by egyptians as had been expected but succeeded in its purpose when 16th division s southern flank came under increasing israeli attack egyptians assumed that israeli objective was to roll up second army s right flank not to open a corridor to west bank for israeli forces to cross canal for next 24 hours this remained general impression among egyptian commanders and they reacted accordingly had they discovered israelis true intentions earlier egyptians would almost certainly have been able to defeat israeli operation in light of greater strength of their forces and reserves near deversoir area on east and west banks of suez canal dupuy 2002 p 2002 pp 307 308 326 442 443 lexicon tirtur junction while paratroopers prepared to cross reshef was informed that akavish had been

and secure tirtur and chinese farm hammad 2002 p ballance 1997 p 226 an infantry battalion forming right flank of abd el hamid s 16th brigade was in position to defend lexicon tirtur crossroads initially reshef sent two armored battalions northward on lexicon as israeli tanks neared infantry battalion they were met by heavy fire from anti tank weapons they lost 27 tanks during this engagement although seven israeli tanks managed to break through battalion s westernmost position on lexicon and advance northwards to al galaa thereafter abd el hamid ordered tank hunting squads groups of ten equipped with rpg 7 rockets and rpg 43 grenades to deploy around al galaa and destroy those tanks that broke through he also sent a tank company to reinforce infantry battalion at night reshef moved with his remaining forces north along canal bank bypassing 16th brigade s positions israelis soon found themselves in center of a huge administrative area and vehicle park reshef s brigade had stumbled into command and supply bases of egyptian 16th and 21st divisions base was located near canal on assumption that it was safest location from israeli attacks which was expected to come from east where defenses were strongest not from south where they were weakest both sides immediately opened fire inadvertently leading to destruction of supply trucks and sam launchers egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of 21st division a battalion of 14th brigade and a battalion less one company of 18th brigade tanks repelled israelis who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces hammad 2002 pp 309 310 brigadier general hafez commanding 16th infantry division planned to contain israeli attack from south by having 18th mechanized brigade occupy defenses north of chinese farm directly behind 16th infantry brigade but without its organic tank battalion which was designated as part of division s reserve 1st armored brigade moved southward to occupy positions between lateral road and canal on right flank of 18th brigade upon brigade s arrival it engaged israeli armor from reshef s brigade in al galaa egyptian armor destroyed around 15 tanks and several half tracks at around 1 00 pm sorties of egyptian su 7s destroyed many israeli tanks in ground attack missions over al galaa village 1st brigade countered a flanking attempt on its left at 2 00 pm by a tank battalion thwarting attack and destroying ten tanks during its engagements on october 16 21st division managed to destroy over 50 israeli tanks and apcs while subjected to frequent israeli air strikes and artillery barrages 1st brigade accounted for most of kills while suffering fewer losses hammad 2002 pp 335 336 442 meanwhile one of reshef s mechanized battalions commanded by major nathan shunari was reinforced with company sized remnants of 40th tank battalion now commanded by captain gideon giladi after previous battalion commander had been wounded shunari was ordered to seize lexicon tirtur junction he sent tank company ahead first which initially reported no egyptian units shunari dispatched an infantry unit in six half tracks to junction upon reaching it they discovered that tank company had already been destroyed and giladi killed soon vehicles began came under heavy fire stopping their advance unit commander reported casualties and shunari ordered remainder of his battalion to aid pinned down men attempts to rescue infantry failed and egyptian battalion defending junction directed heavy firepower against area aided by brigade s artillery egyptian defenders had managed to catch israelis in a prepared killing zone shunari whose troops lacked cover and were threatened with annihilation regrouped some of his forces and managed to escape area in vehicles but infantry half track unit first sent to crossroads remained pinned down hammad 2002 pp 310 311 reshef sent another tank company to rescue infantrymen tanks advanced towards chinese farm from south as they neared farm and village a downpour of anti tank and artillery fire forced company to retreat nathan kept pleading with to send additional support unaware he was facing superior egyptian forces after entering administrative bases of egyptian 16th and 21st divisions with no help coming unit commander had his men carry wounded and attempted to leave battlefield tasking two sections of heavy machine guns with providing cover to force as israelis slowly made their way back to their lines a group of egyptian tanks intercepted and wiped out

at 3 00 am from west as egyptians were preparing for further attacks from south and east as israelis attacked lieutenant colonel brom was killed barely thirty meters from egyptian positions disrupting his battalion s assault israelis sustained losses but managed to retreat soon after a tank company attacked crossroads at 4 00 am on october 16 but also withdrew after losing three tanks hammad 2002 p 312 by 4 00 am on october 16 reshef s brigade which had begun operation with 97 tanks had lost 56 in just twelve hours of fighting leaving only 41 remaining although seizing crossing site had been accomplished easily stiff resistance had prevented reshef from achieving his remaining objectives namely opening routes to canal and securing a corridor reshef s force would further drop to just 27 tanks by noon as a whole sharon s division suffered some 300 killed and 1 000 wounded that night to help reshef secure corridor sharon supplied him with two tank battalions by 6 00 pm propping his numbers up to 81 tanks gawrych 1996 p 2002 p 315 hearing reports of heavy fighting taking place between junction and chinese farm dayan suggested withdrawing matt s brigade and canceling operation he voiced concerns that paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for bridges had failed gonen rejected suggestion stating that if we knew in advance this was going to happen we would not have started crossing operation but now that we have crossed then let us follow through to bitter end bar lev concurred with gonen and dayan decided not to press his suggestion at around 6 00 am golda meir telephoned dayan to inquire about situation dayan informed her that bridges had not yet been laid and that egyptians had closed routes leading to deveroir he also stated there were high hopes that egyptian resistance would be overcome and that bridges would be laid during morning dayan also told her that matt s paratrooper brigade had crossed to west bank without encountering resistance and that southern command as yet had no intentions of withdrawing brigade even if bridge laying was delayed hammad 2002 pp 313 314 thumb 250px right israeli armor knocked out near lexicon tirtur junction shortly after dawn reshef conducted a reconnaissance of battlefield from a hilltop he saw that egyptians had set up a strong blocking position defending junction composed of egyptian tanks situated in hull down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and now dry irrigation ditches of chinese farm infantry were from 16th brigade s right flank battalion and had support of recoilless rifles rpg 7s and some manually guided at 3 missiles reshef discovered that egyptians had mined both sides of lexicon road to which he had lost several of his tanks hammad 2002 p 314 reshef decided to change tactics he personally commanded 40th armored battalions after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from previous night s fighting and maneuvered to attack from west from direction of canal hitting egyptian positions in flank while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north reshef s forces engaged egyptians from long range picking off defensive positions from afar while using alternate fire and movement to advance to crossroads defending infantry battalion exhausted by continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition soon withdrew allowing israelis to at last seize junction in meantime other difficulties were surfacing sharon reported to southern command that one section of roller bridge being towed by erez s brigade had been damaged and that engineers needed a few hours to repair it he also requested additional forces to help secure corridor noting stiff resistance facing reshef s brigade sharon s report prompted bar lev to alert adan to prepare to open corridor with his division sharon argued for adan s division to cross canal on rafts and to proceed with operation abiray lev without waiting for bridges both gonen and bar lev rejected sharon s suggestion since without a secure corridor to canal israeli forces on west bank would be threatened with encirclement subsequently bar lev ordered that no more israeli forces or equipment would cross to west bank until bridges had been laid hammad 2002 pp 315 316 after receiving reinforcements reshef focused on clearing tirtur road he left a battalion of around 30 tanks between junction and western part of chinese farm and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by sharon he concentrated on section of tirtur road defended by an egyptian battalion forming left flank of 16th infantry brigade one of reshef s battalions attacked from north east other from west egyptian battalion managed to halt advance aided by fire from tanks and anti tank weapons on slopes of missouri a hill north west of chinese farm causing reshef to break off his attack hammad 2002 pp 314 2002 p 500 this last attempt left reshef s brigade in a desperate situation he had 27 tanks remaining and was running short on ammunition and supplies reshef requested authorization from sharon to withdraw his brigade to fort lakekan to regroup his forces and regain combat effectiveness israeli reinforcement unexpected egyptian resistance forced israeli southern command to change its plans visiting adan s advance command post gonen noted that sharon has disappointed us and handed adan task of moving pontoon bridge to canal adan was to prepare to clear akavish and tirtur roads to deploy bridges gonen informed sharon of adan s new orders and tasked sharon with capturing chinese farm and egyptian positions near farm and canal needing to regroup his forces sharon suggested that he capture farm once adan had cleared routes to canal and gonen consented in a later meeting with dayan and bar lev gonen reiterated latter s statement that no more forces would cross until bridges had been laid and added that should situation worsen paratroopers could be withdrawn hammad 2002 pp 316 317 162nd division concentrated south of tasa had been standing by to cross canal since dawn on october 16 division advanced towards canal but movement was hampered by massive traffic jams on roads leading to canal when adan realized that akavish was closed he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver through desert to reach deversoir when it arrived sharon contacted adan explaining reshef s difficult situation and requested that battalion be placed under his command adan accepted and sharon in turn authorized reshef s request to pull back and regroup replacing his brigade with tank battalion hammad 2002 pp 317 2002 p 506 after receiving his new orders adan moved his division to occupy a series of positions opposite abd el hamid s 16th brigade one of adan s armored brigades had been placed as a reserve force under southern command abd el hamid s left flank infantry battalion blocking tirtur repelled israeli tanks attacking westwards and thwarted adan s efforts to clear road adan realized that without infantry support breaking through egyptian positions would prove costly however at 2 00 pm southern command notified adan that he was soon receive 35th paratrooper brigade which had been transported by helicopters from ras on gulf of suez to east of canal brigade made its way to canal in buses and was greatly delayed by traffic on akavish road adan had expected unit to arrive well before dusk but brigade commander colonel uzi ya iri only arrived at 10 00 pm rest of his brigade soon arrived transported by helicopters after buses had come to a complete standstill hammad 2002 p 318 paratrooper effort adan met ya iri at adan s former command post adan briefly explained situation and in a short discussion ya iri laid out his plan he was tasked with clearing akavish and tirtur at 11 30 pm paratroopers began moving with a battalion under lieutenant colonel yitzhak mordechai spearheading advance ya iri acting with a sense of urgency had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence or performing adequate reconnaissance on egyptian defenses his unit lacked artillery observers and rather than wait for one to arrive it was agreed paratroopers would request fire support of 162nd division s command net brigade was acting without armor support hammad 2002 p 2000 p 2002 pp 506 507 thumb left israeli roller bridge designed to be swiftly deployed on canal fighting at chinese farm meant bridge reached canal only after pontoon bridge had already been deployed after some time mordechai s battalion had reached an area where tirtur and akavish were closest distance between them no wider than at around 2 45 am they came into contact with abd el hamid s left flank battalion positioned around tirtur battalion directed effective artillery fire against paratroopers who were also receiving heavy machine gun and small arms fire from entrenched egyptian infantry paratroopers attempted to assault machine gun positions in places advancing to within a few meters of egyptian lines paratrooper companies spread out but repeatedly failed to reach defenses israeli artillery fire was ineffective egyptian infantry were able to suppress paratroopers movement and thwart flanking attempts most company and platoon commanders were killed or wounded adan ordered ya iri to narrow his brigade s front and focus on clearing akavish instead but lead paratrooper battalion was under such heavy fire that it was impossible to maneuver dupuy 2002 p 507 with dawn nearing adan realized that if pontoon bridge could not be brought to canal during few remaining hours of dark an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across canal and in daylight paratroopers would sustain more casualties he sent a half track company to reconnoiter akavish at 3 00 half an hour later company reported it had reached crossing site without encountering any resistance egyptian battalion fighting paratroopers had focused all their attention on israelis at tirtur ignoring activity on akavish adan took a risky decision sending irreplaceable pontoons down akavish to canal idf bulldozers cleared road of wreckage and debris and israelis reached fort lakekan before turning northwards finally reaching crossing site bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of 143rd division hammad 2002 p 320 at dawn ya iri requested approval from adan to withdraw his brigade paratroopers having thus far been unsuccessful in reaching egyptian lines gonen denied request approving only medevac for wounded this was countermanded after bar lev visited adan at his command post and realized gravity of paratroopers situation an armored battalion was tasked with covering paratroopers but was unable to locate them paratroopers released red smoke to pinpoint their position but this backfired as egyptians also spotted smoke directing accurate artillery fire against them and inflicting further casualties tanks assaulted defenses but suffered losses and fell back it became evident that withdrawal could not be accomplished in open apcs and half tracks were brought up to extract paratroopers and wounded all while under fire israelis finally withdrew under cover of friendly tanks in 14 hours of almost uninterrupted combat paratroopers suffered heavy casualties with some 40 70 killed and 100 wounded ya iri would state that we had suffered seventy casualties because we went into action too hastily without proper intelligence on enemy s defenses armored losses sustained during withdrawal were also heavy hammad 2002 p 321 egyptian withdrawal israeli armored brigades principally those of nir amir and raviv

80 israeli tanks attacking their positions at around 7 00 am on october 17 21st division received orders to evict israeli armor from vicinity of al galaa village and capture fort matzmed as part of a larger egyptian effort to seal israeli penetration and destroy bridgehead on west bank since oraby had 18th mechanized brigade in defensive positions and stripped of its tank battalion and 14th brigade defending other parts of egyptian bridgehead he tasked 1st brigade to execute attack with its remaining 53 tanks at 8 00 am egyptians conducted an air and artillery strike on area for some fifteen minutes after which attack commenced egyptian tanks managed to destroy israeli armor near village and reached northern strongpoint of fort matzmed just after 9 00 am in face of heavy resistance however they were soon repelled by israeli ground fire supported by air strikes israeli tanks then counterattacked and managed to advance significantly armored battle continued in a see saw fashion until 9 00 pm by which time 1st brigade had restored its original lines meanwhile a 5 00 pm attack by one of 18th brigade s mechanized infantry battalions on al galaa failed with heavy losses and ten tanks were then allocated to brigade israeli armor had occupied irrigation ditches around farm and were entrenched in them which significantly enhanced their defensive position egyptian attacks directed against israeli corridor or bridgehead failed with heavy losses hammad 2002 pp 382 1996 p 64 1st brigade had just 33 tanks remaining after losing 20 tanks j boyne p 334 this prompted second army command to transfer a battalion of 21 tanks on october 18 from 2nd infantry division to north to reinforce dwindling tank numbers in 16th division s bridgehead as battalion moved south a large number of israeli aircraft attacked formation forcing it to undertake evasive maneuvers turning eastwards and fanning out in desert terrain thereby avoiding losses battalion was then attached to

divisions of egyptian third field army sharon also crossed with part of his division simultaneously trying to defend and expand israeli corridor to suez canal as well attacking northwards on west bank to ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off second army his efforts bogged down and he was unable to reach ismailia see battle of ismailia while attempts to seize critical positions and expand israeli corridor on east bank saw little to no success gawrych 2000 pp 223 226 while ultimately an israeli victory battle of chinese farm has an especially infamous legacy among israeli participants

him said look at this valley of death minister taken aback by great destruction before him muttered in an undertone what you people have done here later dayan would recount that i am no novice at war or battle scenes but i have never seen such a sight not in reality or in paintings or in worst war movies here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as eye could see sharon would also provide his own poignant account of aftermath it was as if a hand to hand battle of armor had taken place coming close you could see egyptian and jewish dead lying side by side soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together no picture could capture horror of scene none could encompass what had happened there hammad pp 298 losses suffered by both egyptians and israelis in battle
