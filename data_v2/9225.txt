signings of central defender dave evans and right winger john hendrie to build on previous season s high finish mccall was an integral part of team as city won division three championship in 1984 85 during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever present players title was assured in penultimate game when mccall scored second goal in a 2 0 victory over bolton wanderers league title was paraded before final game of season on 11 may 1985 at home to lincoln city however club s title was overshadowed when 56 people died in bradford city stadium fire when valley parade ground s main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play during which mccall s father who was with other family members was badly injured after fire mccall still in his kit spent several hours driving from ground to his sister s house then to bradford royal infirmary and hospital trying to find his father his father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks for following 19 months club played games away from valley parade cherry and players became a close knit team attending funerals of victims and other engagements in months that followed and club s 13th place finish in division two in 1985 86 was hailed a major achievement during bradford s time away from valley parade mccall also turned his back on leeds united team he had supported as a child after their fans set fire to a chip van at odsal stadium mccall became club captain in november 1986 aged just 21 after peter jackson moved to newcastle united under cherry s replacement terry dolan club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986 87 like jackson mccall and hendrie were both keen to move to a division one club but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season dolan brought in paul tomlinson brian mitchell and lee sinnott in a bid to help mccall and hendrie realise their dreams with city they mounted a promotion challenge in 1987 88 and were top for much of season until they faltered in new year when promotion was missed initially by one point on last day of season after a 3 2 defeat against ipswich town and then through play off defeat to middlesbrough mccall left club signing for everton for ps850 000 in june 1988 he had played 238 league games for club scoring 37 goals and in total played 285 games scoring 46 goals mccall was later outspoken in his autobiography real mccall about city s failure to strengthen side to secure promotion his departure was soured when he was forced to go to football league with a professional footballers association representative to win ps8 327 15 of an unpaid signing on fee everton mccall joined everton at a time when its former triumphant side of mid 1980s had broken up following ban on english sides competing in europe which marked start of a period of underachievement at goodison park his everton debut came in a 4 0 victory over newcastle united on 27 august 1988 against his former teammate hendrie who was making his debut for newcastle mccall also returned to valley parade for a league cup tie but his everton side were knocked out by bradford 3 1 on 14 december 1988 he started 29 league games in 1988 89 as well as another four substitute appearances but failed to score in league he was also a substitute in 1989 fa cup final when he scored everton s equaliser in merseyside

made a second appearance in an everton shirt at valley parade when he was invited by former teammate mark ellis to bring a side for his testimonial in three seasons at everton mccall played 103 league games as well as earned his first caps with scotland but he failed to lift any trophies as club finished eighth sixth and ninth in league apart from fa cup final defeat in 1989 closest he came to winning a trophy at everton was in 1989 90 season when everton topped league in late autumn and remained in contention for title for most rest of season until disappointing form in run in saw them finish sixth rangers in summer of 1991 mccall signed for scottish club rangers for ps1 2 million rangers had just won their third successive scottish premier division title under newly appointed manager walter smith mccall ended up playing in final six of club s nine successive scottish league titles and with rangers also winning a string of cup competitions during that time mccall picked up a total of ten major trophies north of border in his first season at ibrox rangers won league and cup double before they achieved greater success in 1992 93 winning both cups 2 1 against aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of aberdeen in league mccall also enjoyed european success that season when glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in uefa champions league 1992 93 final coming second in semi final group stage to eventual winners olympique de marseille citing reason for their success as spirit which smith instilled in team mccall later said it was an incredible season we won domestic treble we went 44 games unbeaten and we did not lose a single game in europe and though we said we would do it again next year we all knew it was unrepeatable in 1993 94 rangers added another scottish league cup title along with league championship but lost 1 0 in final of scottish cup to dundee united surprisingly being denied a second successive treble following season saw rangers win league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of motherwell but they failed to reach final of either of domestic cups although their winning margin was reduced to four points from city rivals celtic in 1995 96 rangers points tally of 87 was a record high total mccall played in his fourth scottish cup final as rangers defeated hearts 5 1 his rangers side again pushed celtic into second place in 1996 97 and defeated hearts 4 3 in scottish league cup mccall had suffered an injury prior to that final which ruled him out until end of season and he did not play in sufficient league games for a medal but with club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997 98 they had to settle for runners up position with celtic winning league by two points on final day of season mccall was substituted in scottish cup final defeat to hearts as rangers went season without picking up a single title for first season in mccall s time at club in february 2008 mccall became 71st inductee into rangers hall of fame mccall s former teammate and rangers assistant manager ally mccoist presented him with award return to bradford city mccall still had one year left on his rangers contract in 1998 but much of team that walter smith had built had left and mccall was allowed to leave on a free transfer by new manager dick advocaat as long as he joined an english club barnsley and huddersfield town were both interested in signing mccall but he rejoined bradford city as club captain rookie manager paul jewell put together a squad which emerged as surprise promotion contenders after two seasons spent battling relegation adding other new signings including central midfield partner gareth whalley and striker lee mills who went on to be club s top goal scorer season started off slowly with just one win from first seven games but by latter half of season city were vying with ipswich town and birmingham city for second promotion spot behind runaway leaders sunderland loan signing lee sharpe and dean windass were added to ranks and city had chance to seal promotion in their penultimate game against relegation threatened oxford united game finished as a 0 0 draw with mccall heading over goal in final minutes taking promotion bid to final game of season days later he was named club s player of year a 3 2 victory over wolverhampton wanderers at molineux on 9 may 1999 ensured promotion to premier league and denied ipswich town team that had thwarted mccall and bradford 11 years before bradford were expected to struggle in their first season in top flight for 77 years jewell signed david wetherall dean saunders and neil all experienced top flight performers but city were in bottom four teams for most of season it was bradford s home form they earned 26 of their 36 points at valley parade that was key to city avoiding relegation which was narrowly averted by two points after a shock 1 0 final day victory over liverpool in 1999 2000 sending wimbledon down instead when jewell left only days after season ended mccall was appointed assistant manager to chris hutchings and subsequently served as caretaker manager for two games when hutchings was sacked after just 12 games of 2000 01 league season city were relegated with just 26 points during a 6 1 defeat to west yorkshire rivals leeds united in penultimate game mccall and team mate andy myers fought on pitch mccall stayed on for one more season before he was released by manager nicky law in may 2002 shortly before club went into administration for first time after finishing 15th in division one his playing career at bradford city had looked uncertain in december 2001 before law arrived when previous manager jim jefferies had left mccall out of side in a 3 1 defeat at manchester city following a training ground dispute however it was jefferies who lost out in dispute when he resigned his post a week later after summit talks with chairman geoffrey richmond in april 2002 mccall

wolverhampton wanderers mccall played just two league cup games in 2004 05 season and retired just a few weeks before his 41st birthday his career total of 763 league games placed him in 13th position

day in 1984 and chose to join england under 21 squad for their game against turkey however he was only picked as a substitute and referee blew final whistle with mccall waiting to come on he later told scottish newspaper glasgow herald i felt it was a mistake almost from start i was put on bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go but i took my time re tying my boots and generally

his autobiography real mccall he wanted to manage bradford he had been linked with manager s position at bradford city on numerous previous occasions and after colin todd was sacked on 12 february

2006 07 season on 22 may 2007 it was announced mccall would become manager of club where he started his career and on 1 june 2007 he assumed position in less than seven years since mccall s first two game reign serious financial problems had driven club to verge of closure and although they survived threat of oblivion they were unable to avoid a terrible on pitch decline which continued after financial nightmare had been relieved on mccall s return to valley parade bantams had just been relegated to league two meaning that they would be playing in bottom division for first time in 25 years mccall set himself a target of earning promotion back to league one in his first season bradford had just 13 players when mccall took over and he made a number of summer signings including defender darren williams midfielders kyle nix alex rhodes and scott phelan and strikers barry conlon and peter thorne mccall recorded his first win as a manager against wrexham on 25 august 2007 after

players from his squad and replaced them with a number of signings with experience in a higher division as well as michael boulding who was one of league two s top goalscorers during 2007 08 campaign mccall s side made a good start to season and after winning five of their opening six league games went top of league first time city had led table in seven years as a result of maintaining a place in promotion places during first half of season and his stabling influence on club chairmen julian rhodes and mark lawn offered mccall a new contract in january 2009 later in month lawn gave further backing to mccall who was coming under pressure from club s fans following a run of one win in nine games during run mccall was also charged by football association for first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with luton town mccall signed a new contract in february which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at club until 2011 he set himself goal of earning two promotions to put city in championship however less than a month later mccall offered to resign if they did not reach play offs after his side lost 4 1 to bournemouth their fifth consecutive away defeat nobody is hurting more than me but it s as simple as that if we miss out i don t deserve to be here he said city eventually missed out on promotion but mccall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in process because of club s budget being reduced as a result of cuts mccall made a number of changes to his squad during summer of 2009 his team started 2009 10 season by going four games without scoring until they recorded a 5 4 victory against cheltenham town after game mccall said that was youngest and certainly cheapest team bradford have put out for a long time and i m really proud of them city continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached area semi finals of football league trophy where they lost to carlisle united managed by mccall s friend greg abbott but at start of 2010 found themselves 16th in league two and eight points off play offs after a run of five defeats in seven games mccall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games saying bottom line is that players and me personally will get judged on results and results aren t good enough despite club s slide down table he denied he would resign but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing gareth evans to give city a late 2 1 away at torquay united saved mccall from being sacked however defeat to bury in

clean sheet but we can be better and we will be better he followed it up with a 4 0 victory in scottish cup against dundee before his maiden league victory and club s first since november against
