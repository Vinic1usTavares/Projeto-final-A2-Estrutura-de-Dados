possessed by one ring its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills were not present in mythical sources but have a central role in wagner s opera tolkien also acknowledged several non germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas sophocles play oedipus rex he cited as inspiring elements of silmarillion and children of hurin in addition tolkien first read william kirby s translation of finnish national epic kalevala while attending king edward s school he described its character of vainamoinen as one of his influences for gandalf grey kalevala s antihero kullervo was further described as an inspiration for turin turambar dimitra fimi douglas a anderson john garth and many other prominent tolkien scholars believe that tolkien also drew influence from a variety of celtic irish scottish and welsh history and legends however after silmarillion manuscript was rejected in part for its eye splitting celtic names tolkien denied their celtic origin fimi pointed out that despite his dismissive remarks about celtic things in 1937 that tolkien was fluent in medieval welsh though not modern welsh and declared when delivering first o donnell lectures at oxford in 1954 about influences of celtic languages on english language that welsh is beautiful one of tolkien s purposes when writing his middle earth books was to create what his biographer humphrey carpenter called a mythology for england with carpenter citing in support tolkien s letter to milton waldman complaining of poverty of my country it had no stories of its own bound up with its tongue and soil unlike celtic nations of scotland ireland and wales which all had their own well developed mythologies tolkien himself never used exact phrase a mythology for england but he often made statements to that effect writing to one reader that his intention in writing middle earth stories was to restore to english an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own in early 20th century proponents of irish nationalism like poet william butler yeats lady gregory and others had succeeded in linking in public mind traditional irish folk tales of fairies and elves to irish national identity while denigrating english folk tales as being merely derivative of irish folk tales this had prompted a backlash by english writers leading to a savage war of words about which nation had more authentic and better fairy tales with for example english essayist g k chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with yeats over question of superiority of irish vs english fairy tales even though there is nothing innately anti english about irish folklore way in which irish mythology became associated with irish nationalism being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring irish independence led many to perceive irish mythology and folklore as anglophobic tolkien with his determination to write a mythology for england was for this reason disinclined to admit to celtic influences fimi noted in particular that story of noldor elves who fled valinor for middle earth resembles story related in lebor of semi divine tuatha de danann who fled from what is variously described as a place in north or greece to conquer ireland like tolkien s elves tuatha de danann are inferior to gods but superior to humans being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen poets warriors and magicians likewise after triumph of humanity both elves and tuatha de danann are driven underground which causes their fading leading them to become diminutive and pale catholicism catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning tolkien s creative imagination suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit tolkien acknowledged this himself specifically paul h kocher argues that tolkien describes evil in orthodox christian way as absence of good he cites many examples in lord of rings such as sauron s lidless eye black slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing kocher sees tolkien s source as thomas aquinas whom it is reasonable to suppose that tolkien as a medievalist and a catholic knows well tom shippey makes same point but instead of referring to aquinas says tolkien was very familiar with alfred great s anglo saxon translation of boethius consolation of philosophy known as lays of boethius shippey contends that this christian view of evil is most clearly stated by boethius evil is nothing he says tolkien used corollary that evil cannot create as basis of frodo s remark shadow can only mock it cannot make not real new things of its own and related remarks by treebeard and elrond he goes on to argue that in lord of rings evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force more than merely absence of good and suggests that alfred s additions to his translation of boethius may have inspired that view road pp 141 145 stratford caldecott also interpreted ring in theological terms ring of power exemplifies dark magic of corrupted will assertion of self in disobedience to god it appears to give freedom but its true function is to enslave wearer to fallen angel it corrodes human will of wearer rendering him increasingly thin and unreal indeed its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity you could say ring is sin itself tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in long run publications beowulf monsters and critics as well as his fiction tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism his seminal 1936 lecture later published as an article revolutionized treatment of anglo saxon epic beowulf by literary critics essay remains highly influential in study of old english literature to this day beowulf is one of most significant influences upon tolkien s later fiction with major details of both hobbit and lord of rings being adapted from poem piece reveals many of aspects of beowulf which tolkien found most inspiring most prominently role of monsters in literature particularly that of dragon which appears in final third of poem on fairy stories this essay discusses fairy story as a literary form it was initially written as 1939 andrew lang lecture at university of st andrews scotland tolkien focuses on andrew lang s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales he disagreed with lang s broad inclusion in his fairy book collections of traveller s tales beast fables and other types of stories tolkien held a narrower perspective viewing fairy stories as those that took place in faerie an enchanted realm with or without fairies as characters he viewed them as natural development of interaction of human imagination and human language children s books and other short works in addition to his mythopoeic compositions tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children he wrote annual christmas letters from father christmas for them building up a series of short stories later compiled and published as father christmas letters other works included mr bliss and roverandom for children and leaf by part of tree and leaf adventures of tom bombadil smith of wootton major and farmer giles of ham roverandom and smith of wootton major like hobbit borrowed ideas from his legendarium hobbit tolkien never expected his stories to become popular but by sheer accident a book called hobbit which he had written some years before for his own children came in 1936 to attention of susan dagnall an employee of london publishing firm george allen unwin who persuaded tolkien to submit it for publication when it was published a year later book attracted adult readers as well as children and it became popular enough for publishers to ask tolkien to produce a sequel lord of rings request for a sequel prompted tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work epic novel lord of rings originally published in three volumes 1954 1955 tolkien spent more than ten years writing primary narrative and appendices for lord of rings during which time he received constant support of inklings in particular his closest friend c s lewis author of chronicles of narnia both hobbit and lord of rings are set against background of silmarillion but in a time long after it tolkien at first intended lord of rings to be a children s tale in style of hobbit but it quickly grew darker and more serious in writing though a direct sequel to hobbit it addressed an older audience drawing on immense backstory of beleriand that tolkien had constructed in previous years and which eventually saw posthumous publication in silmarillion and other volumes tolkien s influence weighs heavily on fantasy genre that grew up after success of lord of rings lord of rings became immensely popular in 1960s and has remained so ever since ranking as one of most popular works of fiction of 20th century judged by both sales and reader

appointed his son christopher to be his literary executor and he with assistance from guy gavriel kay later a well known fantasy author in his own right organized some of this material into a single coherent volume published as silmarillion in 1977 it received locus award for best fantasy novel in 1978 unfinished tales and history of middle earth in 1980 christopher tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material under title unfinished tales of numenor and middle earth in subsequent years 1983 1996 he published a large amount of remaining unpublished materials together with notes and extensive commentary in a series of twelve volumes called history of middle earth they contain unfinished abandoned alternative and outright contradictory accounts since they were always a work in progress for tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of stories there is not complete consistency between lord of rings and hobbit two most closely related works because tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other he commented in 1965 while editing hobbit for a third edition that he would have preferred to rewrite book completely because of style of its prose mr bliss one of tolkien s least known short works is children s storybook mr bliss published in 1982 it tells story of mr bliss and his first ride in his new motor car many adventures follow encounters with bears angry neighbours irate shopkeepers and assorted collisions story was inspired by tolkien s own vehicular mishaps with his first car purchased in 1932 bears were based on toy bears owned by tolkien s sons tolkien was both author and illustrator of book he submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after success of hobbit lavish ink and coloured pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive tolkien agreed to redraw pictures in a simpler style but then found he did not have time to do so book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of tolkien s difficult to read illustrated manuscript with a typeset transcription on each facing page children of hurin more recently in 2007 children

beginning of quenya poem namarie written in tengwar and in latin script parallel to tolkien s professional work as a philologist and sometimes overshadowing this work to effect that his academic output remained rather thin was his affection for constructing languages most developed of these are quenya and sindarin etymological connection between which formed core of much of tolkien s legendarium language and grammar for tolkien was a matter of esthetics and euphony and quenya in particular was designed from phonaesthetic considerations it was intended as an and was based on latin with ingredients from finnish welsh english and greek letters no 144 a notable addition came in late 1945 with or numenorean a language of a faintly semitic flavour connected with tolkien s atlantis legend which by notion club papers ties directly into his ideas about inability of language to be inherited and via second age and story of earendil was grounded in legendarium thereby providing a link of tolkien s 20th century real primary world with legendary past of his middle earth tolkien considered languages inseparable from mythology associated with them and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages in 1930 a congress of esperantists were told as much by him in his lecture a secret vice your language construction will breed a mythology but by 1956 he had concluded that volapuk esperanto ido c c are dead far deader than ancient unused languages because their authors never invented any esperanto legends letters no 180 popularity of tolkien s books has had a small but lasting effect on use of language in fantasy literature in particular and even on mainstream dictionaries which today commonly accept tolkien s idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and alongside dwarfs and dwarfish which had been little used since mid 19th century and earlier in fact according to tolkien had old english plural survived it would have been or he also coined term though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work artwork tolkien was an accomplished artist who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life from early in his writing career development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings especially of landscapes and by maps of lands in which tales were set he also produced pictures to accompany stories told to his own children including those later published in mr bliss and roverandom and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from father christmas although he regarded himself as an

adventures of tom bombadil and farmer giles of ham and donald swann who set music to road goes ever on queen margrethe ii of denmark created illustrations to lord of rings in early 1970s she sent them to tolkien who was struck by similarity they bore in style to his own drawings however tolkien was not fond of all artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime and was sometimes harshly disapproving in 1946 he rejected suggestions for illustrations by horus engels for german edition of hobbit as too bilbo with a dribbling nose and gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than odinic wanderer that i think of letters no 107 tolkien was sceptical of emerging tolkien fandom in united states and in 1954 he returned proposals for dust jackets of american edition of lord of rings he had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay on fairy stories first presented in 1939 film adaptations tolkien scholar james dunning coined word tollywood a portmanteau derived from tolkien hollywood to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of stories in tolkien s legendarium aimed at generating good box office results rather than at
