utah commonly known as utah beach was code name for one of five sectors of allied invasion of german occupied france in normandy landings on june 6 1944 d day during world war ii westernmost of five code named landing beaches in normandy utah is on cotentin peninsula west of mouths of douve and vire rivers amphibious landings at utah were undertaken by united states army troops with sea transport mine sweeping and a naval bombardment force provided by united states navy and coast guard as well as elements from british dutch and other allied navies objective at utah was to secure a beachhead on cotentin peninsula location of important port facilities at cherbourg amphibious assault primarily by us 4th infantry division and 70th tank battalion was supported by airborne landings of 82nd and 101st airborne division intention was to rapidly seal off cotentin peninsula prevent germans from reinforcing cherbourg and capture port as quickly as possible utah along with sword on eastern flank was added to invasion plan in december 1943 these changes doubled frontage of invasion and necessitated a month long delay so that additional landing craft and personnel could be assembled in england allied forces attacking utah faced two battalions of 919th grenadier regiment part of 709th static infantry division while improvements to fortifications had been undertaken under leadership of field marshal erwin rommel beginning in october 1943 troops assigned to defend area were mostly poorly equipped non german conscripts d day at utah began at 01 30 when first of airborne units arrived tasked with securing key crossroads at sainte mere eglise and controlling causeways through flooded farmland behind utah so infantry could advance inland while some airborne objectives were quickly met many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on first day on beach itself infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06 30 and quickly secured immediate area with minimal casualties meanwhile engineers set to work clearing area of obstacles and mines and additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive at close of d day allied forces had only captured about half of planned area and contingents of german defenders remained but beachhead was secure 4th infantry division landed 21 000 troops on utah at cost of only 197 casualties airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14 000 men with 2 500 casualties around 700 men were lost in engineering units 70th tank battalion and seaborne vessels sunk by enemy german losses are unknown cherbourg was captured on june 26 but by this time germans had destroyed port facilities which were not brought back into full operation until september allied planning decision to undertake a cross channel invasion of continental europe within next year was taken at trident conference held in washington in may 1943 allies initially planned to launch invasion on may 1 1944 and a draft of plan was accepted at quebec conference in august 1943 general dwight d eisenhower was appointed commander of supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force shaef general bernard montgomery was named as commander of 21st army group which comprised all of land forces involved in invasion on december 31 1943 eisenhower and montgomery first saw plan which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions and two thirds of an airborne division two generals immediately insisted that scale of initial invasion be expanded to five divisions with airborne descents by three divisions to allow operations on a wider front change doubled frontage of invasion from to this would allow for quicker offloading of men and materiel make it more difficult for germans to respond and speed up capture of port at cherbourg eisenhower and lieutenant general omar bradley selected for utah vii corps major general j lawton collins who had experience with amphibious operations in pacific theater of operations though not in initial assaults replaced major general roscoe woodruff as commander of vii corps coastline of normandy was divided into seventeen sectors with codenames using a spelling alphabet from able west of omaha to roger on east flank of sword eight further sectors were added when invasion was extended to include utah sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by colors green red and white utah westernmost of five landing beaches is on cotentin peninsula west of mouths of douve and vire rivers terrain between utah and neighboring omaha was swampy and difficult to cross which meant that troops landing at utah would be isolated germans had flooded farmland behind utah restricting travel off beach to a few narrow causeways to help secure terrain inland of landing zone rapidly seal off cotentin peninsula and prevent germans from reinforcing port at cherbourg two airborne divisions were assigned to airdrop into german territory in early hours of invasion need to acquire or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier aircraft for expanded operation meant that invasion had to be delayed to june production of landing craft was ramped up in late 1943 and continued into early 1944 and existing craft were relocated from other theaters more than 600 douglas c 47 skytrain transport aircraft and their crews took a circuitous route to england in early 1944 from baer field indiana bringing number of available troop carrier planes to over a thousand plan of attack amphibious landings at utah were to be preceded by airborne landings further inland on cotentin peninsula commencing shortly after midnight forty minutes of naval bombardment was to begin at 05 50 followed by air bombardment scheduled for 06 09 to 06 27 amphibious landing was planned in four waves beginning at 06 30 first consisted of 20 landing craft vehicle personnel lcvps carrying four companies from 8th infantry regiment ten craft on right were to land on tare green beach opposite strongpoint at les dunes de varreville ten craft on left were intended for uncle red beach south eight landing craft tanks lcts each carrying four amphibious dd tanks of 70th tank battalion were scheduled to land a few minutes before infantry second wave scheduled for 06 35 consisted of 32 lcvps carrying four more companies of 8th infantry as well as combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear beach of obstacles third wave scheduled for 06 45 consisted of eight lcts bringing more dd tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off beach it was to be followed at 06 37 by fourth wave which had eight landing craft mechanized lcm and three lcvps with detachments of 237th and 299th combat engineer battalions assigned to clear beach between high and low water marks troops involved in operation overlord including members of 4th division scheduled to land at utah left their barracks in second half of may and proceeded to their coastal marshalling points to preserve secrecy invasion troops were as much as possible kept out of contact with outside world men began to embark onto their transports on june 1 and 865 ships of force u naval group assigned to utah began their journey from plymouth on june 3 and 4 a 24 hour postponement of invasion necessitated by bad weather meant that one convoy u 2a had to be recalled and hastily refuelled at portland ships met at a rendezvous point nicknamed piccadilly circus southeast of isle of wight to assemble into convoys to cross channel minesweepers began clearing lanes on evening of june 5 german preparations field marshal gerd von rundstedt overall commander on western front reported to hitler in october 1943 regarding weak defences in france this led to appointment of field marshal erwin rommel to oversee construction of enhanced fortifications along atlantic wall with special emphasis on most likely invasion front which stretched from netherlands to cherbourg rommel believed that normandy coast could be a possible landing point for invasion so he ordered construction of extensive defensive works along that shore in addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along coast he ordered wooden stakes metal tripods mines and large anti tank obstacles to be placed on beach to delay approach of landing craft and impede movement of tanks expecting allies to land at high tide so that infantry would spend less time exposed on beach he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at high tide mark terrain at utah is flat offering no high ground on which to place fortifications shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to depending on tides germans flooded flat land behind beach by damming up streams and opening floodgates at mouth of douve to admit seawater defense of this sector of eastern coast of cotentin peninsula was assigned to generalleutnant karl wilhelm von and his 709th static infantry division unit was not well equipped lacking motorized transport and provided with captured french soviet and czech equipment many of men were ostlegionen non german conscripts recruited from soviet prisoners of war georgians and poles known to be deeply unreliable southernmost of sector was manned by about 700 troops stationed in nine strongpoints spaced from apart tangles of barbed wire booby traps and removal of ground cover made both beach and terrain around strongpoints hazardous for infantry german 91st infantry division and 6th fallschirmjager regiment who arrived in may were stationed inland as reserves detecting this move allies shifted their intended airborne drop zones to southeast d day june 6 1944 thumb upright 1 0 fires upon shore thumb upright 1 0 c 47 skytrains with paratroops above a landing craft bombing of normandy began around midnight with over 2 200 british and american bombers attacking targets along coast and further inland some 1 200 aircraft departed england just before midnight to transport airborne divisions to their drop zones behind enemy lines paratroops from 101st airborne were dropped beginning around 01 30 tasked with controlling causeways behind utah and destroying road and rail bridges over douve gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by bocage terrain with its hedgerows stone walls and marshes troops of 82nd airborne began arriving around 02 30 with primary objective of destroying two additional bridges over douve and capturing intact two bridges over merderet they quickly captured important crossroads at sainte mere eglise first town liberated in invasion and began working to protect western flank generalleutnant wilhelm falley commander of 91st infantry division was trying to return to his headquarters near from war games at rennes when he was killed by a paratrooper patrol two hours before main invasion force landed a raiding party of 132 members of 4th cavalry regiment swam ashore at 04 30 at iles saint marcouf thought to be a german observation post it was unoccupied but two men were killed and seventeen wounded by mines and german artillery fire once four troop transports assigned to force u reached their assigned position off coast 5 000 soldiers of 4th division and other units assigned to utah boarded their landing craft in rough seas for three hour journey to their designated landing point eighteen ships assigned to bombard utah included us navy battleship royal navy monitor heavy cruisers royal navy and us navy and gunboat royal netherlands navy naval bombardment of areas behind beach commenced at 05 45 while it was still dark with gunners switching to pre assigned targets on beach as soon as it was light enough to see at 05 50 a destroyer in bombardment group sunk after it struck a mine while evading fire from marcouf battery under command of oberleutnant zur see walter since troops were scheduled to land at utah and omaha starting at 06 30 an hour earlier than british beaches these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before assault troops began to land on shore coastal air bombardment was undertaken in twenty minutes immediately prior to landing by around 300 martin b 26 marauders of ix bomber command due to cloud cover pilots decided to drop to low altitudes of much of bombing was highly effective with loss of only two aircraft landing thumb upright 1 2 map of d day beaches with utah to left first troops to reach shore were four companies from 2nd battalion 8th infantry arriving at 06 30 on 20 lcvps companies b and c landed on segment code named tare green and companies e and f to their left on uncle red leonard t schroeder leading company f was first man to reach beach landing craft were pushed to south by strong currents and they found themselves near exit 2 at grande dune about from their intended landing zones opposite exit 3 at les dunes de varreville first senior officer ashore assistant division commander brigadier general theodore roosevelt jr of 4th infantry division personally scouted nearby terrain he determined that this landing site was actually better as there was only one strongpoint in immediate vicinity rather than two and it had been badly damaged by bombers of ix bomber command in addition strong currents had washed ashore many of underwater obstacles deciding to start war from right here he ordered further landings to be re routed second wave of assault troops arrived at 06 35 on 32 lcvps companies a and d of 1st battalion 8th infantry landed on tare green and g and h on uncle red they were accompanied by engineers and demolition teams tasked with removing beach obstacles and clearing area directly behind beach of obstacles and mines a contingent of 70th tank battalion comprising 32 amphibious dd tanks on eight lcts were supposed to arrive about 10 minutes before infantry however a strong headwind caused them to be about 20 minutes late even though they launched tanks from shore rather than as planned four tanks of company a and their personnel were lost when their lct hit a mine about south of iles st marcouf and was destroyed but remaining 28 arrived intact thumb upright 1 2 utah landings planned center right and actual left north lower right third wave arriving at 06 45 included 16 conventional m4 sherman tanks and 8 dozer tanks of 70th tank battalion they were followed at 06 37 by fourth wave which had eight lcms and three lcvps with detachments of 237th and 299th combat engineer battalions assigned to clear beach between high and low water marks company b came under small arms fire from defenders positioned in houses along road as they headed to enemy strongpoint wn7 near la madeleine northwest of la grande dune and inland they met little resistance at wn7 headquarters of 3rd battalion 919th grenadiers company c disabled enemy strongpoint wn5 at la grande dune which had been heavily damaged in preliminary bombardment companies e and f about 600 men proceeded inland about to strongpoint wn4 at la dune which they captured after a short skirmish they next travelled south on a farm road parallel to beach towards causeway 1 companies g and h moved south along beach toward enemy strongpoint at beau guillot they encountered a minefield and came under enemy machine gun fire but soon captured position 70th tank battalion was expecting to have to help neutralize beach fortifications in immediate area but since this job was quickly completed by infantry they had little to do initially landing area was almost totally secure by 08 30 at which point combat teams prepared to push further inland along causeways meanwhile additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive on beach removal of mines and obstacles from beach a job that had to be performed quickly before tide came in at 10 30 was assignment of 237th and 299th combat engineer battalions and eight dozer tanks teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles dozer tanks pushed wreckage out of way to create clear lanes for further landings moving inland thumb upright 1 2 german prisoners of war in an enclosure on utah next move for 4th division was to begin movement down three causeways through flooded farmland behind beach to link up with 101st airborne who had dropped behind enemy lines before dawn 2nd battalion and several tanks headed down causeway 1 towards poupeville which they discovered had already been captured by 3 501st parachute infantry regiment a dozen german infantrymen trapped between two allied forces surrendered causeway 2 directly behind la grande dune eventually became main exit road off beach securing this causeway required capture of ste marie du mont about inland germans had blown a small bridge over a culvert and movement was delayed while engineers made a repair and cleared two inoperable tanks from road causeway 2 quickly became congested so some units opted to walk through flooded areas beside road several hundred defenders were positioned in and around ste marie du mont including 6th fallschirmjager regiment of 91st infantry division members of 506th parachute infantry successfully attacked batteries at and manor and took ste marie du mont in house to house and street combat clearing way for 8th infantry 3rd battalion to advance up causeway 2 practically unopposed 8th infantry 1st battalion headed up causeway 3 towards la hubert which had already been captured by 502nd parachute infantry as at poupeville enemy soldiers in this case several dozen were caught between two converging forces and had to surrender meanwhile 22nd infantry 3rd battalion and five tanks moved north along beach tasked with eliminating as many german strongpoints as possible they discovered that tank fire could only destroy concrete pillboxes via a direct hit on embrasures so they called for artillery fire from naval vessels offshore by evening they had combined with 12th infantry who had travelled directly across flooded fields to a position far short of their target for day to form a defensive perimeter on northern end of beachhead on southern end of beachhead about 3 000 men of 6th fallschirmjager regiment moved into position near saint come du mont preventing 501st parachute infantry from advancing any further on d day thumb upright 1 gliders are delivered to cotentin peninsula during mission elmira in center 82nd airborne were able to consolidate their position at sainte mere eglise in part due to work of first lieutenant turner turnbull and a squad of 43 men who held off for more than two hours a far larger enemy force that was attempting to retake crossroads from north a task force led by colonel edson raff that included 16 sherman tanks of tank battalion four armored cars and a squad of infantry worked their way up from beach but were stopped from reinforcing sainte mere eglise by a line of german defenders south of town reinforcements arrived by glider around 04 00 mission chicago and mission detroit and 21 00 mission keokuk and mission elmira bringing additional troops and heavy equipment like paratroopers many landed far from their drop zones even those that landed on target experienced difficulty with heavy cargo such as jeeps shifting during landing crashing through wooden fuselage and in some cases crushing personnel on board german defenders also took a toll on glider units with heavy losses inflicted in area near sainte mere eglise in particular members of 82nd airborne who had landed west of merderet were widely scattered and surrounded by enemy forces they quickly realized that they would be unable to achieve their d day objectives and would have to wait for reinforcements it took several days for this to happen as germans set up defensive positions along river for 36 hours 82nd airborne were unable to establish radio contact with other units or with collins aboard his command ship 82nd airborne were finally relieved by 90th division who began disembarking at 16 00 on d day and were all ashore by june 8 original plan for 90th had been that they should push north toward port of cherbourg but collins changed their assignment they were to cut across cotentin peninsula isolating german forces therein and preventing reinforcements from entering area their poor performance led to their being replaced by more experienced 82nd airborne and 9th infantry division who reached west coast of cotentin on june 17 cutting off cherbourg 9th division joined by 4th and 79th infantry divisions took control of peninsula in fierce fighting cherbourg fell during battle of cherbourg on june 26 but by this time germans had destroyed port facilities which were not brought back into full operation until september result thumb members of 101st airborne division in village of st marcouf june 8 1944 4th infantry division did not meet all their d day objectives at utah partly because they had arrived too far to south but they landed 21 000 troops at cost of only 197 casualties airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14 000 men with 2 500 casualties around 700 men were lost in engineering units 70th tank battalion and lcts and other vessels sunk by enemy german losses are unknown forces landing on utah cleared immediate area in less than an hour and penetrated inland by close of d day within two hours of landing 82nd airborne captured important crossroads at sainte mere eglise but they failed to neutralize line of defenses along merderet on d day as planned while many of airborne forces landed far from their drop zones and were unable to meet all their d day objectives this widespread scattering of forces had unintended side effect of confusing german defenders who were slow to react highly trained 4th division faced a mediocre german unit composed of conscripts all best troops had been sent to eastern front allies achieved and maintained air superiority which meant that germans were unable to make observations of preparations underway in britain prior to invasion and were unable to launch airborne on d day extensive allied reconnaissance provided attackers with detailed maps of defenses and terrain unlike neighboring omaha preliminary aerial bombardment was highly effective at utah indecisiveness and an overcomplicated command structure on part of german high command was also a factor in allied success at utah and throughout normandy campaign units united
