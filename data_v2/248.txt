mycena clariviolacea is a mushroom in mycenaceae family first reported as a new species in 2007 it is known only from kanagawa japan where it fruits on dead fallen twigs in forests dominated by oak and chinquapin trees distinctive features of this species are found in its medium sized dark violet fruit bodies with caps up to in diameter and slender stems that are about long microscopic characteristics include amyloid spores staining when treated with melzer s reagent club shaped cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge that are covered with one or more knob like apical protuberances absence of pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face and cylindrical diverticulate caulocystidia cystidia on stem taxonomy naming and classification mushroom was first collected by japanese mycologist haruki takahashi in 2000 and along with seven other mycena species was reported as a new species in a 2007 publication specific epithet is derived from latin words clari meaning clear and violacea japanese name is according to takahashi amyloid spores cheilocystidia covered with one or more knob like apical excrescences diverticulate elements in cortical layer of cap and stem and diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that species is best classified in section as defined by dutch mycena specialist maas geesteranus description depending on age of mushroom cap can range in shape from conic to convex to bell shaped to somewhat flattened in age it reaches in diameter it is sometimes shallowly with a small depression like a navel radially grooved almost to center and somewhat hygrophanous changing color as it loses or absorbs water cap surface is dry and pruinose covered with what appears to be a fine white powder but this soon sloughs off leaving surface smooth initially cap color is dark violet but it later fades to grayish violet around edges whitish flesh is up to 0 5 mm thick and lacks any distinctive taste or odor slender stem is long by thick cylindrical centrally attached to stem and hollow its surface is dry pruinose over entire length and grayish violet to dark violet in color base is covered with a white mycelial tomentum a hairy covering of short closely matted hairs gills are adnate fused to stem and distantly spaced with about 15 19 gills reaching stem gills are up to broad thin and same color as cap or paler microscopic characteristics spores are broadly ellipsoid smooth colorless amyloid staining bluish to blue black when treated with melzer s reagent thin walled and measure 8 9 by 5 6 um basidia are 40 60 by 10 12 um club shaped and four spored cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge are abundant club shaped and measure 30 45 by 10 17 um their tips are covered with one or more knob like short excrescences that are colorless and thin walled pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are absent tissue tissue of hymenium bearing structure is made of thin walled hyphae that are 12 21 um wide cylindrical but often somewhat inflated smooth and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment these hyphae are dextrinoid meaning that they stain reddish to reddish brown in melzer s reagent cap cuticle is made of parallel bent over hyphae that are 2 7 um wide and cylindrical these hyphae are smooth or can be covered with scattered warty or finger like thin walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale brownish and dextrinoid layer of hyphae underlying cap cuticle is parallel cylindrical hyaline or brownish and dextrinoid it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48 um wide stem cuticle is made of parallel bent over hyphae that are 3 8 um wide and similar to hyphae of cap cuticle caulocystidia cystidia on stem are 45 88 by 5 8 um cylindrical diverticulate colorless or brownish and thin walled flesh of stem is composed of longitudinally running cylindrical hyphae that are 8 25 um wide smooth colorless and dextrinoid clamp connections are present in cap cuticle stem cuticle gill flesh and at basal septa of basidia similar species mycena clariviolacea is similar to brazilian species m cerasina and european m diosma mycena cerasina which belongs in section of genus mycena differs in having a grayish purple cap and stem and forming somewhat utriform shaped to lageniform flask shaped smooth cheilocystidia mycena diosma classified in section subsection may be distinguished microscopically from m clariviolacea by its smooth spindle shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia and hyphae in cortical layer of cap and stem habitat and distribution mycena clariviolacea is known only from kanagawa japan fruit bodies are found growing solitary or scattered on dead fallen twigs in forests that are dominated by oak and chinquapin trees mushroom fruits from june to september references external links agaricales in southwestern islands of japan images of holotype specimen clariviolacea category fungi of asia category fungi described in 2007
