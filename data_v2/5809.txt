her film persona she later added lyrics and vocals to demo tape developed by leonard and decided to rename song as well as film to who s that girl featuring instrumentation from drums bass and

some critics compared it to madonna s previous single la isla bonita while others found it forgettable who s that girl became madonna s sixth single to top billboard hot 100 while peaking atop charts in countries like united kingdom canada netherlands ireland and belgium it was also nominated for best song from a motion picture at 1988 grammy awards and best original song at 1988 golden globe awards music video portrayed a different persona of madonna rather than her film character for which it was released like song it incorporated hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in spanish style as a young lady in search of a treasure madonna has performed song on her who s that girl 1987 and rebel heart 2015 2016 tours song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums background and composition in 1986 madonna was shooting for her third motion picture who s that girl known at time as slammer needing songs for soundtrack of movie she contacted patrick leonard and stephen bray who had written and produced her third studio album true blue in 1986 madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song she came to studio one thursday as leonard developed chorus of song he handed over that cassette to madonna who went to backroom and finished melody and lyrics of song while leonard worked on other parts of song after finishing lyrics madonna declared that she wanted song to be named who s that girl and changed movie to same rather than slammer considering it to be a better title in fred bronson s billboard book of number 1 hits book leonard explained that song was recorded in one day with madonna adding her vocals only once additional instrumental tracks with guitars and percussion were included by leonard and bray later regarding development of music for film madonna further explained i had some very specific ideas in mind music that would stand on its own as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen and only way to make that a reality was to have a hand in writing tunes myself songs aren t necessarily about nikki her character name in movie or written to be sung by someone like her but there s a spirit to this music that captures both what film and characters are about i think song is composed in madonna s typical style mingling drum machine a bubbling bass synth line and sound of stringed instruments three parts of song namely bridge where madonna sings what can help me now chorus and verse flow together strongly chorus has a haunting effect in it according to sheet music published at musicnotes com song is composed in time signature of common time with a key of a minor and a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute madonna s vocals span from notes of g3 to b4 song follows a basic sequence of am9 g am9 g dm as its chord progression song epitomizes madonna s interest with hispanic culture that continued after release of la isla bonita by adding spanish phrases in chorus and over trumpets of second verse and also by added instrumental break in middle it also uses sonic effect brought about by combination of multiple vocal lines which had been previously used by groups like beach boys in their singles god only knows 1966 and i get around 1964 as well as r e m s singles fall on me 1986 and near wild heaven 1991 who s that girl employs this effect on last chorus where three or four different vocal hooks are intertwined critical reception thumb left madonna performing track during who s that girl world tour in his book complete guide to music of madonna author rikky rooksby explained that song was madonna s best take on her original music style stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic commented that who s that girl along with causing a commotion were not amongst madonna s best singles similar thoughts were shared by medium s richard labeau biographer j randy taraborrelli in his book madonna an intimate biography called song

contagious chorus and sparkling production from madonna and patrick leonard jude rogers from guardian felt that as balearic moments go la isla bonita was better writing for gay star news joe morgan

priestess tarot card displaying her cartoon impersonation madonna opens it to find a huge diamond she looks up happily to children video ends with them continuing dancing and madonna carrying away casket video portrayed a different image of madonna rather than her real self according to vincent canby of new york times madonna at that time was shrewdly pragmatic about her persona and appearance resembling marilyn monroe but with comic tartness of jean harlow this persona was reflected in second half of who s that girl film however music video chose not to capture her real self and qualities
