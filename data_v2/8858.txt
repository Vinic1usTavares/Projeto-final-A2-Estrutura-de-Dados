where coal was mined from 15th century until 1973 it is part of a larger coalfield which stretched into southern gloucestershire somerset coalfield stretched from in north to mendip hills in south and from bath in east to nailsea in west a total area of about most of pits on coalfield were concentrated in cam brook wellow brook and nettlebridge valleys and around radstock and farrington gurney pits were grouped geographically with clusters of pits close together working same coal seams often under same ownership many pits shared trackways and tramways which connected them to somerset coal canal or railways for distribution early pits were adits where coal or bell pits where coal was close to surface these methods were abandoned when deep seams were mined deepest shaft on coalfield was at strap mine at nettlebridge which reached flooding and coal dust explosions in some mines required improved ventilation and pumping engines several pits closed in 19th century as coal was worked out those that survived until 1947 became part of national coal board but expense of improving equipment and working conditions meant that these became uneconomical and last pit closed in 1973 there is still evidence of mine workings with remains of buildings spoil heaps and tramways in area geology structure somerset coalfield covers a total area of about it consists of three synclines informally referred to as coal basins pensford syncline in north and radstock syncline in south are separated by east west trending farmborough fault belt further to west is smaller nailsea syncline radstock syncline in particular is cut by a series of east west thrust faults and north south trending normal faults green page 48 stratigraphy thumb william smith coal measures are divided into a lower middle and upper with coal seams found within each of these divisions lower and middle coal measures are found at depths between together lower and middle coal measures are thick with middle coal measures

explosions in 1893 1895 and 1908 were amongst first attributable solely to airborne coal dust down page 13 william smith exploratory surveys of local geology were carried out by william smith who became known as father of english geology building on work by john strachey smith worked for stracheys who owned sutton court at one of their older mines mearns pit at high littleton as he observed rock strata at pit he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern that various strata could always be found in same relative positions and each particular stratum could be identified by fossils it contained and same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in other parts of england smith noticed an easterly dip in beds of rock small near surface about three degrees then greater after triassic rocks which led to him a testable hypothesis which he termed principle of faunal succession and he began to determine if relationships between strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout country during work as a surveyor appointed by engineer john rennie for somerset coal canal company and subsequently he mapped locations of rock strata and their vertical extent and drew cross sections and tables of what he saw and earned name strata smith coal seams following coal seams are recognised within coalfield they are listed

evidence of coal being dug on mendips in page page 21 and at kilmersdon in 1437 by time of henry viii there were coal pits at clutton high littleton and stratton on fosse during early 17th century coal was largely obtained by excavating outcrops and driving drifts which followed seam into ground only small amounts of coal could be obtained by these methods and bell pits were also dug collier page 22 23 these were vertical pits with a shaft up to deep which were opened out at bottom when all coal that could safely be extracted from pit had been recovered another pit was sunk close by to intersect seam and waste from second pit thrown into first at beginning of 19th century there were about 4 000 people employed on coalfield collier page 29 somerset miners association was founded in 1872 later becoming an area of national union of mineworkers university of west of england bristol historical resource trade unions uses of coal were varied coal was used in limekilns to produce lime for mortar used in building and by farmers to improve soil from 1820 coal was used to produce gas for lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in area coke was used to dry malt for brewing industry down page 19 transport thumb right 300px wagonloads of coal being hauled up dunkerton hill in 1850s fanny mayne writing in true briton complained of this unpleasant traffic it is a very long hill nearly two miles long and up it are dragged nearly all carts waggons and noddies loaded with coal which supply bath and its environs with that very necessary comfort or comfortable necessary a sad sight is dunkerton hill coalfield had a relatively low population density and did not have a major coal consuming industry nearby transporting coal to market was a key problem for coalfield s development in pre turnpike era roads serving coalfield were unsuited to moving coal bulley notes problem was rendered far worse by state of roads in somerset which were notorious down to middle of 18th century parishes in area sometimes neglected or refused to repair those roads which were heavily used by coal carts thus in 1617 inhabitants of stoke st michael complained that of late by reason of many coalmines highways there are much in decay and grown very bulley j to mendip for coal proc of somerset archaeology and natural history society 97 1952 pages 46 78 in somerset turnpike roads began in 1707 with establishment of bath trust but turnpikes did not reach coalfield until mid 1700s bristol trust which passed close to western boundary of coalfield established in 1727 was of little importance as bristol was never a significant market having its own coalfield turnpikes facilitated movement of coal and john page 307 enthused nothing so much contributes to improvement of a county as good roads before establishment of turnpikes many parts of county were scarcely accessible coal was carried on horses backs to distance of fifteen or twenty miles from colliery each horse carried about two hundred and half weight now one horse with a light cart will draw four hundred weight or four times more than a horse could carry can an insignificant toll be put in competition with this saving thumb 300px map of somerset coal canal not all roads were improved and in 1819 john skinner observed roads rendered bad by passage of coal wagons coombs expansion of production was limited by access to market such a need implied a canal project following lord middleton s dictum water transport is what all coal owners must aim at there were large gains from being connected to a canal system as stated by coal commission at about this period 1800 system of coal navigation was being rapidly extended and result was that coals were gradually finding their way into districts that could not be reached unless at great cost by road report of coal commission 1871 3 pii a scheme for an extension of avon navigation was proposed in 1766 but canals did not reach coalfield for almost another 50 years clew page 10 in 1794 coal proprietors formed a committee to construct somerset coal pages 6 10 with two branches into cam brook and wellow brook valleys and from a junction at midford to join proposed kennet and avon canal at dundas aqueduct near bath coal was transported by somerset coal canal and later by bristol and north somerset railway and somerset and dorset joint railway which were accessed from pits by a series of tramways after 1854 when first railway line was opened tonnage carried by coal canal declined rapidly decline and closure total tonnage of coal produced by coalfield increased throughout 19th century reaching a peak around 1901 when there were 79 separate collieries and production was 1 25 million tons per annum peak years for production were 1900 to 1920 however decline took hold and number of pits reduced from 30 at beginning of 20th century to 14 by mid 1930s twelve at nationalisation when national coal board was created on 1 january 1947 under coal industry nationalisation act 1946 five in 1959 and none after 1973 despite some investment in new infrastructure particularly at norton hill thin seams made production expensive limiting profit and investment conversion of portishead power station from coal to oil and reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to closure of last two pits kilmersdon and
