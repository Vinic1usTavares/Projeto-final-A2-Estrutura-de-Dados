even objections der rhein in den tiber eine geschichte des zweiten ralph m feldkirch cop 1988 p 316 however is not accepted by all observers lefebvre was one of those who voted against declaration but

approval or disapproval of last draft lefebvre was one of 70 about 3 percent of total who voted against schema nevertheless when supreme pontiff himself put his signature to controversial declaration an hour or so later french traditionalist prelate followed suit presumably as an act of submission of his private judgment to that of vicar of christ lefebvre later declared that sheet of paper that

wrote padre pio looked at lefebvre very sternly and said never cause discord among your brothers and always practise rule of obedience above all when it seems to you that errors of those in authority are all more serious there is no other road than that of obedience especially for those of us who have made this vow it seems archbishop lefebvre did not see things in quite same way even if he did respond to padre pio with i will remember that father padre pio looked at him intensely and seeing what would soon happen said no you will forget it you will tear apart community of faithful oppose will of your superiors and even go against orders of pope himself and this will happen quite soon thumb right padre pio in jovial conversation with lefebvre however lefebvre dismissed allegation as a slander a fabrication giving his own account of event as well as photographic evidence backing his counter claim his explanation was provided on 8 august 1990 on occasion of his replying in a personal letter to a society priest in france who had written to ask him about meeting with padre pio here are extracts from letter for several years now this slander a fabrication from start to finish has been circulating in italy i have already refuted it but lies die hard there is not one word of truth in page of that magazine you photocopied for me meeting which took place after easter in 1967

significant number of conservative members of french society under french third republic 1870 1940 third republic was by conflicts between secular left and catholic right with many individuals on both sides espousing distinctly radical positions see for example article on famous dreyfus affair thus it has been said that lefebvre was a man formed by bitter hatreds that defined battle lines in french society and culture from french revolution to vichy regime lefebvre s first biographer english traditionalist writer michael davies wrote in first volume of his apologia pro marcel lefebvre in similar vein pro sspx english priest michael crowdy wrote in his preface to his translation of lefebvre s open letter to confused catholics theological positions lefebvre was associated with following

collegiality within church in favour of strict papal supremacy opposition to replacement of tridentine mass with mass of paul vi however lefebvre s continued use of tridentine mass eventually became

support for catholic order of authoritarian french vichy government 1940 1944 of marshal philippe petain support for authoritarian governments in 1985 he spoke approvingly of governments of francisco franco of spain and antonio salazar of portugal noting that their neutrality in world war ii had spared their peoples suffering of war support for french nationalist leader jean marie le pen in 1985

all our heart and all our soul to catholic rome guardian of catholic faith and traditions necessary to maintain it and to eternal rome mistress of wisdom and truth on other hand we refuse and have

on 3 march in may commission issued a notification that it had decided to grant approval to mgr mamie to carry out his intentions with lefebvre arguing that according to canon 493 of 1917 code of canon law only pope which he interpreted to mean a direct decree from pope rather than mere retroactive approbation could suppress a religious congregation bishop put his intention into effect on 6 may 1975 thereby officially dissolving society pope paul vi canonically suppressed sspx and its seminary in 1975 pete vere envoy magazine volume 4 6 this action was subsequently upheld by pope paul vi who wrote to lefebvre in june 1975 lefebvre continued his work regardless because having taken legal advice from competent canon lawyers who advised him that despite letter from pope paul dated 29 june 1975 entire legal process taken against fraternity had been so irregular that it could not be considered as having been legally suppressed archbishop was further advised that as vatican had permitted priests to be incardinated directly into fraternity on three separate occasions it could be considered that privilege of priests directly into fraternity now existed lefebvre also argued that there were insufficient grounds for suppression as apostolic visitors by commission s own admission delivered a positive report and that since his declaration had not been condemned by congregation for doctrine of faith cdf formerly known as holy office or inquisition he appealed twice to appellate court of church apostolic signatura cardinal villot blocked move reportedly threatening prefect of apostolic signatura cardinal staffa with dismissal if appeals were not struck out in may 1977 mamie warned marcel lefebvre that saying a mass in tridentine rite could be a break

church and senior freemasons prior to council letter of mgr lefebvre to pope paul vi 17 july 1976 quoted in lefebvre was then notified that since he had not apologized to pope he was suspended a

health announced his intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death situation is such work placed in our hands by good lord is such that faced with this darkness in rome faced with roman authorities pertinacity in error faced with this refusal to return to truth or tradition on part of those who occupy seats of authority in rome faced with all these things it seems to us that good lord is asking for church to continue this is why it is likely that before i give acco my life to good lord i shall have to consecrate some bishops bishops to save church marcel lefebvre june 1987 this was controversial because under catholic canon law consecration of a bishop requires permission of pope during year of 1987 lefebvre tried to reach an agreement with then cardinal ratzinger however later on september 4 1987 in econe lefebvre stated that vatican was in apostasy and that he would not collaborate with cardinal ratzinger anymore on 5 may 1988 lefebvre signed an agreement with cardinal joseph ratzinger future pope benedict xvi who was then prefect of congregation for doctrine of faith to regularize situation of society of st pius x cardinal agreed that one bishop would be consecrated for society this is an english translation of original french operation survival shortly after however lefebvre announced that he had received a note from cardinal

consecrate a successor if necessary without papal approval sermon on occasion of episcopal consecration marcel lefebvre june 1988 as cardinal ratzinger did not specify a date for episcopal consecration should he have died before consecration was granted society would be unable to ordain any seminarians and thus forced into capitulation with holy see he dubbed his plan operation survival that is why taking into account strong will of present roman authorities to reduce tradition to naught to gather world to spirit of vatican ii and spirit of assisi we have preferred to withdraw ourselves and to say that we could not continue it was not possible we would have evidently been under authority of cardinal ratzinger president of roman commission which would have directed us we were putting ourselves into his hands and consequently putting ourselves into hands of those who wish to draw us into spirit of council and spirit of assisi this was simply not possible pope appealed to him not to proceed in a schismatic act warning of theological and canonical consequences on 3 june lefebvre wrote that he would still go ahead with 30 june consecrations on 9 june 1988 pope john paul ii replied to him with a personal letter recalling agreement archbishop had signed on 5 may and appealing to him not to proceed with a design that would be seen as nothing other than a schismatic act theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you when no reply came from lefebvre this letter was made public on 16 june pope john paul ii an obituary latin mass society of ireland

schismatics if an excommunication was pronounced against bishops of china who separated themselves from rome and put themselves under chinese government one very easily understands why pope pius xii excommunicated them there is no question of us separating ourselves from rome nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as bishops of palmar de have done in spain they have even elected a pope formed a college of cardinals it is out of question for us to do such things far from us be this miserable thought to separate ourselves from rome next

excommunication cin org 1 july 1988 retrieved on 1 november 2013 aftermath on 2 july pope john paul ii condemned consecration in his apostolic letter ecclesia dei in which he stated that consecration constituted a schismatic act and that by virtue of canon 1382 of code of canon law bishops and priests involved were automatically excommunicated lefebvre declared that he and other clerics involved had not separated themselves from rome and were therefore not schismatic he invoked canon 1323 of 1983 code of canon law that they found themselves in a case of necessity not having succeeded as they said in making rome understand that this change which has occurred in church since second vatican council was not catholic thus we find ourselves in a case of necessity we have done all we could trying to help rome to understand that they had to come back to attitudes of holy pius xii and of all his predecessors bishop de castro mayer and myself have gone to rome we have spoken we have sent letters several times to rome we have tried by these talks by all these means to succeed in making rome understand that since council and since aggiornamento this change which has occurred in church is not catholic is not in conformity to doctrine of all times this ecumenism and all these errors this collegiality all this is contrary to faith of church and is in process of destroying church
