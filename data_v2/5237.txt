boletus auripes commonly known as butter foot bolete is a species of bolete fungus in family boletaceae first described from new york in 1898 fungus is found in eastern asia central america and eastern north america from canada to florida it is a mycorrhizal species and typically grows in association with oak and beech trees fruit bodies mushrooms formed by fungus have convex to nearly flat caps that are up to wide stems are up to long by thick and feature reticulations net like ridges on upper portion other than brownish upper cap entire surface of mushroom is yellow b auripes is edible it can be distinguished from other similar yellow boletes by differences in color degree of stem reticulation and distribution taxonomy species was originally described by american mycologist charles horton peck in 1898 peck collected type specimen in port jefferson new york in 1945 rolf singer proposed variety boletus auripes var aureissimus as a new combination of name ceriomyces aureissimus described by william alphonso murrill in 1938 this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under name boletus aureissimus in 1936 wally snell reported finding a specimen of boletus crassipes another species described by peck from mount gretna pennsylvania snell suggested that although b crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from b auripes by a deeper brown cap color yellow flesh that does not fade to white and a stem with a more orange yellow color and more extensive reticulation he conceded that it was not clear that morphological characteristics between two did not overlap and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them a couple of years later he was more convinced of his stance and considered two conspecific taxonomic authorities index fungorum and mycobank however do not recognize this putative synonymy in genus boletus b auripes is classified in section species in this section are characterized by having a dry cap with a surface texture ranging from smooth to somewhat tomentose yellow flesh a reticulate stem and a mild taste other north american boletes in this section include boletus speciosus and boletus regius specific epithet auripes means golden yellow foot it is commonly known as butter foot bolete description thumb left upper portion of stem is reticulated cap of b auripes has a convex shape before flattening somewhat in maturity and attains a diameter of cap surface is dry with a texture ranging from finely tomentose hairy to nearly smooth and colored yellowish brown to chestnut brown or grayish brown cap color fades with age similarly flesh initially yellow fades to whitish in maturity unlike some other boletus species in b auripes neither surfaces nor internal tissue turns blue when injured or exposed to air odor and taste of mushroom are not distinctive initially pale yellow to yellow pore surface develops olive tinges as it matures and often becomes depressed near stem attachment pores are circular to angular and minute typically less than 1 mm wide tubes are deep golden yellow stem is long by thick young stems are typically bulbous to club shaped but this evens out somewhat as mushroom grows and mature stems are club shaped to nearly equal in width throughout stem is dry solid i e not hollow and features yellow reticulation at least on upper portion mycelia at base of stem have a buff color fruit body does not have a partial veil or a ring on stem boletus auripes is edible mushrooms produce a spore prints that is yellow brown especially in fresh prints to olive brown smooth yellowish spores measure 10 14 by 3 5 mm and range in shape from roughly elliptic to cylindric to somewhat spindle shaped basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped four spored and measure 27 2 35 2 by 9 6 10 4 mm cellular arrangement of cap cuticle is a trichodermium whereby outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel like hairs perpendicular to surface of cap consisting of erect hyphae with a diameter of 3 2 6 4 mm similar species field characteristics used to distinguish boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include yellowish brown to chestnut brown cap surface that becomes paler with age yellow flesh that does not stain blue and a reticulate stem b aureissimus has a similar appearance but has a honey yellow to bright yellow or yellow ochre cap less conspicuous stem reticulation and a more limited range covering florida west to texas b aureissimus var castaneus has a purplish brown cap with a texture like velvet boletus auripes somewhat resembles b but latter species has a more variably colored cap that can be orange brownish orange or yellowish and variable degrees of stem reticulation b has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on stem b auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to costa rican species b known only from a limited area in northern cordillera de talamanca latter species may be distinguished by lack of reticulations on upper half of stem a brown or salmon pink staining reaction on stem in response to handling and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia retiboletus retipes is set apart from b auripes by a darker cap tubes that lack an olive tinge and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to base in contrast to b auripes b has a floccose wooly or tomentose cap surface and lacks an olive tinge on tubes distribution and habitat boletus auripes is mycorrhizal and fruits singly scattered or in groups on ground under broadleaf trees especially oak and beech but it has also been recorded associating with mountain laurel kalmia latifolia boletus auripes typically forms fruit bodies between june and november boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution and is one of several fungi found in both eastern asia and eastern north america in north america where it is relatively common range of fungus extends from alaska south to mexico and east to new york in central america it has been recorded in belize mushroom has also been recorded from taiwan china including yunnan sichuan guangdong and hunan and japan it was reported
