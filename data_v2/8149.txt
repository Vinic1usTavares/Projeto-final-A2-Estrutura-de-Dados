religious buildings were also destroyed in raids on may 25 500 british and hessian soldiers under orders from general sir robert pigot commander of british garrison at newport rhode island landed between bristol and warren destroyed boats and other supplies and plundered bristol local resistance was minimal and ineffective in stopping british activities six days later 100 soldiers descended on freetown where less damage was done because local defenders prevented british from crossing a bridge background in december 1776 after completing conquest of new york city british lieutenant general william howe detached a body of troops from his army which occupied newport rhode island without significant opposition dearden p 7 newport garrison came under command of brigadier general sir robert

barton dearden p 13 since british occupation began american and british forces had been in a standoff major general joseph spencer had been ordered by major general george washington to launch an assault on newport in 1777 but he had not done so and was removed from command of rhode island defenses in march 1778 congress approved appointment of major general john sullivan to rhode island by early may sullivan had arrived in state and produced a detailed report on situation there murray p 6 he also began logistical preparations for an attack on newport caching equipment and supplies on

supplies and set fire to local powder magazine ensuing explosion destroyed six homes and town s meeting house troops also burned a sloop and destroyed five cannon as they marched from town first signs of organized resistance began to appear two british detachments rejoined and headed for bristol dearden p 26 word of british landing had reached providence and colonel barton immediately sprang into action recruiting about 200 volunteers he rushed south turned clary s retreating force around and caught up with british shortly after they left warren heading for bristol two forces skirmished as british marched southward with both sides incurring minor casualties notable exception was colonel barton who took a musket ball that did him sufficient damage that it effectively ended his military career although he continued to fight on that day campbell s men reached bristol in good order despite ongoing skirmishes and engaged in a destructive rampage in addition to military supplies and cannon they destroyed 22 homes and a church and looted everywhere making according to one account no distinction between their friends and foes dearden p 27 their work completed around noon british returned to their boats they embarked covered by guns of frigate hms flora and hm galley pigot and returned to aquidneck island and newport raid prompted general sullivan to renew calls to area governors for increased militia assistance this recruiting did not have material effect before next raid occurred may 25 raids also included capture of an anchored american galley spitfire near entrance to taunton river lieutenant frederick mackenzie diary may 25 1778 entry freetown raid pigot next organized a smaller raiding force to go to lower freetown a portion that was later separated to form fall river on night of may 30 a force of 100 men led by major edmund eyre who had served under campbell in previous raid embarked from arnold s point on aquidneck island in flat bottomed boats

militia from freetown and nearby tiverton mustered to give resistance eyre s men fired grapeshot from a small cannon and slowly pushed militiamen uphill deane p 217 as this took place some of his men proceeded to burn a house grist mill and sawmill nine boats and 15 000 feet of planking militia eventually reached a bridge across a stream where about 25 men established a defensive line behind a stone wall on far side in a battle lasting about 90 minutes durfee s men repulsed repeated attempts by eyre s men to gain control of bridge british soldiers then took one local resident prisoner set fire to his property and retreated to their boats militia followed harassing soldiers with musket fire on their return to port british naval vessels worked to assist pigot which had been grounded in

american battery some accounts describe american prisoner an elderly man named richard borden as being aboard one of boats coming under fire these accounts describe prisoner seeking shelter by laying flat on floor of vessel despite attempts of his captors to have him stand perhaps to try to dissuade attackers according to these accounts one or two of captors were eventually hit by shots from

bristol ferry british suffered two killed and five wounded in battle at freetown while americans suffered no casualties beyond one captive who apparently emerged without any noteworthy injury deane p 218 aftermath destruction of boats and supplies was a minor setback to american plans in mid july general washington informed sullivan that a french fleet was available to assist in operations against newport dearden p 38 this had a galvanizing effect on recruiting and local shipbuilders embarked on a crash boatbuilding program to replace boats destroyed in raid dearden pp 49 51 by early august french fleet of comte d estaing had arrived off newport and sullivan commanded a force of 10 000 militia and regular army troops ward p 588 bad weather and timely arrival of a british fleet to oppose
