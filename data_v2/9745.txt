invisible rail wallace s rail or drummer rail habroptila wallacii is a large flightless rail that is endemic to island of halmahera in north maluku indonesia where it inhabits impenetrable sago swamps adjacent to forests its plumage is predominantly dark slate grey and bare skin around its eyes long thick bill and legs are all bright red its call is a low drumming sound which is accompanied by wing beating difficulty of seeing this shy bird in its dense habitat means that information on its behaviour is limited recorded dietary items include sago shoots and insects and it also swallows small stones to help break up its food it is apparently monogamous but little else is known of its courtship behaviour only known nest was a shallow bowl in top of a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails estimated population of 3 500 15 000 birds and restricted range mean that invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature iucn habitat loss has occurred through harvesting of sago and conversion of wetlands to rice cultivation and rail is eaten by local people described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers so rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought taxonomy rails are a large and very widespread family with nearly 150 species they are small to medium sized terrestrial or wetland birds and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation island species readily become flightless of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands 32 have lost ability to fly invisible rail first classified by english zoologist george robert gray in 1860 is only member of monotypic genus habroptila genus name habroptila derives from greek delicate pretty splendid and ptilon feather wing wallacii commemorates british zoologist alfred russel wallace local names include soisa and this rail is related to new guinea flightless rail megacrex and chestnut rail all three australasian genera probably being derived from amaurornis ancestors storrs olson argued that genus megacrex was so similar to habroptila that megacrex should be considered a junior synonym of habroptila resulting in two species in genus this was further lumped in sidney dillon ripley s 1977 monograph of rallidae he included habroptila within large genus rallus this suggestion was however not accepted by mees who pointed out distinct differences in shape and structure of bill a molecular phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial dna sequence similarity found that habroptila is part of evolutionary radiation within broad genus gallirallus that took place around 400 000 years ago in region description left thumb habroptila wallacii on a 2012 indonesian stamp invisible rail is a large long flightless bird adult has a mainly dark slate grey body dark brown plumage on lower back rump and wings and a black uppertail its underparts are slightly paler slate grey than back and bare skin around eye long thick bill and strong legs are bright red it has a small spine at bend of wings sexes are identical in appearance plumage of fledged immature birds has not been described taylor van berlo 1998 pp 451 452 invisible rail is superficially similar to purple swamphen porphyrio porphyrio which has recently been found in halmahera but that species is larger with a short thick red bill and a red forehead shield it also has purple underparts and a white undertail invisible rail is different from rail gallirallus in that it is larger and lacks barred plumage of that species there is no overlap between ranges of two species call is a low drumming accompanied by a tuk tuk tuk made with wings nature of vocalisation led to a local legend that sound is made by bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet gerd heinrich noted local name soisa meaning drum and described call as being a subdued drumming purre purre purre purre purre which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream bird also produced a dull hum similar to voice of banded pig sus scrofa vittatus and reminiscent of call of snoring rail aramidopsis plateni calling is most frequent in early morning or late evening and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from bird a quieter version of call is given at nest other sounds attributed to this rail such as loud screams may be incorrect since they are like those produced by pale vented bush hen amaurornis moluccana distribution and habitat invisible rail inhabits dense spiky sago swamps of halmahera particularly where forest adjoins boggy areas claims that rail occurs in alang alang grass are thought to have arisen from confusion with pale vented bush hen german ornithologist gerd heinrich who prepared for his halmahera trip by rolling in stinging nettles wrote of sago swamp habitat in 1930s i am solidly confident no european has ever seen this rail alive for that requires such a degree of toughening and such demands on oneself as i cannot so easily attribute to others habroptila is shielded by awful thorns of sago swamps in this thorn wilderness i walked barefoot and half naked for weeks sightings of rail from 1950 to 2003 were from a restricted area of west halmahera regency at base of western peninsula of island but it was recorded prior to 1950 as far as southern point of halmahera more recent records showed that it is still present in a significantly larger area including northeast of island and locals claim that it also occurs in swamps near kao in northwest behaviour thumb left sago palms difficult habitat and retiring nature of invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse and there are few confirmed sightings recorded food items include sago shoots and insects it also feeds at cut sago plants although it is unclear whether it is eating decaying plant or searching for other edible items it swallows small stones as do all rails to help break up its food in gizzard taylor van berlo 1998 p 39 invisible rail is thought to be monogamous but little else is known of its courtship behaviour prior to nesting a report of 4 5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect since such a plumage is not normal for rails in this family chicks are typically precocial downy and black with any ornamentation confined to head bare flesh or specially modified plume feathers issue was resolved in november 2010 when a nest was found in top of a rotting tree stump above ground level and in from edge of a dry swamp forest in national park nest depression was in depth with a lower layer of small wood chips at its base and a lining of dead leaves egg shells were brownish white with dark brown and black markings of different sizes two very young chicks were entirely covered in black down contrasting with a white pollux equivalent of thumbnail on a human hand and pink index nail bill was black with a white tip and legs were black streaked brown eyes had grey irises and blue pupils rail chicks leave nest soon after hatching so chicks were assumed to be only a day or two old status bird species with a restricted range are especially vulnerable to human activities and eight of 26 bird species occurring only in northern maluku endemic bird area are threatened including invisible rail almost a quarter of all rail species have conservation concerns and flightless island species are particularly at risk at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600 taylor van berlo 1998 pp 56 61 estimated population of invisible rail is 3 500 15 000 birds and its restricted range and small population mean that species is classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature iucn although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than estimates suggest habitat loss has occurred through commercial harvesting of sago or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs only described nest was in an area well used by local villagers and rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought there were also several sightings in northeast halmahera in 2008 and 2011 extending area in which this bird has been seen in recent years references cited texts external links drumming at xeno cato six images of adult and chicks at oriental bird images invisible
