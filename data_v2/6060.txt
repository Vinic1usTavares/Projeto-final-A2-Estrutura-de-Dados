energy ace rating of 98 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength systems hurricane one a tropical storm was first observed about a few hundred miles north of lesser antilles on august 21 storm moved west northwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane 12 hours later after various surface vessels reported winds of 80 mph 130 km h it paralleled bahamas and turned northward on august 23 further intensification continued until august 24 with storm approaching major hurricane status at 00 00 utc it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h eye of cyclone later passed over diamond shoals lightship which recorded a minimum central barometric pressure of while located offshore of cape hatteras north carolina cyclone became extratropical on august 25 and dissipated near iceland on august 30 in hatteras area sustained winds reached while rainfall up to was observed thousands of trees were destroyed in buxton damage was estimated at 50 000 mostly in buxton area additionally storm was attributed to two fatalities later on august 24 storm curved east northeastward and began to slowly weaken by 00 00 utc on august
