difficult for him as he had recently undergone back surgery record is a concept album detailing end of world and features dark moody tracks mulling over confusion blink 182 bassist mark hoppus only member of that band not involved in project felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion which evolved into tensions between him and delonge it contributed to band s 2005 breakup however hoppus himself did provide guest vocals on album s twelfth track elevator box car racer peaked at number twelve on us billboard 200 despite little promotion and two singles i feel so and there is charted on billboard modern rock tracks chart with former hitting top 10 album received positive reviews from music critics who complimented darker direction in comparison to delonge s previous work with blink group toured album in north america in late 2002 with used and h2o album was conceived as an experiment of sorts as such band dissolved after tour background thumb right upright tom delonge conceived project during a break from touring box car racer was conceived by blink 182 guitarist vocalist tom delonge and formed during a break from touring trio s european tour in winter of 2001 was delayed in aftermath of september 11 attacks and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to delonge s back problems result of a herniated disc he began taking painkillers and developed neurosis inducing side effects delonge had felt bummed out and creatively stifled while recording group s previous album take off your pants and jacket on ensuing tour he and blink drummer travis barker would jam every day and barker introduced him to post hardcore music delonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music but soon embraced acts like fugazi quicksand rocket from crypt and pitchfork he began writing heavier sounding guitar riffs first riff he created became part of song all systems go barker in his 2015 memoir can i say maintains that he asked delonge if they should use riffs for a new blink album i honestly thought that tom had already had a conversation with bassist mark hoppus about this they were so tight inseparable i couldn t imagine mark didn t know barker writes for delonge he had developed an itch to do something where he didn t feel locked in to what blink was according to delonge box car racer was not meant to be a real band but rather something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on low list of totem pole of priorities in my life and just to have an experimental creative outlet project was at first solely acoustic guitar based he considered it in its earliest stages to be a violent femmes esque acoustic record unnamed project went through other names such as kill and album was initially titled et tu brute he eventually settled on name box car racer which was actually name of a band barker was in just after high school that delonge liked he began writing songs about end of world and connected it thematically with biblical book of revelation and world war ii when reading about war delonge was freaked out to learn that fat man atomic bomb that was detonated over nagasaki was dropped from b 29 bomber bockscar commonly misspelled boxcar recording and production left thumb upright producer jerry finn s gear according to assistant engineer sam boukas his equipment took up half studio space box car racer was recorded over six weeks beginning in december 2001 primarily at signature sound in san diego california sessions commenced quickly with producer jerry finn having sent one whole load of equipment to signature ahead of his arrival barker and delonge worked out 80 percent of completed album in barker s warehouse in corona california two weeks prior to recording when musicians entered studio little was changed aside from certain lyrics according to assistant engineer sam boukas barker completed his drum tracks in one day at two recording facilities in los angeles prior to signature sessions delonge invited musician david kennedy whom he had met in san diego music circuit some years prior to perform lead guitar parts on album roger joseph manning jr plays keyboards on record sessions were particularly difficult for delonge who suffered chronic back pain when your back is killing you and you have to have surgery and all this stuff it s just kind of hard to keep a focus on happier times in your life he told mtv news you end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused he often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again journalist joe shooman writes that album followed a diy spirit rather than spending months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market delonge intended to pay for project himself but when an a r representative heard four unfinished songs mca record label blink 182 was on wanted to finance album delonge s manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution according to boukas an mca representative dropped in on sessions and was pleased with what he heard when we wrote this album we didn t know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves barker said at time once mca jumped on board it was kind of like whatever that s cool cheers put it out we don t really care project caused division in blink 182 mostly between delonge and hoppus hoppus was interested in being a part of record but delonge did not want it to turn into a blink 182 album delonge contended that involvement of barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician regardless hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged band until their 2005 breakup nobody talked about it it was this strange situation that nobody addressed delonge told blender blender issue unknown 2004 barker felt guilty when he told hoppus they were going to tour in support of album i felt like i had let him down but he was ultimately more upset at tom because they had ten years of history together before me despite this tension hoppus lent vocals to track elevator and shared early ideas for next blink 182 album in a later reddit ama hoppus concluded whole situation sucked but i sang on track because at heart of it tom and travis are my friends i m sure tom felt tension and asked me as an offering i was glad to have done it and i was glad that he asked composition and artwork box car racer was inspired by and is partly a tribute to bands delonge credited as an influence such as quicksand fugazi and refused musically it is not drastically different than blink 182 though it puts more emphasis on slower heavier rhythms instead of being fast paced reviewers variously dubbed album post hardcore pop punk punk rock hardcore punk and post punk subject matter found on box car racer explores apocalypse conspiracy theories and freemasonry album follows a central storyline regarding an unnamed boy during end of world barker and delonge wrote songs together delonge would decide what key he would sing song in and barker would mostly arrange song toying with its structure and tempo time signature as for his performance on album barker considered it a totally different approach to drums there are like jazzy bridges it s so much more open and roomy album s final song instrumental was removed on cassette edition of album and replaced with an instrumental version of i feel so album s artwork described by shooman consists of bleak burgundy brown and black silhouettes plus a graffiti esque band logo hidden message 13 01 1 is printed on cd insert which are coordinates pointing to manhattan new york art direction for album was headed by tim stedman with stedman and marcos orozco designing package keegan gibbs was responsible for box car racer logo while maxx gramajo created tag logo artwork critical reception aaron scott of slant magazine was favorable in his review of box car racer writing neither genre obsessed nor intent on defying convention box car racer is perfect union between pop punk riffs and instrumentation that spans all rock genres from indie to folk finally we have a pop band that is attempting to take advantage of potential of its instruments adam of popmatters summarized box car racer as pretty fantastic hardcore emo punk rock album it seems to re affirm band s roots while proving that they are capable of more than by numbers approach of blink on other hand there s no reason this couldn t have been a blink 182 album robert from argus leader felt same commenting music is good with brooding melodies that fester inside soul but for delonge it just sounds like he s lost searching for his other half edna gunderson of usa today was positive commenting music while upbeat and even giddy steers away from adolescent pranks and pratfalls a welcome upgrade band creates a fresh breed of post punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies allmusic s brian o neill gave album three stars calling it a far cry from party boy ethos delonge is best known for and he wears emotional depth well with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread winning main squeeze a reviewer for q admitted that musicians confound expectations with a very good record review in q june 2002 positive reception of album was in contrast to reviews for blink which were often negative i think it s a cop out for critics to like music i do delonge told arizona daily star critics can t say they like blink or give us any credit cause we re out there goofing around barker was more critical i especially don t care what critics say most of them are like 50 years old and they re not really educated in what kind of music we re playing to begin with commercial performance box car racer was released worldwide on may 21 2002 by mca records album debuted on billboard 200 at number 12 on may 30 2002 selling 65 000 copies in its first week numbers were considered surprising given that album had virtually no promotion overall response to this album has been ridiculous we didn t have much push or anything we didn t do a whole lot of promo before album came out and it still did really well said barker as of august 2002 it had sold 244 000 copies in u s according to nielsen soundscan internationally album charted best in canada where it peaked at number seven in 2006 album was certified gold in canada for shipments of 50 000 copies i feel so was album s first single music video for song which is mainly performance based was co directed by delonge and nathan karma cox song was band s highest charting single peaking at number eight on billboard modern rock tracks chart in june 2002 there is was issued as album s second and final single and peaked at number 32 on same chart in november 2002 music video for that song was inspired by film say anything 1989 and was directed by alexander kosta both videos as well as bonus footage were included on a self titled dvd which was released november 2002 touring thumb right upright drummer travis barker whose interest in post hardcore music helped develop album to support album project morphed into a full band with barker delonge and kennedy barker invited his friend anthony celestino to play bass he had initially wanted alex barreto who was in original box car racer to be a part of second version of band but he could not get in touch with him they played their first four shows in april 2002 group commenced a full scale tour behind album in october 2002 with 22 north american shows supported by used and h2o though delonge would joke around at shows as he would with blink 182 mood was much different with blink i can t wait until i get done playing a song so i can say something stupid with this band i hardly talk at all he told las vegas weekly he expounded upon this in another interview it s a much more powerful emotional experience than it is with blink to play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience it s not about anything but music itself aftermath in a 2003 interview with kerrang delonge claimed album was only an attempt to challenge myself to do different shit i did it for myself whether it sold a million copies or just one it was for myself he clarified band s future succinctly there are a lot of emotions between mark and i and that s why there s never going to be another box car racer album it was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody article s author tom bryant describes album s effect on subsequent blink 182 albums it allowed delonge and therefore band to assess whether approaching or in their 30s they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important track listing personnel information adapted from cd
