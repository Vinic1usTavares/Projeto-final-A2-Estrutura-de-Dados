before his death some critics limit hawks by his action films describing hawks as a director who produced films with a masculine bias however action scenes in hawks s films were often left to second unit directors and hawks actually preferred to work indoors howard hawks s style is difficult to interpret because there is no recognizable relationship between his visual and narrative style as in films of his contemporary directors because his camera style was derived more from his working method rather than anecdotal or visual realization his camera work is unobtrusive making his films appear
