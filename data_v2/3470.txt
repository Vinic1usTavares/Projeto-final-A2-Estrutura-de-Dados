thumb adult thumb juvenile western jackdaw coloeus monedula also known as eurasian jackdaw european jackdaw or simply jackdaw is a passerine bird in crow family found across europe western asia and north africa it is mostly resident although northern and eastern populations migrate south in winter four subspecies are recognised which mainly differ in colouration of plumage on head and nape linnaeus first described it formally giving it name corvus monedula common name derives from word jack denoting small and daw a less common synonym for jackdaw and native english name for bird measuring in length western jackdaw is a black plumaged bird with a grey nape and distinctive pale grey irises it is gregarious and vocal living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland open woodland on coastal cliffs and in urban settings like its relatives jackdaws are intelligent birds and have been observed using tools an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder it eats a wide variety of plant material and invertebrates as well as food waste from urban areas western jackdaws are monogamous and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees cliffs or buildings about five pale blue or blue green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by female young fledge in four to five weeks systematics etymology western jackdaw was one of many species originally described by carl linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae owing to its supposed fondness for picking up coins linnaeus gave it binomial name corvus monedula choosing specific name monedula which is derived from moneta latin stem of word money jackdaws are sometimes placed in genus coloeus from ancient greek koloios koloios for jackdaw though most subsequent works have retained two jackdaw species in corvus original old english word ceo pronounced with initial ch gave modern english chough chaucer sometimes used this word to refer to western jackdaw as did shakespeare in hamlet although there has been debate about which species he was referring to this onomatopoeic name based on western jackdaw s call now refers to corvids of genus pyrrhocorax red billed chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax formerly particularly common in cornwall became known initially as cornish chough and then just chough name transferring from one species to other common name jackdaw first appeared in 16th century and is thought to be a compound of forename jack used in animal names to signify a small form e g jack snipe and archaic native english word daw formerly western jackdaws were simply called daws goodwin p 78 metallic chyak call may be origin of jack part of common name but this is not supported by oxford english dictionary daw first used for bird in 15th century is held by oxford english dictionary to be derived from postulated old english dawe citing cognates in old high german taha middle high german or and modern german dahle or and dialectal dahi and dacha names in english dialects are numerous scottish and north english dialects have included ka or since 14th century midlands form of this word was co or coo is potentially a compound of ka and dow a variant of daw other dialectal or obsolete names include caddy chauk college bird jacko ka chimney sweep bird from their nesting propensities and sea crow from frequency with which they are found on coasts it was also frequently known quasi nominally as jack an archaic collective noun for a group of jackdaws is a clattering first recorded in john lydgate s debate between horse goose and sheep c 1430 as a of and then in juliana berners book of saint albans c 1480 as a of choughes another name for a flock is a train taxonomy a study in 2000 found that genetic distance between jackdaws and other members of corvus was greater than that within rest of genus this led pamela rasmussen to reinstate genus name coloeus created by johann kaup in 1829 in her birds of south asia 2005 a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in german by hans edmund wolters a study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared dna sequences in mitochondrial control region of several corvids it found that western jackdaw and closely related daurian jackdaw c dauuricus of eastern russia and china were basal to core corvus clade names coloeus monedula and coloeus dauuricus have since been adopted by international ornithological congress in their official list two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in altai mountains southern siberia and mongolia analysis of mitochondrial dna of specimens of two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct subspecies thumb right c m monedula in sweden this subspecies has a whitish partial collar there are four recognised subspecies of western jackdaw all european subspecies intergrade where their populations meet goodwin p 75 c m monedula intergrades into c m soemmerringii in a transition zone running from finland south across baltic and eastern poland to romania and croatia c m monedula linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies is found in eastern europe its range extends across scandinavia from southern finland south to esbjerg and in denmark through eastern germany and poland and south across eastern central europe to carpathian mountains and north western romania vojvodina in northern serbia and slovenia cramp p 120 it breeds in south eastern norway southern sweden and northern and eastern denmark with occasional wintering in england and france it has been recorded as a rare vagrant to spain it has a pale nape and sides of neck a dark throat and a light grey partial collar of variable extent c m spermologus vieillot 1817 occurs in western central and southern europe and northern africa from british isles netherlands and rhineland in north through western switzerland into italy in south east and iberian peninsula and morocco in south it winters in canary islands and corsica name spermologus comes from greek a picker of seeds it is darker in colour than other subspecies and lacks whitish border at base of grey nape c m soemmerringii fischer von waldheim 1811 is found in north eastern europe and north and central asia from former soviet union to lake baikal and north west mongolia and south to turkey israel and eastern himalayas its south western limits are serbia and southern romania it winters in iran and northern india kashmir johann fischer von waldheim described this taxon as corvus soemmerringii in 1811 noting its differences from populations in western europe its species name was given in honour of german anatomist samuel thomas von it is distinguished by nape and sides of neck being paler creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar c m cirtensis rothschild and hartert 1912 is found in morocco and algeria in north western africa and was formerly found in tunisia name cirtensis refers to ancient city of cirta in numidia

smallest member of genus corvus goodwin p 74 most of plumage is a shiny black with a purple in subspecies monedula and spermologus or blue in subspecies cirtensis and soemmerringii sheen on crown cramp p 139 forehead and secondaries and a green blue sheen on throat primaries and tail cheeks nape and neck are light grey to greyish silver and underparts are slate grey legs are black as is short stout bill length of which is about 75 of length of rest of head there are rictal bristles covering around 40 of maxilla and 25 of lower mandible irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age sexes look alike though head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear particularly just before moulting cramp p 137 western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from june to september in western parts of their range and a month later in east purplish sheen of cap is most prominent just after moulting immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage head is a sooty black sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible back and side of neck are dark grey and underparts greyish or sooty black tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen there is very little geographic variation in size main differences are presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at base of nape variations in shade of nape and tone of underparts populations in central asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill body colour becomes darker further north in mountain regions and humid climates and paler elsewhere however individual variation particularly in juveniles and also during months before moulting can often be greater than geographic differences a skilled flyer western jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide it has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying though these are not evident when birds are migrating wind tunnel experiments show that preferred gliding speed is between per second and that wingspan decreases as bird flies faster on ground western jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly their short legs giving them a rapid gait they feed with their heads held down or horizontally within its range western jackdaw is unmistakable its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features from a distance it can be confused with a rook corvus frugilegus or when in flight with a pigeon or chough cramp p 121 flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips they also have shorter thicker necks much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks they can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs western jackdaw is very similar in morphology behaviour and calls to daurian jackdaw with which its range overlaps in western asia adults are readily distinguished since daurian has a pied plumage but immature birds are much more similar both species having dark plumage and dark eyes daurian tends to be darker with a less contrasting nape than western vocalisations thumb western jackdaw calling in flight on inisheer ireland western jackdaws are voluble birds main call frequently given in flight is a metallic and squeaky chyak chyak or kak kak this is a contact or greeting call a feeding call made by adults to call young or males when offering food to their mates has been transcribed as or females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males written as or cramp p 133 perched birds often chatter together and before settling for night large roosting flocks make a noise western jackdaws also have a hoarse drawn out alarm call or used when warning of predators or when mobbing them nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age as they grow their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18 after this voice deepens and softens cramp p 134 from day 25 young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise european jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech distribution and habitat western jackdaw is found from north west africa through all of europe except for subarctic north and eastwards through central asia to eastern himalayas and lake baikal to east it occurs throughout turkey caucasus iran iraq afghanistan pakistan and north west india however it is regionally extinct in malta and tunisia range is vast with an estimated global extent between it has a large global population with an estimated 15 6 to 45 million individuals in europe alone censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between 1970s and 2010 although this increase may be related to recovery from previous periods when they were regarded as pests text reports large declines among summer populations between 1968 80 and 2000 uk population was estimated at 2 5 million individuals in 1998 up from 780 000 in 1970 bbs has potential for producing better estimates of habitat specific densities and population sizes for many uk bird populations than those available previously thumb a western jackdaw on inisheer ireland most populations are resident but northern and eastern populations are more migratory relocating to wintering areas between september and november and returning between february and early may cramp p 124 their range expands northwards into russia to siberia during summer and retracts in winter they are vagrants to faroe islands particularly in winter and spring and occasionally to iceland elsewhere western jackdaws congregate over winter in ural valley in north western kazakhstan north caspian and tian shan region of western china they are winter visitors to quetta valley in western pakistan and are winter vagrants to lebanon where they were first recorded in 1962 in syria they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place soemmerringii subspecies occurs in south central siberia and extreme north west china and is accidental to hokkaido japan a small number of western jackdaws reached north east of north america in 1980s and have been found from atlantic canada to pennsylvania they have also occurred as vagrants in gibraltar mauritania and saint pierre and miquelon and one is reported to have been seen in egypt western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes pastures cultivated land coastal cliffs and towns they thrive when forested areas are cleared and converted to fields and open areas habitats with a mix of large trees buildings and open ground are preferred open fields are left to rook and more wooded areas to eurasian jay garrulus glandarius along with other corvids such as rook common raven corvus corax and hooded crow c some western jackdaws spend winter in urban parks populations measured in three urban parks in warsaw show increases from october to december possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north same data from warsaw collected from 1977 to 2003 showed that wintering western jackdaw population had increased four fold cause of increase is unknown but a reduction in number of rooks may have benefited species locally or rooks overwintering in belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to warsaw behaviour left thumb a family group in bushy park london thumb a western jackdaw in flight generally wary of people in forest or countryside western jackdaws are much tamer in urban areas like magpies they are known to show interest in shiny objects such as jewellery john gay in his beggar s opera notes that a covetous fellow like a jackdaw steals what he was never made to enjoy for sake of hiding it in tobias smollett s expedition of humphry clinker a scathing character assassination runs he is ungracious as a hog greedy as a vulture and thievish as a jackdaw highly gregarious western jackdaws are generally seen in flocks of varying sizes though males and females pair bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site at uppsala sweden 40 000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for night cramp p 129 western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks latter particularly when migrating or roosting they have been recorded foraging with common starling sturnus vulgaris northern lapwing vanellus vanellus and common gull larus canus in northwestern england flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons falco although larger groups are more able to elude predators western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as european magpies common ravens or egyptian vultures one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group cramp p 132 occasionally a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed in his book king solomon s ring konrad lorenz described and analysed complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in austria he ringed them for identification and caged them in winter to prevent their annual migration he found that birds have a linear hierarchical group structure with higher ranked individuals dominating lower ranked birds and pair bonded birds sharing same rank young males establish their individual status before pairing with females upon pairing female assumes same social position as her partner unmated females are lowest members in pecking order and are last to have access to food and shelter lorenz noted one case in which a male absent during dominance struggles and pair returned to flock became dominant male and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate this female immediately assumed a dominant position in social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others according to lorenz most significant factor in social behaviour was immediate and intuitive grasp of new hierarchy by each of western jackdaws in flock social displays social hierarchy in western jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting fighting and threat displays several of which have been described in bill up posture western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and its plumage indicating both appeasement and assertiveness posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks a bill down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour in this display a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers and sometimes slightly lifts its wings western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues in forward threat posture a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards in intense versions bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings this extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females cramp p 130 in defensive threat posture bird lowers its head and bill spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch site second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other other individuals gather and call noisily cramp p 131 western jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers birds mainly preen each other s head and neck known as allopreening this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair breeding right thumb occupying a hole in a wall at conwy castle wales thumb right nest with a chick and eggs thumb eggs collection museum wiesbaden right thumb fledgling c m spermologus in southern england western jackdaws become sexually mature in their second year genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra pair copulation and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure some pairs do separate in first few months but almost all pairings of over six months duration are lifelong ending only when a partner dies cramp p 128 widowed or separated birds fare badly often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone western jackdaws usually breed in colonies with pairs collaborating to find a nest site which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of year they nest in cavities in trees or cliffs in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys common feature being a sheltered site for nest availability of suitable sites influences their presence in a locale they may also use church steeples for nesting a fact reported in verse by 18th century english poet william cowper nest platforms can attain a great size a mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it it is then built on top of platform formed this behaviour has led to blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces sometimes with birds still on them in his natural history of selborne gilbert white notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath lintels of stonehenge and describes an example of bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting species has been recorded outcompeting tawny owl strix for nest sites in netherlands they can take over old nest sites of black woodpecker dryocopus martius and stock dove columba breeding colonies may also edge out those of red billed chough but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as carrion crow rook or magpie nests are lined with hair wool dead grass and many other materials eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids goodwin p 47 being smooth a glossy pale blue or blue green with darker speckles ranging from dark brown to olive or grey violet cramp p 135 egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies those of subspecies monedula average and in weight those of subspecies soemmerringii in size and in weight and those of subspecies spermologus in size and in weight clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs although a slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs eggs are incubated by female for 17 18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks which are completely dependent on adults for food they fledge after 28 35 days and parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and incubation begins before clutch completion which often leads to death of last hatched young if supply of food is low parental investment in brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive replacement clutches are very rarely laid in event of clutch failure great spotted cuckoo glandarius has been recorded as a brood parasite of western jackdaw depositing its eggs in their nests in spain and israel nest robbers include common raven in spain tawny owl and least weasel mustela nivalis in england and brown rat rattus norvegicus in finland cramp p 136 european pine marten martes martes raids isolated nests in sweden but is less successful when nests are part of a colony feeding thumb c m soemmerringii foraging in pasture in russia foraging takes place mostly on ground in open areas and to some extent in trees landfill sites bins streets and gardens are also visited more often early in morning when there are fewer people about various feeding methods are employed such as jumping pecking clod turning and scattering probing soil and occasionally digging flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto cow pat earthworms are not usually extracted from ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil jackdaws will ride on backs of sheep and other mammals seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests and will catch flying ants in flight compared with other corvids western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy western jackdaw tends to feed on small invertebrates up to in length that are found above ground including various species of beetle particularly cockchafers of genus cramp p 125 and weevil larvae and pupae diptera and lepidoptera species as well as snails and spiders also eaten are small rodents bats eggs and chicks of birds and carrion such as roadkill vegetable items consumed include farm grains barley wheat and oats weed seeds acorns and various cultivated fruits examination of gizzards of western jackdaws shot in cyprus in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals predominantly wheat and insects notably cicadas and beetles diet averages 84 plant material except when breeding when main food source is insects a study in southern spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of and calcareous grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium opportunistic and highly adaptable western jackdaw varies its diet markedly depending on available food sources cramp p 127 they have been recorded taking eggs and nestlings from nests of skylark alauda arvensis manx shearwater puffinus puffinus razorbill torda common murre uria grey heron ardea cinerea rock pigeon columba livia and eurasian collared dove streptopelia a field study of a large city dump on outskirts of leon in northwestern spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in early morning and at dusk and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism saker falcon falco has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in vojvodina in serbia western jackdaws practice active food sharing where initiative for transfer lies with donor with a number of individuals regardless of sex or kinship they also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in context of parental care and courtship western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species including chimpanzees function of this behaviour is not fully understood though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism reciprocity and harassment avoidance it has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement parasites and diseases western jackdaws have learned to peck open foil caps of milk bottles left on doorsteps after delivery by milkman bacterium campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink this activity was linked to cases of campylobacter gastroenteritis in gateshead in northeast england and led department of health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded it was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds from pecking open bottles in future an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to western jackdaws during a post mortem on an affected bird a polyomavirus was isolated from spleen illness appeared to be a co infection of this with salmonella and virus has been provisionally named crow polyomavirus segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from small intestine of a western jackdaw although their pathogenicity or role is unknown pest control western jackdaw has been hunted as vermin though not as heavily culled as other species of corvid after a series of poor harvests in early 1500s introduced a vermin act in 1532 ordeyned to dystroye choughes i e jackdaws crowes and rokes to protect grain crops from their predations western jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit especially cherries this act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion but passed act for preservation of grayne in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until mid 20th century particularly large numbers were culled in county of norfolk western jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs in a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids antonia notes that german naturalist alfred brehm considered western jackdaw to be a lovable bird and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture western jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in united kingdom other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are crow jay magpie and rook an authorised person must comply with requirements of wildlife and countryside act 1981 and does not need to show that birds were a nuisance before trapping them as of 2003 western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in european union birds directive and hunting has been encouraged by german hunting associations permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer
