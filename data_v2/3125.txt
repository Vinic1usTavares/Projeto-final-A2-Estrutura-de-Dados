right thumb 300px bal maidens in traditional protective clothing 1890 alt four women wearing dark heavy clothing bright white aprons and long white bonnets entirely covering sides of their heads and protruding forwards over their faces a bal maiden from cornish language a mine and english maiden a young or unmarried woman was a female manual labourer working in mining industries of cornwall and western devon at south western extremity of great britain term has been in use since at least early 18th century at least 55 000 women and girls worked as bal maidens and actual number is likely to have been much higher while women worked in coal mines elsewhere in britain either on surface or underground bal maidens worked only on surface it is likely that cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity but first records of female mine workers date from 13th century after black death in 14th century mining declined and no records of female workers have been found from then until late 17th century industrial improvements end of crown control of metal mines and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in cornish mining in late 17th and early 18th centuries increasing numbers of women and girls were recruited to mines from about 1720 processing ore sent up by male miners underground discovery of cheaper sources of copper in north wales in 1770s triggered a crash in copper price and many mines closed as industrial revolution began in late 18th and early 19th centuries welsh metal mines declined and mining in cornwall and devon became viable once more women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing women and children accounted for up to half workers in area s copper mines although machinery was capable of performing much of work done by bal maidens industry grew so quickly that number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of workforce to 15 20 by 1850 at peak of cornish mining boom in around 1860 at least 6000 bal maidens were working at region s mines actual number is likely to have been much higher while it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at age of six and to work into old age they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married from 1860s cornish mines faced competition from cheap metal imports and legislation introduced in 1870s limited use of child labour cornish mining system went into terminal decline leading to a collapse of local economy and mass emigration both overseas and to other parts of united kingdom in 1891 number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak and by outbreak of first world war in 1914 very few remained in employment in 1921 dolcoath mine last employer of bal maidens ceased operations bringing tradition to an end other than women recruited for ore processing at geevor as a result of labour shortages during second world war and a very limited number of female workers after sex discrimination act 1975 banned practice of recruiting only male mineworkers women never again performed manual labour in cornish mines last surviving bal maiden died in 1968 and with closure of south crofty tin mine in 1998 cornish metals mining came to an end background right thumb earthworks near minions left by tin streaming gathering clusters of ore from stream and river beds earliest form of mining in cornwall alt soil mounds piled near course of a small stream for at least 3 000 years from antiquity until late 20th century mining of tin and copper played a significant part in economy of cornwall cornwall northern part of iberia and ore mountains modern border between czech republic and germany are only places in europe in which major tin deposits are found near surface as tin is an essential ingredient of bronze cornwall was of great economic significance in bronze age europe despite its relative isolation mining by roman empire led to iberian mines becoming depleted by 3rd century ad leaving cornwall and neighbouring devon most significant sources of tin in europe while it appears from surviving evidence that after decline of bronze age civilisations copper production ceased in cornwall it seems that tin mines were in continuous operation throughout roman period and middle ages primitive early mines of cornwall and devon probably were operated by local extended families with men women and children all working men and boys probably worked both above surface and below ground and women and girls worked only above ground there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in bronze age britain although some mines from period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them at some point between death of cnut great in 1035 and death of edward confessor in early 1066 independent kingdom of cornwall was annexed by neighbouring kingdom of wessex a part of kingdom of england in late 1066 cornwall along with rest of lands under control of english king was conquered by normans and came under control of william conqueror by late 12th century metal mines were brought under control of crown operation of tin mines was devolved to lord warden of stannaries and mining of other metals was directly controlled by crown as mines royal female mine workers in middle ages although women and girls probably worked in mining since antiquity earliest known written references to female manual labourers in mining are in 13th and 14th century records of royal lead and silver mines at bere alston on border between devon and cornwall mines were bordered on three sides by a loop of river tamar since 936 traditional boundary between devon and cornwall mines themselves were on devon side of border at bere alston itself but surface level smelters were on cornish side at as there was a supply of timber for use in furnaces although mining itself was carried out by men female workers were employed to sort ore for crushing to prepare bone ash used as a flux during smelting process and for general manual labour an adult woman was paid up to one penny per day and young girls between and of a penny miners and other skilled labourers at bere alston were recruited from throughout england and wales and from evidence of surnames in records it appears that many of female labourers were wives and daughters of these incomers rather than locally recruited women during and after black death area s population collapsed those miners who had survived pandemic left mining to work in farming in which wages had doubled owing to severe labour shortage and mines of bere alston were abandoned although women and girls were almost certainly employed at lead and silver mine at bere alston and also a few records have so far been of female workers at tin works on bodmin moor and around and in 14th century it does not appear that significant numbers of female labourers worked in cornwall s mining industry until early 18th century as no records have yet been discovered for this period mechanisation and 18th century copper boom in 1678 clement clerke introduced coal powered reverberatory furnace greatly increasing quantity of metal extractable from ore mines royal act 1689 ended crown ownership of cornwall s mines allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations at same time nine years war 1688 97 and war of spanish succession 1701 14 caused high demand for metals as a consequence midlands with easy river and canal access to coal mines of wales and northern england and to metal mines of cornwall became a major centre for metallurgy ore was shipped from cornwall up river severn to smelters in gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to factories surrounding birmingham financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising mines of cornwall with a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly populated cornwall and with a prevalent belief that women and children were best suited to ore separation which required dexterity and good observation skills but little in way of physical strength large scale recruitment of women and girls to mines began it is around this time that term bal maiden appears to have come into common usage derived from old cornish mine a significant proportion of cornwall s young women quickly became involved in mining by 1736 vicar of ludgvan was complaining that he was unable to hire servants as young women of town were employed about copper in around 1720 two key innovations revolutionised cornish mining industry whim a horse powered mechanism for lifting ore to surface made mining in deep shafts practical and horse powered pump allowed mining beneath water table role of 18th century bal maidens with need for expensive machinery and horses and for large numbers of workers at each mine traditional operation of mines by extended families or by individual entrepreneurs became impractical and new deep level mines came under ownership of groups of investors and of mining companies a group of people known as a tribute team often a single extended family would bid for right to work a specified portion of mine men and older boys would dig in appointed section and women girls and young boys would dress ore sent up by men in later years practice of bal maidens dressing only ore sent up by men of their tribute team was abandoned and they would instead be paid a flat wage by mine owner to dress any ore sent up and tribute team which had sent up ore would be billed for work done typical work for a bal maiden in this period was picking ore from rubble breaking and separating ore and carrying ore and metal generally girls under 12 would sort ore older girls would separate ore and grown women would carry out heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus as bal maidens of smaller tribute teams often did not have time to dress all ore sent up or it was not financially worthwhile to pay for poorer quality ore to be processed large quantities of poor quality ore were discarded unprocessed in waste heaps on those occasions when improved extraction techniques or rises in price of metals made it worthwhile to process this discarded ore sometimes separate tribute teams would bid for right to dress and process this rubble as practice of using tribute teams declined in early 19th century mine owners themselves would hire bal maidens to dress this waste ore records from pool adit copper mine at most successful of early copper mines show in 1729 25 bal maidens and three males worked as pickers sorting high quality from poor quality ore earning a flat rate of 4d per day and typically working 20 days per month records do not show ages of pickers at pool adit but male pickers are likely to have been boys too young for heavy labour in 1730 pool adit employed 30 female and four male pickers and by 1731 figures had risen to 55 female and five male typically working 22 to 26 days per month number of bal maidens employed in industry rose dramatically and by early 1770s dolcoath by then most significant of cornish copper mines employed around 220 bal maidens on copper dressing floors alone it appears that during 18th century copper boom it was customary throughout cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour there are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece rate for amount of work done instead mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed when poor weather conditions made surface level work impossible water shortages meant water powered machinery could not operate or accidents in mines caused a temporary closure bal maidens would be suspended in 1770s and 1780s discovery of copper at parys mountain in anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by mining led to a crash in copper price and expensive deep mining began to become unviable as copper boom came to an end mines began to close in 1788 mining ceased at dolcoath itself although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through large quantities of ore which had already been brought to surface industrialisation and 19th century copper boom at end of 18th century copper mining industry of north wales centred around parys mountain declined and depression in british copper market ended as price rose cornish mines began to reopen by this time industrial revolution had begun bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency while mine managers of 18th century generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible while 18th century metal mines had worked on principle of adult men digging ore and women and children picking and cobbing ore ready for smelting in new large scale mines of early 19th century working practices changed strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ragging in copper mines very young girls and sick and injured older women carried out simple work of picking girls in their late teens forced broken ore through a broad mesh to sort ore riddling and used hammers to break large chunks of ore left by riddling process into smaller chunks girls in their mid teens resulting chunks separating valuable ore from waste rock grown women would carry out heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers spalling of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting bucking and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus an experienced bal maiden working as a would produce approximately one ton 2240 lb 1016 kg of broken ore per day depending on type of stone in tin mines in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting cobbing and bucking did not take place instead chunks of ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate coarse rough from fine slimes resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames buddling and framing respectively to extract tin ore from surrounding dust and grit following introduction of mechanical ore crusher in 1804 tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised despite this rapid growth of mines in comparison to slow spread of mechanisation meant number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily although statistics for number of women employed in mines in early days of industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory total numbers because records from period are incomplete and inconsistent in format total number of bal maidens working in this period is unclear estimates for total number employed at end of 18th century range from 1 200 to 5 000 with women and children constituting up to half total number of people working in copper mining and a lower proportion in less labour intensive tin mining mayers 2008 estimates that at a minimum 55 000 women and girls in total worked as bal maidens between 1720 and 1921 based on an estimate of each working an average of 10 years with number peaking in early 1860s at at least 7 000 actual figures are likely to have been considerably higher not all mines recorded male and female workers separately and after 1872 there may have been deliberate under reporting of number of children working owing to legal restrictions on their employment these estimates do not include female workers performing non manual administrative work at mines nor those in related industries such as slate and quarrying although proportion of bal maidens in workforce fell steadily mining boom of first half of 19th century took total number to between 4 000 and 14 400 by 1840s 1841 census first full census of england shows 3 250 women working in mines but mine returns of same year show over 5 000 women in tin lead and copper mines of cornwall and west devon increased mechanisation of ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to harsh working conditions of mines meant that proportion of bal maidens in workforce continued to fall and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20 of mine workers were female by 1861 census coinciding with peak of cornish mining industry a minimum of 6 000 women were working in mining in cornwall at least 2 500 of whom worked within a five mile radius of camborne although employed primarily in copper and tin mines bal maidens also worked in lead zinc manganese iron antimony wolfram and uranium mines and in slate and china clay quarries typical work right thumb bal maidens with traditional tools and protective clothing spalling ore 1858 alt three women wearing heavy clothing and long bonnets carrying long hammers standing around a pile of rocks women typically began working at mines at around age of 10 or 11 although there are some cases of girls starting work at as young as six and in areas such as camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight charles foster barham s enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12 until 1870s cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in united kingdom and typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between 1841 census and 1871 census women would typically remain at mine until they married while this generally meant that they stopped working at between ages of 19 and 24 it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s and a 93 year old bal maiden was recorded in 1891 census a typical working day would last from 7 00 am to 5 00 pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter ore dressing by candle light was not cost effective with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon lunch typically consisted of pasties hoggans hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork potato or dried fruit or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to mine s furnaces along with mugwort or tea and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals although still not paid on a piece rate basis each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay some mines operated on basis that once quota had been met bal maidens were allowed to go home meaning working day could finish up to two hours early although at a few tin mines at which water powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week in vast majority of industry they were not expected to work on sundays as well as religious holidays observed in rest of united kingdom cornish miners also celebrated st piran s day 5 march and thursday thursday before christmas purportedly day on which st piran rediscovered tin smelting other than religious holidays and parish feast days cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in early 20th century typical pay in 1840s and 1850s would be 4d per day for younger girls rising to 8d 1s per day for full grown women engaged in skilled bucking work wages varied by region owing to differing levels of supply and demand for workers in kea and average wage for women and girls was as high as 18s in 1841 as they were employed as casual labour bal maidens were not tied to any particular mine and it was not unusual for them to transfer to other mines offering better pay or conditions some mines may have paid a monthly loyalty bonus in an effort to retain their workers workers could be fined for bad language failure to work hard enough absenteeism and other misdemeanours as their pay was dependent on profitability of mine it was not unusual early in 19th century for bal maidens to work for long periods in at least one case a laundry woman 11 months without pay and to receive their pay in arrears once mine returned to profit while some younger bal maidens would attend school before starting work and in 1841 around a quarter of bal maidens attended sunday schools illiteracy was rife when charles foster barham s reported to 1842 royal commission into employment of children at mines he found that less than half of bal maidens he interviewed were able to read to any extent some mines subsidised basic education for children of their employees mining families generally valued education so highly that they would often try to send at least one child to school but any education children did receive tended to be curtailed once they became old enough to work in mines unlike coal mines of wales and northern england cornish mines generally did not provide housing for their workers largely owing to casual nature of work under tribute team system bal maidens would typically travel to mines from their family homes some families building homes near mine until inclosure acts of late 18th and early 19th centuries anyone moving to an area had right to build a house on common land provided they could build it overnight they would generally remain living with their families until marriage much of early 19th century cornwall retained old custom of keeping company by which a couple would not be formally married until woman became pregnant and woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time while some lived at or near mine at which they worked mine workers typically walked three to four miles five to seven km to and from work each day miners cottages were generally crowded and squalid sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage while abstraction of region s water supplies for use in mines led to serious problems with sanitation and provision of fresh water during european food crisis of 1840s food prices rose sharply to around three times pre crisis prices and relatively low paid bal maidens of devon great consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs while mine owners initially met their demands once food price stabilised pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout on their return to work next day all striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers or re hired at an even lower pay rate than before bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in 19th century but cornwall s high unemployment meant strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced working conditions thumb right 300px miners and bal maidens with typical equipment and protective clothing at dolcoath 1890 alt large group of men in bowler hats and women wearing large bonnets posing with tools from 1840s onwards more mines provided crude shelters to protect surface workers from worst of weather but at many others work at surface level took place in open air workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in most extreme weather conditions bal maidens wore gooks a specialised bonnet which covered shoulders and extended over face to protect from rain bright sunlight flying debris and loud noise in winter was made of felt and in summer of cotton working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery they wore shorter dresses or skirts than ankle length clothing typical of period and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer while working bal maidens wore a waist length hessian apron over their clothes and those who could afford it would have a white flax and hemp apron for wearing to and from work these working clothes were accessorised with flowers bows ribbons jewellery and other decoration until end of 19th century working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little although less dangerous than work below ground some bal maidens suffered poor health tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in mining communities and would be exacerbated by constant exposure to high levels of mineral dust constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems extraction of arsenic from tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes constant bending lifting and carrying often led to muscular strains need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands noise generated by industrial machinery particularly after introduction of steam engine could cause hearing difficulties with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages noxious fumes notably arsenic lead and antimony could cause digestive problems bowel disorders and and other disruptions of reproductive system barley hoggans also caused digestive problems while some of larger mines provided separate eating areas for bal maidens others obliged male and female workers to eat together a cause of consternation among some observers concerned that exposure to coarse joking and rude behaviour of men had a negative effect on modesty and delicacy expected of women other contemporary concerns were that heavy protective clothing led them to be unfeminine that working in constant view of men caused bal maidens to have an unhealthy interest in their own appearance and attractiveness that spending long hours at work meant that they did not have time to learn skills to be good housewives barham s 1841 investigations found no evidence to claim that bal maidens grew up to be poor housewives concluding that they are for most part tender mothers and industrious wives and laborious occupations to which they have been make household duties appear comparatively light other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved and often devoutly religious but it is well documented that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing many contemporary observers commented on high fashion of clothing worn by bal maidens on sundays and holidays although disposable income of a bal maiden was low they would sometimes form dress clubs to buy fashionable clothing which they would take turns wearing despite hardships and relatively low pay barham s 1841 investigation into cornish mining industry found that bal maidens generally enjoyed their work and that those who had been in other jobs tended to prefer work at mines mining had shorter hours than domestic service and was less affected by seasonal variations than farm working other two jobs employing significant numbers of women and it was far easier for workers to live at home and travel to work each day rather than lodging in their master s house or on a remote farm outdoor work was considered healthier than work in enclosed and smoky mines and factories and it was sometimes believed that women who had worked as bal maidens from a young age were healthier than they would otherwise have been from 1780s onwards cornwall suffered severe unemployment and poverty and there were always large numbers of women and girls volunteering for work at mines practice of giving preference to wives widows and children of dead or invalid miners allowed families to remain in their local area and to avoid destitution following loss of family s main breadwinner work as a bal maiden also provided an opportunity for girls and young women to escape workhouses and gain financial independence as well as benefits to community of giving work to families of invalid or dead miners recruitment from within mining families benefited mine owners also wives and children of miners could be expected to understand mining terminology and techniques and would generally have been regular visitors to mines delivering food to their husbands and thus be familiar with mine s layout decline right 300px thumb dolcoath largest and deepest of cornwall s mines at peak of its tin production in 1893 dolcoath was last significant mine in cornwall to employ traditional bal maidens alt barren landscape with a large number of tall smoking chimneys and long low buildings in around 1865 faced with increased competition from overseas mines and with most productive copper mines becoming exhausted cornish mining industry went into terminal decline by 1880 level of cornish copper production was at around a quarter of its 1860 level as production fell numbers of employees in mines fell with it much of copper industry collapsed causing a movement within cornwall from copper to tin mining while some bal maidens continued to work at mines many worked in tin streaming in rivers and streams flowing from tin mining areas in those copper mines which survived investment in new machinery virtually ceased so employment of some bal maidens continued tin industry which was still economically successful began to invest in new machinery to replace manual ore dressing drastically reducing number of female workers by 1870 number of bal maidens in work had fallen by around 50 at same time as cornish mining industry went into decline public opposition to use of female and child labour in mines was rising metalliferous mines regulation act 1872 brought mines of cornwall under provisions of mines act 1842 which had previously applied only to coal mines limiting use of child labour in mines and thus increasing costs act prohibited women from working underground which bal maidens did not do but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine even on surface passing of factory and workshop act 1878 drastically limited use of female and child labour employment of children under 10 was banned outright maximum working hours for children aged 10 14 were drastically restricted and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week sudden loss of cheap child labourers made already weakened mining industries of cornwall and west devon even less profitable and more than half mines in area went out of business in following decade some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin streaming but instability in metal markets made what remained of mining industries increasingly unviable in 1880s william ewart gladstone s liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether although bill was defeated number of bal maidens continued to fall at 1891 census number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s 60s peak by 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873 and in 1901 devon great consols last significant copper mine in devon and cornwall closed electrification and introduction of frue vanners at surviving mines replaced most of jobs still done by women and by outbreak of first world war in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment with wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in armed forces some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re opened mine at st austell and to re dress existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic emigration and economic collapse as metal mining industry on which it depended declined and prices for staple goods rose sharply resulting from fluctuations in food prices and of american civil war economy of cornwall collapsed large numbers of cornish families emigrated to mining districts in other countries and other parts of united kingdom in some former mining districts as much as of young people moved out in 20 years following closure of local mines between 1861 and 1900 at least 35 of cornish women aged 15 24 moved to other parts of uk and over 26 left country altogether although male emigrants generally found work in mines in their new places of settlement or put their mining skills to use digging tunnels for rapidly growing railway networks jobs traditionally done by bal maidens where they still existed were usually done by locally recruited men or boys and tradition of female cornish mine labour died out in emigrant families while a few former bal maidens found alternative employment at local factories and large numbers emigrated unemployment situation in cornwall remained bad as early as 1860s charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants and as textile industry of north of england boomed a concerted effort was made to recruit cornish women to work in mills large numbers of women took up these offers 1891 census showed 17 757 cornish women living in devon majority working in domestic service 10 005 in london and surrounding suburbs of middlesex and 4 439 in lancashire in addition towns growing around newly discovered mines of south australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit cornish women right thumb ruins of dolcoath 85 years after mine s closure alt ruined and overgrown stone building with a tall stone chimney by end of first world war most of more complicated tasks in remaining mines had been mechanised and those bal maidens who remained in work were restricted to simple manual labour of physically moving ore spalling and overseeing buddling frames a successful 1919 workers union campaign for a minimum 30s per week wage in industry virtually doubled wages of few remaining bal maidens in cornwall those at dolcoath were made redundant within weeks of this increase dolcoath last mine in cornwall to employ traditional bal maidens closed in 1921 bringing centuries old tradition to an end end of use of bal maidens did not mean end of female workers in those mines that survived women continued to work in administrative roles until final collapse of cornish mining industry in late 20th century after closures during second world war britain suffered severe shortages of raw materials while consideration was given to reopening closed mines this was not deemed viable and instead few remaining mines increased their production as many male workers were away on military service some women were briefly employed in tin picking at geevor and in ore dressing at great rock iron mine on dartmoor during and after war until around 1952 other than a very limited number of female workers after sex discrimination act 1975 ended policy of recruiting only men for underground work in few surviving mines geevor pickers were last female manual labourers in cornish mining industry minnie
