slayer season eight titled after these messages we ll be right back buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at sunnydale high cordelia s physical appearance is based on art style of loeb and whedon s unproduced buffy animated series conception and casting cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to series main character buffy summers adapting concept of movie into a television series whedon decided to reinvent character of buffy shallow cheerleader of 1992 buffy film as played by kristy swanson had grown more mature and open minded buffy now identified with social outcasts such as willow and xander as a result cordelia chase was created to embody traits of that shallower buffy despite portraying a shallow valley girl stock character actress charisma carpenter felt that cordelia in early seasons was not one dimensional nor was she as superficial as people thought at same time carpenter was critical of her frequent role as damsel in distress angel co creator and executive producer david greenwalt describes cordelia in her buffy years as a somewhat shallow somewhat vain somewhat self centered but a lively and honest character who spoke her mind indeed even not when superhuman she showed a lot of hardiness charisma carpenter had originally planned to read for role of buffy but was late for her audition and instead tried out for cordelia carpenter who had dressed casually for role of buffy who she believed could really be herself felt unprepared to read for cordelia because she was definitely a character to dress for although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for character producers were really responsive to carpenter s audition and she left feeling confident she had got part after carpenter s audition actress sarah michelle gellar who had been offered role of cordelia before carpenter was asked to come back and audition for part of buffy bianca lawson originally won role of cordelia chase but turned it down due to other contractual obligations lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer kendra in show s second season carpenter proud of her own character s growth across two series did not envy gellar for winning role of buffy over her bbc cult interviews charisma carpenter better than being buffy bbc cult section characterization characteristics and analysis cordelia s representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in buffy has been commented on in several academic texts particularly in gender studies such as praising cordelia aggression and adaptation among adolescent girls or sex and slayer in latter dr lorna jowett of university of northampton describes cordelia s initial place in series where at first glance cordelia seems to have normal life buffy often longs for she is a familiar character from teen drama popular a cheerleader center of cliques power as status furthermore cordelia s exceptionalism is based on real material privilege rather than supernatural power she represents in more exaggerated form unnamed white middle class heterosexual qualities read privilege of other characters to point that it becomes visible elizabeth rambo notes how cordelia s status is highlighted by her nickname queen c and harmony s remark to her cordy you reign cordelia functions recognizably as typical female victim of horror often screaming and running away and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters praising cordelia argues that both buffy and cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women who represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls article focuses on competitive relationship between characters buffy s initial friendship with cordelia is compromised once cordelia sees attractive socially competent buffy as a threat to her even after cordelia joins scooby gang and becomes buffy s friend theirs is not a friendship of mutual support warmth and intimacy but rather one of mutual antipathy authors opine that cordelia unlike buffy is a representation of archetypal feminine type one who conforms to pervasive stereotypes of femininity while at same time dominating other girls in school and commanding attention of boys describing her character arc in buffy mary alice money views cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed buffy characters one who reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits money mary alice of supporting characters in buffy ed rhonda v wilcox and david lavery rowman littlefield 2000 pp 98 107 jowett argues that cordelia s assimilation within main group is due largely to her relationship with main character xander and she is rendered sympathetic to audience once they witness her rebuff peer pressure from her old friends she is further endeared to viewer when xander betrays her because scenes showing her pain are shown only to viewer after cordelia is cheated on by xander with willow she chooses not to go back to him and instead retains her autonomy others such as susanne kord and elisabeth note how cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes describing although superficially cordelia conforms to stereotype of insensitive bitch what she actually does is offers her viewers clandestine pleasures of female self assertion one of cordelia s strongest traits her honesty is also highlighted in earshot where buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear thoughts of her friends who avoid her to hide these thoughts for cordelia however her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical and because of this she embodies an antithesis of female self sacrifice in these years but also opposite of kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women susanne kord elisabeth vamp ire s and those who kill them hollywood divas indie queens and tv heroines rowman littlefield publishers inc december 28 2004 writer jennifer crusie interprets this as cordelia s lack of depth becoming her strength she does not mean to argue that cordelia is stupid however pointing out cordy s solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible crusie jennifer assassination of cordelia chase 187 97 jowett feels cordelia s confidence is based in her wealth despite becoming more sympathetic as series progressed enhances cordelia s comic appeal as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth telling development i provide conflict and that s what good drama needs charisma carpenter on her role in buffy vampire slayer in early seasons of buffy vampire slayer cordelia was often used both as comic relief and occasionally for damsel in distress plot device which would require series heroine buffy to save her any concerns that she was simply one dimensional were alleviated for actress when writers developed character through her relationships with xander and later wesley which led carpenter to become more convinced of her potential in an article about psychology of characters in buffy vampire slayer steven c writes about how cordelia is wealthy and at first glance superficial appearing to care most about her own popularity however as show progresses we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion she is a reluctant participant baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to unpopular xander he goes on to describe how cordelia and all characters of buffy vampire slayer are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes discussing cordelia s relationship with xander carpenter says a lot of cordy s conflict and a lot of who she is comes out around xander because she is in love with him in spite of herself or in spite of him i have my best moments with nicholas brendon however her character s growing involvement with buffy and her friends caused actress some concern i wasn t sure how i felt about it because i didn t want to lose my edge i didn t want her to be nice i didn t want her to change because that s who she is carpenter s challenge was to find a balance between good and bad sides of cordelia and she explains that s why i enjoy playing her so much she s got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her but i try not to lose her edge her honesty carpenter claims that cordelia s rough edges made for difficult experiences with fans who expected her to be snobby like her character charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire which writers let her do in her final buffy appearance graduation day part two over course of her appearances in angel cordelia would develop enormously as a character describing this evolution carpenter comments when i first started playing cordelia she wasn t nice she has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility she s a team player which was not case in beginning carpenter cherishes what playing a multi faceted character like cordelia meant for her as an actress describing road cordelia has traveled journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress because there have been so many chances to do so many different emotions heroic vulnerable just angry possessed funny i get to be all those different things rolled into one getting this role in hindsight god i made a good decision or they did cultural critic jennifer crusie points out how cordelia was initially perfect for transition to selfish superficial los angeles which turned out to be her trial by fire executive producer david greenwalt was very keen to acquire character of cordelia for spin off series commenting i desperately wanted her to come to angel because angel being dark and broody we need a big bright smile at same time whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in fourth season of buffy where all of our characters got to point where they were loving and hugging and it was sort of like where s cordelia leading him to introduce spike james marsters to cast to accommodate her absence buffy vampire slayer season four featurette kelly a manners describes cordelia as a rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to irs so in episode one of angel cordelia showed up in la trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail actually crusie states that in mourning for doyle cordelia also begins finding within herself a new level of humanity time and time again cordelia realize s what her calling truly is when cordelia gets pain of world and suffering that s out there she realize s just how important it is that she stay s doing this mission alongside angel charisma carpenter on cordelia s development in angel greenwalt discusses how cordelia is sort of forced to become a deeper character when she starts to receive visions of suffering and helpless she s sort of living with one foot in world of i want to be an actress and with another foot in world of i want to save and help people and i have a deeper purpose and mission greenwalt felt that this development allowed cordelia to develop from a high schooler to someone who s almost like a superhero this also provided carpenter with opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress from tenth episode parting gifts cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in series while introduction of wesley also contributes some added comic relief to series it is from this episode cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns death of doyle whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him first season finale saw cordelia s visions inflict all suffering of human world upon her and to effectively act this carpenter s acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation scene took over eight hours to film and carpenter was relieved when it was over experience saw cordelia further resolve to help those in need stating i saw world and there s so much pain we have to help them carpenter explains through suffering of world and through her own experiences she discovers what s important in life carpenter pleaded to producers to let her cut her hair in second season of angel but they were dissatisfied with darker tone and cut which created a dark edge of cordelia which wasn t as warm and effervescent as she usually is so for third season they wanted her to go shorter and blonder bbc cult interviews charisma carpenter a hairy problem bbc cult angels third season demonstrates cordelia s development into a full fledged heroine episode birthday saw her being offered chance to live a life where she never met angel but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half demon who can better withstand visions she carries in billy cordelia begins to train alongside angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly carpenter began to train extensively with show s stunt co both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry in episode waiting in wings both angel and lorne remark on what a fine woman cordelia has finally become with cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in sunnydale also in this episode she and angel both realize they have fallen for one another but their love goes unconsummated critically jennifer crusie considers cordelia s ascension to heavens at end of season three to be point that mutant enemy productions writers evidently lost their minds she goes on to describe how cordelia s compliance with skip seems entirely out of character jes battis also argues that a paradox is created when character who embraces her privilege cordelia gets to become a higher being and exit angel and as an overwhelmingly positive force where later fred amy acker character who is conflicted about her privilege in season five ends up being possessed by a millennia old demon demonic complex cordelia fred and illyria blood relations chosen families in buffy vampire slayer and angel angel season four played with audience s expectations of now heroic cordelia by revealing her to be season s big bad it was later established that cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called jasmine storyline was controversial with fans and carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed cordelia seduced angel s teenage son carpenter has said i m in denial about that whole storyline it was creepy she tried to keep a positive attitude about situation though director terrence o hara commented that he thought carpenter had a lot of fun playing a manipulative cordelia in episode orpheus because she enjoyed coming up with cordelia s new schizophrenic madwoman characterization david boreanaz was also unsettled by incestuous pairing at a 2004 convention he admitted that season four storyline freaked him out episode inside out saw height of this inversion of cordelia s character where she is seen urging connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite birth of child they conceived together in an effort to stop connor powers that be send spirit of connor s mother darla julie benz to convince him not to go through with it episode sees carpenter dressed in black while benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes voice of reason and morality steven s deknight who wrote and directed episode felt this was a brilliant role reversal for both actresses as carpenter is accustomed to playing benevolent cordelia where darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire much of season four s storyline had to be adjusted due to carpenter s real life pregnancy after cordelia gives birth to jasmine in episode inside out she is left in a coma for remainder of fourth season crusie discusses what she felt were flaws in execution of fourth season it s that she betrays man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely it s that she seduces a boy she once diapered it s that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a dynasty reject it s that she s not cordy and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into secret before beastmaster seduced connor becomes extended rape and death of a much beloved character matt hills and rebecca williams also discuss treatment of cordelia and darla in angel s monstrous mothers and vampires with soul investigating abject in television horror from reading angel tv spin off with a soul by stacey abbot they see send offs of cordelia fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered elaborated abjection seen in angel they also see cordelia s possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern more so than other characters in buffy and angel cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape either symbolically or literally and recounts demon impregnation in expecting and similarly in epiphany where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with groosalugg in through looking glass cordelia even remarks on this as hills and williams quote her as she remarks on her status as a violated and devalued character cordelia states if you ever figure out how to get us out of here i want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn t want to impregnate me with his spawn they liken horror motif in these examples and in inside out to what barbara creed called monstrous womb in her book monstrous feminine film feminism psychoanalysis hills matt and williams rebecca angel s monstrous mothers and vampires with soul investigating abject in television horror reading angel tv spin off with a soul ed stacy abbot i b tauris september 22 2005 pp 203 barbara woman as monstrous womb brood monstrous feminine film feminism psychoanalysis rowman littlefield publishers inc december 28 2004 pp 43 59 jes battis also comments how in comparison with fred illyria season five storyline cordelia s storyline is not as positive as fred s rebirth because fred got to live on through illyria whereas cordelia is taken right out of show and receives no interesting blue haired reincarnation continuing they say that in fact there is no meaningful connection between real cordelia and jasmine as cordelia who did those bad things is killed moment jasmine is and true cordy wakes up from her coma further illustrating comparisons fred illyria become a joined mother daughter subjectivity a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as healthy vibrant cordy that everyone knew pointing out symbolic parallels in subtexts of these gestations battis notes cordelia a vocal advocate of her own privilege creates a fully formed supernatural being jasmine who attempts shockingly to control world fred on other hand who her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness has her body devoured from inside by demon illyria for angel s fifth season as with buffy s fourth spike steps in to replace cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within series it is also noted by critics that in fifth season it doesn t take long for illyria to become a version of cordelia giving everyone cold and honest truth whether they want it or not concerning cordelia s last appearance in angels fifth and final season joss whedon says he used 100th episode to reinforce mission statement of show as well as assess where characters are now compared to how they began whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to through cordelia who was there at beginning ask of angel where are you now where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that return to show s original concerns is echoed by flashback to doyle s first season advertisement sara points out aerial images of los angeles reappear at same time cordelia tells angel you forgot who you are bringing back show s link to city buffy summers was originally intended to appear in 100th episode to get angel back on track but sarah michelle gellar had other obligations writer director david fury explains that since we couldn t get sarah episode was instead written for cordelia he adds this turned out to be a godsend because charisma was fantastic mike week 6 david fury com september 2004 in original script fury wrote a conversation between wesley and angel while driving to hospital that set up cordelia as a possible vegetable scene was never shot because shock of seeing her up and around after a 9 month coma was enough we just didn t want to tip it too soon says fury reception for her role as cordelia chase as she appeared in television
