atheism is in broadest sense an absence of belief in existence of deities less broadly atheism is a rejection of belief that any deities exist in an even narrower sense atheism is specifically position that there are no deities atheism is contrasted with theism which in its most general form is belief that at least one deity exists etymological root for word atheism originated before 5th century bce from ancient greek atheos meaning without god s in antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject gods worshiped by larger society those who were forsaken by gods or those who had no commitment to belief in gods term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed actual term atheism emerged first in 16th century with spread of freethought skeptical inquiry and subsequent increase in criticism of religion application of term narrowed in scope first individuals to identify themselves using word atheist lived in 18th century during age of enlightenment french revolution noted for its unprecedented atheism witnessed first major political movement in history to advocate for supremacy of human reason extract of page 22 arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence problem of evil argument from inconsistent revelations rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified and argument from nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities therefore they argue that burden of proof lies not on atheist to disprove existence of gods but on theist to provide a rationale for theism citing although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies e g secular humanism in there is no one ideology or code of conduct to which all atheists adhere since conceptions of atheism vary accurate estimations of current numbers of atheists are difficult according to global win gallup international studies 13 of respondents were convinced atheists in 2012 11 were convinced atheists in 2015 and in 2017 9 were convinced atheists however other researchers have advised caution with win gallup figures since other surveys which have used same wording for decades and have a bigger sample size have consistently reached lower figures an older survey by british broadcasting corporation bbc in 2004 recorded atheists as comprising 8 of world s population other older estimates have indicated that atheists comprise 2 of world s population while irreligious add a further 12 according to these polls europe and east asia are regions with highest rates of atheism in 2015 61 of people in china reported that they were atheists figures for a 2010 eurobarometer survey in european union eu reported that 20 of eu population claimed not to believe in any sort

not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief sizes in diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population writers disagree on how best to define and classify atheism contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely absence of one and whether it requires a conscious explicit rejection atheism has been regarded as compatible with agnosticism but has also been contrasted with it a variety of categories have been used to distinguish different forms of atheism range some of ambiguity and controversy involved in defining atheism arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for definitions of words like deity and god plurality of wildly different conceptions of god and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism s applicability ancient romans accused christians of being atheists for not worshiping pagan deities gradually this view fell into disfavor as theism came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity with respect to range of phenomena being rejected atheism may counter anything from existence of a deity to existence of any spiritual supernatural or transcendental concepts such as those of buddhism hinduism jainism and taoism implicit vs explicit definitions of atheism also vary in degree of consideration a person must put to idea of gods to be considered an atheist atheism has sometimes been defined to include simple absence of belief that any deities exist this broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas as far back as 1772 baron d holbach said that all children are born atheists they have no idea of god similarly george h smith 1979 suggested that man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god this category would also include child with conceptual capacity to grasp issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist implicit atheism is absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it and explicit atheism is conscious rejection of belief for purposes of his paper on philosophical atheism ernest nagel contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism reprinted in critiques of god edited by peter a angeles prometheus books 1997 graham oppy classifies as innocents those who never considered question because they lack any understanding of what a god is according to oppy these could be one month old babies humans with severe traumatic brain injuries or patients with advanced dementia positive vs negative philosophers such as antony flew in this interpretation an atheist becomes not someone who positively asserts non existence of god but someone who is simply not a theist let us for future ready reference introduce labels positive atheist for former and negative atheist for latter and michael martin have contrasted positive strong hard atheism with negative weak soft atheism positive atheism is explicit affirmation that gods do not exist negative atheism includes all other forms of non theism according to this categorization anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist terms weak and strong are relatively recent while terms negative and positive atheism are of older origin having been used in slightly different ways in philosophical literature and in catholic apologetics under this demarcation of atheism most agnostics qualify as negative atheists while martin for example asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a leap of faith common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven religious propositions deserve as much disbelief as all other unproven propositions who seriously claims we should say i neither believe nor disbelieve that pope is a robot or as to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant i am completely agnostic in absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims we rightly disbelieve them we don t just suspend judgement and that of a god s existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility a lack of proof is no grounds for suspension of belief this is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to alternatives australian philosopher j j c smart even argues that sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself even passionately as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps truths of mathematics and formal logic consequently some atheist authors such as richard dawkins prefer distinguishing theist agnostic and atheist positions along a spectrum of theistic probability likelihood that each assigns to statement god exists definition as impossible or impermanent before 18th century existence of god was so accepted in western world that even possibility of true atheism was questioned this is called theistic innatism notion that all people believe in god from birth within this view was connotation that atheists are simply in denial there is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in god in times of crisis that atheists make deathbed conversions or that there are no atheists in foxholes see for example there have however been examples to contrary among them examples of literal atheists in foxholes some atheists have challenged need for term atheism in his book letter to a christian nation sam harris wrote in fact atheism is a term that should not even exist no one ever needs to identify himself as a non astrologer or a non alchemist we do not have words for people who doubt that elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle atheism is nothing more than noises reasonable people make in presence of unjustified religious beliefs pragmatic atheism pragmatic atheism is view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a pragmatic life this view is related to apatheism and practical atheism arguments thumb paul henri thiry baron d holbach an 18th century advocate of atheism source of man s unhappiness is his ignorance of nature pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy which interweave themselves with his existence consequent prejudice that warps his mind that prevents its expansion that renders him slave of fiction appears to doom him to continual error paul henri thiry baron d holbach system of nature or laws of moral and physical world london 1797 vol 1 p 25 epistemological arguments atheists have also argued that people cannot know a god or prove existence of a god latter is called agnosticism which takes a variety of forms in philosophy of immanence divinity is inseparable from world itself including a person s mind and each person s consciousness is locked in subject according to this form of agnosticism this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence rationalistic agnosticism of kant and enlightenment only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle and therefore cannot be known to exist skepticism based on ideas of hume asserts that certainty about anything is impossible so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists hume however held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as sophistry and illusion allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed it can also be regarded as an independent basic worldview other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or ontological including ignosticism assert meaninglessness or of basic terms such as god and statements such as god is all powerful theological noncognitivism holds that statement god exists does not express a proposition but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless it has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism philosophers a j ayer and theodore m drange reject both categories stating that both camps accept god exists as a proposition they instead place noncognitivism in its own category drange theodore m 1998 atheism agnosticism noncognitivism internet infidels secular web library retrieved 2007 apr 07 ayer a j 1946 language truth

of evil david hume in his dialogues concerning natural religion 1779 cited epicurus in stating argument as a series of questions is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is impotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god logical arguments some atheists hold view that various conceptions of gods such as personal god of christianity are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities such atheists present deductive arguments against existence of god which assert incompatibility between certain traits such as perfection creator status immutability omniscience omnipresence omnipotence omnibenevolence transcendence personhood a personal being non physicality justice and mercy atheists believe that world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with qualities commonly ascribed to god and gods by theologians they argue that an omniscient omnipotent and god is not compatible with a world where there is evil and suffering and where divine love is hidden from many people a similar argument is attributed to siddhartha gautama founder of buddhism v a in jataka buddha argues that three most commonly given attributes of god viz omnipotence omniscience and benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually compatible with existential fact of dukkha accounts of religion philosopher ludwig ludwig 1841 essence of christianity and psychoanalyst sigmund freud have argued that god and other religious beliefs are human inventions created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs or a projection mechanism from id omnipotence for vladimir lenin in materialism and criticism against russian followers of ernst mach feuerbach was final argument against belief in a god this is also a view of many buddhists rahula what buddha taught grove press 1974 pp 51 52 karl marx and friedrich engels influenced by work of feuerbach argued that belief in god and religion are social functions used by those in power to oppress working class according to mikhail bakunin idea of god implies abdication of human reason and justice it is most decisive negation of human liberty and necessarily ends in enslavement of mankind in theory and practice he reversed voltaire s aphorism that if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him writing instead that if god really existed it would be necessary to abolish him atheism religions and spirituality atheism is not mutually exclusive with respect to some religious and spiritual belief systems including hinduism jainism buddhism raelism and neopagan movements such as wicca astika schools in hinduism hold atheism to be a valid path to moksha but extremely difficult for atheist cannot expect any help from divine on their journey jainism believes universe is eternal and has no need for a creator deity however tirthankaras are revered beings who can transcend space and time and have more power than god indra secular buddhism does not advocate belief in gods early buddhism was atheistic as gautama buddha s path involved no mention of gods later conceptions of buddhism consider buddha himself a god suggest adherents can attain godhood and revere bodhisattvas and eternal buddha atheism and negative theology theology is often assessed as being a version of atheism or agnosticism since it cannot say truly that god exists comparison is crude however for conventional atheism treats existence of god as a predicate that can be denied god is nonexistent whereas negative theology denies that god has predicates god or divine is without being able to attribute qualities about what he is would be prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism negative theology is a complement to not enemy of positive theology atheistic philosophies axiological or constructive atheism rejects existence of gods in favor of a higher absolute such as humanity this form of atheism favors humanity as absolute source of ethics and values and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to god marx and freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation full development and unfettered happiness one of most common criticisms of atheism has been to contrary that denying existence of a god either leads to moral relativism and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation or renders life meaningless and miserable perhaps most common criticism of atheism is claim that it leads inevitably to moral bankruptcy blaise pascal argued this view in his pensees pascal blaise 1669 pensees ii misery of man without god french philosopher jean paul sartre identified himself as a representative of an atheist existentialism concerned less with denying existence of god than with establishing that man needs to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself not even a valid proof of existence of god sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that if god does not exist there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept and this being is man practical consequence of this atheism was described by sartre as meaning that there are no a priori rules or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct and that humans are condemned to invent these for themselves making man absolutely responsible for everything he does religion and morality association with world views and social behaviors sociologist phil zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non belief and concluded that societal well being is positively correlated with irreligion he found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer less developed nations particularly in africa and south america than in richer industrialized democracies his findings relating specifically to atheism in us were that compared to religious people in us atheists and secular people are less nationalistic prejudiced antisemitic racist dogmatic ethnocentric closed minded and authoritarian and in us states with highest percentages of atheists murder rate is lower than average in most religious states murder rate is higher than average irreligion thumb left upright buddhism is sometimes described as because of absence of a creator god but that can be too simplistic a view thus in light of theoretical progression from to to primordial wisdom of absolute space of reality buddhism is not so simply non theistic as it may appear at first glance people who self identify as atheists are often assumed to be irreligious but some sects within major religions reject existence of a personal creator deity in recent years certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers such as atheistic or humanistic judaism and christian atheists strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity as such atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs for same reason atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs ranging from moral universalism of humanism which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans to moral nihilism which holds that morality is meaningless atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of hinduism jainism and buddhism philosophers such as slavoj zizek slavoj zizek less than nothing 2012 alain de botton alain de botton religion for atheists 2012 and alexander bard and jan soderqvist alexander bard and jan soderqvist global empire 2012 have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists divine command according to plato s dilemma role of gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary argument that morality must be derived from god and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate among many myths associated with religion none is more widespread or more disastrous in its effects than myth that moral values cannot be divorced from belief in a god in dostoevsky s brothers karamazov book eleven brother ivan fyodorovich chapter 4 there is famous argument that if there is no god all things are permitted but what will become of men then i asked him without god and immortal life all things are lawful then they can do what they like for kant presupposition of god soul and freedom was a practical concern for morality by itself constitutes a system but happiness does not unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality this however is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler reason compels us to admit such a ruler together with life in such a world which we must consider as future life or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams critique of pure reason moral precepts such as murder is wrong are seen as divine laws requiring a divine lawmaker and judge however many atheists argue that treating morality involves a false analogy and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in same way that laws do friedrich nietzsche believed in a morality independent of theistic belief and stated that morality based upon god has truth only if god is truth it stands or falls with faith in god for immanuel kant reason for adjusting to rules comes in its value as categorical imperatives that contain in itself reason to be fulfilled there exist normative ethical systems that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity some include virtue ethics social contract kantian ethics utilitarianism and objectivism sam harris has proposed that moral prescription ethical rule making is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy but that we can meaningfully practice a science of morality any such scientific system must nevertheless respond to criticism embodied in naturalistic fallacy philosophers susan neiman and julian baggini among others assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate morality of imperatives themselves to be able to discern for example that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one s religion instructs it and that atheists therefore have advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations contemporary british political philosopher martin cohen has offered more historically telling example of biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs rather than vice versa but also noted that same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers 101 ethical dilemmas 2nd edition by cohen m routledge 2007 pp 184 185 cohen notes particularly that plato and aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery cohen extends this argument in more detail in political philosophy from plato to mao where he argues that qur an played a role in perpetuating social codes from early 7th century despite changes in secular society political philosophy from plato to mao by cohen m second edition 2008 criticism of religion some prominent atheists most recently christopher hitchens daniel dennett sam harris and richard dawkins and following such thinkers as bertrand russell robert g ingersoll voltaire and novelist jose saramago have criticized religions citing harmful aspects of religious practices and doctrines thumb upright karl marx 19th century german political theorist and sociologist karl marx called religion sigh of oppressed creature heart of a heartless world and soul of soulless conditions it is opium of people he goes on to say abolition of religion as illusory happiness of people is demand for their real happiness to

decked out in smartest ideological costumes martin amis 2003 koba dread london vintage books pp 30 31 sam harris criticizes western religion s reliance on divine authority as lending itself to authoritarianism and dogmatism there is a correlation between religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests and authoritarianism dogmatism and prejudice see for example also see these arguments combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate dangers of religion such as crusades inquisitions witch trials and terrorist attacks have been used in response to claims of beneficial effects of belief in religion believers counter argue that some regimes that espouse atheism such as soviet union have also been guilty of mass murder in response to those claims atheists such as sam harris and richard dawkins have stated that stalin s atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic marxism and that while

ephesians on early 3rd century papyrus 46 it is usually translated into english as those who are without god word in any of its forms appears nowhere else in septuagint or new testament in early ancient greek adjective from privative a god meant godless it was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning or impious in 5th century bce word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in sense of severing relations with gods or denying gods term then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected local gods even if they believed in other gods modern translations of classical texts sometimes render as atheistic as an abstract noun there was also atheism cicero transliterated greek word into latin term found frequent use in debate between early christians and hellenists with each side attributing it in pejorative sense to other term atheist from fr in sense of one who denies existence of god or gods predates atheism in english being first found as early as 1566 and again in 1571 rendered as translated from latin atheist as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as 1577 term atheism was derived from french and appears in english about 1587 rendered as an earlier work from about 1534 used term atheonism oxford english dictionary also records an earlier irregular formation atheonism dated from about 1534 later and now obsolete words and are dated to 1611 and 1612 respectively related words emerged later deist in 1621 theist in 1662 deism in 1675 and theism in 1678 secondly that nothing out of nothing

theism than it does against atheism cudworth ralph true intellectual system of universe 1678 chapter v section ii p 73 at that time deist and deism already carried their modern meaning term theism came to be contrasted with deism karen armstrong writes that during sixteenth and seventeenth centuries word atheist was still reserved exclusively for polemic term atheist was an insult nobody would have dreamed of calling himself an atheist atheism was first used to describe a self avowed belief in late 18th century europe specifically denoting disbelief in monotheistic abrahamic god in part because of its wide use in monotheistic western society atheism is usually described as disbelief in god rather than more generally as disbelief in deities a clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions but some archaic uses of atheism encompassed only disbelief in singular god not in polytheistic deities it is on this basis that obsolete term was coined in late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities in 20th century globalization contributed to expansion of term to refer to disbelief in all deities though it remains common in western society to describe atheism as simply disbelief in god history while earliest found usage of term atheism is in 16th century france ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are

philosophical carvaka or school that originated in india around 6th century bce is probably most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in india similar to greek school this branch of indian philosophy is classified as heterodox due to its rejection of authority of vedas and hence is not considered part of six orthodox schools of hinduism but it is noteworthy as evidence of a

inquisition metaphysics and theology were dominant interests pertaining to religion there were however movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of christian god including differing views of nature transcendence and of god individuals and groups such as johannes scotus eriugena david of dinant amalric of bena and brethren of free spirit maintained christian viewpoints with pantheistic tendencies nicholas of cusa held to a form of he called ignorantia learned ignorance asserting that god is beyond human categorization and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture william of ockham inspired anti metaphysical tendencies with his limitation of human knowledge to singular objects and asserted that divine essence could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect followers of ockham such as john of and nicholas of furthered this view resulting division between faith and reason influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as john wycliffe jan hus and martin luther renaissance did much to expand scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry individuals such as leonardo da vinci sought experimentation as a means of explanation and opposed arguments from religious authority other critics of religion and church during this time included niccolo machiavelli bonaventure des periers michel de montaigne and francois
