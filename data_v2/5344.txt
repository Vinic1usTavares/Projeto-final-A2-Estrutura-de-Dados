siege of fort stanwix also known at time as fort schuyler began on august 2 1777 and ended august 22 fort stanwix in western part of mohawk river valley was then primary defense point for continental army against british and indian forces aligned against them in american revolutionary war fort was occupied by continental army forces from new york and massachusetts under command of colonel peter gansevoort besieging force was composed of british regulars american loyalists hessian soldiers from hesse hanau and indians under command of british brigadier general barry st leger and iroquois leader joseph brant st leger s expedition was a diversion in support of general john burgoyne s campaign to gain control of hudson river valley to east one attempt at relief was thwarted early in siege when a force of new york militia under nicholas herkimer was stopped in august 6 battle of oriskany by a detachment of st leger s forces while that battle did not involve fort s garrison some of its occupants sortied and raided nearly empty indian and loyalist camps which was a blow to morale of st leger s indian support they killed some seneca siege was finally broken when american reinforcements under command of benedict arnold neared and arnold used a ruse with assistance of herkimer s relative hon yost schuyler to convince besiegers that a much larger force was arriving this misinformation combined with departure of indian fighters not interested in siege warfare and upset over their losses from raids led st leger to abandon effort and retreat st leger s failure to advance on albany contributed to burgoyne s surrender following battles of saratoga in october 1777 although st leger reached fort ticonderoga in late september he was too late to aid burgoyne first official us flag was flown during battle on august 3 1777 at fort schuyler continental congress adopted following resolution on june 14 1777 resolved that flag of united states be thirteen stripes alternate red and white that union be thirteen stars white on a blue field representing a new constellation there was a delay in displaying this flag resolution was not signed by secretary of congress until september 3 though it was previously printed in newspapers massachusetts reinforcements to fort schuyler brought news of adoption by congress of official flag soldiers cut up their shirts to make white stripes scarlet material was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers wives while material for blue union was secured from capt abraham swartwout s blue cloth coat a voucher shows

supplies were en route to fort movement of his main force up wood creek from their landing on eastern shore of lake oneida had been blocked by stanwix defenders just a week earlier by felling trees

arrival at fort on august 2 was too late luzader 2008 p 127 supply convoy which was guarded by 200 men from 9th massachusetts regiment had arrived and been unloaded brant s men were able to capture

this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by general burgoyne gansevoort refused to respond st leger then began siege operations encamping regulars and artillery on a low rise north of fort and most of indians and loyalists to its south nickerson 1967 p 200 with a picket line of indian encampments along mohawk river scott 1927 p 179 thumb left 300px a 1777 map depicting troop placements in siege st leger s artillery was held up by a tactic that was also used to slow down burgoyne s army after fall of ticonderoga gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across wooded track expedition came down and st leger needed to clear track to make way for his artillery this work occupied all but 250 of st leger s white men with actual encirclement of fort dominated by indians on august 5 st leger received word from joseph brant s sister molly that an american relief column was marching up mohawk valley oriskany tryon county committee of safety received news of st leger s movements on july 30 and set about raising additional troops on august 4 about 800 men from tryon county militia were mustered at fort dayton near modern herkimer new york by nicholas herkimer committee chairman pancake 1977 p 142 by late next day column had arrived within of fort stanwix st leger on learning of their approach sent johnson with a small number of regulars and rangers along with brant and most of indians to oppose herkimer s advance pancake 1977 p 143 they set up an ambush and in a bloody confrontation near oriskany creek both sides suffered significant casualties including herkimer who suffered a serious wound to leg americans drove st leger s detachment back but herkimer who eventually died of his wounds was forced to retreat back to fort dayton due to large number of casualties confrontation came at another cost to st leger gansevoort s besieged men took advantage of absence of a sizable part of st leger s force to make a sortie in which gansevoort s second in command marinus willett led 250 men out and looted nearly empty indian camps of several wagon loads of spoils pancake 1977 p 144 including john johnson s orderly book plans for expedition and a letter british had intercepted from gansevoort s fiancee watt 2002 p 196 tale of this party recovering actual wagonloads of materials is probably untrue it likely dates to a memoir by marinus willett written late in his life no contemporaneous accounts of sortie including willett s earlier journals mention need for wagons scott 1927 p 195 thumb right 100px 19th century illustration of joseph brant when british force returned from oriskany they arrived at a camp that had been stripped of much including personal belongings and blankets indians slept in combined with fact that battle at oriskany had cost so many indian lives this greatly upset indians they had been told that white men who had thus far fought relatively little would do most of fighting nickerson 1967 pp 269 270 this breach of trust damaged relations between indians and st leger and became instrumental in eventual failure of siege pancake 1977 p 145 st leger took advantage of his victory to deliver another demand for fort s surrender which gansevoort also rejected next day st leger sent in a third surrender demand which included false news that burgoyne was in albany as well as threats that indians would be permitted to massacre garrison and destroy mohawk valley communities from which garrison was drawn nickerson 1967 p 270 in an eloquent refusal lieutenant colonel willett responded by your uniform you are british officers therefore let me tell you that message you have brought is a degrading one for a british officer to send and by no means reputable for a british officer to carry nickerson 1967 p 271 taking advantage of a brief truce gansevoort sent willett and another officer out on august 8 to notify schuyler of their situation watt 2002 p 208 after making their way through

reached hudson river nickerson 1967 p 211 amid concerns that withdrawal from ticonderoga by general arthur st clair would be repeated at stanwix council decided with near unanimity not to send a relief column to fort stanwix in opposition to council schuyler insisted on a relief expedition which arnold offered to lead nickerson 1967 p 212 in addition to schuyler s actions major general israel putnam based in peekskill new york on august 14 dispatched two regiments 1st canadian and 2nd new york which were already on guard duty in mohawk river valley these two units were still en route when siege was lifted and turned back scott 1927 pp 267 292 by august 20 arnold willett and 700 continental army regulars had arrived at fort dayton scott 1927 p 269 in an attempt to enlarge his force arnold tried to interest tryon county men in another attempt against st leger but raised only about 100 men he then decided to wait hoping that friendly oneidas and tuscaroras could be convinced to join effort or that a request to schuyler for another 1 000 men would be fulfilled however news reached him that siege had reached a critical stage and that action was necessary st leger had learned that his guns were largely ineffective against fort s walls from long range so he began entrenching operations to establish positions closer to fort gansevoort reported that siege trenches had reached within striking distance of one of fort s bastions nickerson 1967 p 272 thumb left 100px upright a 1776 mezzotint of benedict arnold uncomfortable with number of troops available to him arnold opted for a deception to sow trouble in british camp while at fort dayton a number of loyalists had been arrested including hon yost schuyler arnold convinced hon yost a member of king s royal regiment of new york who grew up with many of mohawk indians attacking fort stanwix watt 2002 p 224 258 to spread rumors that large numbers of americans under command of dark eagle were about to descend on st leger s camp hon yost s good conduct was assured by holding hostage his brother nickerson 1967 p 273 arnold s stratagem seems to have met with some success st leger recorded on august 21 that arnold was advancing by rapid and forced marches with 3 000 men scott 1927 p 281 even though arnold was still at fort dayton on that day scott 1927 p 282 when st leger held a council about 200 indians had already abandoned camp and in council remaining indians unhappy with siege warfare and loss of their equipment threatened to leave if he did not lift siege on august 22 st leger broke camp and began trek back to lake ontario leaving behind a sizable amount of equipment a number of men from st leger s party deserted or were captured by fort s garrison including hon yost watt 2002 p 258 aftermath arnold whose force was augmented by arrival of friendly indians advanced about toward fort stanwix on august 23 when a messenger from gansevoort notified him of st leger s departure pushing on they reached fort that evening early next day arnold detached 500 men to pursue st leger whose column was also being taunted and harassed by his formerly supportive indian allies an advance party reached shores of oneida lake in heavy rain just as last of st leger s boats were departing watt 2002 pp 260 261 leaving a garrison at fort with smaller outposts along mohawk arnold then hurried back with about 1 200 men to rejoin main army nickerson 1967 p 275 while still on oneida lake st leger learned from an indian messenger of true state of arnold s force watt 2002 p 262 on august 27 st leger wrote to burgoyne from oswego that he intended to join him by traveling via lake champlain nickerson 1967 p 276 he reached fort ticonderoga on september 29 too late to assist burgoyne nickerson 1967 p 354 355 burgoyne blamed failure of his campaign in part on st leger s failure to penetrate mohawk valley and lack of sufficient loyalist support he believed that a well placed loyalist uprising in upstate new york would have diverted enough american resources that either his advance or st leger s would have succeeded scott 1927 p 300 he was also hopeful that st leger s arrival at ticonderoga would be sufficient to assist in his retreat however he was already surrounded by time st leger arrived at ticonderoga and surrendered after battle of bemis heights second saratoga ketchum 1997 pp 423 425 in an analysis after surrender burgoyne noted that failure of general william howe to support him made it possible for washington to divert resources from area around new york city to assist both in relief of stanwix and at saratoga scott 1927 pp 306 307 fort stanwix itself saw little action after siege although it was a dangerous and unpopular posting because of regular harassment by loyalists and hostile indians watt 2002 p 313 in spring of 1779 continental army used fort as a staging ground for destruction of onondaga castle glatthaar 2006 pp 241 244 in 1780 garrison was
