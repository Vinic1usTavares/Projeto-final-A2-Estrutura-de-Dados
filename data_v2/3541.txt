humphrey vi had already served as deputy constable of england under humphrey iv cokayne 1910 59 pp 463 6 humphrey iv had reserved honour of pleshey for his younger son henry but remainder of his lands went to humphrey vi inheritance humphrey vi addition to land in essex and wiltshire from humphrey iv also consisted of significant holdings in welsh marches from his mother morris 1901 p 21 his mother eleanor was a daughter and coheir of william de braose and his wife eva marshal who in turn was daughter and coheir of william marshal regent to henry iii since humphrey vi was only sixteen years old at time of his father s death braose lands were taken into king s custody until 1270 part of this inheritance marcher lordship of brecon was in meanwhile given to custody of gilbert de clare earl of hertford humphrey technically regained his lordship from clare in 1270 but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by welsh prince llywelyn ap gruffudd who had taken advantage of previous decade s political chaos in england to extend his territory into marches morris 1901 p 112 he granted his brother sir gilbert de bohun all of their mother s lands in ireland and some land in england and wales welsh wars over next years much of hereford s focus was on reconquering his lost lands in marches primarily through private warfare against llywelyn davies 2000 pp 322 3 henry iii died in 1272 while his edward iwas crusading edward did not return until 1274 powicke 1952 pp 225 6 llywelyn refused to pay homage to new king partly because of military actions of bohun and other marcher lords which llywelyn saw as violations of treaty of montgomery prestwich 1997 pp 174 5 on 12 november 1276 hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on llewelyn and in 1277 edward i declared war on welsh prince powicke 1952 p 408 rebellion in his own brecon lands delayed hereford s participation in early days of welsh war he managed however to both suppress rebellion and conquer lands further west morris 1901 p 171 he then joined up with royal army and served for a while in anglesey before returning to brecon where he received surrender of certain welsh lords morris 1901 pp 178 9 194 after campaign was over on 2 january 1278 he received protection from king edward to go on pilgrimage to santiago de compostela in spain in 1282 war with wales broke out again this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign but a full scale war of conquest prestwich 1997 p 188 initially king wanted to fight war with paid forces but nobility insisted on use of feudal summons to men like hereford this was preferable because as part of a feudal army participants would have both a stake in war and a justifiable claim on conquered land in end although earls won none of them were paid for war effort prestwich 1972 pp 71 3 hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary constable of england and protested vigorously when gilbert de clare earl of gloucester was appointed commander of forces in south wales prestwich 1972 p 72 in post war settlement however neither hereford nor gloucester received any significant rewards of land way several other magnates did prestwich 1997 p 204 hereford fought again in wales in suppression of rebellion of 1294 95 when he again had to pacify territory of brecon before joining king in north morris 1901 p 256 private war in marches thumb upright left historic county of brecknockshire which corresponds roughly to hereford s lordship of brecon bulk together with lordship of northwest corner parallel with welsh wars hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in marches against other marcher lords in 1284 edward i granted hundred of in carmarthenshire to john giffard hereford believed land belonged to him by right of conquest and started a campaign to win lands back but king took giffard s side morris 1901 pp 201 2 problems also arose with earl of gloucester as gloucester s former ward hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage but gloucester claimed he had not received full sum there was also remaining resentment on hereford s part for his subordination to gloucester in 1282 83 campaign conflict came to a head when gloucester s started construction of a castle at morlais which hereford claimed was his land prestwich 2007 p 136 in 1286 crown ordered gloucester to cease but to no avail prestwich 1997 p 348 it had long been established marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare hereford s problem however was his relative weakness in marches and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies he therefore decided to take issue to king instead in a break with tradition king edward again ordered gloucester to stop but earl ignored order and initiated raids on hereford s lands morris 1901 p 226 hostilities continued and hereford responded until both earls were arrested and brought before king carpenter 2003 p 478 real offense was not private warfare in itself but fact that earls had not respected king s injunction to cease in parliament of january 1292 gloucester was fined 10 000 marks and hereford 1 000 gloucester s liberty of glamorgan was declared forfeit and confiscated by crown as was hereford s of brecon powicke 1952 p 350 in end fines were never paid and lands were soon restored edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point after conquest of wales strategic position of marcher lordships was less vital to english crown and liberty awarded to marcher lords could be curtailed for edward this was therefore a good opportunity to assert royal prerogative and to demonstrate that it extended also into marches of wales davies 1978 pp 259 60 255 7 opposition to edward i in 1294 french king declared english duchy of aquitaine forfeit and war broke out between two countries prestwich 1997 pp 378 9 edward i embarked on a wide scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on continent and preparing an invasion prestwich 1997 pp 387 8 when king at parliament of march 1297 in salisbury demanded military service from his earls roger bigod earl of norfolk refused in his capacity of marshal of england argument was that king s subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in company of king but edward insisted on taking his army to flanders while sending his earls to gascony powicke 1952 pp 666 678 thumb 200px bohun and bigod confront king edward early 20th century imaginary illustration at time of salisbury parliament hereford was accompanying two of king s daughters to brabant and could not be present powicke 1952 p 680 n on his return however as constable of england he joined bigod in july in refusing to perform feudal service two earls were joined in their opposition by earls of arundel and warwick prestwich 1997 p 419 main reasons for magnates defiance was heavy burden of taxation caused by edward s continuous warfare in wales france and scotland in this they were also joined by robert winchelsey archbishop of canterbury who was in midst of an ongoing dispute with king over clerical taxation prestwich 1997 p 420 at one point bohun and bigod turned up in person at exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have consent of community of realm carpenter 2003 p 485 for hereford there was also a personal element in opposition to king after humiliation and affront to his liberties he had suffered over dispute in marches morris 2008 p 297 morris 1901 pp 274 5 at a meeting just outside london bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to king s abuse of power and demanding restoration of ancient liberties grievances were summarised in a document known as remonstrances prestwich 1997 pp 420 1 neither party showed any inclination to back down and nation seemed on brink of another civil war davies 1978 p 269 just as conflict was coming to a head however external events intervened to settle it in september 1297 english suffered a heavy defeat to scots at battle of stirling bridge morris 1901 p 283 scottish victory exposed north of england to scottish raids led by william wallace war with scotland received wider support from english magnates now that their own homeland was threatened than did war in france to protect king s continental possessions prestwich 2007 p 170 edward abandoned his campaign in france and negotiated a truce with french king he agreed to confirm magna carta in so called confirmatio cartarum confirmation of charters prestwich 1997 pp 427 8 earls consequently consented to serve with king in scotland and hereford was in army that won a decisive victory over scots in battle of falkirk in 1298 hereford not satisfied that king had upheld charter withdrew after battle forcing edward to abandon campaign death and family thumb earthwork remains of pleshey castle where humphrey de bohun died in 1275 bohun married maud de fiennes daughter of enguerrand de fiennes chevalier

titles on 16 february 1299 young humphrey also inherited his father s title of constable of england morris 1901 p 300 a common theme in humphrey de bohun s actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges his career was marked by turbulence and political strife particularly in marches of wales but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there in 1297 at height of conflict between edward i and rebellious barons king had actively tried to undermine hereford s authority in marches but failed due to good relations earl enjoyed with local men davies 1978
