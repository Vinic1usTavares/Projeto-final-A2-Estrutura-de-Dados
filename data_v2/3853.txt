time due to heavy traffic courtney continued to hold pole position until carbone took it with a time of 2 minutes and 13 016 seconds late on and kept it until qualifying ended however carbone s session ended early as he pushed too hard trying to improve his time and spun into san francisco bend corner wall briscoe pushed hard and joined carbone on grid s front row despite having a wishbone on his suspension replaced after he spun into an barrier at fisherman s bend early on courtney fell to third and he attributed this to a gear ratio change which lost him some acceleration lapierre improved to fourth while kaffer fell to fifth antinucci was another driver to improve his best time and gained five places to qualify sixth despite going off at lisboa turn rosberg clipped an wall at police bend but set a seventh place lap kataoka was eighth and montin ninth doornbos had an accident at lisboa corner and fell five places to round out top ten behind him rest of field lined up as

race in shortest amount of time leg 1 left thumb upright ryan briscoe pictured in 2009 took lead from carbone entering reservoir bend turn but lost it when he went wide at lisboa corner and failed to return to top three first leg of race began under overcast but dry weather conditions at 09 15 macau standard time utc 08 00 on 16 november on formation lap one of piquet s tyres shredded as he went up moorish hill it then detached and piquet also shattered his front wing piquet stopped in pit lane and ran to grid to seek a mechanic from his team repairs could not be completed before start briscoe made a brisk getaway to drew alongside pole sitter carbone around inside going into reservoir bend corner briscoe took lead after a touch of wheels with carbone however briscoe kept lead for a short while as he carried too much speed approaching lisboa turn and ran wide allowing carbone to retake first lapierre and courtney took advantage of situation to claim second and third from briscoe further down order kaffer tried to pass montin around inside but clipped an barrier on outside as kaffer ricocheted across track rosberg rolled over one of stricken vehicles and rested upside down on circuit parente also got caught up in incident and retired watts then picked up front wing damage but returned to pit lane for a replacement nose cone before retiring a lap later because of wreckage safety car was deployed to enable extraction of all stricken cars via a crane and it remained on circuit until start of third lap lapierre immediately mounted a challenge on his teammate carbone it led to carbone s right side front wing endplate breaking and launching into air lapierre consequently became new leader as he passed carbone into lisboa corner and courtney followed soon after carbone then dropped behind briscoe who moved to fourth and he came under attack from antinucci in meantime austin gained most places and was now 13th after starting 25th upfront lapierre withstood pressure from courtney and responded by setting what was at that point race s fastest lap a circuit of two minutes and 15 704 seconds on fifth lap this however did not disconcert courtney and he overtook lapierre around outside at lisboa corner for lead on lap six meanwhile kataoka moved up order as he passed doornbos while hamilton overtook kubica both gained another position on seventh lap when a frustrated briscoe collided with carbone in an attempt to pass for third due to carbone braking earlier at lisboa corner and spun carbone continued but briscoe was stuck in lisboa turn s escape road where he was trying to restart his car and antinucci moved into third kataoka was now duelling carbone but made an error in traffic when he tried to overtake him entering lisboa turn it meant kataoka had to abandon duel and went onto escape road to avoid piling into carbone was now pressured by hamilton who overtook doornbos on lap nine but re passed him at lisboa corner on final lap before doornbos drive shaft broke and relinquished positions courtney extended his advantage to win by 4 6 seconds and started second leg from pole position he was joined on grid s front row by lapierre and antinucci was third last of finishers were carbone hamilton kubica fauzy thompson quintarelli hiranaka austin viso yoshimoto doornbos briscoe ho bonanomi lei merszei and barral other retirements included campanico kataoka and piquet who damaged their cars through collisions with an wall lining track leg 2 race s second leg started later that day at 15 55 local time under cloudy but dry weather conditions yoshimoto removed his front wing and it was replaced before second leg began courtney held lead going into reservoir bend corner with lapierre close by hamilton moved to third but could not advance any further as he was caught up in a multi car accident hamilton was slow leaving turn as kubica challenged him on inside approaching san francisco bend kubica went into an wall and ricocheted into incoming field then drifted into an wall and his front wing broke hamilton s front track rod antinucci s teammate thompson also went into a barrier incidents necessitated safety car s deployment for two laps as track marshals were required to remove wrecked cars courtney remained first at restart followed by lapierre and fended off a series of initial attacks from him for lead under safety car hamilton noticed he had a punctured tyre from contact with antinucci he allowed carbone through just before start finish line to make puncture known to race officials he retired in pit lane at end of lap three meanwhile viso retired on lap with car damage caused by debris thumb upright nicolas lapierre pictured in 2007 won grand prix overall after james courtney picked up a puncture that put him into wall at melco hairpin on lap eleven lapierre was underneath rear of courtney s car as they entered melco hairpin each time courtney pulled out a small advantage on circuit s straights due to a more powerful engine than lapierre s this proved so until lapierre drew closer to courtney by setting race s fastest lap and courtney responded by doing same lap after lap it provided courtney with a small lead and he negated slipstream effect that lapierre would have had if he was close by in meantime carbone incurred a drive through penalty for a pass on hamilton before start finish line it was rescinded when race officials realised hamilton s puncture prevented carbone from backing out of manoeuvre carbone responded by lapping faster than top two but lapierre reacted almost immediately and again began to draw closer to courtney lapierre was soon close enough to attempt an overtake entering lisboa turn but courtney blocked manoeuvre further back an oil leak forced parente to retire in pit lane on lap seven meanwhile austin lost part of his front wing and led a train of cars that included rosberg who sought a way past but piquet was close by piquet then stopped attacking allowing rosberg to focus on austin he drew alongside austin only for him to come back before latter lost duel and made a pit stop for a new front wing upfront courtney focused on increasing his lead by recording weekend s fastest lap completing a circuit in two minutes and 12 937 seconds on tenth lap and it appeared he would win race comfortably however on lap eleven courtney was two seconds in front of lapierre when a stray chunk of carbon fibre debris lying on circuit from an earlier incident punctured his right rear tyre that rendered courtney unable to steer and he crashed against a barrier leaving melco hairpin courtney s front right suspension was torn from his vehicle and its bodywork damaged although courtney was unhurt lapierre took lead kaffer was hassling kataoka for sixth but this became fifth when doornbos gearbox failed on lap fourteen doornbos retirement promoted hiranaka to third while kaffer overtook kataoka for fifth on final lap kataoka retired due to a crash into an wall alongside circuit on his maiden appearance in macau it was lapierre s overall victory completing second leg in a time of 37 minutes and 0 078 seconds and achieving first win for a rookie in macau since david coulthard 1991 edition lapierre was 5 416 seconds in front of his teammate carbone in second and hiranaka completed outright podium in third off podium
