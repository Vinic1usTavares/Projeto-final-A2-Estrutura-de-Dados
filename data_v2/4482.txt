covenant are a theocratic military alliance of alien races who serve as main antagonists in first trilogy of halo video game series they are composed of a variety of diverse species united under religious worship of forerunners and their belief that forerunner ringworlds known as halos will provide a path to salvation after covenant leadership high prophets declare humanity an affront to their gods claiming extermination of humanity is will of gods and we covenant are their gods instrument more advanced extraterrestrials subsequently prosecute a lengthy genocidal campaign against technologically inferior human race covenant were first introduced in 2001 video game halo combat evolved as enemies of playable character a human super soldier known as master chief not realizing halos were meant as weapons of destruction rather than salvation covenant attempt to activate rings on two separate occasions throughout series inadvertently releasing a virulent parasite known as flood in process to develop a distinctive look for various species of covenant bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian ursine and avian characteristics a covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate alien from human architecture covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated challenge they provided to players several critics lamented change of main enemies from elites to brutes in halo 3 and conversely praised their return in later halo reach game development like most of other characters and species in halo universe covenant were slowly developed during initial concept phase and refined as halo combat evolved progressed during course of development of halo designers decided upon three schools of architecture for each of races represented humans covenant and forerunners for covenant team decided on sleek and shiny with reflective surfaces organic shapes and use of purples trautmann 2004 86 like character designs covenant technology architecture and design continually changed throughout development occasionally for practical reasons as well as aesthetics trautmann 2004 98 according to eric arroyo covenant cruiser truth and reconciliation which plays a major role in halo combat evolved was to be boarded by player by a long ramp however due to technical considerations of having a fully textured ship so close to player designers came up with a gravity lift which allowed ship to be farther away thus not requiring as much processing power for detail as well as adding a visually interesting component of covenant technology trautmann 100 art team also spent a large amount of time on covenant weaponry in order to make them suitably alien yet still recognizable to players trautmann 2004 125 at same time designers wanted all aspects of covenant technology especially vehicles to act plausibly trautmann 143 bungie ended up looking at films and other media for inspiration on almost every aspect of race trautmann 2004 48 species thumb right covenant elites as they appeared early in halos development to design various species of covenant bungie s artists looked at live animals and films for inspiration trautmann 51 as a result species within covenant bear simian reptilian avian and ursine characteristics elites sangheili one of strongest and toughest foes and allies of games elites who are from sanghelios are called sangheili in fictitious covenant language they stand around and feature recharging personal shields elites initially had simple mouths which developed into pairs of split mandibles substituting for lower jaws bungie concept artist shi kai wang noted that project lead jason jones had at one point been insistent on giving elites a tail while wang thought it made aliens look too animalistic idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations including where tail would go when elites were driving vehicles at one point we considered just having elites tuck their tails forward between their legs wang noted but we abandoned that for obvious reasons according to paul russel when bungie was bought by microsoft and halo was turned into an xbox launch title microsoft took issue with design of elites as they felt that elites had a resemblance to cats that might alienate japanese consumers grunts unggoy among other races developed were grunts or unggoy from planet viewed in game s fiction as cannon fodder depicted as squat and cowardly fighters grunts generally break formation panicking and fleeing in terror if a player or an npc kills their commanding officer however they are also notable for attempting suicide runs against enemies on higher difficulties charging at their foe with a plasma grenade in each hand in an attempt to kill opponent and or themselves unggoy are intelligent having been industrialized before their induction into covenant novels halo fall of reach and halo flood described unggoy as dog like methane breathers they are stocky possessing both an arthropod like exoskeleton and a spinal based nervous system their powerful forearms evolved for climbing vertical terrain unggoy have methane suits that allow them to remove breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non methane atmosphere in halo reach if a player kills a unggoy in a particular way their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around area out of control causing damage if they hit player jackals and skirmishers kig yar jackals or kig yar from moon of orbiting chu ot carry energy shields or ranged weaponry shield or armor colors denotes rank of each caste in some cases such as with jackals overall design was honed once enemy s role was clearly defined trautmann 28 they look like bird like creatures or raptors this particular species did not come into covenant in same way as other species they work as mercenaries as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow religious beliefs like other species in halo book halo contact harvest it was revealed that jackals were first species in covenant to encounter humanity resulting events initiated start of human covenant war hunters mgalekgolo hunters or mgalekgolo from planet te are according to bungie s mythology collectives of worm like aliens singularly known as encased in tough armor bungie 2004 4 5 initial concepts were less humanoid looking and softer than final shape with angular shields and razor sharp spines trautmann 33 species are armed with a heavy fuel rod cannon and also carry a massive shield engineers huragok floating serene aliens known as engineers or huragok were pulled from combat evolved but made later appearances in halo novels they also appeared in halo wars halo 3 odst and halo reach they serve no actual combat role although in halo 3 odst halo wars and halo reach they can aid players or enemies they are actually artificial lifeforms created by vanished technologically superior race known as forerunners and are enslaved by covenant to build repair and maintain their technology huragok reproduce by assembling progeny out of stock materials prophets san shyuum prophets or san shyuum from planet serve as theocratic rulers of covenant and were primarily designed by shi kai wang and eric arroyo originally prophets were built in a more unified way with gravity thrones they used for floatation and movement fused with prophet s organic structures trautmann 55 characters were also designed to be feeble yet sinister three prophet hierarchs were each individually designed trautmann 56 brutes jiralhanae brutes from planet are one of new fighting forces that were added in halo 2 they were made physically taller stronger and hairier than elites with their society organized around tribal chieftains inspired by animators watching biker films brutes incorporated simian and ursine elements while retaining an alien look trautmann 37 wang s final concept for creature replete with bandoliers and human skulls was simplified for game trautmann 38 brutes were meant to typify abusive alien menace of covenant and in words of design lead jaime griesemer to serve as barbarians in rome for final installment in halo trilogy halo 3 designers had to refine covenant for move to more powerful xbox 360 hardware bungie was dissatisfied with brutes in halo 2 they were added in late in development resulting in brutes functioning merely as damage sponges and not interesting to fight their design was also limited being little more than hairy apes with a bandoleer reminiscent of star wars character chewbacca with elites leaving covenant in game s story brutes became player s main enemy necessitating radical changes in character s behavior and design for new look of brutes concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceros and gorillas designers added armor with buckles gauntlets and leather straps to bring them more in line with covenant aesthetic more seasoned brute more ornate clothing and helmets armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to species and emphasize their mass and power designs for halo 3 took cues from ancient greek spartans character animators recorded intended actions for new brutes in a padded room at bungie a new addition to brute artificial intelligence was a pack mentality leader brutes direct large scale actions simultaneously such as throwing grenades towards a player drones yanme e another addition to fighting force debuting in halo 2 were drones or yanme e from planet animators found creatures challenging as they had to be animated to walk run crawl or fly on multiple surfaces old concept art from combat evolved was re purposed in influencing drone s final shape which took cues from cockroaches grasshoppers and wasps society technologically covenant are described in flood and first strike to be imitative rather than innovative most of covenant s sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on forerunner artifacts rather than covenant s own research nylund 2003 101 covenant weapons are generally based on forerunner technology and utilize plasma these weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target bungie 2004 13 frank o connor bungie s former public relations head hinted that there may be something more to covenant s weaponry saying actual technology is not plasma as we know it but something far more dangerous arcane and destructive a few of covenant s weapons are not plasma based including needler which fires razor sharp pink needles capable of homing in on organic foes and exploding a weapons expert noted parallels between needler and ancient greek amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine electronic gaming monthly bungie designed majority of covenant technology to mirror aesthetic of elites exteriors are sleek and graceful with a more angular and complex core underneath hinting at fictional forerunner origins of technology de govia 60 in contrast to sleek elite based designs of covenant at large brutes were given their own visual design distinct from other covenant weaponry was designed to reflect brute s souls distilled to its purest form conveyed by dangerous shapes harsh colors and objects that looked dangerous to be around de govia 47 a unsc weapon designed for combat evolved in 1999 that was discarded at time was re purposed as brute s mauler weapon de govia 61 covenant society is a caste system composed of many races some of which were forcibly incorporated each race is required to provide a specific number of troops to remain within covenant in games races are identified by their common unsc designation their covenant names are supplied by halo 2 limited edition and halo 3 limited edition manuals and several novels appearances majority of events in story arc of halo series occur during ninth age of reclamation covenant s organization of time and dates is not elaborated on in detail in game or during any of novelizations bungie cinematic director joseph staten in an interview on halo fansite halo

wars 2 with a flashback of how betrayed them and formed banished reception reception of covenant as enemies in combat evolved was generally favorable ability to experience storyline of halo 2 from covenant perspective was described as a brilliant stroke of game design allowing player to assume role of an elite was described as providing an unexpected plot twist and allowing player to experience a newfound complexity to story in addition some reviewers thought that this provided series with a significant plot element ign referred to it as intriguing side story of arbiter and his elites and its elimination in halo 3 was pointed to as responsible for reducing role of arbiter within series plot in 2010 ign ranked covenant 26th in top 100 videogames villains notes references div id hgn
