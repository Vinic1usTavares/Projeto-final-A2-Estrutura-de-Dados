he was named bishop of elmham in 1043 and was later bishop of winchester and archbishop of canterbury stigand was an advisor to several members of anglo saxon and norman english royal dynasties serving six successive kings excommunicated by several popes for his pluralism in holding two sees or bishoprics of winchester and canterbury concurrently he was finally deposed in 1070 and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by william conqueror stigand was imprisoned at winchester where he died without regaining his liberty stigand served king cnut as a chaplain at a royal foundation at ashingdon in 1020 and as an advisor then and later he continued in his role of advisor during reigns of cnut s sons harold harefoot and harthacnut when cnut s stepson edward confessor succeeded harthacnut stigand in all probability became england s main administrator monastic writers of time accused stigand of extorting money and lands from church and by 1066 only estates richer than stigand s were royal estates and those of harold godwinson in 1043 edward appointed stigand to see of elmham four years later he was appointed to see of winchester and then in 1052 to archdiocese of canterbury which stigand held jointly with winchester five successive popes including nicholas ii and alexander ii excommunicated stigand for holding both winchester and canterbury stigand was present at deathbed of king edward and at coronation of harold godwinson as king of england in 1066 after harold s death stigand submitted to william conqueror on christmas day 1066 ealdred archbishop of york crowned william king of england stigand s excommunication meant that he could only assist at coronation despite growing pressure for his deposition stigand continued to attend royal court and to consecrate bishops until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at winchester his intransigence towards papacy was used as propaganda by norman advocates of view that english church was backward and needed reform early life neither year nor date of stigand s birth is known he was born in east anglia possibly in norwich barlow edward confessor p 59 to an apparently prosperous family of mixed english and scandinavian ancestry as is shown by fact that stigand s name was norse but his brother s was english his brother aethelmaer also a cleric later succeeded stigand as bishop of elmham his sister held land in norwich williams english and norman conquest p 46 but her given name is unrecorded stigand first appears in historical record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to king cnut of england reigned 1016 1035 in that year he was appointed to cnut s church at ashingdon or hill road to hastings p et al handbook of british chronology p cnut p 138 which was dedicated by reforming bishop wulfstan of york barlow english church 1000 1066 p 77 little is known of stigand s life during cnut s reign but he must have had a place at royal court as he witnessed occasional charters

died stigand became an advisor to emma of normandy cnut s widow and mother of harthacnut and his successor edward confessor he may have been emma s chaplain stafford queen emma and queen edith pp 112 113 and it is possible that stigand was already one of her advisors while cnut was alive and that he owed his position at ashingdon to emma s influence and favour because little is known of stigand s activities before his appointment as a bishop it is difficult to determine to whom he owed his position smith archbishop stigand anglo norman studies 16 p 200 bishop of elmham and winchester stigand was appointed to see of elmham shortly after edward confessor s coronation on 3 april 1043 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 29 probably on emma s advice barlow edward confessor p 76 this

he was consecrated bishop in 1043 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 217 but later that year edward deposed stigand and deprived him of his wealth during next year however edward returned stigand to office barlow edward confessor p 77 reasons for deposition are unknown but it was probably connected to simultaneous fall from power of dowager queen emma stafford queen emma and queen edith pp 248 250 some sources state that emma had invited king magnus i of norway a rival claimant to english throne to invade england and had offered her personal wealth to aid magnus stenton anglo saxon england p 426 some suspected that stigand had urged emma to support magnus and claimed that his deposition was because of this mason house of godwine p 44 contributing factors in emma and stigand s fall included emma s wealth and dislike of her political influence which was linked to reign of unpopular harthacnut stafford unification and conquest p 87 left thumb 350px emma of normandy

winchester after regaining edward s favour may also have influenced appointment either alone or in concert with godwin after his appointment to winchester stigand was a witness to all surviving charters of king edward during period 1047 to 1052 some historians such as frank barlow and emma mason state that stigand supported earl godwin in his quarrel with edward confessor in 1051 1052 barlow

aethelric a relative of earl godwin s as archbishop huscroft ruling england p 6 king edward opposed election and instead appointed robert of jumieges who was norman and already bishop of london besides furthering edward s quarrel with godwin appointment signalled that there were limits to edward s willingness to compromise on ecclesiastical reform although not known as a reformer before his appointment robert returned in 1051 from rome where he had gone to be confirmed by papacy and opposed king s choice for bishop of london on grounds that candidate was not suitable robert s attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by earl godwin contributed to quarrel between earl and king when godwin returned to england in 1052 robert was outlawed and exiled stafford unification and conquest pp 89 92 following which king edward appointed stigand to archbishopric fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 214 appointment was either a reward from godwin for stigand s support during conflict with edward or a reward from king edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to crisis in 1052 stigand was first non monk to be appointed to either english archbishopric since before days of dunstan archbishop from 959 to 988 knowles monastic order p early history p 306 papacy refused to recognise stigand s elevation as robert was still alive and had not been deprived of office by a pope robert of jumieges appealed to leo ix who summoned stigand to rome when stigand did not appear he was excommunicated stenton anglo saxon england pp 465 466 historian nicholas brooks holds view that stigand was not excommunicated at this time but rather was ordered to refrain from any archiepiscopal functions such as consecration of bishops he argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with stigand something they would not have done had he been excommunicated brooks early history p 307 legates did nothing to alter stigand s position either rex harold ii p 184 although one of legates later helped depose stigand in 1070 barlow english church 1000 1066 p 306 however pope leo ix and his successors victor ii and stephen ix continued to regard

coredon dictionary p 209 from pope travelling to rome for pallium had become a custom practised by a number of his predecessors brooks early history pp 291 299 304 instead some medieval chroniclers state that he used robert of jumieges pallium it is not known if stigand even petitioned papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment darlington ecclesiastical reform english historical review p 420 owing to reform movement stigand probably knew request would be unsuccessful in 1058 antipope benedict x who opposed much of reform movement gave stigand a pallium greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 2 monastic cathedrals northern and southern provinces canterbury archbishops however benedict was deposed following year reforming party declared benedict an antipope and nullified all his acts including stigand s pallium grant huscroft ruling england p 48 exact circumstances that led to benedict granting a pallium are unknown whether it was at stigand s request or was given without prompting after his translation to canterbury stigand released elmham to his brother aethelmaer but retained bishopric of winchester canterbury and winchester were two richest sees in england higham death of anglo saxon england p english church 1000 1066 p 79 and while precedent allowed holding of a rich see along with a poor one there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently brooks early history p 205 he may have retained winchester out of avarice or his hold on canterbury may not have been secure stafford unification and conquest p 94 besides these he held abbey of gloucester and abbey of ely and perhaps other abbeys also knowles monastic order p 72 whatever his reasons retention of winchester made stigand a pluralist holder of more than one benefice at same time this was a practice that was targeted for elimination by growing reform movement in church five successive popes leo ix victor ii stephen ix nicholas ii and alexander ii excommunicated stigand for holding both winchester and canterbury at same time it has been suggested by historian emma mason that edward refused to remove stigand because this would have undermined royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input further hurting stigand s position pope nicholas ii in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by pope huscroft ruling england p 62 stigand was later accused of simony by monastic chroniclers but all such accusations date to after 1066 and are thus suspect owing to post conquest desire to vilify english church as corrupt and backward huscroft ruling england pp 46 47 medieval chronicler william of poitiers also claimed that in 1052 stigand agreed that william of normandy future william conqueror should succeed king edward this claim was used as propaganda after conquest but according to historian david bates among others it is unlikely to be true bates william conqueror pp 77 harold ii p 141 position of stigand as head of church in england was used to good effect by normans in their propaganda before during and after conquest douglas william conqueror p 170 ecclesiastical affairs diocese of york took advantage of stigand s difficulties with papacy and encroached on suffragans or bishops owing obedience to an archbishop normally subject to canterbury york had long been held in common with worcester but during period when stigand was excommunicated see of york also claimed oversight over sees of lichfield and dorchester barlow feudal kingdom p 27 in 1062 however papal legates of alexander ii came to england

to rome to be consecrated by pope in 1061 rather than be consecrated by stigand huscroft ruling england p 51 during brief period that he held a legitimate pallium however stigand did consecrate aethelric of selsey and siward of rochester walker harold pp 136 138 abbots of monasteries however came to stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop these included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province such as as abbot of st augustine s abbey in canterbury but also baldwin as abbot of bury st edmunds and thurstan as abbot of ely after norman conquest stigand was accused of selling office of abbot but no abbot was deposed for buying office so charge is suspect barlow english church 1000 1066 pp 113 115 stigand was probably most lavish clerical donor of his period when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale dodwell anglo saxon art pp 230 231 he was a benefactor to abbey of ely and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to ely st augustine s abbey in canterbury bury st edmunds abbey and to his cathedral church at winchester smith et al court and piety catholic historical review p 576 crucifixes given to ely bury and winchester all appear to have had about life size figures of christ with matching figures of virgin and john evangelist as is recorded in monastic histories and were probably permanently mounted over altar or elsewhere

survive though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like german gero cross of around 980 and santo of lucca renewed with a later figure which is known to have inspired abbot of bury d 1065 to create a similar figure perhaps covered in precious metal on his return from a visit to rome dodwell anglo saxon art p 211 to ely he gave gold and silver vessels for altar and a chasuble embroidered in gold of such inestimable workmanship and worth that none in kingdom is considered richer or more valuable dodwell anglo saxon art pp 181 and 205 although it does not appear that stigand ever

two sees and appointment of his men to other sees in southeast of england stigand was an important figure in defending coastline against invasion loyn english church p 64 stigand may have been in charge of royal administration mason house of godwine pp 78 79 he may also have been behind effort to locate edward atheling and his brother edmund after 1052 possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to king edward walker harold p 75 his landholdings were spread across ten counties and in some of those counties his lands were larger than king s holdings smith archbishop stigand anglo norman

archbishop of york crowned harold while norman sources claim that stigand did so with conflict between various sources probably tracing to post conquest desire to vilify harold and depict his coronation as improper current historical research has shown that ceremony was performed by ealdred owing to controversy about stigand s position however one historian pauline stafford theorises that both archbishops may have consecrated harold stafford unification and conquest p 83 another historian frank barlow writing in 1979 felt that fact that some of english sources do not name who

afterwards aethelric bishop of selsey bishop of durham and bishop of lichfield who was married were deposed at a council held at windsor douglas william conqueror p feudal kingdom p 93 there were three reasons given for stigand s deposition that he held bishopric of winchester in plurality with canterbury that he not only occupied canterbury after robert of jumieges fled but also seized robert s pallium which was left behind and that he received his own pallium from benedict x an anti pope powell and wallis house of lords pp 33 34 some accounts state that stigand did appear at council which deposed him but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted charges against his brother are nowhere stated leading to a belief that depositions were mainly political that spring he had deposited his personal wealth at ely abbey for safekeeping but king william confiscated it after his deposition along with his estates brooks early history p 309 king appointed lanfranc a native of italy and a scholar and abbot in normandy as new archbishop thomas norman conquest p 123 king william appears to have left initiative for stigand s deposition to papacy and did nothing to hinder stigand s authority until papal legates arrived in england to depose archbishop and reform english church besides witnessing charters and consecrating remigius stigand appears to have been a member of royal council and able to move freely about country but after arrival of legates william did nothing to protect stigand from deposition and archbishop later accused king of acting with bad faith stigand may even have been surprised that legates wished him deposed loyn english church p 69 it was probably death of ealdred in 1069 that moved pope to send legates as that left only one archbishop
