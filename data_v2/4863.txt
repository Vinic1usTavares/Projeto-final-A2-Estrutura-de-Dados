shrewsbury drapers company was a trade organisation founded in 1462 in town of shrewsbury shropshire england members were wholesale dealers in wool or woollen cloth company dominated trade in welsh cloth for many years holding a virtual monopoly from 16th century to late 18th century it lost its position when roads were improved making it practical for factors from liverpool and elsewhere to travel into wales and purchase cloth directly from makers and became irrelevant when industrial revolution made trade guilds obsolete today it survives as a charity that runs almshouses in shrewsbury early years 12th 15th centuries shrewsbury in 1334 was 7th wealthiest town in england outside of london and was well situated to handle trade from north and central wales in time of peace drapers took role of middlemen when trade in raw wool was replaced by trade in woollen cloth in late 12th and 13th centuries all trade in shrewsbury was controlled by guild merchants by late 14th century drapers had become an independent guild with commercial religious and political functions in 1444 drapers guild founded almshouses beside st mary s church that housed 13 residents mercers company remained

part of which still exists rise to dominance of cloth trade 16th century in early 16th century welsh cloth for export was mainly produced in south wales and shipped from local ports during that century there was a shift in production to mid wales and north wales after act of union in 1536 shrewsbury drapers provided an increasingly important export market for welsh light coarse cloths known as cottons friezes and flannel mercers who retailed cloth had formerly claimed a share of welsh trade as had shearmen who finished cloth in early 16th century drapers shut mercers out of trade and make shearmen purely subcontractors creating an effective monopoly during reformation company s religious duties were eliminated drapers came to wield great power in shrewsbury and included all leading men of town from mid 16th century to end of 17th century members of company dominated shrewsbury s administration drapers provided homes for a number of poor people whom they employed and gave work to over 600 shearmen in 1565 this was used to justify an act of parliament that gave them a monopoly of cloth trade in town formal monopoly was repealed after six years but drapers usually managed to exclude competitors in 1576 company built a new drapers hall in st mary s place on site of an earlier hall company was allowed a coat of arms same as that of london drapers in 1585 at first staple or woollen cloth trading centre for welsh cloth was located in town of oswestry about to north west of shrewsbury in 1585 market was temporarily moved to knockin due to an outbreak of plague in

drapers this had risen to 113 by 1625 many of drapers were engaged in other businesses such as brewing or law in 17th century shrewsbury was regularly visited by drapers from north of england and midlands textile industry created a lively market for pack horses in 1618 first brick house in shrewsbury was built by william rowley a brewer and draper in 1638 first mayor of shrewsbury thomas jones was a leading draper sir edward coke sponsored welsh cloth bill in 1621 which aimed to eliminate effective monopoly of company over transport of cloth to london first draft said that all merchants were to be allowed to buy cloth anywhere in wales and to export it subject to paying duties to crown export clause was later qualified to add only after cloth had been entirely finished at home two shrewsbury burgesses tried to block bill at its third reading in 1621 on grounds that it would overthrow a statute that specified standard dimension for welsh cloth allow forestalling and or overthrow charter of shrewsbury and allow welsh clothiers to sell their cloth in any english town coke refuted these arguments saying that shrewsbury would only suffer from bill because it had a monopoly he said monopolies were to be detested and could not be justified by reason of state bill was passed by commons and sent to lords in 1621 drapers agreed to buy no more cloth in oswestry john davies noted in 1633 that oswestry flourished and was happy indeed by reason of market of welsh cottons ps1 000 in ready money was left in town each week sometimes far more but now since staple of cloth is removed to shrewsbury town is much impoverished shrewsbury having now said market after market moved to shrewsbury on fridays a clothier from merioneth had to travel further each way and could only get home very late on saturday in response to a plea from rector of in 1648 drapers agreed as a compromise to buy cloth on thursdays welsh cloth makers who lacked capital produced poor quality drapery for which there was relatively low demand drapers bought cloth in semi finished form and sold it after it had been finished or nearly finished better welsh wool was woven into cloth and fulled in wales making plains or webs or wool was woven and fulled in shrewsbury or nearby towns such as wrexham denbigh oswestry and chirk shrewsbury drapers brought this cloth and had it cottoned and shorn other plains were finished as high friezes with upper fibres on one side raised into a rough curly nap suitable for cold weather outer clothing some cloth was sold as shrewsbury or welsh cottons mostly destined for london some of which was exported to france or mediterranean finished cloth was sent on weekly trains of pack horses to cloth market in blackwell hall in city of london shrewsbury had a large body of craftsmen to finish cloth so plains that were bought on monday could be cottoned and on way to london by wednesday after english civil war 1642 51 regulations were made in 1654 for preventing drapers forestalling or engrossing welsh flannels cloths c many of drapers supported parliament during civil war and as a consequence company was not given royal support after monarchy was
