united states special operations command ussocom or socom is unified combatant command charged with overseeing various special operations component commands of army marine corps navy and air force of united states armed forces command is part of department of defense and is only unified combatant command created by an act of congress ussocom is headquartered at macdill air force base in tampa florida idea of an american unified special operations command had its origins in aftermath of operation eagle claw disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at american embassy in iran in 1980 ensuing investigation chaired by admiral james l holloway iii retired chief of naval operations cited lack of command and control and inter service coordination as significant factors in failure of mission since its activation on 16 april 1987 u s special operations command has participated in many operations from 1989 invasion of panama to ongoing global war on terrorism ussocom conducts several covert and clandestine missions such as direct action special reconnaissance counter terrorism foreign internal defense unconventional warfare psychological warfare civil affairs and counter narcotics operations each branch has a special operations command that is unique and capable of running its own operations but when different special operations forces need to work together for an operation ussocom becomes joint component command of operation instead of a soc of a specific branch history unworkable command and control structure of separate u s military special operations forces sof which led to failure of operation eagle claw in 1980 highlighted need within department of defense for reform and reorganization army chief of staff general edward c shy meyer had already helped create u s delta force in 1977 following eagle claw he called for a further restructuring of special operations capabilities although unsuccessful at joint level meyer nevertheless went on to consolidate army sof units under new 1st special operations command in 1982 a significant step to improve u s army s sof thumb senator barry goldwater former chairman of senate armed services committee by 1983 there was a small but growing sense in congress for need for military reforms in june senate armed services committee began a two year long study of defense department which included an examination of sof spearheaded by senator barry goldwater r az with concern mounting on capitol hill department of defense created joint special operations agency on 1 january 1984 this agency however had neither operational nor command authority over any sof joint special operations agency thus did little to improve sof readiness capabilities or policies and therefore was insufficient within defense department there were a few staunch sof supporters noel koch principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and his deputy lynn both advocated sof reforms at same time a few on capitol hill were determined to overhaul united states special operations forces they included senators sam nunn d ga and william cohen r me both members of armed services committee and representative dan daniel d va chairman of united states house armed services subcommittee on readiness congressman daniel had become convinced that u s military establishment was not interested in special operations that country s capability in this area was second rate and that sof operational command and control was an endemic problem senators nunn and cohen also felt strongly that department of defense was not preparing adequately for future threats senator cohen agreed that u s needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low intensity conflicts in october 1985 senate armed services committee published results of its two year review of u s military structure entitled defense organization need for change mr james r locher iii principal author of this study also examined past special operations and speculated on most likely future threats this influential document led to goldwater nichols defense reorganization act of 1986 by spring 1986 sof advocates had introduced reform bills in both houses of congress on 15 may senator cohen introduced senate bill co sponsored by senator nunn and others which called for a joint military organization for sof and establishment of an office in defense department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low intensity conflict and special operations representative daniel s proposal went even further he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass joint chiefs and report directly to secretary of defense this would keep joint chiefs and services out of sof budget process congress held hearings on two bills in summer of 1986 admiral william j crowe jr chairman of joint chiefs of staff led pentagon s opposition to bills he proposed as an alternative a new special operations forces command led by a three star general this proposal was not well received on capitol hill congress wanted a four star general in charge to give sof more clout a number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of need for reform by most accounts retired army major general richard scholtes gave most compelling reasons for change scholtes who commanded joint special operations task force in grenada explained how conventional force leaders misused sof during operation not allowing them to use their unique capabilities which resulted in high sof casualties after his formal testimony scholtes met privately with a small number of senators to elaborate on problems that he had encountered in grenada both house and senate passed sof reform bills and these went to a conference committee for reconciliation senate and house conferees forged a compromise bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four star general for all sof an assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict a coordinating board for low intensity conflict within national security council and a new major force program mfp 11 for sof so called sof checkbook final bill attached as a rider to 1987 defense authorization act amended goldwater nichols act and was signed into law in october 1986 congress clearly intended to force dod and administration to face up to realities of past failures and emerging threats dod and administration were responsible for implementing law and congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation legislation promised to improve sof in several respects once implemented mfp 11 provided sof with control over its own resources better enabling it to modernize force additionally law fostered interservice cooperation a single commander for all sof promoted interoperability among forces assigned to same command establishment of a four star commander in chief and an assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict eventually gave sof a voice in highest councils of defense department thumb left general james lindsay first commander in chief special operations command implementing provisions and mandates of nunn cohen amendment to national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1987 however was neither rapid nor smooth one of first issues to surface was appointing an assistant secretary of defense for special operations low intensity conflict interdependent capabilities whose principal duties included of special operations activities and low intensity conflict activities of department of defense congress even increased number of assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12 but department of defense still did not fill this new billet in december 1987 congress directed secretary of army john o marsh to carry out asd so lic duties until a suitable replacement was approved by senate not until 18 months after legislation passed did ambassador charles whitehouse assume duties of asd so lic meanwhile establishment of ussocom provided its own measure of excitement a quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command united states readiness command usredcom with an often misunderstood mission did not appear to have a viable mission in post goldwater nichols era and its commander in chief general james lindsay had had some special operations experience on 23 january 1987 joint chiefs of staff recommended to secretary of defense that usredcom be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for ussocom president ronald reagan approved establishment of new command on 13 april 1987 department of defense activated ussocom on 16 april 1987 and nominated general lindsay to be first commander in chief special operations command senate accepted him without debate operation earnest

reagan agreed to kuwaiti request on 10 march 1987 hoping it would deter iranian attacks protection offered by u s naval vessels however did not stop iran which used mines and small boats to harass convoys steaming to and from kuwait in late july 1987 rear admiral harold j bernsen commander of middle east force requested nsw assets special boat teams deployed with six mark iii patrol boats and two seal platoons in august middle east force decided to convert two oil servicing barges hercules and vii into mobile sea bases mobile sea bases allowed sof in northern persian gulf to thwart

division paramilitary officers with elements of jsoc they conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to entry of follow on forces first casualty of conflict came from this team and was a paramilitary officer and former delta force operator named larry freedman freedman was awarded intelligence star for extraordinary heroism for his actions earliest missions during operation restore hope were conducted by navy seals seals performed several hydro graphic reconnaissance missions to find suitable landing sites for marines on 7 december seals swam into mogadishu harbor where they found suitable landing sites assessed area for threats and concluded that port could support offloading ships this was a tough mission because seals swam against a strong current which left many of them overheated and exhausted furthermore they swam through raw sewage in harbor which made them sick when first seals hit shore following night they were surprised to meet members of news media first marines came ashore soon thereafter and press redirected their attention to them later seals provided personal security for president george bush during a visit to somalia in december 1992 special

especially arduous mission for aidid had gone underground after several lockheed ac 130 air raids and un assaults on his strongholds while marines from 24th meu provided an interim qrf force recon det and helicopters from hmm 263 task force arrived in country and began training exercises marines were asked to take on aidid snatch mission but having advantage of being in area for more than two months decided after mission analysis that mission was a no go due to several factors centered around inability to rescue crew of a downed helicopter re indigenous forces technique of using rpgs against helicopters and blocking narrow streets in order to restrict movement of a ground rescue force this knowledge was not passed on to rangers due to marines operating from uss wasp and rangers remaining on land tf ranger was made up of operators from delta force 75th ranger regiment 160th soar seals from naval special warfare development group and air force special tactics units during august and september 1993 task force conducted six missions into mogadishu all of which were successes although aidid remained free effect of these missions seriously limited his movements on 3 october tf ranger launched its seventh mission this time into aidid s stronghold market to capture two of his key lieutenants mission was expected to take only one or two hours helicopters carried an

on foot ah 6 gunships raked streets with fire to support movement main force of convoy arrived at pakistani stadium compound for qrf at 6 30 am thus concluding one of bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since vietnam war task force ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded various estimates placed somali casualties above 1 000 although task force ranger s few missions were successes overall outcome of operation gothic serpent was deemed a failure because of task force s failure to complete their stated mission capturing mohamed farrah aidid most u s forces pulled out of somalia by march 1994 withdrawal from somalia was completed on march 1995 even though operation gothic serpent failed ussocom still made significant contributions to operations in

prior to invasion their efforts organized kurdish peshmerga to defeat ansar al islam in northern iraq before invasion this battle was for control of a territory in northeastern iraq that was completely occupied by ansar al islam an ally of al qaeda this was a very significant battle and led to death of a substantial number of terrorists and uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at sargat these terrorists would have been in subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle sargat was only facility of its type discovered in iraq war this battle may have been tora bora of iraq but it was a sound defeat for al qaeda and their ally ansar al islam this combined team then led peshmerga against saddam s northern army this effort kept saddam s forces in north and denied ability to redeploy to contest invasion force coming from south this effort may have saved lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women at launch of iraq war dozens of 12 member special forces teams infiltrated southern and western iraq to hunt for scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets scores of navy seals seized oil terminals and pumping stations on southern coast air force combat controllers flew combat missions in mc 130h combat talon iis and established austere desert airstrips to begin flow of soldiers and supplies deep into iraq it was a far cry from persian gulf war of 1991 where special operations forces were kept largely on sidelines but it would not be a replay of afghanistan where army special forces and navy seals led fighting after their star turn in afghanistan many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in iraq many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders from that point ussocom has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and al qaeda terrorists it has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training iraqi security forces current role united

linked up several times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with enemy one such battle happened during operation anaconda mission to squeeze life out of a taliban and al qaeda
