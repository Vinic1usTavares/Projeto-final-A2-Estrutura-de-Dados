development and writing series was conceived by mercer executive producer gerald lunz and salter street films co chair michael donovan in 1994 lunz had launched mercer s career producing his one man shows and this hour has 22 minutes latter of which was made by salter street mercer and lunz formed island edge to co produce made in canada and develop other projects for mercer lunz and mercer wanted to satirize office politics starring mercer as an ambitious man manipulating his way to top in a parody of shakespeare s richard iii instead of killing his rivals programme s richard would kill their careers by ruining their reputations and seizing their power richard would address audience directly breaking fourth wall to share his plans and ambitions although they realized this was a risk they felt that mercer could connect with audience as he had in his monologues mercer had established himself as first mainstream canadian satirist to make scathing criticisms directly without a comedic mask they had considered setting satire in federal bureaucracy in line with mercer s political criticism known as country s unofficial opposition party but mercer was not sufficiently knowledgeable about government s inner workings believing that satire required a firm understanding of its targets they set programme in a television and film production office this would be understood by audience and provide many egos to lampoon mercer described programme in a later interview as having a dilbert reality of an office in which some have a suck up kick down philosophy in april 1998 canadian broadcasting corporation cbc approved a six part series without seeing a script first season was by mercer and mark farrell over a two month period they had both written for 22 minutes and had written sketches for several years but neither had written episodic television before lunz a self described shakespeare nut guided theme and style farrell lunz and mercer remained show s creative force throughout its five seasons other writers for series included paul bellini alex ganetakos and edward riche programme shifted from a dark satire to an episodic sitcom after its first season and addressed audience less frequently this was often limited to closing line i think that went well or this is not good which might be given to a character other than richard depending on who was behind that episode s schemes series working title was industry which was changed to casting couch and then made in canada production cbc executive george anthony who had convinced lunz and mercer to come to network years previously recognized their talent and was firmly supportive of production programme went from network approval to broadcast in a record six months executives ordered a thirteen episode second season after viewing first episode which was unprecedented for public broadcaster casting was done while scripts were still being written and episodes were filmed out of

during its first season that made in canada had all makings of a hit with clever dialogue plausible characters and a storyline for anyone who fantasized about ruining their boss antonia of toronto star described programme as scary cynical and biting and felt that production took huge risks in satirizing its producers and industry moguls and its choice of title in a country which looked down on domestic productions according to stephen cole of national post first season was well scripted funny and clever with solid performances but never found a target worthy of its savage and cutting satire cole was disappointed that series remained a sitcom instead of taking on more compelling issues specific to canadian industry rating first episode 9 out of 10 a tv guide reviewer said that programme centred on mercer s fresh and deeply biting satire with a smirk complemented with an able cast although audience might miss some inside jokes show should hold 22 minutes audience for saturday night comedy critic andrew clark wrote that programme created an eerily believable universe with its casting filming location and fictitious shows and appreciated mercer s ability to find a satirical line and hone it to a cutting edge at beginning of its fourth season john doyle of globe and mail called show addictive switching from absurdity to brutal satire accessible to every viewer at end of series doyle wrote that most in industry had enjoyed its twisted vague versions of real stories and scandals made in canada has been compared to ken finkleman s satire newsroom in which farrell keleghan and pinsent had roles although they share a documentary feel and were shot in real offices clark noted that their lead characters are distinctly different richard s ambition is all consuming and he wages intergenerational warfare against likes of finkleman s ineffective george findlay awards series was nominated for more than three dozen gemini awards during its five season run winning ten made in
