hms russell was a pre dreadnought battleship of royal navy commissioned in 1903 built to counter a group of fast russian battleships russell and her sister ships were capable of steaming at making them fastest battleships in world duncan class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to s though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout as such they reflected a development of lighter second class ships of russell was built between her keel laying in march 1899 and her completion in february 1903 russell served with mediterranean fleet until 1904 at which time she was transferred to home fleet in 1905 home fleet became channel fleet she moved to atlantic fleet in early 1907 before returning to mediterranean fleet in 1909 in another fleet reorganisation in 1912 mediterranean fleet became part of home fleet and it was later transferred to british waters russell served as flagship of 6th battle squadron from late

two mines laid by a german u boat most of her crew survived sinking though 125 men were killed design thumb left right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1915 six ships of were ordered in response to russian s that had been launched in 1898 russian ships were fast second class battleships so william henry white british director of naval construction designed duncan class to match purported top speed of russian vessels to achieve higher speed while keeping displacement from growing white was forced to reduce ships armour protection significantly effectively making ships enlarged and improved versions of s of 1896 rather than derivatives of more powerful and series of first class battleships duncans proved to be disappointments in service owing to their reduced defensive characteristics though they were still markedly superior to peresvets they had been built to counter russell was long overall with a beam of and a draft of duncan class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded her crew numbered 720 officers and ratings duncan class ships were powered by a pair of 4 cylinder triple expansion engines that drove two screws with steam provided by twenty four belleville boilers boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships duncan class ships had a top speed of from this made russell and her sisters fastest battleships in world for several years at a cruising speed of ship could steam for russell had four 40 calibre guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft ships also mounted twelve 45 calibre guns mounted in casemates in addition to ten 12 pounder guns and six 3 pounder guns as was customary for battleships of period she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in hull russell had an armoured

russell 1st earl of orford a former royal navy officer and commander in chief of navy in 17th century she was laid down by palmers shipbuilding and iron company at jarrow on 11 march 1899 and launched on 19 february 1902 she arrived at sheerness later same month and went to chatham dockyard for steam and gun mounting trials construction of russell was completed in february 1903 during her sea trials she was painted in black and buff paint scheme used during victorian period though after entering service she was repainted in new grey paint scheme russell commissioned at chatham dockyard on 19 february 1903 for service in mediterranean fleet in which she served until april 1904 on 7 april 1904 she recommissioned for service in home fleet when home fleet became channel fleet in january

on 16 july she collided with cruiser off quebec but suffered only minor damage in 1909 russell had her armament overhauled which included installation of new traversing and elevation gear and sighting equipment she also had identification bands painted onto her funnels on 30 july 1909 russell transferred to mediterranean fleet under a fleet reorganisation of 1 may 1912 mediterranean fleet became 4th battle squadron first fleet home fleet and changed its base from malta to gibraltar russell transferred to home waters in august 1912 in september 1913 russell was reduced to a nucleus crew in

channel when world war i began in august 1914 plans originally called for russell and battleships albemarle duncan exmouth and to combine in 6th battle squadron and serve in channel fleet where squadron was to patrol english channel and cover movement of british expeditionary force to france however plans also existed for 6th battle squadron to be assigned to grand fleet when war began commander in chief grand fleet admiral sir john jellicoe requested that russell and her four surviving sister ships of duncan class albemarle cornwallis duncan and exmouth be assigned to 3rd battle squadron in grand fleet for patrol duties to make up for grand fleet s shortage of cruisers accordingly 6th battle squadron was abolished temporarily russell exmouth and albemarle were only ships in a condition to immediately join jellicoe so they left without rest of squadron on 5 august they arrived in scapa flow on night of 7 8 august ships worked with grand fleet cruisers on northern patrol russell and her four duncan class sisters as well as battleships of were temporarily transferred to channel fleet on 2 november 1914 as reinforcements in face of german navy activity in channel fleet s area following day german fleet raided yarmouth at time russell and rest of 3rd squadron were dispersed on northern patrol and were thus unavailable during german attack on 13 november 1914 king edward vii class ships returned to grand fleet but russell and other duncans stayed in channel fleet where they reconstituted 6th battle squadron on 14 november 1914 with russell serving as squadron s flagship squadron was based at portland although it transferred immediately 14 november to dover however due a lack of antisubmarine defences at dover particularly after harbour s anti submarine boom was swept away in a gale it returned to portland on 19 november 1914 6th battle squadron was given a mission of bombarding german submarine bases on coast of belgium and russell participated in bombardment of german submarine facilities at zeebrugge on 23 november 1914 in company with exmouth two ships left portland on 21 november accompanied by eight destroyers a group of trawlers and a pair of airships to observe fall of shot though airships failed to arrive in time for operation russell and exmouth closed to of port and shelled harbour railroad station and coastal defences two ships fired some 400 shells in total and observed several fires ashore reports from dutch observers indicated significant damage had been inflicted but attack achieved very little and discouraged royal navy from continuing such bombardments 6th battle squadron returned to dover in december 1914 then transferred to sheerness on 30 december to relieve 5th battle squadron there in guarding against a german invasion of united kingdom between january and may 1915 6th battle squadron was dispersed russell and albemarle remained with grand fleet through april on 19 april they were detached from fleet base at rosyth to conduct training exercises in scapa flow they rejoined fleet for a sortie on 21 april russell left squadron in april 1915 and rejoined 3rd battle squadron in grand fleet at rosyth she underwent a refit at belfast in october november 1915 during this refit she received a pair of anti aircraft guns on her quarterdeck mediterranean thumb illustration of russell underway on 6 november 1915 a division of 3rd battle squadron consisting of battleships flagship albemarle and russell was detached from grand fleet to reinforce british dardanelles squadron in gallipoli campaign at gallipoli peninsula russell was at that time in belfast and she joined other ships while they were en route albemarle had to turn back almost immediately due to heavy weather damage but other ships continued to mediterranean where russell took up her duties at dardanelles in december 1915 based at mudros with hibernia and held back in support her only action in campaign was her participation in evacuation of cape helles from 7 january to 9 january 1916 and she was last battleship of british dardanelles squadron to leave area she relieved hibernia as divisional flagship rear admiral in january 1916 after conclusion of dardanelles campaign russell stayed on in eastern mediterranean russell was steaming off malta early on morning of 27 april 1916 when she struck two naval mines that had been laid by german submarine a fire broke out in after part of ship and order to abandon ship was passed after an explosion near after turret she took on a dangerous list however she sank slowly allowing most of her crew to escape a total of 27 officers and 98 ratings were lost gardiner gray p 9 puts loss of life at 126 rather than 125 john h d cunningham served aboard her at time as a lieutenant commander and survived her sinking he would one day become first sea lord according to naval historian r a burt insufficient internal subdivision which limited ability of crew to counter flood to offset underwater damage contributed significantly to loss of russell and her sister cornwallis both of which listed badly before sinking wreck was examined for first time in 2003 by
