publication history upright thumb alt photograph of ernest hemingway and hadley richardson hemingway in switzerland 1922 ernest hemingway and his first wife hadley in montreux a year before their son john was born in early 1920s hemingway and his wife hadley lived in paris where he was foreign correspondent for toronto star when hadley became pregnant they returned to toronto hemingway biographer kenneth lynn suggests that hadley s childbirth became inspiration for story she went into labor while hemingway was on a train returning from new york lynn believes hemingway likely was terrified hadley would not survive birth and he became beside himself with fear about extent of her suffering and swamped by a sense of helplessness at realization that he would probably arrive too late to be of assistance to her hemingway wrote indian camp a few months after john hemingway was born in toronto on october 10 1923 while they were in toronto hemingway s first book three stories and ten poems was published in paris followed months later by a second volume in our time without capitals which included 18 short vignettes presented as untitled chapters hemingway hadley and their son nicknamed bumby returned to paris in january 1924 moving into a new apartment on rue notre dame des champs with ezra pound hemingway helped ford madox ford edit his newly launched literary magazine transatlantic review which published pieces by modernists such as pound john dos passos james joyce gertrude stein as well as hemingway indian camp began as a 29 page untitled manuscript that hemingway cut to seven pages at first he called story one night last summer in 1924 seven page story titled indian camp was published by transatlantic review in works in progress section along with a piece from james joyce s manuscript finnegans wake a year later on october 5 1925 indian camp was republished by boni liveright in new york in an expanded american edition of hemingway s first collection of short stories titled in our time with capitals with a print run of 1335 copies indian camp was later included in hemingway s collection fifth column and first forty nine stories published in october 1938 two collections of short stories published after hemingway s death included indian camp nick adams stories 1972 and complete short stories of ernest hemingway finca vigia edition 1987 nick adams stories 1972 edited by philip young included story fragment titled three shots that hemingway originally cut from indian camp themes and genre initiation and fear of death indian camp is an initiation story nick s father dr adams exposes his young son to childbirth and unintentionally to violent death an experience that causes nick to equate childbirth with death hemingway critic tetlow maintains that in indian camp sexuality culminates in butchery style birth and bloody death and that nick s anxiety is obvious when he turns away from butchery story reaches a climax when nick s heightened awareness of evil causes him to turn away from experience although nick may not want to watch caesarian his father insists he watch he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness writes thomas strychacz hemingway biographer philip young writes that hemingway s emphasis in indian camp was not primarily on woman who gives birth or father who kills himself but on young nick adams who witnesses these events and becomes a badly scarred and nervous young man in indian camp hemingway begins events that shape adams persona young considers this single hemingway story to hold master key to what its author was up to for some thirty five years of his writing career critic howard hannum agrees he believes trauma of birth and suicide hemingway paints in indian camp rendered a leitmotif that gave hemingway a unified framework for nick adams stories indian camp is also about fear of death section cut from story highlights nick s fear published version underscores it in a less obvious manner in cut section later published as three shots night before being taken to indian camp nick is left alone in forest where he is overwhelmed by thoughts of death critic paul strong speculates that hemingway may have intended narrative to be structured so that nick s father chose to take his fearful son to indian camp where nick faced grisly reality of death which can have done little to assuage nick s fears hannum believes hemingway is intentionally vague about details of birth but not death he speculates that nick would have likely blocked out much of caesarian but he had clearly seen father s head tilted back critics have questioned why woman s husband kills himself strong finds arguments that husband is driven to suicide by wife s screaming to be problematic because suicide occurs at moment screams are silenced he points to hemingway s statement in death in afternoon if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it as evidence that husband may have killed himself because he is driven frantic by his wife s pain and perhaps his own story also shows innocence of childhood nick adams believes he will live forever and be a child forever he is a character who sees his life stretching ahead at end of story in boat with his father nick denies death when he says he will never die indian camp shows hemingway s early fascination with suicide and with conflict between fathers and sons young thinks there is an unavoidable focus on fact that two people principal characters are based on father clarence hemingway and boy ernest hemingway end up committing suicide kenneth lynn writes that irony to modern readers is that both characters in that boat on lake would one day do away with themselves hemingway shot himself on july 2 1961 his father had shot himself on december 6 1928 primitivism race and autobiography in his essay hemingway s primitivism and indian camp jeffrey meyers writes that hemingway was very clear about husband s role because in this story he was writing about a familiar subject experiences of his boyhood in michigan young father s role is to deflate doctor who finds victory in slicing open woman s belly to deliver infant and to provide a counterpoint to mother s strength and resilience father s suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of white doctor whose skill is necessary but who brings with him destruction in her paper screaming through silence violence of race in indian camp amy strong writes indian camp is about domination husband kills himself at moment his wife is cut open by a white doctor she thinks theme of domination exists on more than one level nick is dominated by his father white outsiders dominate in indian camp and white doctor has cut into woman like early settlers leaving a gash in tree according to hemingway scholar thomas strychacz in story hemingway presents a re enactment of arrival of europeans in new world and subsequent doctrine of manifest destiny white men in story arrive on water and are met at a beach by natives native husband and father of baby loses everything causing him to kill himself his home is overtaken and his wife ripped apart white doctor tells his son to ignore woman s screams her screams are not important i don t hear them because they are not important doctor s victory is to control nature by delivering a baby diminished by father s suicide who through his death symbolically takes back control from white doctor meyers claims story is not autobiographical though it is an early example of hemingway s ability to tell stories true to life in story nick adams father who is portrayed as professionally cool is based on hemingway s own father clarence hemingway hemingway s paternal uncle george appears in story and is treated unsympathetically hannum suggests george may have been child s father writing that in story remains never resolved implication of paternity of indian child during surgery mother bites uncle george indians laugh at him and he leaves when father is found dead jackson benson writes in ernest hemingway life as fiction and fiction as life that critics should refrain from finding connections between hemingway s life and fiction and instead focus on how he uses biographical events to transform life into art he believes events in a writer s life have only a vague relationship to fiction like a dream from which a drama emerges of hemingway s earliest stories benson claims his early fiction his best has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare in his essay on writing hemingway wrote that indian camp was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real everything good he d ever written he d made up of course he d never seen an indian woman having a baby that was what made it good qtd in writing style thumb upright alt 1920 photograph of ezra pound ezra pound photographed by e o hoppe in 1920 two years before he taught hemingway to write in imagist style hemingway biographer carlos baker writes that hemingway learned from his short stories how to get most from least how to prune language how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but truth in a way that allowed for telling more than truth style has become known as iceberg theory because as baker describes it in hemingway s writing hard facts float above water while supporting structure including symbolism operates out of sight benson believes hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general not only his life concept of iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as theory of omission hemingway believed writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below surface hemingway learned from ezra pound how to achieve a stripped down style and how to incorporate concepts of imagism in his prose he said pound had taught him more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive and his friend james joyce told him to pare down his work to essentials prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism instead of more conventional literary allusions hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as blanket and bunk in a series of objective a technique hemingway learned from t s eliot tetlow believes in this early story hemingway ignored character development he simply places a character in a setting and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman men smoking tobacco and an infected wound which give a sense of truth indian camp is constructed in three parts first places nick and his father on a dark lake second takes place in squalid and cramped cabin amid terrifying action and third shows nick and his father back on lake bathed in sunlight hemingway s use of counterpoint is evident when for example at end nick trails his hand in lake water that felt warm in sharp chill of morning paul strong believes deleted section may have provided context and additional counterpoint to plot with nick s aloneness in stillness of night juxtaposed against middle scene crowded with people paul smith writes that by cutting piece hemingway focuses on story s central point life and death initiation rituals familiar to residents of indian camp but alien to young nick unable to express his feelings fully in end nick trails his hand in water and felt quite sure that he would never die reception and legacy hemingway s writing style attracted attention when in our time without capitals was published in paris in 1924 in a small print run from ezra pound s modernist series through three mountains press edmund wilson described writing as of first distinction enough to bring attention to hemingway qtd in when indian camp was published it received considerable praise ford madox ford regarded indian camp as an important early story by a young writer critics in united states claimed hemingway reinvigorated short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style hemingway said in our time had pretty good unity and generally critics agree in 1970s carlos baker wrote of stories from in our time and specifically indian camp that they were a remarkable achievement hemingway scholars such as benson rank indian camp as one of hemingway s greatest short stories a story that is described as best known violent and dramatic in 1992 frederick busch wrote in new york times that hemingway had gone out of fashion while his antisemitism racism violence and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him objectionable by current standards he turned violence into art unlike any other american writer of his time by showing that making of art is a matter of life or death no less busch believes hemingway s characters either faced life or chose death a choice shown most starkly in indian camp saving of a life in indian camp is at center of much of hemingway s
