performed on logan earlier in day logan s wife valencia flood fearing for her safety and safety of her children filed petition with judicial system to have her husband receive treatment saying that logan was paranoid and that he needs to be hospitalized immediately as his condition was worsening petition entailed deputies taking logan to a hospital where he would have his psychiatric health examined by medical personnel a few days earlier on august 26 logan had been examined by a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and recommended that he be admitted to a medical institution to receive treatment for his mental health logan adamantly believed that he was in sound mental health and refused to consent to any such treatment and as such he was not admitted to such an institution and was released after deputies arrived at man s house logan s father james logan sr a television repairman led them inside residence where logan was in basement conducting a bible study with anthony antwan kromah a 19 year old man from hyattsville maryland earlier in month logan was released from a st mary s county detention center after being arrested and posting a 25 000 bond he had been arrested by a maryland state trooper who had found cocaine marijuana and a 38 caliber handgun in logan s automobile after stopping him as he was driving with kromah and another man in st mary s county logan was charged with possession of an illegal controlled substance with intent to distribute logan had also been using cocaine and smoking marijuana earlier in day after deputies went into basement he was asked by arnaud to come with him who said to him you ve got to come and go with me now however logan adamantly refused saying i told you i m not going with you anywhere logan then ran up staircase and went into his former bedroom now used as a guest bedroom and closed door arnaud and magruder followed him to room and stood outside door arnaud tried to convince logan to come out of room as logan s parents and magruder who had joined department in february 2001 stood by watching after logan s parents left scene and went to house s master bedroom logan became belligerent and uncooperative partially hidden behind a closet door logan retrieved a semi automatic 9mm chambered handgun and fired at arnaud where a bullet struck him in throat and severed his carotid artery logan then shot arnaud fatally in chest seeing arnaud felled by gunfire magruder who was wearing body armor stepped back and drew her sidearm however before she could return fire logan then shot six bullets at her one of which struck her in head mortally wounding her logan then went over to arnaud and while standing over his body shot him four more times injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding arnaud would die from severe gunshot induced blood loss at scene but mortally wounded magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9 34 p m logan s father who was in house s master bedroom had heard gunshots and thinking that deputies had shot him went over to see what had happened instead he saw logan leaving house with a firearm in hand and saw that two deputies had been shot logan s father then called 9 1 1 via telephone at 9 39 p m to report shooting to authorities emergency medical technicians arrived and removed arnaud and magruder from house via stretchers magruder was airlifted on a medical helicopter to prince george s hospital center with cpr being applied on her while en route however she would be pronounced dead at hospital before midnight manhunt

weapon from logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence such as fingerprints from it two then disposed of murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned getaway vehicle kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to murder he pleaded guilty on april 24 2003 to being an accessory after fact to a murder in meantime logan stayed briefly at residence of james a woman who lived in largo maryland james would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she had transported logan who she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities to her residence and allowed him to stay there logan was apprehended two days after murder on august 31 2002 at a shed near quebec arms apartments in hyattsville maryland on block of 14th avenue he was spotted there by undercover policemen who had received information that it had been an area that logan was known to frequent in past logan was found hiding in shed by policemen who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him firearm believed to be used in murders was recovered earlier as well after his capture logan was taken to prince george s hospital center where he received stitches and sutures being treated for canine bites on his ankle and arms after receiving medical treatment for his injuries logan was taken to a police station where he was interrogated for approximately three and a half hours by vincent vince canales a pgpd detective where he admitted to murders when asked by detective why he had murdered deputies rather than fleeing without killing them logan said i wanted to annihilate them i couldn t leave them alive interrogation was recorded by a camera and stored onto a vhs cassette tape and dvd contents of which would later be used in his murder trial as evidence to assist in convicting him in november 2002 logan s attorney fred warren bennett claimed that logan could not be held criminally responsible for murders due to mental deficiencies and poor psychiatric health in response judiciary mandated that logan undergo a psychiatric evaluation trial at his trial in late october 2003 logan s attorney fred warren bennett argued that although logan did kill deputies he was not criminally responsible for killings due to mental illness and thus should be acquitted by reason of insanity however state s prosecution argued that any mental deficiencies logan had were brought about by his usage of illegal narcotics such as cocaine and marijuana and as such he would be legally responsible for murders ultimately jury did not agree with arguments put forth by logan s defense attorney and logan was convicted of second degree murder on november 10 2003 after jurors deliberated for ten hours over span of three days over his fate a few weeks later on december 12 2003 logan was sentenced by trial s judge e allen shepherd to one hundred years of imprisonment without possibility of parole before he was sentenced logan apologized to relatives and comrades of his victims and asked shepherd to show mercy in his sentencing him shepherd rebuked logan s pleas for mercy citing heinous nature of crime which he remarked as being most callous one that he had ever encountered as a member of judiciary shepherd said to logan i ve never experienced a case of a murder more cold blooded than those that occurred in this case and you decided you were going to annihilate those two people retrial despite his conviction logan s attorneys tried to appeal to courts with one hundred year prison sentence being unanimously upheld by a three judge judicial panel on june 15 2004 however in their decision panel granted him possibility of paroled release after fifty years however more than a year later on september 7 2005 conviction was overturned by maryland court of appeals and logan was awarded a second trial judiciary determined that investigators had acted with impropriety in process of obtaining of logan s confession to murders by violating logan s miranda rights and by deliberately misleading him in order to obtain a confession court also determined that judiciary s selection process of jurors for trial had not been rigorous enough and had thus been conducted improperly logan s retrial began in june 2007 with prosecution unable to use logan s confession to present its case for conviction for judiciary had ruled that it had been obtained with impropriety in retrial prosecution used same argument it had used in original trial back in 2003 arguing that logan s insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances state s prosecution argued that logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics such as cocaine and marijuana two illegal controlled substances which he had used on day of murders ultimately first attempt at a retrial ended in june 2007 with a mistrial after jurors could not come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations on july 1 2007 logan s attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on route 10 in glen burnie further complicating matters however a few months later logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years of imprisonment on october 24 2007 with credit for five years he had already served much to disappointment of victims surviving family members who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime legacy murders occurred eleven days before maryland democratic party s primary election to determine its candidate for prince george s county sheriff as there were no candidates running for sheriff in any other parties

son named in september 2002 arnaud and magruder were posthumously honored before u s house of representatives by u s representative steny h hoyer of maryland s 5th congressional district killings helped to spur passage of a new maryland state law pertaining to treatment of mentally ill which went into effect on october 1 2003 law s creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from logan s parents james logan sr and karen logan law allows a judge to order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person if person presented a threat to themselves or to others in march 2017 logan was considered for release on parole by state but was ultimately denied amid opposition from relatives of victims 2008 deputy wounded in laurel on february 16 2008 at approximately 3 30 a m a pgso
