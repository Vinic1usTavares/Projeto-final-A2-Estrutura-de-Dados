strongly patterned arrangement with repeating combinations of pyramids long structures and residential complexes carmack weeks 1981 p 330 these repeating combinations appear to be linked to different lineages in addition there appears to be a larger division of site separating it into northwestern and southwestern halves dividing line runs from west along a street to central plaza crosses ballcourt and plaza then separates northern and eastern branches of site up to rim of canyon on eastern side carmack weeks 1981 pp 329 330 this larger site division places six complexes in northern half and six in south although this larger division may not have been strictly along lineage lines since kaweq linked structures are found in both halves of site carmack weeks 1981 pp 330 331 kaweq and their allies dominated most of site with nijaib occupying eastern portion possibly as far as satellite site of atalaya temple of tohil left thumb remains of temple of tohil at q umarkaj plaza was

plaza standing remains are reduced to rubble and mud core of temple with an opening where modern maya still make offerings as late as middle of 19th century this temple was much better preserved and was described by john lloyd stephens carmack 2001a p 355 originally temple consisted of a steep pyramid with stairways on three sides all except west and a temple building was on summit base was on each side and exterior of building was covered in painted stucco carmack 2001a pp 355 358 catherwood s copy of rivera y maestre s drawing of temple showed body of pyramid divided into four talud tablero terraces and 19 steps in each of three stairways while rivera y maestra s drawing depicts 24 steps and six terraces carmack 2001a p 356 francisco ximenez writing at end of 17th century described temple as tallest building in q umarkaj identity of temple as that of tohil was known during lifetime of ximenez when 30 steps were visible in each stairway and remains of pillars that supported temple roof were still standing carmack 2001a p 357 building style of temple of tohil is similar to that of most important temples of mayapan and chichen itza far to north in yucatan peninsula carmack 2001a p 358 pillars possibly once supported an elaborate masonry roof carmack 2001a p 361 temple of tohil was used for human sacrifice bodies of sacrificial victims were probably hurled down front stairway before being decapitated and heads places on a skull rack carmack 2001a p 360 this was likely to have been located immediately to southeast of temple in an area that is now buried under rubble fallen from temple itself an image of a jaguar was found painted onto stucco of temple an animal that was a of ruling kaweq dynasty temple of awilix thumb right temple of awilix temple of awilix is on east side of plaza awilix was patron goddess of nijaib lineage and is identified with one of hero twins from popul vuh carmack 2001a p 362 fox cook 1996 p 813 according to a drawing made by rivera y maestre temple of awilix was not as tall as temple of tohil carmack 2001a p 362 this structure was apparently second most important temple in q umarkaj originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure on east side kelly 1996 p 200 carmack 2001a p 361 a wide stairway climbed west side of temple it was flanked on lower level by two large talud tablero panels exterior stonework of building has been completely stripped away temple is similar in form to a temple mound on west side of first plaza in iximche postclassic capital of kaqchikel maya there were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that temple had been repaired various times prior to conquest carmack 2001a pp 361 362 floor under third phase of construction had been painted dark green archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath first building phase temple of jakawitz a large mound on south side of plaza was once temple of jakawitz a deity of mountains and patron of ajaw k iche lineage kelly 1996 p 200 carmack 2001a pp 367 369 like other structures of q umarkaj all stone facing has been robbed leaving only a rubble and mud core carmack 2001a p 367 this structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by temple on northern side a palace on southern side and a long building on east jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically drawings by rivera y maestre suggest that temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces carmack 2001a p 368 temple of q uq umatz temple of q uq umatz was a circular temple of feathered serpent and a palace in honour of lineage ruling dynasty of city temple is now only a circular impression in surface of main plaza carmack 2001a p 364 it is located directly between temples of tohil and awilix slightly north of central axis of tohil temple and slightly south of axis of awilix temple from traces left in plaza it is evident that temple consisted of a circular wall measuring across running around a circular platform with a wide circular passage between two whole structure probably once supported a roof and there were small stone platforms on east and west sides of temple each about wide priests of q uq umatz were drawn from an important lineage among ruling kaweq dynasty and this was likely to have been a source of power and prestige for kaweq carmack 2001a p 366 temple of q uq umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after spanish conquest since it is not mentioned by any of colonial era visitors and early drawings of site show only vegetation where temple once stood tradition of circular temples dedicated to feathered serpent deity was an ancient one in mesoamerican cultural region carmack 2001a p 365 ballcourt thumb right central ballcourt of q umarkaj ballcourt lies close to and just south of temple of tohil on southwest side of plaza kelly 1996

palaces of kaweq and ajaw k iche which were located to north and south of ballcourt fox 1991 p 217 correspondingly north range of ballcourt appears to have been associated with kaweq lineage and south range with ajaw k iche lineage fox 1991 p 223 palaces a small palace belonging to nijaib lineage was located directly behind temple of awilix carmack 2001a p 363 these lineage houses are found throughout city of q umarkaj as with other buildings of site outer stonework and plastering has been lost carmack 2001a p 375 are long rectangular structures located beside plazas upon high platforms upon these platforms palaces generally consisted of two levels a lower roofed antechamber with a second higher level supporting main rooms of structure some of larger palaces had several stairways giving access to antechamber and multiple doors and pillars opening into rooms of main building another palace structure lies to southeast of main plaza excavations in 1972 uncovered a simple superstructure consisting of a room with a bench at back and an altar in middle six funerary urns were found in remains of palace one of which was found near altar and contained rich offerings that included a gold necklace carmack 2001a pp 375 376 there were traces of hearths at each extreme of main chamber carmack 2001a p 376 other structures in central plaza there are traces of thirteen small platforms that once stood there carmack 2001a p 372 three of these each measuring wide were located to north of temple of k carmack 2001a p 373 a line of five similar structures was also located to south of same temple with an alternating pattern of a circular platform then a square platform followed by another circular platform and so on there was a sixth small platform nearby which was square in shape these platforms appear to have served as altars to south of line of platforms are traces of two larger square platforms one of these measured on each side other measured per side a circular impression lies between these two platforms which is all that remains of another platform of a different type that must have stood there larger platforms may also have served as auxiliary altars to those of principle temples carmack 2001a p 374 a large square platform in northwest section of central plaza measuring on each side it is located immediately behind temple of tohil and stands high although typically for site outer stonework has been robbed there are remains of six layers of plaster on floor of platform s upper surface this platform has been identified as al platform of gladiators described in early sources this platform seems to have been closely linked to military lineages of kaweq such as nima two large platforms lie in southeastern section of main plaza their use remains unknown caves thumb right smoke filled tunnel under ruins of q umarkaj in addition a series of three caves tunnel straight into limestone immediately to north of site first and most extensive cave is about 30 meters long with various altars carved into rock inside some modern quiche although officially roman catholic still burn candles and incense at ruined temples carmack 2001a pp 218 219
