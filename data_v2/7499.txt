in painting was court jester when poland was at height of its political economic and cultural power during era of renaissance in poland during reign of king sigismund i old reigned 1506 1548 he was a popular figure besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent witty and intelligent man using satire to comment on nation s past present and future unlike jesters of other european courts stanczyk has always been considered as much more than a mere entertainer stanczyk s fame and legend were strong in his own time and enjoyed a resurgence in 19th century and he remains well known to this day scarcity of sources gave rise to four distinct hypotheses about stanczyk in 19th century that he was entirely invented by jan kochanowski and his colleagues that he was perhaps a typical jester dressed by his contemporaries in an attire perhaps a shakespearean vision of 19th century writers or perhaps indeed a grey eminence of in any measure consensus among modern scholars is that such a person indeed existed and even if he did not figure had a tremendous importance to polish culture of later centuries appearing in works of many artists of 19th and 20th centuries he appears in a work of among others julian ursyn niemcewicz in jan z powiesc 1825 and several works by jozef ignacy kraszewski 1839 1841 content full title of painting is stanczyk w balu na bony wobec stanczyk during a ball at court of queen bona in face of loss of smolensk primary composition of painting is in contrast between solemn jester stanczyk obviously focus of painting and lively ball going on in background stanczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room while a ball hosted by royal family is in full swing in neighbouring hall his appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester gloomy deep in thought his seriousness is reinforced by his accessories his marotte lies discarded on floor whereas a holy medallion of black madonna of czestochowa can be seen on his torso wrinkled carpet at stanczyk s feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into chair upon reading letter or through a nervous shifting of feet thereafter on table lies a letter likely announcing that poland has lost smolensk now in russia to grand duchy of muscovy causing stanczyk s sorrow and reflection on his fatherland s fate letter seems to have been discarded by some official and only jester realizes its significance while rulers are partying celebrating recent victory at battle of orsha disregarding bad news about smolensk letter bears year 1533 a d and name samogitia a province of commonwealth note is incongruent with actual date of fall of smolensk in 1514 and is a matter of ongoing debate with an outright mistake by meticulous matejko known for use of symbolism and iconography being unlikely another symbol a lute symbol of glory is being carried by a midget stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in matejko s time this suggests a decline of

besides painting discussed here in consecration of king sigismund s bell 1874 and prussian homage 1882 working on this painting matejko was also inspired by book krol by seweryn whose main character a loner living in castle s ruins trying to reconcile past and present and himself inspired by stanczyk likely influenced this painting completed in 1862 when matejko was twenty four years old it is one
