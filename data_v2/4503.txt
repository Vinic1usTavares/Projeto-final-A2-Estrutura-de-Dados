a lake is reinforced by nennius record of conflict as gueith linn garan old welsh for battle of crane lake it is likely that linn garan was original pictish name for lake this was originally suggested by jackson 1963 p40 although alternative suggestions have been made orthodox view is that jackson was correct in his assessment of pictish as a brythonic language forsyth 1997 most complete narrative of battle itself is given by bede who nevertheless fails to inform us of location other than his mention that it took place in straits of inaccessible mountains irish annals have provided perhaps most useful resource for identifying battle site giving location as dun nechtain nechtan s fort a name that has survived into modern usage in two separate instances annals of ulster u686 1 annals of

of arbroath abbey as dun nechtan and spelling variations see for example innes and chalmers 1843 he further suggests a site dunnichen moss to east of village which he informs us had recently been drained but can be seen in old maps as a small lake chalmers 1887 example chalmers gives is ainslie s map of forfarshire 1794 which does not show a lake in that position nor do earlier maps for example pont c 1583 1596 roy 1747 1755 earlier local tradition related by headrick in second statistical account claimed that site was location of battle of where king arthur fought mordred headrick

birch wood in foreground is a dry stone wall behind which lies a small modern pond right dunnichen moss body of water to left is a modern battle scene inscribed on aberlemno kirk yard stone is often cited as evidence for battle site this interpretation was made based on stone s proximity to dunnichen only to north but while short distance seems compelling stone is unlikely to be any earlier than mid 8th century cummins 1999 pp 98 103 and ornamentation of stone including animal forms used and style of weaponry depicted suggests it may be as late as mid 9th century laing 2000 prior to being linked with battle of nechtansmere aberlemno stone had been cited as evidence for battle of barry now known to be historically inauthentic mitchel 1792 crombie 1842 jervise 1856 jervise writing in 1856 recounts chalmers identification of dunnichen as battle site while mentioning in same article aberlemno stone solely in relation to battle of barry and there are a number of other possible interpretations for carving for example w a cummins suggests possibility that stone is a memorial to 9th century pictish king oengus mac fergusa cummins 1999 pp 98 103 dunachton thumb right alt a

makes a case for an alternative site at dunachton in badenoch on north western shore of loch insh which shares dunnichen s origin of dun nechtain james fraser of edinburgh university suggests that
