both a single and double bass drums chart song is a guitar solo by eddie van halen reception early reviews of promotional version of game received by redeeming a code that came with guitar hero 5 were critical of game ign s erik brudvig rated game 4 9 10 citing problems with lack of relevance of van halen relative to culture of 2000s including having their avatars based on their current appearances rather than that of their 80s heyday lack of songs from sammy hagar s period in band and lack of features since introduced with guitar hero 5 brudvig ultimately stated that those who got game free through guitar hero 5 promotion got what they paid for robert workman of game daily was less critical of title but still noted that game lacked features including some mention of hagar and gary cherone and songs from their period with band and felt that title was below quality of guitar hero metallica both brudvig and workman commented positively on sound recordings and note tracking of van halen songs guitar hero van halen reviews following its release were mixed ben kuchera of ars technica considered game s limited coverage of band s history to be a sadly revisionist and dishonest take and felt that non van halen songs clashed with band s own material kuchera further pointed to activision s distribution strategy for game stating that he felt that giving game away free with guitar hero 5 showed that activision did not have confidence in game philip horton of telegraph was critical of game s song selection band s modern appearance and lack of any additional extras compared with either previous band centric games or guitar hero 5 and described it as weakest offering in series to date kate carter of guardian commented that game is neither one thing or other as it neither succeeds at bringing anything new to guitar hero series nor fully pays tribute to van halen computer and video games review complained about shoddy character models and described it as laziest guitar hero yet and nathan meunier of gamepro said that while van halen songs were good and challenging remaining tracks did not fit theme of game and that lackluster presentation makes game feel more like a glorified track pack than a true homage guitar hero van halen sold fewer than 75 000 units across all platforms in north america from december 22 to 31 2009 according to npd group as of april 2010
