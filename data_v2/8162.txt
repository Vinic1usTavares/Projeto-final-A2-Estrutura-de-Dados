rockwell woody harrelson and christopher walken it broke even at box office and reviews were generally good with david rooney of hollywood reporter writing that farrell serves as an excellent foil for

disfigured her in a car crash reviews were mixed with empire calling film a pleasingly intricate double or is it triple revenge plot anchored by excellent acting and hollywood reporter saying that j h wyman s script and measured pace don t lend themselves to necessary escalating tension that would have resulted in a more rewarding climax new york times manohla dargis called film a failure but said of actor farrell and his sensitive hardworking eyebrows help keep it from becoming a full bore lampoon joe neumaier of new york daily news also disliked film it contained a lot to roll your eyes over
