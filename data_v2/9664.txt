tufted tit tyrant anairetes parulus is a species of bird in tyrant flycatcher family tyrannidae this species is found in western south america its range stretches from southern colombia south along andes mountains to tierra del fuego it prefers to live in upper montane forests and shrublands however it is a habitat generalist and can be found across a wide range of ecosystems tufted tit tyrant has three subspecies including nominate subspecies anairetes parulus parulus a p aequatorialis and a p patagonicus and is very closely related to juan fernandez tit tyrant it is very small with a distinctive and conspicuous crest bird s head is black overall with white supraloral and postocular stripes its dull grayish brown back contrasts with its white throat and breast that are covered with black streaks and pale unmarked yellow underbelly there are few noticeable differences in plumage between subspecies it is a vocal flycatcher with a broad repertoire of songs this tit tyrant defends its territory only against other tit tyrants and except for southernmost population is non migratory tufted tit tyrant feeds mainly on a variety of insects that it hunts on or from small shrubs typically by perch gleaning it normally hunts in pairs breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location two to three eggs are normally laid twice a year in a cup shaped nest made of root fibers grasses and lichens and lined with small feathers tufted tit tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population taxonomy german explorer heinrich von kittlitz described tufted tit tyrant in 1830 tufted tit tyrant s genus anairetes is in tyrant flycatcher family tyrannidae and is believed to be most closely related to genera and however there is no definitive evidence supporting this claim tufted tit tyrant was described as muscicapa parulus by heinrich von kittlitz in 1830 from a specimen collected near valparaiso chile it was later moved from genus muscicapa which today solely contains old world flycatchers to anairetes however this genus was too similar to pre existing genus so harry church oberholser erected genus spitzitornis for it and other tit tyrants however spitzitornis was eventually abolished and tit tyrants were returned to anairetes tufted tit tyrant is believed to form a superspecies with juan fernandez tit tyrant members of genus anairetes are commonly known as tit tyrants because their active foraging behavior and crests are reminiscent of true tits in family paridae while genus itself is part of tyrant flycatcher family tufted tit tyrant is known in spanish as which means little longhorn in reference to bird s crest tufted tit tyrant has three described subspecies anairetes parulus aequatorialis is northernmost subspecies and is found in andes from southern colombia to western bolivia and northern argentina it was described by hans von berlepsch and wladyslaw in 1884 nominate subspecies a p parulus is found in western chile and in southwest argentina south to tierra del fuego and was described by kittlitz in 1830 third subspecies a p patagonicus is found in western argentina and was described by austrian ornithologist carl eduard in 1920 description thumb left a tufted tit tyrant a p aequatorialis tufted tit tyrant is a small bird averaging in length and weighing about its long recurved crest is typically conspicuous and is often parted giving impression that bird has two crests crest s feathers are black and emerge from center of bird s black crown although occasionally there is a small patch of white hidden by crest head is black overall with a white supraloral and postocular stripe bird s iris is creamy white to pale yellow and bill is black this tit tyrant s back is a dull grayish brown and wings and tail are a duskier shade of this color wings also feature two narrow white wingbars while outer tail feathers are white throat and breast are white and covered in dark gray to black streaks which thin out further down breast and along sides belly is a pale yellow which fades as plumage becomes more worn while bird s legs are black males and females are similar in appearance although females are typically smaller and may have smaller crests juvenile tufted tit tyrants are duller in coloration and have a shorter crest juvenile s wingbars are also buffy and there is no hidden white spot on crown there are few variations in plumage between three subspecies anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than nominate subspecies in its upperparts with broader and more extensive breast streaks and broader and more distinct white wingbars a p patagonicus has more variation from nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall particularly on crown and wingbars and breast streaks are broader and more distinct a p patagonicus underbelly is also a paler yellow to white this flycatcher has a loud high pitched song it is also known to give a fast song and occasionally single notes of are made in a slow series of calls when foraging in pairs tufted tit tyrants have been observed using a call to stay in contact with each other species contact call has been described as a tufted tit tyrant is also known to give a long weak trill distribution and habitat tufted tit tyrant has been recorded in colombia ecuador peru bolivia argentina and chile it is mostly restricted to andes mountains throughout northern portions of its range while in south its range broadens to include coast it has also been recorded as a vagrant in falkland islands it is most abundant and widely distributed of tit tyrant species its preferred habitat is upper montane forests and shrublands despite this preference it is a habitat generalist and is also found in elfin forest edges of cloud forests polylepis woodland brushy forests with bamboo disturbed humid scrub temperate forests and dry thorn scrub it seems to move back into fire stricken areas at a normal rate for paramo birds neither colonizing recently burned areas nor waiting for area to completely recover this tit tyrant is most frequently found between though it can be found at sea level in chile and up to in andes behavior thumb left a tufted tit tyrant a p aequatorialis this tit tyrant appears to be territorial in defending what it regards as its feeding territory although it only displays territorial behavior against other tufted tit tyrants birds defending their territory either alone or in a pair tend to begin their defense by calling rapidly and displaying displacement behavior such as bill wiping or wing flaring they then raise their crest and chase other tit tyrant through shrubs occasionally physically attacking intruder victorious tit tyrant then returns to its normal foraging behavior southern subspecies a p patagonicus migrates to northern argentina after breeding season other populations appear to be non migratory diet tufted tit tyrant is a generalist feeder that eats insects it is also known to eat seeds in rare circumstances it is an active forager that hunts in pairs or after breeding season small family groups it has also been known to feed with mixed species foraging flocks although this behavior is abnormal when this does occur it is most frequently seen foraging with thorn tailed flocks of thirty tufted tit tyrants in these mixed species foraging groups have been reported birds in pairs tend to feed leapfrog style and maintain constant visual contact with each other this species feeds at all strata of its habitat from understory to canopy thumb right porlieria chilensis in tufted tit tyrant habitat when feeding this flycatcher makes many short flights from perch to perch preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves particularly those from genera baccharis and porlieria a tit tyrant tends to land near base of shrub and make its way upwards while frequently flicking its tail upwards and shuddering its wings it has also been observed pivoting on its perch throughout this process while foraging tufted tit tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute its feeding style has been compared to that of a kinglet tufted tit tyrant uses three different hunting strategies to catch its prey gleaning insects from a perch is its primary hunting strategy while gleaning bird sits upright with its wings dropped below tail which is pointing straight down from this position tit tyrant scans upwards into vegetation for three to five seconds before attacking making them surprisingly deliberate hunters for a small flycatcher second most prevalent hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning in which tit tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from vegetation a third and less frequently used strategy is flycatching in which bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey in midair prey can be grabbed either close to bird s perch or at a short distance which often requires bird to pursue its prey when pairs cooperatively one bird quietly lurks within shrub while other snatches nearby insects after about a dozen attacks birds switch positions reproduction this flycatcher typically raises two broods a year northern populations nest from january to june while southern populations nest from august to january male tufted tit tyrant is aggressive during breeding season frequently chasing potential rivals in undulating flights while making a whirring sound tufted tit tyrant s nest is built in shrubs or bamboo often beside a stream clearings or path and is frequently well hidden nest is small and compact and is made in shape of an open cup cup is made of root fibers lichens grasses and down of thistles and small feathers line interior of cup tufted tit tyrant s nests are remarkably homogeneous varying only slightly in composition two to three creamy yellow eggs are laid in nest eggs have an average size of by conservation tufted tit tyrant is listed as least concern because of its large range of and stable population which although not officially estimated is believed to be well above 10 000 individuals it is uncommon to locally common throughout its range this species is considered to have a low sensitivity towards human disturbances in its habitat references cited texts external links calls image of an egg videos tufted tit
