arbor high school where he led football team to consecutive state championships in 1908 and 1909 one account of 1908 playoffs noted ann arbor s smashing play in first half was wholly due to maulbetsch ann arbor s fullback and his terrific line bucking he clearly outshone his team mates after graduating from high school maulbetsch joined ann arbor independents a football team made up of michigan varsity eligibles and maulbetsch was once reportedly called upon to drive across goal line for independents in a game in which a large crowd including a farmer with his plow horse gathered in end zone

maulbetsch started his college football career at age 21 leading adrian college to an 8 0 record in 1911 including a 15 0 win over university of michigan freshman team maulbetsch s performance drew attention of michigan coach fielding h yost after watching maulbetsch dominate michigan s freshman team yost concluded if i could get that kid into michigan and keep him up in his studies i d make an all american place for him his first year yost persuaded maulbetsch to transfer and he played with scrubs in 1912 yost told press at time he had another willie heston in maulbetsch 1914 season maulbetsch did not play for varsity team until fall of 1914 when he was 24 years old before season began maulbetsch was touted as one of fastest halfbacks who ever donned he weighs 155 pounds is built low has a powerful pair of shoulders and his dashes are characterized by lightning speed another pre season account said he was a wonder as a line plunger and a wizard in open field from outset considerable attention was paid to his unusual running style observers noted peculiar manner in which he runs he has a corkscrew style of dashing and even when tackled squarely has such a sturdy pair of legs that his assailant is usually carried back several yards michigan opened season with a 58 0 win over depauw followed by a 69 0 victory over case institute of technology maulbetsch was offensive star against case as he twice carried several would be tackles across goal playing vanderbilt following week maulbetsch had runs of 25 and 35 yards scored two touchdowns was worked overtime and probably advanced pigskin more than any two other players after starting season 5 0 michigan lost three of four games against top eastern schools syracuse harvard penn and cornell 1914 harvard game maulbetsch s breakthrough came on october 31 1914 in front of 30 000 fans at harvard game was one of most anticipated matches of year a special train brought michigan fans to cambridge massachusetts and hundreds of michigan alumni from east were on hand as reinforcements though harvard prevailed 7 0 maulbetsch was big story in papers across country writers from ring lardner to damon runyon told story of maulbetsch s performance lardner said if anyone tells you east plays best brand of football maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes according to runyon wolverines used mighty maulbetsch as their battering ram and he gained enough ground against harvard to bury a german army corps football writer frank g menke said no westerner ever created half stir in east as did this michigander his peculiar baffling style of attack backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20 yards every time he was called upon to carry ball another writer noted maulbetsch s skill as a line breaker as he carried ball repeatedly through harvard line and into secondary defense with bullet like rushes that upset tackler after tackler maulbetsch was responsible for four fifths of michigan s ground gains and on several occasions his dives reportedly had so much power that he dove right through a double line of crimson players and went sprawling on ground twelve to twenty feet clear of double line while every report indicates that maulbetsch had a big day accounts vary dramatically as to exactly how many yards he gained frank menke reported after game that maulbetsch gained 300 yards a 1938 newspaper account said he gained 350 yards from scrimmage yet his 1951 obituary indicated he gained 133 yards in 30 attempts despite maulbetsch s efforts michigan was never able to punch ball across goal line many blamed michigan s quarterback who switched to another back every time after maulbetsch took ball to shadow of crimson goal posts in answer to question why michigan was unable to score frank menke said ask fellow who quarterbacked for michigan that day his actions were too mystifying for spectators to figure out when harvard reneged on an agreement to play a game in ann arbor in 1915 sports writers concluded it was to avoid facing maulbetsch again said one reporter when sic saw what maulbetsch did in first clash it decided it cared to see no more of him he was too rough human bullet much of attention on maulbetsch focused on his diminutive size and unique running style at and maulbetsch was a small back even by standards of his day and his running style saw him bend his torso and propel himself like a projectile into opposing line indeed he won several nicknames based on his size running style and fighting spirit including human bullet mauly human shrapnel featherweight fullback michigan cannon ball and german bullet comparisons of maulbetsch to military armaments were common in addition to bullet shrapnel and cannonball nicknames syracuse herald observed standing up in front of a krupp gun has its dangers but it is not to be compared with dangers of standing in front of maulbetsch when he is going full speed ahead maulbetsch s style was described as line plunging a new york newspaper noted when ball is snapped to him he almost doubles himself up and with his head aimed at knees of opposing line he dives head first those who have seen maulbetsch in action marvel at great momentum he can get up in two or three steps noted football writer walter eckersall said mauly is a little fellow being built close to ground they say that when he plunges at line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops that he hits so low that it s well nigh impossible to stop him an iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with force that maulbetsch does and come out of game without a broken neck maulbetsch was said to run so low that he could dash under an ordinary table without losing his feet at a coaching conference in 1920s a coach doubted table ducking story and challenged maulbetsch later recalled i began ribbing him about this table ducking stuff and finally offered to bet him he couldn t do it well we got a table up in a room johnny tucked a water pitcher under his arm and backed against wall darned if he didn t do it only thing that water pitcher broke in a million pieces asked about incident maulbetsch said it was true except one part maulbetsch insisted there wasn t a nick on pitcher maulbetsch makes all american after loss to harvard in 1914 michigan rebounded with a 34 3 win over penn walter eckersall reported that wolverines were led by redoubtable johnny maulbetsch despite being a marked man by penn defense he was not thrown for a loss in entire game and he scored three touchdowns before michigan lost to cornell in final game of season a scandal arose when it was revealed that owner of an ann arbor pool room joe reinger had written a letter intimating that he could buy maulbetsch and michigan s quarterback to throw cornell game and win us 50 000 from students willing to bet on michigan letter was turned in to michigan athletic officials and reinger went to athletic office to try to hush matter up reinger became abusive and was thrown out of office by coach yost incident caused biggest stir of season on campus as students demolished reinger s pool room and police had to guard reinger s residence against threatening demonstrations that continued to a late hour although michigan did lose to cornell maulbetsch was said to be practically only successful ground gainer for michigan over course of 1914 season maulbetsch was said to have scored about half of michigan s 252 points a wisconsin newspaper noted that when it comes time to write a resume of 1914 football season maulbetsch s play will live in minds of men for years to come as a reward for his efforts maulbetsch was named a first team all american at end of 1914 season pie and coffee diet as public attention focused on maulbetsch as greatest line plunger of a decade press could not get enough of maulbetsch even interviewing his family his sister revealed that maulbetsch had a fondness for home cooking and received permission from team trainer to eat at his family s ann arbor home now johnny s sister explains that each day his mother baked two pies for athlete s supper and that in addition he had everything else his appetite craved including coffee confronted by reporters about revelation maulbetsch replied story was slightly exaggerated i rarely ate more than one and one half pies for dinner joking references to maulbetsch s diet continued when it was reported in 1915 that he was suffering from acute indigestion one reporter quipped those much advertised pies of his maw s evidently aren t as great training dope as they were cracked up to be it turned out that indigestion was appendicitis and maulbetsch was hospitalized at st joseph s sanitarium in ann arbor in april 1915 where he underwent an operation 1915 season as 1915 season was set to get underway coach yost reported johnny told me he was feeling fine when i saw him recently although he doesn t weigh as much as he used to despite yost s hopes maulbetsch fell far short of prior year s performance in 1915 he was several pounds lighter after illness and surgery and it was noted that a few pounds means much to a man of maulbetsch s weight in opening game against lawrence maulbetsch scored three touchdowns but he was woefully weak on interference playing against mount union maulbetsch made several big gains including a 50 yard touchdown run in third quarter his difficulties returned in season s third game against marietta as maulbetsch was powerless to stop marietta forward pass all of successful ones being directed toward his side of line after michigan daily criticized his performance following marietta game maulbetsch threatened to desert michigan squad and give up football for good it reportedly took yost several hours to coax maulbetsch to report for practice again and in next game against case maulbetsch did not play until third quarter in season s first big game michigan was soundly beaten by michigan agricultural college 24 0 and most of maulbetsch s runs didn t even get as far as his own line in final four games of season matters got worse for michigan and maulbetsch as team went 0 3 1 scoring only 14 points in four games in maulbetsch s defense some writers noted weakness of michigan line often allowing rushers into backfield before maulbetsch even had ball but some of those same observers noted that mauly was not carrying ball at his usual pace sports writer frank menke described maulbetsch s 1915 performance this way wolverine halfback skidded from heights of greatness to level of mediocre lines that he had crumpled like eggshells a year before stood up under his charges often dumping him back for losses once unstoppable maulbetsch not only was stopped but forced to retract despite subpar performance in 1915 michigan s varsity letter winners elected him captain of team for 1916 1916 comeback maulbetsch made a strong comeback in 1916 instead of spending summer recovering from appendicitis he spent summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between chicago and st joseph michigan maulbetsch spent his afternoons swimming and running sprints up and down beach on one trip a giant coal passer claimed to be strongest man in world and maulbetsch agreed to a wrestling match on boat coal passer rushed who ducked caught his opponent about waist and crushed him to deck when giant woke he wanted to know if boat hit a rock as season started new york times wrote michigan s come back football team headed by bullet maulbetsch is going to be an eleven to be reckoned with on gridiron this fall maulbetsch returned to his prior form and one of writers who had criticized him in 1915 said great michigander using same method of attack has repeatedly broken in fragments this year lines that he couldn t dent in 1915 professional football after 1916 football season ended maulbetsch considered his options there was a report that he had been engaged as a high school football coach and math instructor in toledo ohio even more prevalent were reports that he had signed to play for a professional football team professional football was still in its infancy in 1917 and landing a well known star would have been a boost to any of budding franchises in january 1917 newspapers reported that maulbetsch had signed a contract to play professional football for detroit tigers owner frank navin navin was supporting efforts to organize a professional football league in all important midwestern cities including a detroit franchise to play at navin field as late as november 1917 newspapers reported maulbetsch had played professional football after graduating and was offered a handsome fee to play with akron in november 1917 although professional football records prior to 1920 are scarce it appears unlikely that maulbetsch played professional football as press accounts show he was working as a college football coach starting in 1917 head football coach building phillips university into a football power 1917 1920 in june 1917 maulbetsch announced that he had accepted a position as football coach and professor of chemistry at phillips university in enid oklahoma phillips was a small private school without a well known athletic program in fall enid residents were leaving their work every afternoon to watch maulbetsch and his husky young oklahoma youths work out on campus within a year maulbetsch turned phillips into one of strongest teams in southwest maulbetsch landed his first big recruit before leaving ann arbor while playing at michigan maulbetsch became friends with doug roby a football player at michigan military academy and one of state s top recruits roby followed maulbetsch to phillips and later went on to become a member of international olympic committee in 1950s and 1960s and president of united states olympic committee from 1965 to 1968 maulbetsch s next find was future pro football hall of famer steve owen who later spent 23 years with new york giants maulbetsch saw owen watching football practice from under a tree and told him a fellow your size ought to be out for squad owen showed up next day and when maulbetsch used him to illustrate blocking fundamentals owen threw a block into maulbetsch that threw him five yards through air maulbetsch was satisfied and owen had a spot on team because phillips was not part of a conference it was not subject to any eligibility limitations an advantage maulbetsch was accused of exploiting a third key player recruited by maulbetsch was a native american halfback named levi and dubbed big chief by phillips fans having recruited top talent to enid maulbetsch s teams lost only one game in 1918 and 1919 including a 10 0 1 record in 1919 in 1917 and 1918 phillips came into limelight when they beat oklahoma sooners and henry kendricks college team that had swept west without allowing another team to score maulbetsch arranged a game against texas longhorns in 1919 first meeting between schools when game was announced san antonio light reported phillips university has one of strongest teams in southwest only team to beat them in past two years is oklahoma and last year phillips beat sooners 13 7 report credited maulbetsch for securing success at an institution little known in athletics before he arrived university of texas had not lost a game since 1917 when phillips haymakers arrived in austin texas on october 11 1919 maulbetsch s team shocked longhorns holding them scoreless and winning contest 10 0 one texas newspaper reported that phillips had whitewashed longhorns in their own corral others in texas concluded that phillips success was result of lax or non existent eligibility policies lack of eligibility rules almost certainly did play a part in phillips success when phillips joined southwest conference in 1920 it became bound by conference s eligibility rules and team was outscored 97 0 in conference play against texas a m 47 0 texas 27 0 arkansas 20 0 and texas christian 3 0 galveston daily news noted that maulbetsch s 1920 team could not compare with strong team he surprised texas with in 1919 at end of 1920 season phillips withdrew from southwest conference and maulbetsch accepted a new position at oklahoma a m head coach at oklahoma a m 1921 1928 in january 1921 maulbetsch was hired as head coach at oklahoma agricultural and mechanical college now oklahoma state in stillwater oklahoma he served as coach at oklahoma a m

backfield players to carry footballs with them to classes throughout week and instructed other team members to try knocking balls from under their arms penalty for losing a ball was a hard run around stadium he also ordered one of his ends to wear boxing gloves after he poked an opposing player in eye aggies won only one game against seven defeats in 1928 in late november day after a 46 0 loss to oklahoma newspapers reported that reliable sources had said maulbetsch intended to resign maulbetsch immediately denied rumor saying i have not resigned i am aware that a faction here is trying to get me out but i do not intend to throw up sponge in december pressure to fire maulbetsch grew and one oklahoma newspaper observed coach maulbetsch of a m football team is object of attacks from many sides because of rather poor showing made by his team during past season they are looking for a goat and just now johnnie is cast in that role regardless of his past record those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in position who by fair means or foul will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game ultimately maulbetsch resigned at end of may 1929 as oklahoma a m s coach in football baseball and basketball it was announced that he would spend remaining year of his contract on a leave of
