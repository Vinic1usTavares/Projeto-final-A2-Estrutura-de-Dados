gang from their album light of worlds 1974 stems from j dilla s albums donuts and shining 2006 were made available for use while miike snow were working on iii karlsson presented instrumentals to rest of band and they found one that was so inspirational as original instrumental is chopped and incoherent wyatt learned piano chord progression to complete a continuous pattern that source material lacked he noted that band s own version is somewhat different from original because of this wyatt explained to rolling stone that they experimented with many different samples on iii stating that they are all pop songwriters and they try to conceptualize songs from as weird of a place as possible he added our formula has been take what s great about pop songwriting and leave what s not great about some pop songwriting and present that with as complex an array of instrumental aspects we can add on production side winnberg elaborated to huffpost on topic of sampling for us to do a song based on a j dilla beat is of course a huge tribute to j dilla and we wish that he could be alive and hear it and maybe even like it it s not about taking something and running with it to build on your own success in an interview for spin wyatt deemed my trigger album s best combination of song and track elaborating on difference of two terms i think a song is like just play it on guitar and sing it you look out and see thousands of covers of animal for example there are other tracks that are more reliant upon beat composition and lyrics musically my trigger is an electropop and indie pop song with a hip hop groove and influences of old school motown instrumentation is provided by bass guitar organ piano and timpani wyatt utilizes a falsetto vocal style throughout song it includes a section with electronically manipulated vocals which sounds like a squirrel is having a seizure according to michael pementel of popmatters wyatt told musicomh that my trigger has an almost identical sound to a composition from his unreleased 1993 solo album he also said it recalls music he made with greg kurstin in 1990s while in a band called lyrics of my trigger came about when karlsson came up with line i saw you licking a dollar bill wyatt then went with idea and wrote about a lost weekend with a stripper he previously dated a stripper which inspired single silvia from band s debut album miike snow 2009 but he told notion that narration of my trigger is totally fictional he stated that song is meant to convey a deeper meaning about sex industry in united states you can say some things that feel kind of truthful or that are a little bit more controversial inside of a song that s about something very simplistic he commented that lyrical interpretation is up to listener stating that public can dive in and maybe get something to think about in lyrics or just enjoy beat critic dave simpson of guardian deemed phrase pull my trigger to be laden with innuendo while paul carr of popmatters wrote that it contains most unsubtle innuendo since robert plant asked to squeeze his lemon release and reception miike snow launched a remix competition in collaboration with and on 23 august 2016 where

pop sheen william sutton described it as a fun slice of light hearted pop and wrote electronically manipulated vocals can be slightly grating at times but this is still a good track sputnikmusic s staff reviewer rudy k perceived my trigger as a genuinely great addition to band s catalog and commended its position as opening track of iii ben hogwood of musicomh viewed it as almost as good as genghis khan and felt j dilla sample is screwed up brilliantly kat bein of billboard called song captivating and argued it could use a little kick if it were to be played in dance clubs praising higher self remix included on digital release this remix is all things we love about my trigger with a hefty injection of kick drum and synthetic flourishes diy critic david beech felt my trigger along with two other album tracks possess a pop pomp that s been hinted at only slightly in past he concluded though there s a definite confidence in their composition they certainly feel less organic more contrived than before spin rachel brodsky was critical in her review stating that song lives in upper register but ends up suggesting unappealing prospect of gnarls barkley cutting an elo record writing for popmatters andrew paschal felt it lacked sonic depth asserting while catchy song comes across as a factory produced collection of hooks arbitrarily pasted together with no overarching concept or emotional nuance to guide it music video thumb right 200px video portrays nikita khrushchev left and john f kennedy right ninian doff directed accompanying music video for my trigger doff
