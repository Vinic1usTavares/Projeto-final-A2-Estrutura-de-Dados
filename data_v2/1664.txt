thumb io with two plumes erupting from its surface volcanology of io a moon of jupiter is scientific study of lava flows volcanic pits and volcanism volcanic activity on surface of io its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by voyager 1 imaging scientist linda morabito observations of io by passing spacecraft voyagers galileo cassini and new horizons and earth based astronomers have revealed more than 150 active volcanoes up to 400 such volcanoes are predicted to exist based on these observations io s volcanism makes satellite one of only four known currently volcanically active worlds in solar system other three being earth saturn s moon enceladus and neptune s moon triton first predicted shortly before voyager 1 flyby heat source for io s volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity this differs from earth s internal heating which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion io s eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in jupiter s gravitational pull on satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit causing a varying tidal bulge this variation in shape of io causes frictional heating in its interior without this tidal heating io might have been similar to moon a world of similar size and mass geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters io s volcanism has led to formation of hundreds of volcanic centres and extensive lava formations making it most volcanically active body in solar system three different types of volcanic eruptions have been identified differing in duration intensity lava effusion rate and whether eruption occurs within a volcanic pit known as a patera lava flows on io tens or hundreds of kilometres long have primarily basaltic composition similar to lavas seen on earth at shield volcanoes such as kilauea in hawaii although most of lava on io is made of basalt a few lava flows consisting of sulfur and sulfur dioxide have been seen in addition eruption temperatures as high as were detected which can be explained by eruption of high temperature ultramafic silicate lavas as a result of presence of significant quantities of sulfurous materials in io s crust and on its surface some eruptions propel sulfur sulfur dioxide gas and pyroclastic material up to into space producing large umbrella shaped volcanic plumes this material paints surrounding terrain in red black and or white and provides material for io s patchy atmosphere and jupiter s extensive magnetosphere spacecraft that have flown by io since 1979 have observed numerous surface changes as a result of io s volcanic activity discovery thumb discovery image of active volcanism on io plumes of pele and loki are visible above limb and at terminator respectively before voyager 1 encounter with io on march 5 1979 io was thought to be a dead world much like moon discovery of a cloud of sodium surrounding io led to theories that satellite would be covered in evaporites hints of discoveries to come arose from earth based infrared observations taken in 1970s an anomalously high thermal flux compared to other galilean satellites was discovered during measurements taken at an infrared wavelength of 10 mm while io was in jupiter s shadow at time this heat flux was attributed to surface having a much higher thermal inertia than europa and ganymede these results were considerably different from measurements taken at wavelengths of 20 mm which suggested that io had similar surface properties to other galilean satellites robert nelson and bruce attempted to explain these features in io s spectrum by suggesting fumarolic activity as a mechanism for producing short chain sulphur allotropes on io s surface it has since been determined that greater flux at shorter wavelengths was due to combined flux from io s volcanoes and solar heating whereas solar heating provides a much greater fraction of flux at longer wavelengths a sharp increase in io s thermal emission at 5 mm was observed on february 20 1978 by witteborn et al group considered volcanic activity at time in which case data was fit into a region on io in size at however authors considered that hypothesis unlikely and instead focused on emission from io s interaction with jupiter s magnetosphere shortly before voyager 1 encounter stan peale patrick and r t reynolds published a paper in journal science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend they based this prediction on models of io s interior that took into account massive amount of heat produced by varying tidal pull of jupiter on io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit their calculations suggested that amount of heat generated for an io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone this effect would be even greater with a differentiated io left thumb voyager 1 observation of loki patera and nearby lava flows and volcanic pits voyager 1 s first images of io revealed a lack of impact craters suggesting a very young surface craters are used by geologists to estimate age of a planetary surface number of impact structures increase with age of planetary surface instead voyager 1 observed a multi coloured surface pockmarked with irregular shaped depressions which lacked raised rims characteristic of impact craters voyager 1 also observed flow features formed by low viscosity fluid and tall isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes surface observed suggested that just as peale and colleagues had theorized io was heavily modified by volcanism on march 8 1979 three days after passing jupiter voyager 1 took images of jupiter s moons to help mission controllers determine spacecraft s exact location a process called optical navigation although processing images of io to enhance visibility of background stars navigation engineer linda morabito found a tall cloud along its limb at first she suspected cloud to be a moon behind io but no suitably sized body would have been in that location feature was determined to be a plume generated by active volcanism at a dark depression later named pele following this discovery eight other plumes were located in voyager images of io these plumes were later named after mythological deities associated with fire volcanoes or mayhem loki two separate plumes prometheus volund amirani maui marduk and masubi thermal emission from multiple sources indicative of cooling lava were also found surface changes were observed when images acquired by voyager 2 were compared to those taken four months previously by voyager 1 including new plume deposits at aten patera and surt heat source io s main source of internal heat comes from tidal forces generated by jupiter s gravitational pull this external heating differs from internal heat source for volcanism on earth which is a result of radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion in earth these internal heat sources drive mantle convection which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics tidal heating of io is dependent on its distance from jupiter its orbital eccentricity composition of its interior and its physical state its laplace orbital resonance with europa and ganymede maintains io s eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within io from its orbit eccentricity leads to vertical differences in io s tidal bulge of as much as as jupiter s gravitational pull varies between periapsis and apoapsis points in io s orbit this varying tidal pull also produces friction in io s interior enough to cause significant tidal heating and melting unlike earth where most of its internal heat is released by conduction through crust on io internal heat is released via volcanic activity and generates satellite s high heat flow global total 0 6 1 6 w models of its orbit suggest that amount of tidal heating within io changes with time and that current heat flow is not representative of long term average observed release of heat from io s interior is greater than estimates for amount presently generated from tidal heating suggesting that io is cooling after a period of greater flexing composition right thumb voyager 1 image of volcanic pits and lava flows near ra patera analysis of voyager images led scientists to believe that lava flows on io were composed mostly of various forms of molten elemental sulfur colouration of flows was found to be similar to its various allotropes differences in lava colour and brightness are a function of temperature of polyatomic sulfur and packing and bonding of its atoms an analysis of flows that radiate out from ra patera revealed differently colored materials all associated with liquid sulfur at different distances from vent dark albedo material close to vent at red material in central part of each flow at and orange material at farthest ends of each flow at this colour pattern corresponds to flows radiating out from a central vent cooling as lava travels away from it in addition temperature measurements of thermal emission at loki patera taken by voyager 1 s infrared interferometer spectrometer and radiometer iris instrument were consistent with sulfur volcanism however iris instrument was not capable of detecting wavelengths that are indicative of higher temperatures this meant that temperatures consistent with silicate volcanism were not discovered by voyager despite this voyager scientists deduced that silicates must play a role in io s youthful appearance from its high density and need for silicates to support steep slopes along patera walls contradiction between structural evidence and spectral and temperature data following voyager flybys led to a debate in planetary science community regarding composition of io s lava flows whether they were composed of silicate or sulfurous materials earth based infrared studies in 1980s and 1990s shifted paradigm from one of primarily sulfur volcanism to one where silicate volcanism dominates and sulfur acts in a secondary role in 1986 measurements of a bright eruption on io s leading hemisphere revealed temperatures of at least this is higher than boiling point of sulfur indicating a silicate composition for at least some of io s lava flows similar temperatures were also observed at surt eruption in 1979 between two voyager encounters and at eruption observed by witteborn and colleagues in 1978 in addition modeling of silicate lava flows on io suggested that they cooled rapidly causing their thermal emission to be dominated by lower temperature components such as solidified flows as opposed to small areas covered by still molten lava near actual eruption temperature left thumb thermal emission map of io by galileo silicate volcanism involving basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic magnesium rich compositions was confirmed by galileo spacecraft in 1990s and 2000s from temperature measurements of io s numerous hot spots locations where thermal emission is detected and from spectral measurements of io s dark material temperature measurements from galileo s solid state imager ssi and near infrared mapping spectrometer revealed numerous hot spots with high temperature components ranging from at least to a maximum of like at pillan patera eruption in 1997 initial estimates during course of galileo mission suggesting eruption temperatures approaching have since proven to be overestimates because wrong thermal models were used to calculate temperatures spectral observations of io s dark material suggested presence of such as enstatite magnesium rich silicate minerals common in mafic and ultramafic basalt this dark material is seen in volcanic pits fresh lava flows and pyroclastic deposits surrounding recent explosive volcanic eruptions based on measured temperature of lava and spectral measurements some of lava may be analogous to terrestrial komatiites compressional superheating which could increase temperature of magma during ascent to surface during an eruption may also be a factor in some of higher temperature eruptions although temperature measurements of io s volcanoes settled sulfur versus silicates debate that persisted between voyager and galileo missions at jupiter sulfur and sulfur dioxide still play a significant role in phenomena observed on io both materials have been detected in plumes generated at io s volcanoes with sulfur being a primary constituent of pele type plumes bright flows have been identified on io at tsui fluctus patera and balder patera for example that are suggestive of effusive sulfur or sulfur dioxide volcanism eruption styles observations of io by spacecraft and earth based astronomers have led to identification of differences in types of eruptions seen on satellite three main types identified include intra patera flow dominated and explosion dominated eruptions they differ in terms of duration energy released brightness temperature determined from infrared imaging type of lava flow and whether it is confined within volcanic pits intra patera eruptions right thumb patera an example of a volcanic depression intra patera eruptions occur within volcanic depressions known as paterae which generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls paterae resemble terrestrial calderas but it is unknown whether they form when an empty magma chamber collapses like their terrestrial cousins one hypothesis suggests that they are produced through exhumation of volcanic sills with overlying material either being blasted out or integrated into sill some paterae display evidence for multiple collapses similar to calderas atop olympus mons on mars or kilauea on earth suggesting that they may occasionally form like volcanic calderas because formation mechanism is still uncertain general term for these features uses latin descriptor term employed by international astronomical union in naming them paterae unlike similar features on earth and mars these depressions generally do not lie at peak of shield volcanoes and are larger with an average diameter of patera depths have been measured for only a few paterae and typically exceed 1 km largest volcanic depression on io is loki patera at across whatever formation mechanism morphology and distribution of many paterae suggest that they are structurally controlled with at least half bounded by faults or mountains left thumb infrared image showing night time thermal emission from lava lake pele this eruption style can take form of either lava flows spreading across floor of paterae or lava lakes except for observations by galileo during its seven close flybys it can be difficult to tell difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics intra patera lava flow eruptions such as gish bar patera eruption in 2001 can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across ionian plains flow like features have also been observed within a number of paterae like patera suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors ionian lava lakes are depressions partially filled with molten lava covered by a thin solidified crust these lava lakes are directly connected to a magma reservoir lying below observations of thermal emission at several ionian lava lakes reveal glowing molten rock along patera margin caused by lake s crust breaking up along edge of patera over time because solidified lava is denser than still molten magma below this crust can founder triggering an increase in thermal emission at volcano for some lava lakes like one at pele this occurs continuously making pele one of brightest emitters of heat in near infrared spectrum on io at other sites such as at loki patera this can occur episodically during an overturning episode at these more quiescent lava lakes a wave of foundering crust spreads out across patera at rate of about per day with new crust forming behind it until entire lake has been resurfaced another eruption would only begin once new crust has cooled and thickened enough for it to no longer be buoyant over molten lava during an overturning episode loki can emit up to ten times more heat than when its crust is stable flow dominated eruptions promethean volcanism right thumb patera an example of a flow dominated eruption flow dominated eruptions are long lived events that build up extensive compound lava flows extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on io in this style of eruption magma emerges onto surface from vents on floor of paterae vents surrounding paterae or from fissures on plains producing inflated compound lava flows similar to those seen at kilauea in hawaii images from galileo spacecraft revealed that many of io s major flows like those at prometheus and amirani are produced by build up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows flow dominated eruptions differ from explosion dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time lava erupts at a generally steady rate and flow dominated eruptions can last for years or decades active flow fields more than long have been observed on io at amirani and masubi a relatively inactive flow field named lei kung fluctus covers more than an area slightly larger than nicaragua thickness of flow fields was not determined by galileo but individual breakouts on their surface are likely to be thick in many cases active lava breakouts flow out onto surface at locations tens to hundreds of kilometres from source vent with low amounts of thermal emission observed between it and breakout this suggests that lava flows through lava tubes from source vent to breakout although these eruptions generally have a steady eruption rate larger outbreaks of lava have been observed at many flow dominated eruption sites for example leading edge of prometheus flow field moved between observations by voyager in 1979 and galileo in 1996 although generally dwarfed by explosion dominated eruptions average flow rate at these compound flow fields is much greater than what is observed at similar contemporary lava flows on earth average surface coverage rates of per second were observed at prometheus and amirani during galileo mission compared to per second at kilauea explosion dominated eruptions volcanism right thumb galileo images of active lava flows and fountains at tvashtar paterae in 1999 explosion dominated eruptions are most pronounced of io s eruption styles these eruptions sometimes called outburst eruptions from their earth based detections are characterized by their short duration lasting only weeks or months rapid onset large volumetric flow rates and high thermal emission they lead to a short lived significant increase in io s overall brightness in near infrared most powerful volcanic eruption observed on io was an outburst eruption at surt observed by earth based astronomers on february 22 2001 explosion dominated eruptions occur when a body of magma called a dike from deep within io s partially molten mantle reaches surface at a fissure this results in a spectacular display of lava fountains during beginning of outburst eruption thermal emission is dominated by strong 1 3 mm infrared radiation it is produced by a large amount of exposed fresh lava within fountains at eruption source vent outburst eruptions at tvashtar in november 1999 and february 2007 centred on a long tall lava curtain produced at a small patera nested within larger tvashtar paterae complex large amount of exposed molten lava at these lava fountains has provided researchers with their best opportunity to measure actual temperatures of ionian lavas temperatures suggestive of an ultramafic lava composition similar to pre cambrian komatiites about are dominant at such eruptions though superheating of magma during ascent to surface cannot be ruled out as a factor in high eruption temperatures left thumb two galileo images showing effects of an explosion dominated eruption at pillan patera in 1997 although more explosive lava stage may last only a few days to a week explosion dominated eruptions can continue for weeks to months producing large voluminous silicate lava flows a major eruption in 1997 from a fissure north west of pillan patera produced more than of fresh lava over a to month period and later flooded floor of pillan patera observations by galileo suggest lava coverage rates at pillan between per second during 1997 eruption pillan flow was found to be thick compared to thick flows observed at inflated fields at prometheus and amirani similar rapidly emplaced lava flows were observed by galileo at thor in 2001 such flow rates are similar to those seen at iceland s laki eruption in 1783 and in terrestrial flood basalt eruptions explosion dominated eruptions can produce dramatic but often short lived surface changes around eruption site such as large pyroclastic and plume deposits produced as gas exsolves from lava fountains 1997 pillan eruption produced a wide deposit of dark silicate material and bright sulfur dioxide tvashtar eruptions of 2000 and 2007 generated a tall plume that deposited a ring of red sulfur and sulfur dioxide wide despite dramatic appearance of these features without continuous resupply of material vent surroundings often revert to their pre eruption appearance over a period of months in case of grian patera or years as at pillan patera plumes right thumb sequence of new horizons images showing io s volcano tvashtar spewing material above its surface discovery of volcanic plumes at pele and loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that io was geologically active generally plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from io s volcanoes at speeds reaching creating umbrella shaped clouds of gas and dust additional materials that might be found in volcanic plumes include sodium potassium and chlorine although striking in appearance volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon of 150 or so active volcanoes observed on io plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them limited area of io s lava flows suggests that much of resurfacing needed to erase io s cratering record must come from plume deposits thumb plume near terminator juno december 21 2018 most common type of volcanic plume on io are dust plumes or prometheus type plumes produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost sending material skyward examples of prometheus type plumes include prometheus amirani and masubi these plumes are usually less than tall with eruption velocities around prometheus type plumes are dust rich with a dense inner core and upper canopy shock zone giving them an umbrella like appearance these plumes often form bright circular deposits with a radius ranging between and consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide frost prometheus type plumes are frequently seen at flow dominated eruptions helping make this plume type quite long lived four out of six prometheus type plumes observed by voyager 1 in 1979 were also observed throughout galileo mission and by new horizons in 2007 although dust plume can be clearly seen in sunlit visible light images of io acquired by passing spacecraft many prometheus type plumes have an outer halo of fainter more gas rich material reaching heights approaching that of larger pele type plumes io s largest plumes pele type plumes are created when sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes carrying silicate pyroclastic material with them few pele type plumes that have been observed are usually associated with explosion dominated eruptions and are short lived exception to this is pele which is associated with a long lived active lava lake eruption though plume is thought to be intermittent higher vent temperatures and pressures associated with these plumes generate eruption speeds of up to allowing them to reach heights of between pele type plumes form red from short chain sulfur and black from silicate pyroclastics surface deposits including large wide red rings as seen at pele erupted sulfurous components of pele type plumes are thought to be result of an excess amount of sulfur in io s crust and a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in io s lithosphere they are generally fainter than prometheus type plumes as a result of low dust content causing some to be called stealth plumes these plumes are sometimes only seen in images acquired while io is in shadow of jupiter or those taken in ultraviolet little dust that is visible in sunlit images is generated when sulfur and sulfur dioxide condense as gases reach top of their ballistic trajectories that is why these plumes lack dense central column seen in prometheus type plumes in which dust is generated at plume source
