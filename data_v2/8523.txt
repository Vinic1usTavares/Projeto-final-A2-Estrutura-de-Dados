mass in b minor is johann sebastian bach s only setting of complete latin text of towards end of his life mainly in 1748 and 1749 he finished composing new sections and compiling it into a complex unified structure bach structured work in four parts four sections of manuscript are numbered and bach s usual closing formula s d g is found at end of some parts of mass were used in latin even in lutheran leipzig and bach had composed them five settings of missa containing and and several additional individual settings of and to achieve a setting of complete text of mass he combined his most elaborate missa missa in b minor written in 1733 for court in dresden and a written for christmas of 1724 he added a few new compositions but mostly derived movements from cantata movements in a technique known as parody mass is a compendium of many different styles in vocal composition in both stile antico reminiscent of renaissance music even containing gregorian chant and baroque concertante style of his own time fugal writing and dances arias and a movement for two four part choirs similar to architecture of period bach achieved a symmetry of parts with profession of faith in center and in its center bach scored work for five vocal parts two sopranos alto tenor and bass ssatb while some choral movements are for only four parts is scored for six voices ssaatb and even for two four part choirs bach called for a rich instrumentation of brass woodwinds and strings assigning varied obbligato parts to different instruments history and parody mass was bach s last major artistic undertaking reason for composition is unknown scholars have found no plausible occasion for which work may have been intended joshua rifkin notes likely bach sought to create a paradigmatic example of vocal composition while at same time contributing to venerable musical genre of mass still most demanding and prestigious apart from opera thumb upright title page for missa for dresden from 1733 bach first composed a setting of kyrie and gloria in 1733 for catholic royal court in dresden he presented that composition to frederick augustus ii elector of saxony later as augustus iii also king of poland accompanied by a letter in deepest devotion i present to your royal highness this small product of that science which i have attained in musique with most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to imperfection of its composition but with a most gracious eye and thus take me into your most mighty protection he arranged text in diverse movements for a five part choir and solo voices according to taste in dresden where sacred music borrowed from italian opera with a focus on choral movements as musicologist arthur wenk notes thumb upright left johann sebastian bach towards end of his life by elias gottlob haussmann 1746 alt portrait of bach towards end of his life posing in a dark outfit with a wig holding a single sheet of music in his right hand facing viewer with a serious expression bach expanded missa of 1733 to a from 1748 to 1749 near end of his life in these last years he added three choral movements for its opening and et incarnatus est sanctus was originally an individual movement composed for christmas 1724 in leipzig most other movements of mass are parodies of music from earlier cantatas dating back as far as 1714 wenk points out that bach often used parody to bring a composition to a higher level of perfection original musical sources of several movements are known for others they are lost but score shows that they are copied and reworked bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and affekt for example we give you thanks is based on we thank you god we thank you and crucified is based on general lamenting about situation of faithful christian weeping lamenting worrying fearing which bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for court of weimar bach quoted gregorian chant twice in as a theme and in as a cantus firmus embedded in complex polyphony thumb schloss friedrichsthal alt symmetrical structure of schloss friedrichsthal seen through front gate to property bach achieved a symmetry of parts with profession of faith in center and movement in its center markus rathey associate professor of music history at institute of sacred music at yale school of music sees a similarity to architecture of period such as palace of versailles bach knew buildings in that style for example in gotha built in 1710 rathey continues symmetry on earth mirrors symmetric perfection of heaven purpose of art at this time in architecture visual arts and music was not to create something entirely new but to reflect this divine perfection and in this way to praise god we find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by johann sebastian bach 19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in b minor mass parts kyrie gloria and credo are all designed with choral sections as outer movements framing an intimate center of theological significance according to christoph wolff mass can be seen as a kind of specimen book of his finest compositions in every kind of style from stile antico of palestrina in credo and confiteor and expressively free writing of crucifixus and agnus dei to supreme counterpoint of opening kyrie as well as so many other choruses right up to most modern style in galant solos like christe eleison and domine deus bach made a conscious effort to incorporate all styles that were available to him to encompass all music history as far as it was accessible mass is a compendium of vocal sacred music similar to other collections that bach compiled during last decade of his life such as clavier iii art of fugue goldberg variations great eighteen chorale preludes and musical offering overview given bach s lutheran background and history of composition developed over several decades he deviated from typical structure of mass in five parts and he had composed in 1724 and consisting of and in 1733 when he compiled mass he used these parts added including new compositions and concluded with which is normally part of class wikitable

f sharp form b minor triad butt notes d major as central key corresponding to atonement of christ is structured in symmetry as a sequence of choral movements and solo movements arias and a central duet in three sections first is opened with a chorus followed by an aria closed in last section in symmetry by an aria followed with a chorus middle section alternates choral music with solo movements trumpets are introduced as a symbol of divine glory in several movements beginning and ending in d major with a planned architecture of keys in middle movements central duet is in lowly key of g major referring to christ as a human incarnation of god a corno da caccia appears only once in whole work in movement which is about holiness of god kyrie i first movement is scored for five part choir woodwinds and strings as dresden mass style required it opens with a short homophonic section followed by an extended fugue in two sections which both begin with an instrumental fugue thumb 300px kyrie lento themes by wilderer top and bach christoph wolff notes a similarity between fugue theme and one by johann hugo von wilderer whose mass bach had probably copied and performed in leipzig before 1731 wilderer s mass also has a slow introduction a duet as second movement and a motet in stile antico similar to late renaissance music as third movement bach based work on a composition in c minor as mistakes in copying process show vast movement has aspects of both a fugue and a ritornello movement in first fugal section voices enter in sequence tenor alto soprano i soprano ii bass expanding from middle range to extreme parts just as theme expands from repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards in second fugal section instruments begin in low registers and voices build with every part first in extremely low range from bass to soprano i in both sections instruments open fugue but play with voices once they enter christe thumb 300px incipit of christe acclamation of christ stresses second person of trinity and is therefore rendered as a duet of two sopranos their lines are often parallel in an analogy to christ and god proclaimed as two in one probably a parody of an earlier work it is bach s only extant duet for two sopranos stressing that idea rathey points out that duet is similar in many aspects to love duets of neapolitan opera typical features of these duets are consonant melodies in parallel thirds and sixths or imitating each other with sigh motifs as on word christe rendering christe eleison as a duet follows dresden mass style kyrie ii thumb 300px incipit of kyrie second acclamation of god is a four part choral fugue set in stile antico with instruments playing colla parte this style was preferred at court in dresden theme begins with intervals such as minor seconds and major seconds similar to motif b a c h first entrances build from lowest voice in sequence bass tenor alto soprano according to christoph wolff bach assimilated stricter style of renaissance only in early 1730s after he had composed most of his cantatas and this movement is his first significant product in style gloria is structured in nine movements first and last are similar in style concertante music of eighteenth century in further symmetry opening in two different tempos corresponds to final sequence of an aria leading to soprano ii solo with obbligato violin to alto solo with obbligato oboe and choral movements frame central duet of soprano i and tenor thumb 300px incipit of gloria text of begins with angels song from luke s christmas story bach used this section central duet and concluding doxology as a christmas cantata glory to god in highest probably in 1745 a few years before compilation of mass opening is set as a five part chorus beginning with an instrumental presentation of material in great contrast to first section it is in d major introducing trumpets and timpani first thought glory to god in highest is set in 3 8 time compared by wenk to giga a dance form et in terra pax thumb 300px incipit of et in terra pax continuation of thought within angels song and peace on earth is in common time duration of an eighth note stays same bach thus achieves a contrast of heavenly three eights a symbol of trinity and earthly four quarters voices start this section and trumpets are silent for its beginning but return for its conclusion laudamus te thumb 300px incipit of laudamus te an aria for soprano ii and obbligato violin express praise and adoration of god in vivid coloraturas it has been argued that bach might have thought of dresden taste and specific voice of faustina gratias agimus tibi thumb 300px incipit of gratias agimus tibi a four part chorus in stile antico illustrates idea of thanks and praise again with trumpets and timpani it is based on first choral movement of which also expresses idea of thanks to god and praise of his creation but this cantata movement may have been derived from an even earlier bwv 29 com first part of text devoted to thanks is a melody in even tempo that rises gradually and falls again voices enter without instrumental support in dense succession countersubject on second line propter magnam gloriam tuam for your great glory devoted to glory of god is more complex in rhythm similarly in cantata second line und deine wunder and proclaim your wonders leads to a more vivid countersubject towards end of movement trumpets take part in polyphony of dense movement domine deus thumb 300px incipit of domine deus section addressing god as father and son is again a duet this time of soprano i and tenor voices are often in canon and in parallel as in christe movement is likely another parody possibly from 1729 cantata ihr hauser des himmels bwv as christe it is a love duet addressing jesus both duets appear as center of symmetry within respective part kyrie and gloria here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with orchestra and introduces material that voices pick up rathey points out that scoring at first glance does not seem to match text domine deus rex coelestis lord god heavenly king but it matches continuation domine deus agnus dei lord god lamb of god stressing lutheran crucis theology of cross that omnipotent god is same as one revealed on cross qui tollis thumb 300px incipit of qui tollis thumb 300px alt two lines of musical notation in comparison beginning of first vocal entry in cantata movement and beginning of in mass when text reaches phase who away sins of world music is given to a four part choir with two obbligato flutes movement is based on first choral movement of cantata text was based on book of lamentations a similar expression of grief bach changed key and rhythm because of different text key of b minor connects this description of christ s suffering and mankind s plea for mercy to similar quest in first kyrie keys g b d form g major triad leading to home key of gloria d major bach uses only part of cantata movement without instrumental introduction and second part qui sedes thumb 300px incipit of qui sedes continuation of thought who sits at right hand of father is expressed by an aria for alto and obbligato oboe d amore it is probably a parody in bach s earlier settings of mass he had treated qui tollis and qui sedes as one movement here he distinguished jesus at right hand of father by dance like music wenk likens it to a gigue quoniam tu solus sanctus thumb 300px incipit of quoniam tu solus sanctus last section begins with an aria for bass showing for you alone are holy in an unusual scoring of only corno da caccia and two bassoons paczkowski points out symbolic function of this corno da caccia as well as polonaise by using polonaise bach not only expressed text by musical means but also paid respect to king of poland and elector of saxony august iii to whom mass is dedicated probably a parody it is only movement in work using horn unusual scoring provides a solemn character butt observes that bach uses a rhythmic pattern throughout movement in two bassoons which is even extended into following movement although they originally were independent repeated figure of an provides rhythmic energy of texture cum sancto spiritu thumb 300px incipit of cum sancto spiritu on continuing text with holy spirit choir enters in five parts in symmetry to beginning a homophonic section is followed by a fugue concertante music corresponds in symmetry to opening of gloria both praising god no 2 symbolum nicenum thumb 300px architecture of thumb autograph of first page of text of profession of faith is nicene creed it is structured in three sections regarding father son and holy spirit bach follows structure devoting two choral movements to first section beginning second section with a duet followed by three choral movements and opening third with an aria followed by two choral movements center is set in e minor lowest key of part is also oldest music in mass dating back to 1714 part begins and ends with a sequence of two connected choral movements in contrasting style a motet in stile antico containing a chant melody and a concerto chant melodies are devoted to two of key words of this part credo i believe and confiteor i confess credo in unum deum credo begins with i believe in one god a polyphonic movement for five part choir to which two obbligato violins add independent parts theme is a gregorian chant first presented by tenor in long notes on a walking bass of continuo other voices enter in sequence bass alto soprano i soprano ii each one before former one even finishes its line two violins enter independently reaching a seven part fugue complex counterpoint of seven parts five voices and two violins expands theme of chant often in stretto function and uses a variety of in second exposition sequence of fugue entries bass voice is missing leading to anticipation and a climactic entry in augmentation long notes beginning third exposition just as an entry of first violin ends second exposition musicologist john butt summarizes by using numerous stile antico devices in a particular order and combination bach has created a movement in which a standardised structure breeds a new momentum of its own this movement in stile antico contrasts with following modern concerto style movement this contrast is reminiscent of contrast between two kyrie movements and foreshadows last two movements of symbolum nicenum recent research dates movement to 1747 or 1748 and suggests that it might have been introduction to a credo by a different composer before bach began to assemble mass patrem omnipotentem thumb 300px incipit of patrem omnipotentem thought is continued in to father almighty in a four part choral movement with trumpets movement probably shares its original source with opening chorus of god as your name is so is also your praise which also expresses idea of thanks to god and praise of his creation voices sing a fugue to a concerto of orchestra bass introduces theme without an instrumental opening while other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony as a firm statement theme contains all eight notes of scale as a symbol completeness bach noted at end of movement that it contains 84 measures multiplication of 7 and 12 a hint at symbolic meaning of numbers word appears 49 times 7 7 words 84 times et in unum dominum thumb 300px incipit of et in unum dominum thumb 250px et in unum different articulation of instruments canon of voices belief in jesus christ begins with and in one lord another duet this time of soprano and alto beginning in a canon where second voice follows first after only one beat instruments often play same line with different articulation movement is based on a lost duet which served already in 1733 as basis for a movement of lasst uns sorgen lasst uns wachen bwv 213 bach headed movement which can be translated as two voices express 2 or two vocal parts of article 2 text included originally line illustrating by a descending figure for violins when bach treated as a separate choral movement he rearranged text and figure lost its pictorial association et incarnatus est thumb 300px incipit of et incarnatus est thumb 300px autograph of beginning virgin birth and was incarnate is a five part movement it is probably bach s last vocal composition dating from end of 1749 or first weeks of 1750 until then text had been included in preceding duet late separate setting of words which had been given special attention by previous composers of mass established symmetry of humiliation of god born as man is illustrated by violins in a pattern of one measure that descends and then combines symbol of cross and sighing motifs alluding to crucifixion voices sing a motif of descending triads they enter in imitation starting in measure 4 one voice every measure in sequence alto soprano ii soprano i tenor bass forming a rich texture text out of virgin mary appears in an upward movement et homo factus est and made man is even in upward triads crucifixus thumb 300px incipit of crucifixus thumb 300px passus duriusculus in ground bass crucified center of credo part is oldest music in setting of mass dating back to 1714 it is a passacaglia with chromatic fourth in bass line repeated thirteen times wenk likens it to a sarabande movement is based on first section of first choral movement of bach transposed music from f minor to e minor changed instrumentation and repeated each bass note for more expressiveness bach begins movement with an instrumental setting of bass line while cantata movement started immediately with voices suffering of jesus is expressed in chromatic melodic lines dissonant harmonies and sigh motifs final line on 13th repeat of bass line et est and was buried was newly composed with accompaniment silent and a modulation to g major to lead to following movement at end soprano and alto reach lowest range of movement on final and was buried a pianissimo ending of this movement contrasted by a forte et resurrexit follows dresden mass style et resurrexit thumb 300px incipit of et resurrexit and is risen is expressed by a five part choral movement with trumpets concerto on ascending motifs renders resurrection ascension and second coming all separated by long instrumental interludes and followed by a postlude and will come again is given to bass only for bach vox christi voice of christ wenk likens movement to a dance a light festive movement in triple meter upbeat three eighth notes et in

dominant key to d major main key of part symbolising superiority in contrast to e minor of as lowest point of architecture two oboes d amore open movement with a ritornello with an theme played in parallels which is later picked up by voice ritornello is played between three sections second time shortened and it concludes movement sections cover first holy spirit then his adoration with father and son finally how he acted through prophets and church voice sings in highest register for words and one holy universal church and expands in a repeat of text in long coloraturas words and wenk likens movement to a pastorale a christmas dance often on a drone bass confiteor thumb 300px incipit of confiteor belief in baptism for forgiveness of sins i confess is expressed in strict counterpoint which incorporates a cantus firmus in five part choir is accompanied only by continuo as a walking bass voices first perform a double fugue in stile antico first entries of first theme i proclaim one baptism from soprano to bass followed by first entries of second theme for remission of sinners in sequence tenor alto soprano i soprano ii bass voices follow each other in fast succession only one or two measures apart two themes appear in complex combinations until cantus firmus is heard from measure 73 as a canon in bass and alto and then in augmentation long notes from measure 92 in tenor then movement slows down to adagio a written tempo change rare in bach as altos sing word sinners one last time in an extremely low range as text turns to words and expect resurrection of dead slow music modulates daringly with enharmonic transformations through several keys touching e flat major and g sharp major vividly bringing a sense of dissolving into disorder as well as expectation before resurrection to come whenever word mortuorum appears voices sing long low notes whereas resurrectionem is illustrated in triad motifs leading upwards et expecto thumb 300px incipit of et expecto expectation of a world to come and i expect is a joyful concerto of five voices with trumpets marked vivace a allegro voices begin with a trumpet fanfare in imitation on same text as before movement is based on a choral movement dating from about 1729 which is used in and a related wedding cantata bwv 120a in bwv 120 it sets words exult you delighted voices after this statement which ends in homophony instruments begin a short section in which runs in rising sequences alternate with fanfare in which voices are later embedded word resurrectionem appears then in runs in voices one after other in a second repetition of instruments embedded voices and upward runs brings whole section to a jubilant close on words and life of world to come amen with extended runs on amen wenk likens movement to a bourree a dance in quick duple meter with an upbeat no 3 sanctus sanctus thumb 300px holy is an independent movement written for christmas 1724 scored for six voices ssaatb and a festive orchestra with trumpets and three oboes in original bach had asked for three soprano parts alto tenor and bass only score and duplicate parts of this performance survived music in d major is in common time but dominated by triplets three upper voices sing frequently alternating with three lower voices reminiscent of a passage by isaiah about angels singing holy holy holy to each other number of voices may relate to six wings of seraphim described in that passage pleni sunt coeli continuation full are heavens follows immediately written for same scoring as a fugue in
