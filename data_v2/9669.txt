arbitrarily chosen to distinguish himself from bbc radio 4 presenter and first series he was commissioned to write a novelisation it features a more ambiguous climax and foreshadows a sequel set in an

examine waterfall that gave ben his powers and disaster which caused legendary infertility serial climaxes in a confrontation between tess and deity century who is attempting to fuse with tess s unborn sister century falls is conceptually much darker than its predecessor dark season and his later work which davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers get off on dark stuff in a bafta interview with davies home recalled she very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at boundaries which some of powers that be would rather not have been pushed and a daily mail review of series considered show s themes of arson black magic and communal fear as being on a scale normally reserved for peak time adult viewing series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist who is not heroic and aspirational has poor social skills and is bluntly described by ben as a fat girl a practice which daily mail praised as something that defies thought police century falls was last script he wrote for bbc s children s department for fourteen years he had begun to formulate another successor heat of sun a series set over christmas 1999 and new year s day 2000 which would have included concepts of psychic powers and world domination children s ward while he was writing dark season and century falls davies sought freelance projects elsewhere these included three scripts

write for series on occasion notably he was requested to write 100th episode of series by then called ward which aired in october 1996 instead of celebrating milestone he wrote a script about a recently emerging threat paedophiles in online chat rooms episode was about an x files fan who was drawn in by a paedophile s offer of a rare magazine in denouement of episode child recounts tale of his near abduction and describes his attacker as just a man like any other man episode earned davies his first bafta award 1997 children s bafta for best drama adult television career 1994 2004 during his production tenure on children s ward davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs particularly for soap operas his intention was to eventually work on popular and long running granada

late night soap opera revelations created by him tony wood and brian b thompson series was a tongue in cheek deconstruction of organised religion and featured his first overtly homosexual character a lesbian vicar portrayed by sue holderness who came out of closet in a two hander episode with carole davies attributes revelation about holderness s character as a consequence of both pressure cooker nature of show and recent ordination of female vicars in church of england he let his contract with granada expire and pitched a new early evening soap opera to channel 4 ru with its creator bill moffat sandra hastie a producer on moffat s previous series press gang and co writer paul cornell although slot was eventually taken by hollyoaks he and cornell mutually benefited from pitch davies

novel damaged goods in which doctor tracks a class a drug tainted by time lord technology across several galaxies book includes several themes which davies would intersperse in his later works including a family called tyler and companion chris participating in casual homosexual sex and a subplot formed inspiration for mother war a proposed but never produced thriller for granada about a woman eva jericho and a calcified foetus in her uterus davies continued to propose dramas to channel 4 next drama to be commissioned was springhill an apocalyptic soap opera co created by frank cottrell boyce and paul abbott which aired simultaneously on sky one and channel 4 in 1996 1997 set in suburban liverpool series focuses on devoutly catholic freeman family and their encounter and conflict with eva morrigan katharine rogers he storylined for second series but submitted fewer scripts granada had commissioned him to write for their soap grand temporarily storyline for coronation street and write straight to video special coronation street viva las vegas second series of springhill continued his penchant for symbolism in particular it depicted marion freeman judy holt and eva as personifications of good and evil and climaxed with a finale set in an ultra liberal dystopian future where premarital sex and homosexuality are embraced by church boyce later commented that without davies input show would have been a dry run for abbott s hit show shameless grand davies next project was grand a period soap drama set in a manchester hotel during interwar period it was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with bbc and was scheduled at 9 pm on a friday night after original writer abandoned series granada approached him to write entire show his scripts for first series reflect pessimism of period each episode added its own emotional trauma on staff these included a soldier s execution for desertion a destitute maid who threatened to illegally abort her unborn child to survive and a multi episode storyline centred on chambermaid monica jones jane danson who kills her rapist in self defence is arrested and eventually hanged for murder show was renewed for a second series despite first s dark tone second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development which davies attributed to his friend sally who had previously warned him of adult humour in breakfast serials she told him his show was too bleak to be compared to real life he highlighted sixth and eighth episodes of second series as a time of maturity as a writer for sixth he utilised then unconventional narrative devices such as flashbacks to explore hotel barman s closeted homosexuality and societal attitudes towards sexuality in 1920s and he highlighted eighth as when he allowed series to take on its own life by deliberately inserting plot devices such as mcguffins to enhance comic relief of series although well received series ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series after its cancellation in september 1997 davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series which celebrated his homosexuality queer as folk thumb manchester s gay district on canal street was a major source of inspiration for queer as folk and later bob rose alt canal street during europride 2003 several rainbow flags adorn exterior of bars along road after his near death experience davies started to develop a series for channel 4 which reflected hedonistic lifestyle of gay quarter of manchester he was leaving behind encouraged by ex granada executives catriona mackenzie and neil to go gay series focused on a group of friends in manchester s gay scene tentatively titled other end of ballroom and later queer as fuck by february 1998 when he completed first draft for series premiere series was known under its eventual title queer as folk series emulates dramas such as band of gold in presenting realistic discussion on sexuality as opposed to one sided gay characters in soap operas such as eastenders and eschews heavy handed discussion of issues such as hiv show instead focuses on party scene on canal street after he wrote pilot he approached actors for main characters christopher eccleston was davies first choice for role of stuart jones eccleston declined because of his age and suggested his friend aidan gillen instead roles of vince tyler and nathan maloney were quickly given to craig kelly and charlie hunnam and secondary character alexander perry originally written for television producer phil collinson during his brief acting career was portrayed by antony cotton who later played gay character sean tully in coronation street series was allocated a ps3 000 000 budget and was produced by red productions owned by his friend and former colleague nicola shindler and filmed by cracker and hillsborough director

delaney jason dies of a cocaine overdose unnoticed by his social circle series was transmitted in early 1999 when parliament were discussing lgbt equality series premiere aired on day house of lords was discussing sexual offences bill 1999 which eventually reduced age of consent for homosexual couples to 16 premiere was controversial in particular because it depicted character nathan aged 15 in sexual intercourse with an older man broadcasting watchdog ofcom received 136 complaints and series received criticism from hunnam s parents and from activist mary whitehouse controversy was amplified when sponsor beck s withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained series was not representative of gay culture nevertheless show garnered 3 5 million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans and was renewed for a two episode special due for following year queer as folk 2 was broadcast in 2000 and was driven by plot element of vince s half sister s

generation show ended on february 22 2000 on heels of special davies pitched spin off misfits a late night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by vince s mother hazel and second coming a series which depicted second coming of christ in contemporary manchester misfits was rejected in december 2000 and second coming was initially approved by channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel instead of contesting cancellation of second coming he left channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again bob rose shindler continued to pitch second coming to other television networks while davies sought other ventures his next series was based on a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child he saw relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked couple about their relationship to develop show after he developed series around prejudice he and his gay friends had shown he realised he was creating caricatures for purpose of exposing them and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave couple traditionally british names of bob gossage and rose cooper to simulate a classic love story plot required antagonists in form of bob s best friend and fellow teacher holly vance and rose s boyfriend andy lewis daniel ryan while andy named after davies boyfriend andrew smith was a minor character and departed in third episode holly featured throughout entirety of series bob rose thus followed a similar format to queer as folk in particular triumvirate of main characters composed of a couple and an outsider who lived in contemporary manchester and inverted traditional coming out story by focusing on bob s uncharacteristic attraction to rose bob describes his sexual life by simply speaking line i fancy men and her series was similar to kevin smith film chasing amy 1997 as they both portrayed a romance between a straight character and gay character and resulting ostracism from couple s social circles much like second coming shared its concept with smith s 1999 film dogma like queer as folk bob rose contributed to contemporary political debate around lgbt rights a subplot involves fictional pressure group parents against pah led by bob s mother monica penelope wilton an ardent gay rights activist and their campaign to repeal section 28 of local government act 1988 which prohibited local authorities from intentionally promot ing homosexuality subplot climaxes in fourth episode when monica and bob lead a rally into direct action by handcuffing themselves to a bus run by a company whose management donated millions to keeping law on books scene directly parallels protests against transport company stagecoach due to their founder brian souter s financial and political support of section 28 at one point davies intended to explicitly name stagecoach in script and is inspired by earlier protests undertaken by lgbt rights pressure group outrage after successfully pitching show to itv red productions joined davies in casting show and initially approached jonathan creek star alan davies to portray bob although he was not gay alan davies accepted role and spent several weeks researching first hand manchester s gay scene with series director joe wright his only objection to role was bob being a fan of manchester united f c team shindler had named red productions for because of his prolific support of arsenal f c part of rose was given to lesley sharp her first leading role after her portrayal of secondary characters in past red shows playing field and clocking off and jessica stevenson was cast as holly by itv head of drama nick elliott on basis of her performance in channel 4 comedy spaced series was filmed in southern suburbs of manchester between march

and a british academy television award nomination series had lower viewing figures than expected and was moved to a later timeslot for final two episodes although series was not as successful as he hoped show helped davies rekindle his relationship with his mother shortly before her death just after transmission of fourth episode which he sees as possibly best thing he has ever written second coming shortly after transmission of bob rose davies was approached by abbott to write for his new bbc show linda green he accepted offer and wrote an episode where titular character portrayed by liza tarbuck and her friends attend a schoolmate s funeral and become psychologically haunted by deceased woman s solitary life his first work for bbc in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive doctor who which had then been on hiatus for over a decade in 2002 he met with bbc to discuss revival of show and producing second coming bbc were unable to commit to either and he again declined to work for them after bbc rejected second coming shindler proposed series should be pitched to itv despite story s controversial message critical success of bob rose encouraged channel to commission series for broadcast second coming had been several years in making and endured many rewrites from first draft presented to channel 4 in 2000 but retained its key concept of a depiction of second coming of christ with a humanity centred deity a major removal from script due to time constraints was a long sequence titled night of demons main character a shop assistant stephen baxter who discovers his divine lineage takes over a hotel with his disciples and eventually encounters several of hotel s employees which had been possessed by devil several similar sequences were removed to create a thriller set in days before judgement day an experienced actor was required to portray stephen davies approached christopher eccleston who had previously been approached for role of stuart in queer as folk based on his performance as nicky hutchinson in drama our friends in north eccleston accepted role and helped davies make character more human after he observed baxter was getting lost amid his loftier pronouncements character of judith who would represent fall of god was given to lesley sharp after her performance in bob rose and role of devil was given to mark benton second coming was controversial from its conception when it was a channel 4 project it was subject of a sunday

family who discovers they own entire city of swansea vivaldi inheritance later renamed mine all mine was based on tale of welsh pirate robert edwards and his descendants claim to of real estate in lower manhattan new york city series was a departure from his trend of experimental social commentary it was instead designed to be a mainstream comedy which utilised welsh actors davies and red

principal characters role of family patriarch max vivaldi was given to griff rhys jones at request of itv for prolific actors rhian morgan davies ex girlfriend from wgyt was cast as max s wife val

direction of sheree and tim whitby and utilised many areas of swansea which davies was familiar with since his childhood it aired as four hour long episodes and a ninety minute finale on thursday nights preceding christmas 2003 eventually mine all mine would be his least successful series and ended its run with just over two million viewers which he later blamed on series high eccentricity casanova shortly after transmission of mine all mine bbc commissioned davies to produce revival of doctor who which completed his decade long quest to return series to airwaves at time he was developing two scripts first a cinematic adaptation of charles ingram who wants to be a millionaire scandal was cancelled after he accepted doctor who job and second a dramatisation of life of venetian adventurer and lover giacomo casanova was his next show with red productions davies association with casanova began when london weekend television producers julie gardner michele buck and

instead of potter s focus on sex and misogyny 2005 serial focuses on casanova s compassion and respect for women casanova was filmed alongside first few episodes of new series of doctor who which meant producers common to both projects including davies and gardner made daily journeys between former s production in lancashire and cheshire and latter s production in cardiff red productions also

reached discussion stages in late 1998 and early 2002 his proposals would update show to be better suited for a 21st century audience series would be recorded on film instead of videotape length of each episode would double from twenty five minutes to fifty episodes would primarily take place on earth in style of third doctor jon pertwee unit episodes and davies would remove excess baggage from mythology such as gallifrey and time lords his pitch competed against three others dan freedman s fantasy retelling matthew graham s gothic styled pitch and mark gatiss s reboot which made doctor audience surrogate character instead of his companions davies also took cues from american fantasy television series such as buffy vampire slayer and smallville most notably buffys concepts of series long story arcs and big bad in august 2003 bbc had resolved legal issues over production rights which had surfaced as a result of jointly produced universal studios bbc 20th century fox 1996 doctor

portrayed torchwood as a covert quasi governmental organisation that monitors exploits and suppresses existence of extraterrestrial life and technology upon its transmission torchwood was one of bbc three s most popular shows however it received criticism for adolescent use of sexual and violent themes this led production team to alter format to be subtler in its portrayal of adult themes concurrently he was approached to produce a cbbc show which was described as young doctor who davies was reluctant to diminish mystery of doctor s character and instead pitched a show with elisabeth sladen as once popular companion sarah jane smith sarah jane adventures which follows sarah jane and local schoolchildren as they investigate extraterrestrial events in london borough of ealing show

company it received more favourable reviews than torchwood and a significant periphery demographic which compared show to 1970s doctor who episodes workload of managing three separate shows prompted

shindler and red production company commission by channel 4 marked davies first collaboration with channel since queer as folk and shindler and red since casanova davies was convinced to return to

of middle aged henry best vincent franklin and fallout from a disastrous date with his boyfriend of nine years and is accompanied with banana an e4 anthology series about younger characters across lgbt spectrum on periphery of cucumber narrative and tofu an online documentary series available on all 4 which discusses modern sex sexuality and issues arisen during show with cast and public three names reference a urological scale which categorises male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between two generations although cucumber was designed as a self contained serial about life of one man davies envisioned banana as open ended with potential to continue after its sister series finished a midsummer night s dream a very english scandal years and years and boys after cucumber davies returned to bbc in 2016 to produce a midsummer night s dream an adaptation of william shakespeare s play of same name davies

name about thorpe affair a sex scandal which involved former liberal party leader jeremy thorpe which starred hugh grant as thorpe and ben whishaw as thorpe s former lover norman scott davies

primetime emmy award for outstanding writing for a limited series movie or dramatic special in 2019 in 2017 davies illustrated a book of doctor who poetry now we are six hundred a collection of time

davies was working with red production company to produce years and years a drama series following a family from manchester lyons over fifteen years in a britain affected by political economic and technological changes years and years aired on bbc one in may and june 2019 davies next project boys began filming on 7 october 2019 https www instagram com p hl en channel 4 series is a dramatised retrospective of hiv aids crisis during 1980s focusing on men living in as opposed to films such as pride which focused on gay activists davies notes stories about politics of crisis and virus itself has been told but not those about early victims of virus itself davies describes boys as a way of coming to terms with his own actions during 1980s when shock of crisis prevented him from properly mourning deaths of his close friends future projects after boys davies plans to write a series about which draws inspiration from real life incidents of blackmail which resulted in suicide davies has also expressed interest in adapting charles dickens old curiosity shop for television writing style davies is a self admitted procrastinator and often waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits them to script in writer s tale he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career at time his method of dealing with pressures of delivering a script was to go out drinking instead on one occasion in mid 1990s he was at manchester gay club cruz 101 when he thought of climax to first series of grand as his career progressed he instead spent entire nights just thinking of plot character pace etc and waited until 2 00 am when clubs used to shut to overcome urge of procrastination davies described sense of anxiety he experiences in an email to cook in april 2007 in response to cook s question of how do you know when to start writing he expanded on his email two weeks later in response to cook s query about supposed link between major depressive disorder and creativity he explained his anxiety and melancholy during scriptwriting period still allowed him to keep on top of his work on other hand he thought depression with a capital d didn t provide any such luxury davies explained in length his writing process to cook in writer s tale when he creates characters he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it in case of rose tyler billie piper in his inaugural series of doctor who he chose name because he considered it a good luck charm after he used it for lesley sharp s character in bob rose he presented his desire to make show essentially british as another justification he considered rose to be most british name in world and feminine enough to subvert then current trend of female companions and their boyish names such as benny charley and ace while he was writing for grand executive producer requested that he change female lead character s name a decision that led to character never feeling right from that moment on surname harkness most notably given to torchwood lead captain jack harkness is a similar charm first used in 1993 for harkness family in century falls and ultimately derived from marvel universe supporting character agatha harkness and surname tyler is similarly used because of his affection for how surname is spelled and pronounced davies also attempts to channel his writing by using music that fits theme of series as a source of inspiration doctor who was typically written while he listened to action adventure film scores queer as folk was written to hi nrg music to catch sheer clubland drive bob rose was written to moby album play because two works shared an urban sexy full of lonely hearts at night image and second coming shared concepts of experimental anguish dark ness and pain of radiohead albums more specifically he wrote early drafts of fourth series doctor who episode partners in crime while he was listening to mika s life in cartoon motion and singled out song any other world as a doctor who companion song with lyrics that matched penny planned companion for fourth series when he creates new scripts davies considers denouement of a story to be representative of work he often formulates both scene and its emotional impact early in process but writes scenes last due to his belief that later scenes can t exist if they aren t informed by where they ve come from davies is a strong advocate for continued use of cliffhanger ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices impact of storytelling in pursuit of his quest he instructs editors to remove scenes from press copies of episodes he writes cliffhangers were removed from review copies of doctor who episodes army of ghosts stolen earth and first part of end of time and rose tyler s unadvertised appearance in partners in crime was excised his most noted cliffhanger was in script of stolen earth which created a public sense of doctor who fever in week preceding its conclusion in an interview with bbc news shortly after episode s transmission he argued that success of a popular television series is linked to how well producers can keep secrets and create a live experience davies attempts to both create imagery and to provide a social commentary in his scripts for example he uses camera directions in his scripts more frequently than newer screenwriters to ensure that anyone who reads script especially director is able to feel pace speed atmosphere mood gags and dread his stage directions also create an atmosphere by their formatting and avoidance of first person although basis of several of his scripts derive from previous concepts he claims most concepts for storytelling have been already used and instead tries to tell a relatively new and entertaining plot for example doctor who episode turn left shares its concept most notably with 1998 film sliding doors like how sliding doors examines two timelines based on whether helen quilley gwyneth paltrow catches a london underground train davies uses choice of doctor s companion to turn left or right at a road intersection to depict either a world with doctor as seen throughout rest of fourth series or an alternate world without doctor examined in its entirety within episode world without doctor creates a dystopia which he uses to provide a commentary on nazi esque fascism davies generally tries to make his scripts quite detailed but very succinct and eschews long character and set descriptions instead he limits himself to only three adjectives to describe a character and two lines to describe a set to allow dialogue to describe story instead davies also uses his scripts to examine and debate on large issues such as sexuality and religion especially from a homosexual or atheist perspective he refrains from a dependence on cheap easy lines which provide little deeper insight his mantra during his early adult drama career was no boring issues queer as folk is primary vehicle for his social commentary of homosexuality and advocation of greater acceptance he used series to challenge primal gut instinct of homophobia by introducing homosexual imagery in contrast to heterosexual fundamental image of life of family of childhood and of survival his next series bob rose examined issue of a gay man who falls in love with a woman and reaction of couple s respective social circles torchwood in davies own words is a very bisexual programme and demonstrates a fluid approach to both gender and sexuality almost from its opening moments for example lead character captain jack harkness nonchalantly mentions he was once pregnant and later other lead characters discuss jack s sexuality gay website afterelton opined that torchwoods biggest breakthrough could be queer representation by showing captain jack as a character whose bisexuality is explored but not his only character trait his most notable commentaries of religion and atheism are second coming and his 2007 doctor who episode gridlock second comings depiction of a contemporary and realistic second coming of jesus christ eschews use of religious iconography in favour of a love story underlined by male lead s awakening as son of god in contrast gridlock takes a more pro active role in debating religion episode depicts unity of supporting cast in singing christian hymns abide with me and old rugged cross as a positive aspect of faith but depicts doctor as an atheistic hero which shows faith as misguided because there is no higher authority he also includes his commentary as an undertone in other stories he described sub plot of differing belief systems of doctor and queen victoria in tooth and claw as a conflict between rational man versus head of church like other scriptwriters during doctor whos original tenure several of davies scripts are influenced by his personal politics marc edward of oklahoma city university observes that davies usually espouses a left leaning view through his scripts beyond religion and sexuality davies most notably satirises united states under george w bush on doctor who slitheen in aliens of london and world war three and henry van statten in dalek were portrayed as sociopathic capitalists daleks under his tenure echoed contemporary american conservatives in their appearances from religious fundamentalists in parting of ways to imperialists in daleks in manhattan and evolution of daleks and in sound of drums a parody of bush is murdered by master john simm who was presented in story as a prime minister reminiscent of tony blair other targets of satire in his doctor who scripts include fox news news corporation and 24 hour news cycle in long game plastic surgery and consumer culture in end of world obesity and alternative medicine in partners in crime and racism and paranoia in midnight recognition davies has received recognition for his work since his career as a children s television writer davies first
