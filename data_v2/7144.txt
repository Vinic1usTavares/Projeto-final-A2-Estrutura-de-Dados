real f1 doctor on ward rounds an experience he found difficult we were approaching beds in which people were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes it was really difficult to be there with a patient it s harder than you think and i got quite emotional anderson underwent such extensive training with programme s medical advisors that he jested in june 2009 if i started medical training now i could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of show actor experienced an extended period of anxiety upon joining series and recalls it took me about six months to have any sense of what was going on and then second six months to feel comfortable but only because it s such a well oiled machine you re coming in as a little cog so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while bbc online described oliver s positive qualities as being his boyishly charming manner and his general determination jane simon of daily mirror deemed him a soft touch

his first relationship developed when he attracted attention of ward sisters chrissie williams and daisha anderson daisha showed less interest in him than chrissie of whose attentiveness anderson said i think any hot blooded male would find that attractive oliver appeared to ruin his chances with daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis though anderson noted he does apologise to daisha and sweetly gives her a cupcake this left chrissie free to pursue oliver before their relationship began anderson opined she s gorgeous and oliver would be a fool not to go out with her he thought that oliver and chrissie s unflappable natures made them a good fit for one another though wondered if they were too alike as an older woman their relationship was described as a storyline for chrissie hobley admitted to having fun with storyline due to real age gap between herself and anderson she described chrissie s feelings for oliver stating chrissie is having a lot of fun with him but deep down she s really hoping to find true love she s been quite unlucky so far she s not getting any younger and she s worried about missing out on kids producers kyle and mchale revealed that pair could have been a perfect match however said romance would not run smoothly anderson believed it was a bad idea for his character to get involved with a colleague oliver began to doubt relationship and on penny s advice convinced chrissie to break up with him without ruining his career chrissie took break up well and hobley told what s on tv that her character did not mind as it was only a bit of fun she never planned on settling down with him it was then announced chrissie would become pregnant with oliver s child hobley assessed that chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant but pleased as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not think that she was capable of conceiving another oliver was displeased by news but chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her her father nursing consultant mark williams robert powell urged him to stand up to mark and be a proper man however soon after chrissie miscarried their unborn baby tina hobley chrissie s ready for a baby event occurs at 00 35 retrieved 1 july 2011 she says i don t want anything from you this is my decision to have this baby not yours you re young 24 years old and

sister frieda petrenko developed a crush on him and was pleased when he invited her for a drink however oliver did not reciprocate her feelings and later cancelled fedori commented in january 2011 that she and anderson had had little juicy material more little scenes here and there asked about future of frieda and oliver s relationship she was unwilling to divulge potential plots but noted there s been talk about things heading in all sorts of directions oliver initially had a friendly rivalry with sister penny catherwood believes they always had a really good relationship she characterised siblings relationship as one of constant rivalry but ultimately unconditional support and noted everything always comes more easily to oliver than penny she has spent her life playing catch up when penny considered giving her career up over a patient she was romantically involved with in order to protect her oliver ruined romance their relationship remained unaffected by this catherwood revealed well they are brother and sister so you forgive your family for enormous amounts so it doesn t affect their relationship if anything he is there as soon as she breaks down he s there to catch her full of apologies and support she said situation would bring them closer together because it is a typical scenario siblings go through when catherwood quit series penny was killed whilst attempting to rescue a patient from a train crash her death was not shown on screen a conscious decision made by production team to fully focus on oliver s story series producer craig brown revealed that big focus would be on effect it had on oliver forced to come to terms with her death he faced an emotional rollercoaster of feeling that he was second best to her career having arrived at holby as an f1 oliver quickly progressed onto his f2 training this resulted in professional jealousy forming with penny and in retaliation to their disagreements he put her career in jeopardy by revealing her affair registrar greg douglas was appointed as oliver s mentor fast paced storyline saw greg initially kick ing against his newfound responsibility before realising that oliver could be beneficial to his own career which resulted in an unlikely friendship forming between them though a fairly light buddy buddy storyline to begin with anderson felt that filming their scenes was intensive speaking of their friendship anderson explained we start off on wrong foot with each other and we re competitive which is unhelpful to patients and initially we re not out to help one another at all but they have similarities in terms of dropping people in it pace of storyline had to be changed when anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care and their friendship soon created a negative effect over oliver s work ethic greg s jokes at his expense left oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly oliver s career further deteriorated in early 2011 when it transpired he was not a qualified doctor a series of setbacks failing exam to progress on to his ct1 training blaming a surgical error on penny and death of a patient in his care prompted him to admit that he swapped his own exam paper with penny s in his final year of medical school anderson explained that oliver could no longer cope with mounting pressure hence his confession contrasting siblings he assessed oliver was seen as golden boy when he arrived at holby but he was trading on his sister s success issued with ultimatum of confessing to director of surgery henrik hanssen oliver realised that he must take responsibility lest he lose one person who loves him unconditionally believing himself to be in an impossible dilemma anderson said that oliver was trying to make good on what he had done by repeating his f2 exams by exposing lie he ll end his career oliver can t understand why penny won t stand by him he added that since oliver made a serious surgical error his colleagues had lost trust in his medical capability when a train crash occurred he was forced to take control of aau anderson explained he s not fully qualified and that s all he can think about he s struggling when he saved a patients life oliver thought he should keep his job however he was then told that penny had died news that would change oliver s life forever following penny s death craig brown stated that whether he s good enough to stay in medicine will be oliver s big storyline series explored how oliver coped with her death through a flashback episode henry who plays hanssen observed that oliver s return to work saw him make multiple mistakes and hit rock bottom oliver tried to resign from holby though before he left he responded to a dangerous rta call and saved a patient s life when he was summoned by hanssen about his resignation he was given fatherly advice and senior doctor turned a blind eye to oliver s
