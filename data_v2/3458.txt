empathic civilization race to global consciousness in a world in crisis is a 2010 non fiction book written by jeremy rifkin it connects evolution of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans rifkin considers latest phase of communication and energy regimes that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction as bringing people together on nation state level based on democratic capitalism but at same time creating global problems like climate change pandemics and nuclear proliferation rifkin extrapolates observed trend into future predicting that internet and mobile technology along with small scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems book was published by jeremy p tarcher inc as a hardcover in january 2010 it was noted as being well researched and covering a significant breadth of academic fields however reviews were mixed several reviewers found that while rifkin provided a convincing overview of development of empathy he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co operatively solve global problems background author jeremy rifkin had previously written several books that like empathic civilization have attempted to extrapolate trends in economy technology and society for example his 1995 book end of work concerns changes that tele commuting would have on workplace his 1998 book biotech century concerns expected impacts of genetic engineering and his 2002 book hydrogen economy concerns economic and social effects that will result from expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium his last book before writing empathic civilization was european dream published in 2004 comparing american dream with values expressed by europeans in post industrial economy at time of publication 64 year old rifkin was working as an advisor to european union concerning issues relating to economy climate change and energy security as well as president of american non profit organization foundation on economic trends rifkin argues that global crisis of 2008 and 2011 marks end of a particular energy regime fossil fuels new global economy will be based upon renewable energy like wind power solar energy natural gas etc he calls this distributed capitalism because these energy sources are dispersed rather than centralized they are best controlled by individuals or small communities this will entail a very different power structure from fossil fuel financial capitalism this new structure is networked and decentralized and an inherently much more democratic form of globalization synopsis left thumb author jeremy rifkin 2009 empathic civilization is divided into three parts with an introductory chapter that summarizes contents and arguments of book first part consists of four chapters and analyses empathy from perspective of psychology biology and philosophy rifkin provides a history of empathy in psychology including how it relates to works of freudian psychology melanie klein ronald fairbairn heinz and donald winnicott leading to john bowlby and attachment theory as psychological theory has evolved empathy has played a larger and larger role especially in emotional and intellectual development of children in terms of biology rifkin connects biological function of mirror neurons with capacity for empathy philosophically rifkin explores empathy altruism faith versus reason debate and truth versus reality debate rifkin argues in favour of that meaning of existence is to enter into relationships from lens of empathy he deconstructs concepts of truth freedom democracy equality mortality second part consists of five chapters and focuses on rise development and fall of civilizations rifkin connects qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality hunter gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically in terms of that group spiritually these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales development of writing as well as hydraulics and irrigation allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled hydraulic power was labour intensive requiring large populations of subservient people with scripts there was a shift from a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god decentralization followed collapse of roman empire as each town operated a water or wind mill and printing press distributed literature empowering more people autobiographies started to be written more people married for love rather than other arrangements and concept of privacy democracy and market capitalism was more prevalent people began to organize themselves more into nation states steam and fossil fuels became dominant energy regime and electronic communications like telegraphs radios telephones and television became dominant means of communication with vastly more interaction with other people and cultures there was more emphasis on studying people and psychology personal investments social exploration and creativity became highly valued third part consists of remaining five chapters rifkin extrapolates changes in energy regimes to predict a shift in production towards renewable sources like wind and solar power under distributed i e personal management rifkin also extrapolates changes in communication to predict a proliferation of wireless mobile personal communication that allows people to be constantly connected to others regardless of distance language or other barriers this will evolve people s sense of empathy to create a biosphere wide consciousness and a mode of production he calls distributed capitalism rifkin believes this new system will allow people to solve more complex issues such as climate change and pathogenic pandemics focus more on quality of life rather than materialistic issues and value collaboration over competition style and genre book was noted for its heft in terms of its actual page numbers exhaustive research and dense academic language writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and arts theology philosophy anthropology sociology political science psychology and communication theory book was described as sociobiology empathic civilization was contrasted to book crisis economics by and stephen mihm as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress john n gray s review in guardian described theme of rifkin s argument as a struggle between polar forces of empathy and entropy and that as civilisation has extended reach of empathy beyond family and tribe expanding infrastructure of industry and transport has needed ever larger inputs of energy increasing entropy and wrecking planet publication empathic civilization was published in january 2010 by jeremy p tarcher inc an imprint of penguin group usa in north america and by cambridge polity press in united kingdom cambridge polity press also published book in australia and new zealand beginning in march 2010 a german translation was published by campus verlag and spanish language version was released by mexican publisher mexicana excerpts were published in huffington post and arianna huffington named it one of best books of year reception book received mixed reviews by critics philosopher john n gray s review in guardian found that rifkin spent most of book defending his view that humans are essentially empathic animals and ultimately fails to substantiate its central thesis that empathy in humans will make them able to deal with a world wide crisis like global warming in globe and mail reviewer expressed a similar view that rifkin doesn t explain how empathy can vanquish a physical principle entropy reviewer in edmonton journal admitted book is well researched and presents an immense amount of engaging evidence on empathy but ultimately dismisses it as a shallow intellectual hit due to its simple thesis souped up unnecessarily and impression of having been written in a hurry with a marketing rep scribbling catchphrases over rifkin s shoulder along with edmonton journal review numerous others noted either book s eurocentric interpretation of history or selective historiography michael reviewing for winnipeg free press labelled book ambitious deserving of a wide audience and at times fascinating but ultimately underwhelming dudley found book covers so many topics that few of them are given depth they deserve and that despite book s considerable length it is also surprisingly limited in scope for example dudley was disappointed with few references made to marshall mcluhan and lack of reference to works of julian jaynes likewise reviewer in journal of psychohistory was disappointed with one reference to lloyd demause who reviewer believed would have helped rifkin s case book was reviewed in journal integral leadership review from a spiral dynamics point of view noting that it speaks more towards people at green and turquoise
