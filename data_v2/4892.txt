united airlines flight 232 was a regularly scheduled united airlines flight from denver usa to chicago continuing to philadelphia usa on july 19 1989 dc 10 registered as n1819u serving flight crash landed at sioux city iowa after suffering a catastrophic failure of its tail mounted engine which led to loss of many flight controls at time aircraft was en route from stapleton international airport to o hare international airport of 296 passengers and crew on board 111 died during accident while 185 people survived crash was fifth deadliest one involving dc 10 behind turkish airlines flight 981 american airlines flight 191 air new zealand flight 901 and uta flight 772 despite deaths accident is considered a prime example of successful crew resource management because of large number of survivors and manner in which flight crew handled emergency and landed airplane without conventional control aircraft and crew airplane a mcdonnell douglas dc 10 10 registration n1819u was delivered in 1973 and had been owned by united airlines since then before departure on flight from denver on july 19 1989 airplane had been operated for a total of 43 401 hours and 16 997 cycles a takeoff and subsequent landing is considered an aircraft cycle airplane was powered by cf6 6d high bypass ratio turbofan engines produced by general electric aircraft engines geae captain alfred clair haynes 57 was hired by united airlines in 1956 he had 29 967 hours of total flight time with united airlines of which 7 190 were in dc 10 first officer william roy records 48 was hired by national airlines in 1969 he subsequently worked for pan american world airways he estimated that he had approximately 20 000 hours of total flight time he had 665 hours as a dc 10 first officer second officer dudley joseph dvorak 51 was hired by united airlines in 1986 he estimated that he had approximately 15 000 hours of total flying time he had 1 900 hours as a second officer in boeing 727 and 33 hours as a second officer in dc 10 training check airman captain dennis edward fitch 46 was hired by united airlines in 1968 he estimated that prior to working for united he had accrued at least 1 400 hours of flight time with air national guard with a total flight time of approximately 23 000 hours his total dc 10 time with united was 3 079 hours of which 2 000 hours were accrued as a second officer 1 000 hours as a first officer and 79 hours as a captain he had learned of 1985 crash of japan airlines flight 123 caused by a catastrophic loss of hydraulic control and had wondered if it was possible to control an aircraft using throttles only he had practiced under similar conditions on a simulator eight flight attendants were aboard flight janice t brown barbara a timothy b owens susan white donna

electric cf6 6 engine explosively disintegrated debris penetrated tail in numerous places including horizontal stabilizer puncturing lines of all three hydraulic systems pilots felt a jolt and autopilot disengaged as records took hold of his control column haynes focused on tail engine whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed at dvorak s suggestion a valve cutting fuel to tail engine was shut off this part of emergency took 14 seconds attempts to control plane thumb photo of united airlines flight 232 from ntsb report with damage done by second engine highlighted meanwhile records found that plane did not respond to his control column even with control column turned all way to left commanding maximum left and pulled all way back commanding maximum up that would never be used together in normal aircraft was banking to right with nose dropping haynes attempted to level aircraft with his own control column then both haynes and records tried using their control columns together but aircraft still did not respond afraid aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position an unrecoverable situation crew reduced left wing mounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to right engine this caused airplane to slowly level out various gauges for all three hydraulic systems were registering zero three hydraulic systems were separate so that failure of any one of them would leave crew with full control but lines for all three systems shared same narrow passage through tail where engine debris had penetrated and thus control surfaces were inoperative crew contacted united maintenance personnel via radio but were told that as a total loss of hydraulics on dc 10 was considered virtually impossible there were no established procedures for such an event plane was tending to pull right and slowly oscillated vertically in a phugoid of planes in which control surface command is lost with each iteration of cycle aircraft lost approximately of altitude on learning that fitch an experienced united airlines captain and dc 10 flight instructor was among passengers crew called him into cockpit for assistance haynes asked fitch to observe ailerons through passenger cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect fitch reported back that ailerons were not moving at all nonetheless crew continued to manipulate their control columns for remainder of flight hoping for at least some effect haynes then asked fitch to take over control of throttles so that haynes could concentrate on his control column with one throttle in each hand fitch was able to mitigate phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments atc was contacted and an emergency landing at nearby sioux gateway airport was organized haynes kept his sense of humor during emergency as recorded on plane s cvr fitch i ll tell you what we ll have a beer when this is all done haynes well i don t drink but i ll sure as

united two thirty two heavy wind s currently three six zero at one one three sixty at eleven you re cleared to land on any runway haynes laughter roger laughter you want to be particular and make it a runway huh a more serious remark often quoted from haynes was made when atc asked crew to make a left turn to keep them clear of city haynes whatever you do keep us away from city haynes later noted that we were too busy to be scared you must maintain your composure in airplane or you will die you learn that from your first day flying crash landing as crew began to prepare for arrival at sioux city they questioned whether they should deploy landing gear or belly land aircraft with gear retracted they decided that having landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact complete hydraulic failure left landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative two options were available to flight crew dc 10 is designed so that if hydraulic pressure to landing gear is lost gear will fall down slightly and rest on landing gear doors placing regular landing gear handle in down position will unlock doors mechanically and doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity an alternative system is also available using a lever in cockpit floor to cause landing gear to fall into position this lever has added benefit of unlocking outboard ailerons which are not used in high speed flight and are locked in a neutral position crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them they elected to extend gear with alternative system although gear deployed successfully there was no change in controllability of aircraft landing was originally planned on runway 31 difficulties in controlling aircraft made lining up almost impossible while dumping some of excess fuel plane executed a series of mostly right hand turns it was easier to turn plane in this direction with intention of lining up with runway 31 when they came out they were instead lined up with shorter 6 888 ft and closed runway 22 and had little capacity to maneuver fire trucks had been placed on runway 22 anticipating a landing on nearby runway 31 so all vehicles were quickly moved out of way before plane touched down runway 22 had been permanently closed a year earlier atc also advised that there was a four lane interstate that ran north and south just east of airport which they could land on if they did not think they could make runway pilot opted to try for runway instead

station fitch continued to control aircraft s descent by adjusting engine thrust with loss of all hydraulics flaps could not be extended and since flaps control both minimum required forward speed and sink rate crew were unable to control both airspeed and sink rate on final descent aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1 850 feet per minute approximately 407 km h forward and 34 km h downward speed while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute approximately 260 km h and 5 km h respectively fitch needed a seat for landing dvorak offered up his own as it could be moved to a position behind throttles dvorak sat in cockpit s jump seat for landing fitch noticed high sink rate and that plane started to yaw right again and pushed throttles to full power in an attempt to

spilling fuel which ignited immediately tail section broke off from force of impact and rest of aircraft bounced several times shedding landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking fuselage into several main pieces on final impact right wing was shorn off and main part of aircraft skidded sideways rolled over onto its back and slid to a stop upside down in a corn field to right of runway 22 witnesses reported that aircraft cartwheeled end over end but investigation did not confirm this reports were due to misinterpretation of video of crash that showed flaming right wing tumbling end

injury and reason of death from ntsb report of 296 people on board 111 died most were killed by injuries sustained in multiple impacts but 35 people in middle fuselage section directly above fuel

many of children were traveling alone it was not until 35 minutes after crash that rescuers identified debris that was remains of cockpit with four pilots alive inside all four recovered from their injuries and eventually returned to flight duty investigation thumb tail section of crashed airliner thumb damaged hydraulic systems on dc 10 rear engine s fan disk and blade not be located at accident scene despite an extensive search engine s manufacturer general electric offered rewards of 50 000 for disk and 1 000 for each fan blade three months after crash a farmer discovered most of fan disk with several blades still attached in her cornfield rest of fan disk and most of additional blades were later found nearby ntsb determined that probable cause of this accident was inadequate consideration given to human factors and limitations in inspection and quality control procedures used by united airlines engine overhaul facility these resulted in failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of titanium alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by general electric aircraft engines uncontained manner in which engine failed resulted in high speed metal fragments being hurled from engine these fragments penetrated hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board aircraft which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid subsequent catastrophic disintegration of disk resulted in liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded level of protection provided by design features of hydraulic systems that operate dc 10 s flight controls flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them despite these losses crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using throttles to adjust thrust to remaining wing mounted engines by using each engine independently crew made rough steering adjustments and by using engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude crew guided crippled jet to sioux gateway airport and lined it up for landing on one of runways without use of flaps and slats they were unable to slow down for landing and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent because of inability to flare reduce rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch as a result upon touchdown aircraft broke apart rolled over and caught fire largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to runway despite ferocity of accident 185 62 5 passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including relatively controlled manner of crash and early notification of emergency services failed component thumb fracture is clearly visible in recovered fan disk from center engine of ual 232 investigation while praising actions of flight crew for saving lives would later identify cause of accident as a failure by united airlines maintenance processes and personnel to detect an existing fatigue crack probable cause in report by ntsb read as follows post crash analysis of crack surfaces showed presence of a penetrating fluorescent dye used to detect cracks during maintenance presence of dye indicated that crack was present and should have been detected at a prior inspection detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in united airlines specification of maintenance processes investigators discovered an impurity and fatigue crack in disk titanium reacts with air when melted which creates impurities which can initiate fatigue cracks like that found in crash disk to prevent this ingot that would become fan disk was formed using a double vacuum process raw materials were melted together in a vacuum allowed to cool and solidify then melted in a vacuum once more after double vacuum process ingot was shaped into a billet a sausage like form about 16 inches in diameter and tested using ultrasound to look for defects defects were located and ingot was further processed to remove them but some contamination remained ge later added a third vacuum forming stage because of their investigation into failing rotating titanium engine parts contamination caused what is known as a hard alpha inclusion where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes metal around it to become brittle brittle titanium around impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at edges for next 18 years crack grew slightly each time engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature eventually crack broke open causing disk to fail origins of crash disk are uncertain because of significant irregularities and gaps noted in ntsb report in manufacturing records of ge aircraft engines geae and its suppliers records found after accident indicated that two rough machined forgings having serial number of crash disk had been routed through geae manufacturing records indicated that alcoa supplied ge with timet titanium forgings for one disk with serial number of crash disk some records show that this disk was rejected for an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication that an outside lab performed an ultrasound inspection of this disk that this disk was subsequently returned to ge and that this disk should have been scrapped faa report stated there is no record of warranty claim by geae for defective material and no record of any credit for geae processed by alcoa or timet ge records of second disk having serial number of crash disk indicate that it was made with an rmi titanium billet supplied by alcoa research of ge records showed no other titanium parts were manufactured at ge from this rmi titanium billet during period of 1969 to 1990 ge records indicate that final finishing and inspection of crash disk were completed on december 11 1971 alcoa records indicate that this rmi titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts if alcoa records were accurate rmi titanium could not have been used to manufacture crash disk indicating that initially rejected timet disk with an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication was crash disk cf6 engines like that containing crash disk were used to power many civilian and military aircraft at time of crash due to concerns that accident could recur a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects fan disks on at least two other engines were found to have defects like that of crash disk prioritization and efficiency of inspections of many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of titanium source of crash disk chemical analyses of crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive ntsb report stated that if examined disks were not from same source records on a large number of geae disks are suspect it also means that any ad airworthiness directive action that is based on serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service faa report did not explicitly address impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk influence on industry national transportation safety board ntsb investigation after reconstructions of accident in flight simulators deemed that training for such an event involved too many factors to be practical while some level of control was possible no precision could be achieved and a landing under these conditions was stated to be a highly random event expert pilots were unable to reproduce a survivable landing according to a united pilot who flew with fitch most of simulations never even made it close to ground ntsb stated that under circumstances ual united airlines flight crew performance was highly commendable and greatly exceeded reasonable expectations because this type of aircraft control with loss of control surfaces is difficult for humans to achieve some researchers have attempted to integrate this control ability into computers of fly by wire aircraft early attempts to add ability to real airplanes were not very successful software was based on experiments conducted in flight simulators where jet engines are usually modeled as perfect devices with exactly same thrust on each engine a linear relationship between throttle setting and thrust and instantaneous response to input later computer models were updated to account for these factors and planes have been successfully flown with this software installed titanium processing manufacturing process for titanium was changed in order to eliminate type of gaseous anomaly that served as starting point for crack newer batches of titanium use much higher melting temperatures and a triple vacuum process in an attempt to eliminate such impurities aircraft designs newer aircraft designs such as mcdonnell douglas md 11 have incorporated hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid following ual 232 accident such fuses were installed in number 3 hydraulic system in area below number 2 engine on all dc 10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in tail area although elevator and rudder control would be lost aircrew would still be able to control aircraft s pitch up and down with stabilizer trim and would be able to control roll left and right with some of aircraft s ailerons and spoilers although not an ideal situation system provides a greater measure of control than was available to crew of united 232 it is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in wheel well damage in left wing area caused total loss of pressure from 1 and 2 hydraulic systems 3 system was dented but not penetrated ntsb factual report aviation ntsb august 21 2003 restraints for children of four children deemed too young to require seats of their own lap children one died from smoke inhalation ntsb added a safety recommendation to faa on its list of most wanted safety improvements in may 1999 suggesting a requirement for children under two years old to be safely restrained which was removed in november 2006 accident sparked a campaign led by united flight 232 s senior flight attendant jan brown lohr for all children to have seats on aircraft though it is no longer on most wanted list aircraft restraints for children under two is still recommended practice by ntsb and faa though it is not required by faa as of may 2016 ntsb asked international civil aviation organization to make this a requirement in september 2013 crew resource management accident has since become a prime example of successful crew resource management for much of aviation s history captain was considered final authority and crews were to respect captain s expertise and not question him this began to change in 1970s especially after tenerife airport disaster crew resource management while still considering captain final authority instructs crew members to speak up when they detect a problem and instructs captains to listen to their concerns united airlines instituted a crew resource management class in early 1980s ntsb would later credit this training as valuable toward success of united 232 s crew in handling their emergency faa made crew resource training mandatory in aftermath of accident factors contributing to survival rate of 296 people aboard 111 were killed and 185 survived haynes later identified three factors relating to time of day that increased survival rate accident occurred during daylight hours in good weather accident occurred as a shift change was occurring at both a regional trauma center and a regional burn center in sioux city allowing for more medical personnel to treat injured accident occurred when iowa air national guard was on duty at sioux gateway airport allowing for 285 trained personnel to assist with triage and evacuation of injured had any of those things not been there haynes said i m sure fatality rate would have been a lot higher haynes also credited crew resource management as being one of factors that saved his own life and many others when haynes died in august 2019 united airlines issued a statement thanking him for his exceptional efforts aboard flight as with eastern air lines flight 401 crash of a similarly sized lockheed l 1011 in 1972 relatively shallow angle of descent likely played a large part in relatively high survival

odds against all three hydraulic systems failing simultaneously had previously been calculated as low as a billion to one yet such calculations assume that multiple failures must have independent causes an unrealistic assumption and similar flight control failures have indeed occurred in 1971 a boeing 747 operating as pan am 845 struck approach light structures for reciprocal runway as it lifted off runway at san francisco airport major damage to belly and landing gear resulted which caused loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems fluid which remained in fourth system gave captain very limited control of some of spoilers ailerons and one inboard elevator that was sufficient to circle plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing there were no fatalities but there were some injuries in 1981 a lockheed l 1011 operating as eastern airlines flight 935 suffered a similar failure of its tail mounted number two engine shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage on all four of its hydraulic systems which were also close together in tail structure fluid was lost in three of four systems fourth hydraulic system was struck by shrapnel but not punctured hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled captain to land plane safely with some limited use of outboard spoilers inboard ailerons and horizontal stabilizer plus differential engine power of remaining two engines there were no injuries on august 12 1985 japan airlines flight 123 a boeing 747 suffered a rupture of pressure bulkhead in its tail section caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to rear bulkhead after a seven years earlier pressurized air subsequently rushed out of bulkhead and blew off plane s vertical stabilizer also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems pilots were able to keep plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power but without any hydraulics or stabilizing force of vertical stabilizer plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain there were only 4 survivors among 524 on board this accident is deadliest single aircraft accident in history in 1994 a tupolev tu 154 operating as
