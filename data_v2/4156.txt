antarctic expedition snae 1902 04 was organised and led by william speirs bruce a natural scientist and former medical student from university of edinburgh although overshadowed in prestige terms by robert falcon scott s concurrent discovery expedition snae completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work its achievements included establishment of a manned meteorological station first in antarctic territory and discovery of new land to east of weddell sea its large collection of biological and geological specimens together with those from bruce s earlier travels led to establishment of scottish oceanographical laboratory in 1906 bruce had spent most of 1890s engaged on expeditions to antarctic and arctic regions and by 1899 was britain s most experienced polar scientist in march of that year he applied to join discovery expedition however his proposal to extend that expedition s field of work into weddell sea quadrant using a second ship was dismissed as mischievous rivalry by royal geographical society rgs president sir clements markham bruce reacted by obtaining independent finance his venture was supported and promoted by royal scottish geographical society expedition has been described as by far most cost effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of heroic age despite this bruce received no formal honour or recognition from british government and expedition s members were denied prestigious polar medal despite vigorous lobbying after snae bruce led no more antarctic expeditions although he made regular arctic trips his focus on serious scientific exploration was out of fashion with his times and his achievements unlike those of polar adventurers scott shackleton and amundsen soon faded from public awareness snae

during his student years bruce built up his knowledge of natural sciences and oceanography by studying at summer courses under distinguished tutors such as patrick geddes and john arthur thomson he also spent time working voluntarily under oceanographer dr john murray helping to classify specimens collected during challenger expedition in 1892 bruce gave up his medical studies altogether and embarked on a voyage to antarctic in whaler balaena as part of 1892 93 dundee whaling expedition on his return he began organising an expedition of his own to south georgia claiming that taste i have had has made me ravenous but he could not obtain funding he then worked at a meteorological station on summit of ben nevis before joining jackson harmsworth arctic expedition to franz josef land as a scientific assistant between 1897 and 1899 he made further arctic trips to spitsbergen and to novaya zemlya first on a private trip organised by major andrew coats later as a scientist on arctic survey vessel princess alice this vessel was owned by prince albert of monaco a renowned oceanographer who became a friend and supporter of bruce after returning from arctic in 1899 bruce sent a lengthy letter to royal geographical society in london applying for a scientific post on major antarctic expedition later to be known as discovery expedition which rgs was then organising his recent experiences made it unlikely that there was any other person in british isles at that time better qualified bruce s letter which detailed all his relevant qualifications was acknowledged but not properly answered until more than a year had passed by then bruce s ideas had progressed away from his original expectation of a junior post on scientific staff he now proposed a second ship for expedition separately financed from scottish sources which would work in weddell sea quadrant while main ship was based in ross sea this proposal was denounced by rgs president sir clements markham as mischievous and after some heated correspondence bruce resolved to proceed independently in this way idea of a distinctive scottish national antarctic expedition was born bruce was supported by wealthy coats family who were prepared to give whole hearted financial backing to a scottish expedition under his leadership however as a result he had acquired lasting enmity of markham preparations scotia in autumn of 1901 bruce purchased a norwegian whaler at a cost of ps2 620 approximately ps as of during following months ship was completely rebuilt as an antarctic research vessel with two laboratories a darkroom and extensive specialist equipment two huge revolving cylinders each carrying of cable were fitted to deck to enable deep sea trawling for marine specimens other equipment was installed for making depth soundings for collection of sea water and sea bottom samples and for meteorological and magnetic observations hull was massively reinforced to withstand pressures of antarctic ice and ship was re rigged as a barque with auxiliary engines this work increased cost of ship to ps16 700 approximately ps as of which was met by coats family who altogether donated ps30 000 towards total expedition costs of ps36 000 renamed scotia ship was ready for her sea trials in august 1902 personnel expedition s scientific staff consisted of six persons including bruce zoologist was david wilton who like bruce had been a member of jackson harmsworth expedition he had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern russia robert rudmose brown of university college dundee and formerly an assistant in botany department at british museum was party s botanist dr james harvie pirie who had worked in challenger office under john murray was geologist bacteriologist and expedition s medical officer robert mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work and alastair ross a medical student was taxidermist bruce appointed thomas robertson as captain robertson was an experienced antarctic and arctic sailor who had commanded whaling ship active on dundee whaling expedition rest of 25 officers and men who signed for three year engagements were all scotsmen many used to sailing in icy waters on whaling voyages objectives objectives of expedition were published in scottish geographical magazine and in rgs geographical journal in october 1902 they included establishment of a winter station as near to south pole as is practicable deep sea and other research of antarctic ocean and systematic observations and research of meteorology geology biology topography and terrestrial physics essentially scottish character of expedition was expressed in scotsman shortly before departure leader and all scientific and nautical members of expedition are scots funds have been collected for most part on this side of border it is a product of voluntary effort and unlike expedition which will be simultaneously employed in exploration of antarctic it owes nothing to government help as work of expedition would be mainly at sea or within confines of winter station only a few dogs were taken to facilitate occasional sledge journey rudmose brown records that of original eight dogs four survived expedition they pulled well in harness their only weak point being their paws which were apt to be cut when on rough ice expedition first voyage 1902 03 scotia left troon scotland on 2 november 1902 on her way southward she called at irish port of kingstown now dun laoghaire at funchal in madeira and then cape verde isles before an unsuccessful attempt was made to land at tiny isolated equatorial archipelago known as st paul s rocks this attempt almost cost life of expedition s geologist and medical officer james harvie pirie who was fortunate to escape from shark infested seas after misjudging his leap ashore scotia reached port stanley in falkland islands on 6 january 1903 where she re provisioned for antarctic journey ahead thumb left 350px alt outline map of a group of irregular shaped islands largest of which is labelled coronation island laurie island is shown at eastern right end of group south orkney islands on 26 january scotia set sail for antarctic waters she encountered heavy pack ice on 3 february north of south orkney islands which forced her to manoeuvre next day scotia was able to move southward again and land a small party on saddle island south orkney islands where a large number of botanical and geological specimens were gathered ice conditions prevented any further progress until 10 february after which scotia continued southward along at seven knots under sail on 17 february position was s and five days later they passed 70degs deep within weddell sea shortly after this with new ice forming and threatening ship robertson turned northward having reached 70deg25 s having failed to find land expedition had to decide where to winter matter was of some urgency since sea would soon be freezing over with risk of ship becoming trapped bruce decided to head back to south orkneys and find an anchorage there in contrast to his stated object to winter as far south as possible south orkneys were more than from south pole but northerly location had advantages relatively brief period during which ship would be frozen in would allow more time for trawling and dredging operations in early spring also islands were well situated as a site for a meteorological station their relative proximity to south american mainland opened prospect of establishing a permanent station thumb omond house it took a month of hard sailing before scotia reached islands after several foiled attempts to locate a suitable anchorage and with its rudder seriously damaged by ice ship finally found a sheltered bay on southern shore of laurie island most easterly of south orkneys chain on 25 march ship safely anchored settling into ice from shore she was then rapidly converted to winter quarters with engines dismantled boilers emptied and a canvas canopy enclosing deck bruce instituted a comprehensive programme of work involving meteorological readings trawling for marine samples botanical excursions and collection of biological and geological specimens major task completed during this time was construction of a stone building christened omond house after robert omond director of edinburgh observatory who was a supporter of expedition this building provided living accommodation for parties that would remain on laurie island to operate proposed meteorological laboratory building was constructed from local materials using dry stone method with a roof improvised from wood and canvas sheeting completed house had a footprint of with two windows fitted as quarters for six people rudmose brown wrote considering that we had no mortar and no masons tools it is a wonderfully fine house and very lasting i should think it will be standing a century hence in general party maintained excellent health exception was ship s engineer allan ramsay who had been taken ill with a heart condition in falklands during outward voyage he chose to remain with expedition but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed he died on 6 august and was buried on island as winter turned to spring level of activity increased and there were numerous sledge journeys including some to neighbouring islands near omond house a wooden hut was constructed for magnetic observations and a cairn was built high on top of which union flag and saltire were displayed scotia was made seaworthy again but remained icebound throughout september and october it was not until 23 november that strong winds broke up bay ice allowing her to float free four days later she departed for port stanley

departed for buenos aires where she was to be repaired and provisioned for another season s work bruce had further business in city he intended to persuade argentine government to assume responsibility for laurie island meteorological station after expedition s departure during voyage to buenos aires scotia ran aground in rio de la plata estuary and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug on 24 december during following four weeks while ship was dry docked bruce negotiated with argentine government over future of weather station he was assisted by british resident minister british consul and dr w g davis who was director of argentine meteorological office when contacted by cable british foreign office registered no objection to this scheme on 20 january 1904 bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of argentine government would travel back to laurie island to work for a year under robert mossman as first stage of an annual arrangement he then formally handed over omond house building its furnishings and provisions and all magnetic and meteorological instruments to argentine government station renamed orcadas base has remained operational ever since having been rebuilt and extended several times several of original crew left during buenos aires interlude some through illness and one discharged for misconduct and replacements were recruited locally scotia left for laurie island on 21 january arriving on 14 february a week later having settled meteorological party who were to be relieved a year later by argentine gunboat uruguay scotia set sail for her second voyage to weddell sea second voyage 1904 thumb 250px alt a barren and featureless headland observed from side of a

sea in calm weather no pack ice was encountered before they were south of antarctic circle and they were able to proceed smoothly until on 3 march heavy pack ice stopped ship at s w a sounding was taken revealing a sea depth of compared to which had been general measurement up to that date this suggested that they were approaching land a few hours later they reached an ice barrier which blocked progress towards south east over following days they tracked edge of this barrier southwards for some a sounding from barrier edge gave a depth of only which strongly indicated presence of land behind barrier outlines of this land soon became faintly visible and bruce named it coats land after his chief sponsors this was first positive indicator of eastern limits of weddell sea at high latitude and suggested that sea might be considerably smaller than had been previously supposed a projected visit to coats land by a sledging party was abandoned by bruce because of state of sea ice thumb left alt

march 1904 scotia reached its most southerly latitude of 74deg01 s at this point ship was held fast in pack ice and prospect loomed of becoming trapped for winter it was during this period of inactivity that bagpiper gilbert kerr was photographed serenading a penguin on 13 march ship broke free and began to move slowly north eastward under steam throughout this part of voyage a regular programme of depth soundings trawls and sea bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of oceanography and marine life of weddell sea scotia headed for cape town by a route that took it to gough island an isolated mid atlantic volcanic projection that had never been visited by a scientific party on 21 april bruce and five others spent a day ashore collecting specimens ship then proceeded to cape town arriving on 6 may after carrying out further research work in saldanha bay area scotia sailed for home on 21 may on voyage home party called at saint helena and visited napoleon s exile home which they found neglected and in disrepair on 7 june ship reached ascension island where they were impressed by sight of giant turtles some of them across final port of call was at horta in azores where they stopped briefly on 5 july before heading for home homecoming and after expedition was warmly received on its return to clyde on 21 july 1904 a formal reception for 400 people was held at marine biological station at which john murray read a telegram of congratulation from king edward vii bruce was presented with royal scottish geographical society s gold medal and captain robertson with silver medal following expedition more than 1 100 species of animal life 212 of them previously unknown to science were catalogued however there was no official acknowledgement from london where under influence of markham work of snae tended to be ignored or denigrated its members were not awarded prestigious rgs polar medals which were bestowed on members of discovery expedition when it returned home two months after scotia polar medals would also be awarded after each of sir ernest shackleton s later expeditions and after douglas mawson s australasian expedition bruce fought unavailingly for years to right what he considered a grave injustice a slight on his country and on his expedition some of aversion of london geographical establishment may have arisen from bruce s overt scottish nationalism reflected in his own prefatory note to rudmose brown s expedition history in which he said while science was talisman of expedition scotland was emblazoned on its flag and it may be that in endeavouring to serve humanity by adding another link to golden chain of science we have also shown that nationality of scotland is a power that must be reckoned with thumb left alt a bare stretch of land with ice and snow patches leading to rocky hills in background gough island visited by snae on its return from weddell sea in 1904 photographed in 2005 a significant consequence of expedition was establishment by bruce in edinburgh of scottish oceanographical laboratory which was formally opened by prince albert of monaco in 1906 laboratory served as a repository for large collection of biological zoological and geological specimens amassed during scotia voyages and also during bruce s earlier arctic and antarctic travels it was also a base from which scientific reports of snae could be prepared and it served as general headquarters where polar explorers could meet nansen amundsen and shackleton all visited and where other scottish polar ventures could be planned and organised although bruce continued to visit arctic for scientific and commercial purposes he never led another antarctic expedition his plans for a transcontinental crossing being stifled through lack of funding snae scientific reports took many years to complete most were published between 1907 and 1920 but one volume was delayed until 1992 a proposal to convert laboratory into a permanent scottish national oceanographic institute failed to come to fruition and because of difficulties with funding bruce was forced to close it down in 1919 he died two years later aged 54 by this time scotia expedition was barely remembered even in scotland and it has remained overshadowed in polar histories by more glamorous adventures of scott and shackleton in these histories it is usually confined to a brief mention or footnote with little attention given to its achievements bruce lacked charisma had no public relations skills as prickly as scottish thistle itself according to a lifelong friend and tended to make powerful enemies however in words of oceanographer professor tony rice author of deep ocean natural history museum london 2000 his expedition fulfilled a more comprehensive programme than that of any previous or contemporary antarctic expedition expedition ship scotia was requisitioned during great war and saw service as a freighter on 18 january 1916 she caught fire and was burned out on a sandbank in bristol channel one hundred years after bruce a 2003 expedition in a modern version of scotia used information collected by snae as a basis for examining climate change in south georgia during past century this expedition asserted that its contribution to international debate on global warming would be a fitting testament to snae s pioneering
