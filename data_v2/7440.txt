chelsea bridge is a bridge over river thames in west london connecting chelsea on north bank to battersea on south bank there have been two chelsea bridges on site of what was an ancient ford first chelsea bridge was proposed in 1840s as part of a major development of marshlands on south bank of thames into new battersea park it was a suspension bridge intended to provide convenient access from densely populated north bank to new park although built and operated by government tolls were charged initially in an effort to recoup cost of bridge work on nearby chelsea embankment delayed construction and so bridge initially called victoria bridge did not open until 1858 although well received architecturally as a toll bridge it was unpopular with public and parliament felt obliged to make it toll free on sundays bridge was less of a commercial success than had been anticipated partly because of competition from newly built albert bridge nearby it was acquired by metropolitan board of works in 1877 and tolls were abolished in 1879 bridge was narrow and structurally unsound leading authorities to rename it chelsea bridge to avoid royal family s association with a potential collapse in 1926 it was proposed that old bridge be rebuilt or replaced due to increased volume of users from population growth and introduction of automobile it was demolished during 1934 1937 and replaced by current structure which opened in 1937 new bridge was first self anchored suspension bridge in britain and was built entirely with materials sourced from within british empire during early 1950s it became popular with motorcyclists who staged regular races across bridge one such meeting in 1970 erupted into violence resulting in death of one man and imprisonment of 20 others chelsea

battersea bridge albert bridge victoria now chelsea bridge and grosvenor railway bridge red house inn was an isolated inn on south bank of river thames in marshlands by battersea fields about east of developed street of prosperous farming village of battersea not on any major road its isolation and lack of any police presence made it a popular destination for visitors from london and westminster since 16th century who would travel to red house by wherry attracted by sunday dog fighting bare knuckle boxing bouts and illegal horse racing because of its lawless nature battersea fields was also a popular area for duelling and was venue for 1829 duel between then prime minister duke of wellington and earl of town of chelsea on north bank of thames about west of westminster was an important industrial centre although by 19th century its role as centre of british porcelain industry had been overtaken by west midlands its riverside location and good roads made it an important centre for manufacture of goods to serve nearby and rapidly growing london chelsea waterworks company occupied a site on north bank of thames opposite red house inn founded in 1723 company pumped water from thames to reservoirs around westminster through a network of hollow elm trunks as london spread westwards former farmland to west became increasingly populated and thames became seriously polluted with sewage and animal carcasses in 1852 parliament banned water from being taken from thames downstream of teddington forcing chelsea waterworks company to move upstream to seething wells since 1771 battersea and chelsea had been linked by modest wooden battersea bridge as london grew following advent of railways chelsea began to become congested and in 1842 commission of woods forests and land revenues recommended building of an embankment at chelsea to free new land for development and proposed building of a new bridge downstream of battersea bridge and replacement of battersea bridge with a more modern structure battersea park in early 1840s thomas cubitt and james pennethorne had proposed a plan to use 150 000 tons of rocks and earth from excavation of royal victoria dock to infill marshy battersea fields and create a large public park to serve growing population of chelsea in 1846 commissioners of woods and forests purchased red house inn and of surrounding land and work began on development that would become battersea park it was expected that with opening of park volume of cross river traffic would increase significantly putting further strain on dilapidated battersea bridge consequently in 1846 an act of parliament authorised building of a new toll bridge on site of an ancient ford exactly downstream of battersea bridge approach road on southern side was to run along side of new park while that on northern side was to run from sloane square through former chelsea waterworks site to new bridge although previous toll bridges in area had been built and operated by private companies new bridge was to be built and operated by government under control of metropolitan improvement commission despite protests in parliament from radicals objecting to government profiting from a toll paying bridge it was intended that bridge would be made toll free once costs of building it had been recouped victoria bridge old chelsea bridge engineer thomas page was appointed to build bridge and presented commission with several potential designs including a seven span stone bridge a five span cast iron arch bridge and a suspension bridge commission selected suspension bridge design and work began in 1851 on new bridge to be called victoria bridge design and construction thumb alt suspension bridge crossing a wide river a few buildings can be seen behind bridge first chelsea bridge as seen from battersea in 1858 shortly after opening victoria tower of palace of westminster is shown under construction in background page s design was typical of suspension bridges of period and consisted of a wrought iron deck and four cast iron towers supporting chains which in turn supported weight of deck towers rested on a pair of timber and cast iron piers towers passed through deck meaning that between towers road was narrower than on rest of bridge although work had begun in 1851 delays in closure of chelsea waterworks which only completed its relocation to seething wells in 1856 caused lengthy delays to project and edinburgh made ironwork was only transported to site in 1856 left upright thumb alt golden shield dominated by three circular

span was inscribed with date of construction and words gloria deo in excelsis glory to god in highest it took seven years to build at a total cost of ps90 000 about ps in controversial tolls were collected from octagonal stone tollhouses at each end of bridge as with earlier construction of nearby battersea bridge during excavations workers found large quantities of roman and celtic weapons and skeletons in riverbed leading many historians to conclude that area was site of julius caesar s crossing of thames during 54 bc invasion of britain most significant item found was celtic la tene style bronze and enamel battersea shield one of most important pieces of celtic military equipment found in britain recovered from riverbed during dredging for piers opening on 31 march 1858 queen victoria accompanied by two of her daughters and en route to formal opening of battersea park crossed new bridge and declared it officially open naming it victoria bridge it was opened to public three days later on 3 april 1858 design met with great critical acclaim particularly from illustrated london news shortly after its opening concerns were raised about bridge s safety following an inspection by john hawkshaw and edwin clark in 1861 an additional support chain was added on each side despite strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed at same time name was changed from victoria bridge to chelsea bridge as government was concerned about reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse to be associated with queen left thumb alt perspective view of a wide river running through a green city from upper left to lower right three bridges cross river which contains many small boats battersea top victoria centre and vauxhall bottom bridges 1859 although reasonably well used it was unpopular with public who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it on 4 july 1857 almost a year before bridge s opening a demonstration against tolls attracted 6 000 residents concerns were raised in parliament that poorer industrial workers in chelsea which had no large parks of its own would be unable to afford to use new park in battersea bowing to public pressure shortly after bridge opened parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on sundays and in 1875 it was also made toll free on public holidays additionally because main lights were only turned on when queen victoria was staying in london it was poorly used at night despite this new battersea park was extremely popular particularly sporting facilities on 9 january 1864 park staged world s first official game of association football abolition of tolls in 1873 privately owned albert bridge between chelsea and battersea bridges opened although albert bridge was not as successful as intended at luring customers from chelsea bridge and soon found itself in serious financial difficulties it nonetheless caused a sharp drop in usage of chelsea bridge in 1877 metropolis toll bridges act was passed which allowed metropolitan board of works mbw to buy all london bridges between hammersmith and waterloo bridges and free them from tolls ownership of chelsea bridge was transferred to mbw in 1877 at a cost of ps75 000 about ps in and on 24 may 1879 chelsea bridge battersea bridge and albert bridge were declared toll free by prince of wales in a brief ceremony after which a parade of chelsea pensioners marched across bridge to battersea park by early 20th century chelsea bridge was in poor condition it was unable to carry increasing volume of traffic caused by growth of london and increasing popularity of automobile between 1914 and 1929 use of bridge almost doubled from 6 500 to 12 600 vehicles per day in addition parts of its structure were beginning to work loose and in 1922 gilded finials on towers had to be removed because of concerns that they would fall off architectural opinion had turned heavily against victorian styles and chelsea bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects former president of royal institute of british architects reginald blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921 and there were few people supporting preservation of old bridge in 1926 royal commission on cross river traffic recommended that chelsea bridge be rebuilt or replaced new chelsea bridge left thumb alt

lcc proposed demolishing chelsea bridge and replacing it with a modern six lane bridge at a cost of ps695 000 about ps in because of economic crisis of great depression ministry of transport refused to fund project and lcc was unable to raise funds elsewhere however in an effort to boost employment in battersea area which had suffered badly in depression ministry of transport agreed to underwrite 60 of costs of a cheaper four lane bridge costing ps365 000 about ps in on condition that all materials used in building of bridge be sourced from within british empire design and construction thumb

abutments in 1934 a temporary footbridge which had previously been used during rebuilding works on lambeth bridge was moved into place alongside chelsea bridge and demolition began new bridge also called chelsea bridge was designed by lcc architects g topham forrest and e p wheeler and built by holloway brothers london much wider than older bridge at wide it has a wide roadway and two wide pavements cantilevered out from sides of bridge uniquely in london chelsea bridge is a self anchored suspension bridge first of type to be built in britain horizontal stresses are absorbed by stiffening girders in deck itself and suspension cables are not anchored to ground relieving stress on abutments which are built on soft and unstable london clay piers of new bridge were built on site of old bridge s piers and are built of concrete faced with granite above low water point each side of bridge has a single suspension cable each made up of 37 1 inch 23mm diameter wire ropes bundled to form a hexagonal cable as was agreed with ministry of transport all materials used in bridge came from british empire steel came from scotland and yorkshire granite of piers from aberdeen and cornwall timbers of deck from british columbia and asphalt of roadway from trinidad left thumb alt end of a large red suspension cable attached to a protrusion atop side of bridge deck as a self anchored bridge suspension cables attach directly to deck and do not extend to ground because self anchored structure relies on roadway itself to absorb stresses suspension cables could not be installed until roadway was built however until cables were in place roadway could not be supported to resolve this problem topham had roadway built in sections supported on very tall barges barges were floated into place at low tide and rising tide was used to lift sections above height of piers as tide ebbed roadway dropped into place recently built battersea power station then dominated most views of area so it was decided that bridge s appearance was unimportant consequently in contrast to heavily ornamented 1858 bridge new bridge has a starkly utilitarian design and only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance each features a gilded galleon on top of a coat of arms outward facing sides of all four posts show lcc coat of arms of lion of england st george s cross and

canada william lyon mackenzie king who was in london for coronation of king george vi and queen elizabeth temporary wartime bridge two years after bridge s opening second world war broke out because of their close proximity to chelsea barracks it was expected that enemy bombers would target three road bridges in area and a temporary bridge was built parallel to chelsea bridge as with four other temporary thames bridges built in this period it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes however despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment as it turned out no enemy action took place in area and all three bridges survived war undamaged temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945 motorcycle gangs beginning in 1950s chelsea bridge became a favourite meeting place for motorcyclists who would race across bridge on friday nights on 17 october 1970 a serious confrontation took place on chelsea bridge between essex and chelsea chapters of hells angels and rival motorcycle gangs road rats nightingales windsor angels and jokers around 50 people took part in fight weapons used included motorcycle chains flick knives and at least one spiked flail one member of jokers was shot with a sawn off shotgun and fatally wounded and 20 of those present were sentenced to between one and twelve years imprisonment

scheme chelsea bridge is now floodlit from beneath at night and of light emitting diodes strung along towers and suspension chains intended to complement illuminations of nearby albert bridge although motorcyclists still meet on bridge following complaints from residents about noise their racing has been curtailed chelsea bridge was declared a grade ii listed structure in 2008 providing protection to preserve its character from further alteration battersea park still retains cubitt and pennethorne s original layout and features including a riverfront promenade a formal avenue through centre of
