published as a book in 1967 which truffaut nicknamed audio tapes were used as basis of a documentary in 2015 truffaut sought interview because it was clear to him that hitchcock was not simply mass

year 500 a week contract with hitchcock in october 1961 and he decided to cast her in lead role opposite sean connery in 2016 describing hedren s performance as one of greatest in history of cinema richard brody called film a story of sexual violence inflicted on character played by hedren film is to put it simply sick and it s so because hitchcock was sick he suffered all his life from furious sexual desire suffered from lack of its gratification suffered from inability to transform fantasy into reality and then went ahead and did so virtually by way of his art a 1964 new york times film review called it hitchcock s most disappointing film in years citing hedren s and connery s lack of experience an amateurish script and glaringly fake cardboard backdrops in film marnie edgar hedren

comfort her not rape her hitchcock reportedly replied evan when he sticks it in her i want that camera right on her face citing evan hunter 1997 me and hitch when hunter submitted two versions of

introduced idea of male gaze view of spectator in hitchcock s films she argued is that of heterosexual male protagonist female characters in his films reflected same qualities over and over again

1941 carole lombard brought three cows onto set wearing name tags of lombard robert montgomery and gene raymond stars of film to surprise him hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to directors and screenwriters he told bryan forbes in 1967 i remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth he said we re taught using improvisation we are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to i said that s not acting that s writing walter slezak said that hitchcock knew mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew critics observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances he used same actors in many of his films cary grant worked with hitchcock four times and ingrid bergman three james mason said that hitchcock regarded actors as animated props for hitchcock actors were part of film s setting he told francois truffaut chief requisite for an actor is ability to do nothing well which is by no means as easy as it sounds he should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into picture by director and camera he must allow camera to determine proper emphasis and most effective dramatic highlights writing storyboards and production hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers in writing with hitchcock 2001 steven derosa noted that hitchcock supervised them through every draft asking that they tell story visually he told roger ebert in 1969 hitchcock s films were extensively storyboarded to finest detail he was reported to have never even bothered looking through viewfinder since he did not need to although in publicity photos he was shown doing so he also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision if a studio asked him to change a film he would claim that it was already shot in a single way and that there were no alternative takes to consider bill krohn hitchcock at work london phaidon 2000 p 9 cited in thumb left alt image of hitchcock pictured under mount rushmore during filming of north by northwest hitchcock at mount rushmore filming north by northwest 1959 this view of hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre production than on actual production itself has been challenged by bill krohn american correspondent of french film magazine cahiers du cinema in his book hitchcock at work after investigating script revisions notes to other production personnel written by or to hitchcock and other production material krohn observed that hitchcock s work often deviated from how screenplay was written or how film was originally envisioned he noted that myth of storyboards in relation to hitchcock often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films was to a great degree perpetuated by hitchcock himself or publicity arm of studios for example celebrated crop spraying sequence of north by northwest was not storyboarded at all after scene was filmed publicity department asked hitchcock to make storyboards to promote film and hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match scenes in detail even when storyboards were made scenes that were shot differed from them significantly krohn s analysis of production of hitchcock classics like notorious reveals that hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film s conception during its production another example krohn notes is american remake of man who knew too much whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule something that as krohn notes was not an uncommon occurrence on many of hitchcock s films including strangers on a train and topaz while hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films he was fully that actual film making process often deviated from best laid plans and was flexible to adapt to changes and needs of production as his films were not free from normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions thumb alt close up of hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview hitchcock interview around 1966 krohn s work also sheds light on hitchcock s practice of generally shooting in chronological order which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and more importantly differed from standard operating procedure of hollywood in studio system era equally important is hitchcock s tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes this differed from coverage in that films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give editor options to shape film how he she chooses often under producer s aegis rather they represented hitchcock s tendency to give himself options in editing room where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of work according to krohn this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of hitchcock s personal papers script revisions and like refute notion of hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films whose vision of his films did not change during production which krohn notes has remained central long standing myth of alfred hitchcock both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each film poster for his films hitchcock preferred to work with best talent of his day film poster designers such as bill gold and saul bass who would produce posters that accurately represented his films legacy awards and honours thumb upright 0 9 left one of
