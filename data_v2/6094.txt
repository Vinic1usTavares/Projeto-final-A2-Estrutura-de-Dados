other characters from previous mcu media also appear as well as elements shared with films and television series marvel s agents of s h i e l d season which aired on abc from january 19 to march 1 2016 over 10 episodes aired during season three mid season break of agents of s h i e l d receiving generally positive reviews critics praised performances setting and character development of whitney frost but some elements such as season s ending and humor were criticized and viewership for season was low abc canceled agent carter on may 12 2016 episodes cast and characters main hayley atwell as peggy carter james d arcy as edwin jarvis chad michael murray as jack thompson enver gjokaj as daniel sousa recurring bridget regan as dottie underwood wynn everett as whitney frost reggie austin as

marino as joseph manfredi notable guests ray wise as hugh jones dominic cooper as howard stark lyndsy fonseca as angie martinelli production development in january 2015 showrunners michele fazekas and tara butters confirmed that agent carter was not intended to be a miniseries and that a possible second season would not necessarily be limited to eight episodes like first series was renewed for a second season on may 7 2015 intended to debut in 2016 of 2015 16 season during midseason break of third season of agents of s h i e l d later in may hayley atwell stated season would consist of 10 episodes butters explained that this would probably not allow for any standalone episodes but i definitely think it allows for more character because we can have more personal stories built into framework of overall arching mystery writing before second season was announced fazekas said that we ve certainly been talking about what a second season would look like what s great about structure of this show is you can tell so many different stories and go so many different directions thus butters said of first season storyline featuring leviathan we wrapped up that story already with toby jones cameo as arnim zola in first season finale just a fun tie in rather than something that would be followed up on in second season series creators christopher markus stephen mcfeely revealed they had a really nice story about who peggy is and where she came from that did not make it into first season but they hoped could be explored in a second while fazekas and butters also revealed that there had been a story about carter having a night out with girls to explore her personal life as well as more material for character angie that they felt would both be easier to tell in a second season season two is set in 1947 approximately six months to a year following events of first with time jump made to show people are in a little bit different positions and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don t know about fazekas noted that challenge for season was to find a way to reunite carter with edwin jarvis since he is not an agent that s a really important relationship how do we keep them together nice thing about peggy this season is she s not having to hide her agenda from ssr jarvis is helping her out just in a different way elaborating on ssr s role in season fazekas explained that when markus and mcfeely created organisation for captain america first avenger it was inspired by office of strategic services oss which was somewhat disbanded after war because it was created because of world war ii so now that war is over things are changing and in real history oss sort of became cia and some of its other functions went under other departments there s a little bit of change going on within ssr and so thompson is now new york ssr chief but he has a boss in vernon masters that s going to be saying look things are changing and you need to look out for yourself season also sees daniel sousa promoted to chief of los angeles ssr office fictional company isodyne energy who is involved with nuclear testing in desert was influenced by real life 1940s companies such as general atomic or beginnings of jet propulsion lab all of which were in l a in 40s and were developing space program and were developing nukes additionally season avoids depicting real life hollywood stars from 1940s because focus would shift from story to does that person look or sound like an actor instead character whitney frost is depicted as an actress who will have a part to play in our larger storyline season introduces council of nine based on secret empire who meet at arena club which is like this social club of white guys they re just guys who sort of run world they have orchestrated assassinations we insinuate that they orchestrated 1929 stock market crash members of council include powerful businessmen calvin chadwick and hugh jones and their influence extends to high levels of government as seen with war department veteran vernon masters despite close similarities between a symbol of arena club and a hydra symbol introduced in third season of agents of s h i e l d fazekas stated that she would not say there was a connection between council and hydra with introduction of jason wilkes and frost both considered outsiders as carter was in first season co showrunner chris dingess noted how their arcs in season would be similar yet different to carter s saying i think everyone to get to that place of getting respect has a different road to get there everyone makes different choices along way that define that road and i think with these three characters everyone has a distinct separate path atwell spoke specifically about season s approach to diversity and prejudice and noted that series crew had expanded to include african american and asian writers as well as a female director since first season heavily focused on a woman in a man s world atwell said we re now going into more diversity and we re investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race as we all know if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of time but it becomes less relatable to our audiences especially when marvel world s so diverse on racism issue butters stated we didn t want to just have an african american character and not talk about that that would have been very inauthentic as for sexism frost faces gina and andrea towers of entertainment weekly saw similarities with marvel s jessica jones when frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in smoke mirrors towers said talent agent who asks frost to smile may not be purple man but whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can t deviate from easily at conclusion of season fazekas recalled potential story revolving around carter having a girls night out saying that they realized that once peggy is on mission it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we tried to do it it was like she s not going to stop to go out to dinner she has world to save also they felt they were not properly servicing angie s character instead just sticking her in scenes just to be there resulting in decision to ultimately not bring angie back for season as planned in her place characters of ana jarvis and rose roberts are featured as confidante s for carter both people who are 100 in on peggy s secret angie sort of figures it out at end of first season but ana and rose there is no need to hide truth from them so it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them casting atwell james d arcy chad michael murray and enver gjokaj return from first season to star as peggy carter edwin jarvis jack thompson and daniel sousa respectively by july 2015 it was reported that marvel was working to have bridget regan dottie underwood and lyndsy fonseca angie martinelli return for season at fan expo canada next month atwell confirmed that regan would return for season with dominic cooper and lesley boone later also confirmed to be reprising their roles respectively as howard stark and rose roberts in december 2015 fonseca was confirmed to return for a dream sequence in a little song and dance also returning for second season was ray wise as hugh jones in august 2015 it was revealed that character whitney frost would appear in season and currie graham was cast as her husband calvin chadwick owner of isodyne energy in october wynn everett was revealed to be cast as frost reggie austin was cast as physicist jason wilkes lotte verbeek was cast in role of ana jarvis wife of edwin jarvis and kurtwood smith was revealed to be recurring as vernon masters a veteran of war department next month ken marino was cast as joseph manfredi leader of maggia crime syndicate additionally matt braunger was cast as ssr lab tech aloysius samberly and rey valentin was cast as ssr agent vega dream sequence in a little song and dance dubbed an informal crossover with dancing with stars features many of professional dancers from that series including louis van amstel dmitry chaplin karina smirnoff anna trebunskaya sasha farber and damian whitewood dancers robert roldan malene ostergaard amanda serge lacey alla and paul kirkland are also featured in sequence design series costume designer giovanna ottobre melton took inspiration from films la confidential chinatown and who framed roger rabbit to represent west coast and sunshine noir feel of era for season then just introduced dior new look is also referenced with longer on supporting players dream sequence at beginning of a little song and dance was choreographed by van amstel and begins in black and white before transitioning to color head of make up debra lamia denaver explained that for zero matter wound on frost s face guidelines were for it to be like a cracked porcelain doll and then black matter would come from inside out from there jay wejebe makeup artist designed prosthetics that we use and robin beauchesne key makeup artist created all different avenues dark matter takes using reference photographs and pre made prosthetics make up team were ultimately able to apply effect to everett in 30 minutes filming filming for season began on august 31 and ended on december 19 2015 with edward j pei serving as director of photography unlike first season episodes were filmed concurrently two at a time discussing series location move head of marvel television jeph loeb explained that agent carter season one took place in new york in 1946 it wasn t like we could go to new york and find 1946 so we shot in l a but that s part of reason that when we talked about it we said you know what this season let s stay in l a because so much of l a still looks like it did in 1946 butters expanded by saying move to l a was something we had talked about in middle of first season and we realized that not only was it a good idea for storytelling but also it s much easier for us to shoot l a for l a than try to shoot l a for new york she added season hoped to film at musso frank grill formosa cafe griffith observatory racetracks piers and other locations in downtown los angeles universal studios backlot serves as backlot for film studio stark starts stark pictures with filming also taking place at los angeles river dunbar hotel a famous jazz club where both african americans and caucasians would attend is portrayed in season showrunners looked to films la confidential chinatown big heat and lady from shanghai when shaping visuals for season with additional research provided by pei butters said it doesn t feel like a different show it just feels like an evolution of show visual effects dneg tv provided visual effects for season with sheena duggal returning as visual effects supervisor effects created for season included zero matter and its related properties such as people being frozen and shattered by it dimensional rifts and levitated objects that get sucked into them and wilkes becoming intangible frost s zero matter crack on her face was also augmented with visual effects to add depth sentience and an infinite black by color correcting image with effects animators studying cracking glass to better capture animation effect 20 cast members were digitally scanned and modeled for interaction with zero matter while many other instances required facial tracking markers on actors for zero matter itself design was described as a cross between liquid spiders and magnetic ferrofluid latter being used as an on set reference for actors by duggal main dimensional rifts were designed as black holes based on work of theoretical physicist kip thorne which also inspired double negative s visual effects for interstellar software developed for film was reused for series dneg tv also worked on howard stark s hover car using original computer asset for version seen in captain america first avenger despite original car from film being only a shell and destroyed after picture an identical cadillac was found for dneg to laser scan and incorporate into episode along with real car when it is parked on ground music dance number used in dream sequence from a little song and dance was an original song from lyricist david zippel and series composer christopher lennertz in conjunction with butters and fazekas titled whatcha gonna do it s up to you single was performed by atwell and gjokaj along with hollywood studio symphony and was released on itunes on march 18 2016 marvel cinematic universe tie ins in july 2015 butters revealed that season would feature darkforce which ties to characters doctor strange and marcus daniels latter having appeared in agents of s h i e l d in january 2016 fazekas elaborated saying that darkforce known as zero matter in series is result of a nuclear test gone wrong by isodyne energy looking to history of darkforce in comics fazekas and butters were able to select what we liked and sort of make our own rules as to what it does how it operates and who it affects in our world producers tried to take a scientific approach to explanation of zero matter consulting with theoretical physicist clifford johnson to help ground it in science johnson provided science equations seen on throughout season as well as real world reference for zero matter containment systems showrunners also conversed with eric carroll at marvel studios to ensure anything they were doing with darkforce would not contradict doctor strange script and to see if they could destroy howard stark s hover car which was originally seen as a prototype in captain america first avenger mention in season finale of land stark owns in malibu is a reference to what will become location for home of his son tony in mcu films release broadcast season two of agent carter premiered on january 19 2016 on abc with a two hour premiere during midseason break of third season of agents of s h i e l d it was originally scheduled to premiere on january 5 2016 but was delayed due to an earlier than usual 2016 state of union address season aired until march 1 2016 marketing footage from first episode was screened at new york comic con in october 2015 while first trailer for season was released in november alice walker of screen rant felt that promo highlight ed best parts of show calling it f ast paced and slick and atwell still incredibly charming she further noted that there is a long way to go before we see if they can build on momentum from previous season but so far it looks like a fun adventure conversely kaitlin thomas at tv com called promo weird asking why is abc marketing agent carter like it s one of network s casually daft melodramas instead of a well written drama from a tonal and thematic standpoint series depicted in that trailer feels like polar opposite of what it actually is cutting together a bunch of scenes of peggy punching people or holding a gun does not make her a badass when its framed in this way and frankly it s no wonder people aren t tuning in if that s type of show they think this is in march 2016 maureen ryan writing for variety described season s promotion as lackluster and blamed botched rollout of season 2 for season s ultimately poor viewership reception ratings season averaged 4 37 million total viewers including from dvr ranking 109th among network series in 2015 16 television season it also had an average total 18 49 rating of 1 4 which was 88th critical response review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported a 76 approval rating with an average rating of 7 96 10 based on 21 reviews website s consensus reads a move from new york to hollywood gives agent carter new territory to explore as series continues to search for a storyline as dynamic as its heroine mitchell broussard at we got this covered graded season premiere 4 5 out of 5 stars calling it fantastic and positively comparing it to marvel s ant man by saying agent carter finds a way to make smaller stakes of peggy s noir sandbox as tense credible and addictively watchable as any other addition to mcu broussard highlighted performances of atwell and d arcy as well as new casting additions and called season s pacing due to small episode order exciting he noted that some may be disappointed in more restrained of show releasing so soon after jessica jones but i think that s greatest thing about this world each show feels different and its own thing despite their close proximity varietys brian lowry was less positive praising casting and performances but saying agent carter feels too slavishly locked into s h i e l d formula it s sort of a shame agent carter isn t more compelling since impeccable period trappings and costumes make series a nice change of pace at least visually eric goldman of ign gave season an 8 3 out of 10 praising atwell s performance as well as return of dottie in season and additions of ana jarvis and whitney frost conversely he felt reggie austin as jason wilkes was likable but ultimately character felt a bit bland and that humor in season was pushed a bit too far he concluded i don t think season was quite as tightly constructed as season 1 and tonally it sometimes wrestled with finding right balance between cool spy action elements and likable comedic aspect but overall it was another fun season filled with compelling characters including a strong villain and 1940s marvel flavored spy heroics which benefitted from new visuals los angeles setting gave it molly freeman reviewing season finale for screen rant called season as a whole excellent particularly praising character development given to character of whitney frost but criticized way that season ended that character s storyline stating that finale does a disservice to all character development of whitney throughout season 2 for sake of sweeping her aside as easily as possible and giving other cast members more development and screen time after watching agent carter develop whitney as such a powerful and sympathetic villain earlier this season way show wrapped up her storyline is a disappointment bob chipman in a review of whole season for same website disagreed calling season consistently disappointing and a letdown compared to previous season accolades for season series was nominated for best superhero adaptation series at 42nd saturn
