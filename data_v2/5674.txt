nikola tesla tesla random house webster s unabridged dictionary 10 july 1856 7 january 1943 was a serbian american inventor electrical engineer mechanical engineer and futurist who is best known for his contributions to design of modern alternating current ac electricity supply system born and raised in austrian empire tesla studied engineering and physics in 1870s without receiving a degree and gained practical experience in early 1880s working in telephony and at continental edison in new electric power industry he emigrated in 1884 to united states where he would become a naturalized citizen he worked for a short time at edison machine works in new york city before he struck out on his own with help of partners to finance and market his ideas tesla set up laboratories and companies in new york to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices his alternating current ac induction motor and related polyphase ac patents licensed by westinghouse electric in 1888 earned him a considerable amount of money and became cornerstone of polyphase system which that company would eventually market attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators generators electrical discharge tubes and early x ray imaging he also built a wireless controlled boat one of first ever exhibited tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures throughout 1890s tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high voltage high frequency power experiments in new york and colorado springs in 1893 he made pronouncements on possibility of wireless communication with his devices tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished wardenclyffe tower project an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter but ran out of funding before he could complete it after wardenclyffe tesla experimented with a series of inventions in 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success having spent most of his money tesla lived in a series of new york hotels leaving behind unpaid bills he died in new york city in january 1943 tesla s work fell into relative obscurity following his death until 1960 when general conference on weights and measures named si unit of magnetic flux density tesla in his honor there has been a resurgence in popular interest in tesla since 1990s early years thumb rebuilt tesla s house parish hall in smiljan now in croatia where he was born and rebuilt church where his father served during yugoslav wars several of buildings were severely damaged by fire they were restored and reopened in 2006 thumb upright tesla s baptismal record 28 june 1856 nikola tesla was born an ethnic serb in village smiljan lika county in austrian empire present day croatia on 1856 his father milutin tesla 1819 1879 was an eastern orthodox priest tesla s mother duka tesla nee mandic 1822 1892 whose father was also an orthodox priest had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and ability to memorize serbian epic poems duka had never received a formal education tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother s genetics and influence tesla s progenitors were from western serbia near montenegro tesla was fourth of five children he had three sisters milka angelina and marica and an older brother named dane who was killed in a horse riding accident when tesla was aged five in 1861 tesla attended primary school in smiljan where he studied german arithmetic and religion in 1862 tesla family moved to nearby gospic lika where tesla s father worked as parish priest nikola completed primary school followed by middle school in 1870 tesla moved far north to karlovac to attend high school at higher real gymnasium classes were held in german as it was a school within austro hungarian military frontier thumb left upright tesla s father milutin was an orthodox priest in village of smiljan tesla would later write that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor tesla does not mention which professor this was by name but some sources point conclude this was prof martin sekulic tesla noted that these demonstrations of this mysterious phenomena made him want to know more of this wonderful force tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating he finished a four year term in three years graduating in 1873 in 1873 tesla returned to smiljan shortly after he arrived he contracted cholera was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times tesla s father in a moment of despair who had originally wanted him to enter priesthood promised to send him to best engineering school if he recovered from illness in 1874 tesla evaded conscription into austro hungarian army in smiljan by running away southeast of lika to tomingaj near gracac there he explored mountains wearing hunter s garb tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger both physically and mentally he read many books while in tomingaj and later said that mark twain s works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness in 1875 tesla enrolled at austrian polytechnic in graz austria on a military frontier scholarship during his first year tesla never missed a lecture earned highest grades possible passed nine exams nearly twice as many as required started a serb cultural club and even received a letter of commendation from dean of technical faculty to his father which stated your son is a star of first rank during his second year tesla came into conflict with professor over gramme dynamo when tesla suggested that were not necessary tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a m to 11 p m no sundays or holidays excepted he was mortified when his father made light of those hard won honors after his father s death in 1879 tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father warning that unless he were removed from school tesla would die through overwork at end of his second year tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling during his third year tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money later gambling back his initial losses and returning balance to his family tesla said that he conquered his passion then and there but later in us he was again known to play billiards when examination time came tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study but was denied he did not receive grades for last semester of third year and he never graduated from university thumb left upright tesla aged 23 in december 1878 tesla left graz and severed all relations with his family to hide fact that he dropped out of school his friends thought that he had drowned in nearby mur river tesla moved to maribor where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month he spent his spare time playing cards with local men on streets in march 1879 tesla s father went to maribor to beg his son to return home but he refused nikola suffered a nervous breakdown around same time on 24 march 1879 tesla was returned to gospic under police guard for not having a residence permit on 17 april 1879 milutin tesla died at age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness some sources say that he died of a stroke during that year tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in gospic in january 1880 two of tesla s uncles put together enough money to help him leave gospic for prague where he was to study he arrived too late to enroll at charles ferdinand university he had never studied greek a required subject and he was illiterate in czech another required subject tesla did however attend lectures in philosophy at university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for courses working at budapest telephone exchange in 1881 tesla moved to budapest hungary to work under tivadar puskas at a telegraph company budapest telephone exchange upon arrival tesla realized that company then under construction was not functional so he worked as a draftsman in central telegraph office instead within a few months budapest telephone exchange became functional and tesla was allocated chief electrician position during his employment tesla made many improvements to central station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier which was never patented nor publicly described working at edison in 1882 tivadar puskas got tesla another job in paris with continental edison company tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in form of an electric power utility company had several subdivisions and tesla worked at societe electrique edison division in ivry sur seine suburb of paris in charge of installing lighting system there he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors they also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other edison utilities being built around france and in germany move to united states thumb edison machine works on street new york tesla found change from cosmopolitan europe to working at this shop located amongst tenements on manhattan s lower east side a painful surprise in 1884 edison manager charles batchelor who had been overseeing paris installation was brought back to united states to manage edison machine works a manufacturing division situated in new york city and asked that tesla be brought to us as well in june 1884 tesla emigrated to united states he began working almost immediately at machine works on manhattan s lower east side an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists laborers managing staff and 20 field engineers struggling with task of building large electric utility in that city as in paris tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators historian w bernard carlson notes tesla may have met company founder thomas edison only a couple of times one of those times was noted in tesla s autobiography where after staying up all night repairing damaged dynamos on ocean liner ss oregon he ran into batchelor and edison who made a quip about their parisian being out all night after tesla told them he had been up all night fixing oregon edison commented to batchelor that this is a damned good man one of projects given to tesla was to develop an arc lamp based street lighting system radmilo ivankovic dragan petrovic review of reprinted nikola tesla notebook from edison machine works 1884 1885 com arc lighting was most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with edison low voltage incandescent system causing company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well tesla s designs were never put into production possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that edison cut with an arc lighting company tesla had been working at machine works for a total of six months when he quit what event precipitated his leaving is unclear it may have been over a bonus he did not receive either for redesigning generators or for arc lighting system that was shelved tesla had previous run ins with edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned in his own biography tesla stated manager of edison machine works offered a 50 000 bonus to design twenty four different types of standard machines but it turned out to be a practical joke nikola tesla my inventions autobiography of nikola tesla originally published 1919 p 19 later versions of this story have thomas edison himself offering and then reneging on deal quipping tesla you don t understand our american humor size of bonus in either story has been noted as odd since machine works manager batchelor was stingy with s contemporaries remembered that on a previous occasion machine works manager batchelor had been unwilling to give tesla a 7 a week pay raise seifer wizard life and times of nikola tesla p 38 and company did not have that amount of cash equivalent to 12 million today on hand tesla s diary contains just one comment on what happened at end of his employment a note he scrawled across two pages covering 7 december 1884 to 4 january 1885 saying good by to edison machine works tesla electric light manufacturing soon after leaving edison company tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system possibly same one he had developed at edison in march 1885 he met with patent attorney lemuel w serrell same attorney used by edison to obtain help with submitting patents serrell introduced tesla to two businessmen robert lane and benjamin vail who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in tesla s name tesla electric light manufacturing tesla worked for rest of year obtaining patents that included an improved dc generator first patents issued to tesla in us and building and installing system in rahway new jersey tesla s new system gained notice in technical press which commented on its advanced features investors showed little interest in tesla s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment after utility was up and running in 1886 they decided that manufacturing side of business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility they formed a new utility company abandoning tesla s company and leaving inventor penniless tesla even lost control of patents he had generated since he had assigned them to company in exchange for stock he had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for 2 per day later in life tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship writing my high education in various branches of science mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery account comes from a letter tesla sent in 1938 on occasion of receiving an award from national institute of immigrant welfare john tesla said tesla book co p 280 ac and induction motor thumb right upright drawing from illustrating principle of tesla s alternating current induction motor in late 1886 tesla met alfred s brown a western union superintendent and new york attorney charles f peck two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain based on tesla s new ideas for electrical equipment including a magnetic motor idea they agreed to back inventor financially and handle his patents together they formed tesla electric company in april 1887 with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1 3 to tesla 1 3 to peck and brown and 1 3 to fund development they set up a laboratory for tesla at 89 liberty street in manhattan where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors generators and other devices in 1887 tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current ac a power system format that was rapidly expanding in europe and united states because of its advantages in long distance high voltage transmission motor used polyphase current which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn motor a principle that tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882 thomas parke hughes networks of power electrification in western society 1880 1930 pp 115 118 this innovative electric motor patented in may 1888 was a simple self starting design that did not need a commutator thus avoiding sparking and high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes henry g prout a life of george westinghouse p 129 along with getting motor patented peck and brown arranged to get motor publicized starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent with issue of patent physicist william arnold anthony who tested motor and electrical world magazine editor thomas commerford martin arranged for tesla to demonstrate his ac motor on 16 may 1888 at american institute of electrical engineers engineers working for westinghouse electric manufacturing company reported to george westinghouse that tesla had a viable ac motor and related power system something westinghouse needed for alternating current system he was already marketing westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator less rotating magnetic field based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in march 1888 by italian physicist galileo ferraris but decided that tesla s patent would probably control market thumb left upright nikola tesla s ac dynamo electric machine ac electric generator in an 1888 in july 1888 brown and peck negotiated a licensing deal with george westinghouse for tesla s polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for 60 000 in cash and stock and a royalty of 2 50 per ac horsepower produced by each motor westinghouse also hired tesla for one year for large fee of 2 000 in today s dollars per month to be a consultant at westinghouse electric manufacturing company s pittsburgh labs during that year tesla worked in pittsburgh helping to create an alternating current system to power city s streetcars he found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with other westinghouse engineers over how best to implement ac power between them they settled on a 60 cycle ac system that tesla proposed to match working frequency of tesla s motor but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars since tesla s induction motor could run only at a constant speed they ended up using a dc traction motor instead market turmoil tesla s demonstration of his induction motor and westinghouse s subsequent licensing of patent both in 1888 came at time of extreme competition between electric companies

westinghouse edison and thomson houston were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other there was even a war of currents propaganda campaign going on with edison electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than westinghouse alternating current system quentin r skrabec 2007 george westinghouse gentle genius algora publishing pp 118 120 competing in this market meant westinghouse would not have cash or engineering resources to develop tesla s motor and related polyphase system right away two years after signing tesla contract westinghouse electric was in trouble near collapse of bank in london triggered financial panic of 1890 causing investors to call in their loans to w e westinghouse electric sudden cash shortage forced company to refinance its debts new lenders demanded that westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies research and patents including per motor royalty in tesla contract at that point tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development westinghouse was paying a 15 000 a year guaranteed parke hughes networks of power electrification in western society 1880 1930 1983 p 119 even though operating examples of motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer in early 1891 george westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to tesla in stark terms saying that if he did not meet demands of his lenders he would no longer be in control of westinghouse electric and tesla would have to deal with bankers to try to collect future royalties advantages of having westinghouse continue to champion motor probably seemed obvious to tesla and he agreed to release company from royalty payment clause in contract six years later westinghouse would purchase tesla s patent for a lump sum payment of 216 000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with general electric a

had rented and for next dozen years would work out of a series of workshop laboratory spaces in manhattan these included a lab at 175 grand street 1889 1892 fourth floor of 33 35 south fifth avenue

conduct some of his most significant work in these workshops tesla coil in summer of 1889 tesla traveled to 1889 exposition universelle in paris and learned of heinrich hertz s 1886 88 experiments that proved existence of electromagnetic radiation including radio waves tesla found this new discovery refreshing and decided to explore it more fully in repeating and then expanding on these experiments tesla tried powering a coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that high frequency current overheated iron core and melted insulation between primary and secondary windings in coil to fix this problem tesla came up with his tesla coil with an air gap instead of insulating material between primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of coil citizenship on 30 july 1891 aged 35 tesla became a naturalized citizen of united states naturalization record of

light association tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without use of wires by conducting it through earth tesla served as a vice president of american institute of electrical engineers from 1892 to 1894 forerunner of modern day ieee along with institute of radio engineers steam powered oscillating generator trying to come up with a better way to generate alternating current tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator he patented it in 1893 and introduced it at chicago world s columbian exposition that year steam would be forced into oscillator and rush out through a series of ports pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed producing an alternating magnetic field this induced alternating electric current in wire coils located adjacent it did away with complicated parts of a steam engine generator but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity reciprocating engine 6 february 1894 polyphase system and columbian exposition thumbnail a westinghouse display of tesla polyphase system at chicago s 1893 columbian exposition at beginning of 1893 westinghouse engineer benjamin lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of tesla s induction motor and westinghouse electric started branding their complete polyphase ac system as tesla polyphase system they believed that tesla s patents gave them patent priority over other ac systems westinghouse electric asked tesla to participate in 1893 world s columbian exposition in chicago where company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits westinghouse electric won bid to light exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in history of ac power as company demonstrated to american public safety reliability and efficiency of

wireless lighting system using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout america and europe these included using high voltage high frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas discharge lamp an observer noted tesla also explained principles of rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end using a device that he constructed known as egg of columbus and introduced his new steam powered oscillator ac generator consulting on niagara in 1893 edward dean adams who headed up niagara falls cataract construction company sought tesla s opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at falls over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by falls among systems proposed by several us and european companies were two phase and three phase ac high voltage dc and compressed air adams asked tesla for information about current state of all competing systems tesla advised adams that a two phased system would be most reliable and that there was a westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two phase alternating current company awarded a contract to westinghouse electric for building a two phase ac generating system at niagara falls based on tesla s advice and westinghouse s demonstration at columbian exposition that they could build a complete ac system at same time a further contract was awarded to general electric to build ac distribution system nikola tesla company in 1895 edward dean adams impressed with what he saw when he toured tesla s lab agreed to help found nikola tesla company set up to fund develop and market a variety of previous tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones alfred brown signed on bringing along patents developed under peck and brown board was filled out with william birch rankine and charles f it found few investors mid 1890s was a tough time financially and wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out company would handle tesla s patents for decades to come lab fire in early morning hours of 13 march 1895 south fifth avenue building that housed tesla s lab caught fire it started in basement of building and was so intense tesla s 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into second floor fire not only set back tesla s ongoing projects it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material models and demonstration pieces including many that had been exhibited at 1893 worlds colombian exposition tesla told new york times i am in too much grief to talk what can i say after fire tesla moved to 46 48 east houston street and rebuilt his lab on 6th and 7th floors x ray experimentation thumb left upright x ray of a hand taken by tesla starting in 1894 tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of invisible kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments later identified as roentgen rays or x rays his early experiments were with crookes tubes a cold cathode electrical discharge tube tesla may have inadvertently captured an x ray image predating by a few weeks wilhelm rontgen s december 1895 announcement of discovery of x rays when he tried to photograph mark twain illuminated by a geissler tube an earlier type of gas discharge tube only thing captured in image was metal locking screw on camera lens thumb upright in 1898 tesla demonstrated a radio controlled boat which he hoped to sell as a guided torpedo to navies around world w bernard carlson tesla inventor of electrical age princeton university press 2013 p 231 in march 1896 after hearing of wilhelm rontgen s discovery of x ray and x ray imaging radiography tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in x ray imaging developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from output of tesla coil modern term for phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation in his research tesla devised several experimental setups to produce x rays tesla held that with his circuits instrument will enable one to generate roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus n tesla high frequency oscillators for electro therapeutic and other purposes in proceedings of american electro therapeutic association american electro therapeutic association p 25 tesla noted hazards of working with his circuit and single node x ray producing devices in his many notes on early investigation of this phenomenon he attributed skin damage to various causes he believed early on that damage to skin was not caused by roentgen rays but by ozone generated in contact with skin and to a lesser extent by nitrous acid tesla incorrectly believed that x rays were longitudinal waves such as those produced in waves in plasmas these plasma waves can occur in force free magnetic fields griffiths david j introduction to electrodynamics and jackson john d classical electrodynamics on 11 july 1934 new york herald tribune published an article on tesla in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single electrode vacuum tubes a minute particle would break off cathode pass out of tube and physically strike him tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body and again at place where it passed out in comparing these particles with bits of metal projected by his electric gun tesla said particles in beam of force will travel much faster than such particles and they will travel in concentrations radio remote control in 1898 tesla demonstrated a boat that used a based radio control which he dubbed to public during an electrical exhibition at madison square garden crowd that witnessed demonstration made outrageous claims about workings of boat such as magic telepathy and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside tesla tried to sell his idea to us military as a type of radio controlled torpedo but they showed little interest remote radio control remained a novelty until world war i and afterward when a number of countries used it in military programs fitzsimons bernard ed fritz x in illustrated encyclopedia of 20th century weapons and warfare london phoebus 1978 volume 10 p 1037 tesla took opportunity to further demonstrate in an address to a meeting of commercial club in chicago while he was travelling to colorado springs on 13 may 1899 wireless power thumb upright tesla sitting in front of a spiral coil used in his wireless power experiments at his east houston st laboratory from 1890s through 1906 tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop transmission of electrical power without wires it was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting he saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around world but also as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures a way to transmit worldwide communications at time tesla was formulating his ideas there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances let alone large amounts of power tesla had studied radio waves early on and came to conclusion that part of existing study on them by hertz was incorrect tesla s own experiments led him to erroneously believe hertz had misidentified a form of conduction instead of a new form of electromagnetic radiation an incorrect assumption that tesla would hold on to for a couple of decades carlson pp 127 128 white nikola tesla guy who didn t invent radio also this new form of radiation was widely considered at time to be a short distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile brian regal radio life story of a technology p 22 tesla noted that even if theories on radio waves were true they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of invisible light would diminish over distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space becoming hopelessly lost by mid 1890s tesla was working on idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through earth or atmosphere and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his east houston street lab my inventions autobiography of nikola tesla hart brothers 1982 ch 5 tesla on electricity without wires electrical engineer n y 8 january 1896 p 52 refers to letter by tesla in new york herald 31 december 1895 mining scientific press electrical progress nikola tesla is credited with statement 11 april 1896 seeming to borrow from a common idea at time that earth s atmosphere was conductive he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending transmitting and receiving electrodes in air above in altitude where he thought lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages millions of volts long distances colorado springs thumb upright tesla s colorado springs laboratory to further study conductive nature of low pressure air tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in colorado springs during 1899 nikola tesla on his work with alternating currents and their application to wireless telegraphy telephony and transmission of power leland i anderson 21st century books 2002 p 109 there he could safely operate much larger coils than in cramped confines of his new york lab and an associate had made an arrangement for el paso power company to supply alternating current free of charge to fund his experiments he convinced john jacob astor iv to invest 100 000 in today s dollars to become a majority share holder in nikola tesla company astor thought he was primarily investing in new wireless lighting system instead tesla used money to fund his colorado springs experiments upon his arrival he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments transmitting signals from pikes peak to paris thumb left a multiple exposure picture of tesla sitting next to his magnifying transmitter generating millions of volts long arcs were not part of normal operation but only produced for effect by rapidly cycling power switch there he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in range producing artificial lightning and thunder consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to in length gillispie charles coulston dictionary of scientific biography tesla nikola charles scribner s sons new york and at one point inadvertently burned out generator in el paso causing a power outage observations he made of electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to incorrectly conclude that he could use entire globe of earth to conduct electrical energy during his time at his laboratory tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet he mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in december blair stewart 1999 tesla modern sorcerer frog book p 372 and to red cross society in december 1900 reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to conclusion tesla was hearing signals from mars he expanded on signals he heard in a 9 february 1901 collier s weekly article entitled talking with planets where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing intelligently controlled signals and that signals could have come from mars venus or other planets it has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted guglielmo marconi s european experiments in july 1899 marconi may have transmitted letter s dot dot dot in a naval demonstration same three impulses that tesla hinted at hearing in colorado or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission tesla had an agreement with editor of century magazine to produce an article on his findings magazine sent a photographer to colorado to photograph work being done there article titled problem of increasing human energy appeared in june 1900 edition of magazine he explained superiority of wireless system he envisioned but article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work illustrated with what were to become iconic images of tesla and his colorado springs experiments wardenclyffe thumb upright tesla s wardenclyffe plant on long island in 1904 from this facility tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless transmission of electrical energy across atlantic tesla made rounds in new york trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission wining and dining them at waldorf astoria s palm garden hotel where he was living at time players club and delmonico s in march 1901 he obtained 150 000 in today s dollars from j pierpont morgan in return for a 51 share of any generated wireless patents and began planning wardenclyffe tower facility to be built in shoreham new york east of city on north shore of long island by july 1901 tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of marconi s radio based system which tesla thought was a copy of his own he approached morgan to ask for more money to build larger system but morgan refused to supply any further funds in december 1901 marconi successfully transmitted letter s from england to newfoundland defeating tesla in race to be first to complete such a transmission a month after marconi s success tesla tried to get morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling vibrations throughout globe over next five years tesla wrote more than 50 letters to morgan pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete construction of wardenclyffe tesla continued project for another nine months into 1902 tower was erected to its full height of in june 1902 tesla moved his lab operations from houston street to wardenclyffe investors on wall street were putting their money into marconi s system and some in press began turning against tesla s project claiming it was a hoax malanowski gregory race for wireless authorhouse p 35 project came to a halt in 1905 and in 1906 financial problems and other events may have led to what tesla biographer marc j seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on tesla s part david hatcher childress fantastic inventions of nikola tesla p 255 tesla mortgaged wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at waldorf astoria which eventually mounted to 20 000 in today s dollars he lost property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 tower was demolished by new owner to make land a more viable real estate asset later years after wardenclyffe closed tesla continued to write to morgan after great man died tesla wrote to morgan s son jack trying to get further funding for project in 1906 tesla opened offices at 165 broadway in manhattan trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents he went on to have offices at metropolitan life tower from 1910 to 1914 rented for a few months at woolworth building moving out because he could not afford rent and then to office space at 8 west 40th street from 1915 to 1925 after moving to 8 west 40th street he was effectively bankrupt most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with new inventions he was trying to develop bladeless turbine thumb tesla s bladeless turbine design on his 50th birthday in 1906 tesla demonstrated a 16 000 rpm bladeless turbine during 1910 1911 at waterside power station in new york several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100 5 000 hp tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 1922 in milwaukee for allis chalmers he spent most of his time trying to perfect tesla turbine with hans head engineer at company but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device tesla did license idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in form of luxury car and other instruments wireless lawsuits when world war i broke out british cut transatlantic telegraph cable linking us to germany in order to control flow of information between two countries they also tried to shut off german wireless communication to and from us by having us marconi company sue german radio company telefunken for patent infringement telefunken brought in physicists jonathan and karl ferdinand braun for their defense and hired tesla as a witness for two years for 1 000 a month case stalled and then went moot when us entered war against germany in 1917 in 1915 tesla attempted to sue marconi company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents marconi s initial radio patent had been awarded in us in 1897 but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times before it was finally approved in 1904 on grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 tesla wireless power tuning patents howard b rockman intellectual property law for engineers and scientists john wiley sons 2004 p 198 tesla s 1915 case went nowhere but in a related case where marconi company tried to sue us government over wwi patent infringements a supreme court of united states 1943 decision restored prior patents of oliver lodge john stone and tesla court declared that their decision had no bearing on marconi s claim as first to achieve radio transmission just that since marconi s claim to certain patented improvements were questionable company could not claim infringement on those same patents nobel prize rumors on 6 november 1915 a reuters news agency report from london had 1915 nobel prize in physics awarded to thomas edison and nikola tesla however on 15 november a reuters story from stockholm stated prize that year was being awarded to sir william henry bragg and william lawrence bragg for their services in analysis of crystal structure by means of x rays there were unsubstantiated rumors at time that either tesla or edison had refused prize nobel foundation said any rumor that a person has not been given a nobel prize because he has made known his intention to refuse reward is ridiculous a recipient could decline a nobel prize only after he is announced a winner there have been subsequent claims by tesla biographers that edison and tesla were original recipients and that neither was given award because of their animosity toward each other that each sought to minimize other s achievements and right to win award that both refused ever to accept award if other received it first that both rejected any possibility of sharing it and even that a wealthy edison refused it to keep tesla from getting 20 000 prize money in years after these rumors neither tesla nor edison won prize although edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937 other ideas awards and patents tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time they include grand officer of order of st sava serbia 1892 elliott cresson medal franklin institute usa 1894 grand cross of order of prince danilo i montenegro 1895 edison medal institute of electrical and

tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals tesla theorized that application of electricity to brain enhanced intelligence in 1912 he crafted a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity wiring walls of a schoolroom and saturating schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency whole room will thus mr tesla claims be converted into a health giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or bath plan was at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of new york city schools william h maxwell before world war i tesla sought overseas investors after war started tesla lost funding he was receiving from his patents in european countries in august 1917 edition of magazine electrical experimenter tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using reflection of an electric ray of tremendous frequency with signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar margaret cheney robert uth jim glenn tesla master of lightning pp 128 129 tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water emile girardeau who helped develop france s first radar system in 1930s noted in 1953 that tesla s general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct girardeau said tesla was prophesying or dreaming since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out but one must add that if he was dreaming at least he was dreaming correctly in 1928 tesla received for a biplane capable of taking off vertically vtol aircraft and then of being gradually tilted through manipulation of elevator devices in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane tesla thought plane would sell for less than 1 000 although aircraft has been described as impractical this would be his last patent and at this time tesla closed his last office at 350 madison ave which he had moved into two years earlier living circumstances since 1900 tesla had been living at waldorf astoria in new york running up a large bill in 1922 he moved to st regis hotel and would follow a pattern from then on of moving to a new hotel every few years leaving behind unpaid bills o neill 1944 p 359 tesla would walk to park every day to feed pigeons he took to feeding them at window of his hotel room and bringing injured ones in to nurse back to health he said that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily tesla spent over 2 000 including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal to fix her broken wing and leg tesla stated tesla s unpaid bills and complaints about mess from his pigeon feeding forced him to leave st regis in 1923 hotel pennsylvania in 1930 and hotel governor clinton in 1934 at one point he also took rooms at hotel in 1934 tesla moved to hotel new yorker and westinghouse electric manufacturing company began paying him 125 per month as well as paying his rent expenses company would pay for rest of tesla s life accounts of how this came about vary several sources say westinghouse was worried or warned about potential bad publicity surrounding impoverished conditions under which their former star inventor was living payment has been described as being couched as a consulting fee to get around tesla s aversion to accept charity or by one biographer marc seifer as a type of unspecified settlement birthday press conferences thumb upright tesla on time magazine commemorating his 75th birthday in 1931 a young science fiction writer whom tesla befriended kenneth swezey organized a celebration for inventor s 75th birthday tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering including albert einstein and he was also featured on cover of time magazine cover caption all world s his power house noted his contribution to electrical power generation party went so well that tesla made it an annual event an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink featuring dishes

35 years of work he was on verge of producing proof of a new form of energy he claimed it was a theory of energy that was violently opposed to physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years he also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths working on breakthroughs in metallurgy and developing a way to

transmit signals expects to have 100 000 000 within two years new york world telegram 11 july 1935 describing device which he expected would earn him 100 million within two years he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 east houston street lab and neighboring streets in lower manhattan in 1898 he went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy empire state building with 5 lbs of air pressure he also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called using it to transmit vibrations into ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits in his 1937 grand ballroom of hotel new yorker event tesla received order of white lion from czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from yugoslav ambassador on questions concerning death ray tesla stated but it is not an experiment i have built demonstrated and used it only a little time will pass before i

that have lain hidden in patent archives there are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to tesla in 26 countries many of tesla s patents were in united states britain and canada but many other patents were approved in countries around globe many inventions developed by tesla were not put into patent protection personal appearance upright alt head and shoulder shot of slender man with dark hair and moustache dark suit and white collar shirt thumb right tesla aged 34 circa 1890 photo by napoleon sarony tesla was tall and weighed with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926 his appearance was described by newspaper editor arthur brisbane as almost tallest almost thinnest and certainly most serious man who goes to delmonico s regularly he was an elegant stylish figure in new york city meticulous in his grooming clothing and regimented in his daily activities an appearance he maintained as to further his business relationships he was also described as having light eyes very big hands and remarkably big thumbs eidetic memory tesla read many works memorizing complete books and supposedly possessed a photographic memory he was a polyglot speaking eight languages serbo croatian czech english french german hungarian italian and latin tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration during his early life tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness he suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes often accompanied by visions often visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across at other times they would provide solution to a particular problem he had encountered just by hearing name of an item he would be able to envision it in realistic detail tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision including all dimensions before moving to construction stage a technique sometimes known as picture thinking he typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory beginning in his childhood tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life relationships tesla never married explaining that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities he once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman considering women superior in every way his opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant this new woman was met with much indignation from tesla who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power in an interview with galveston daily news on 10 august 1924 he stated in place of soft voiced gentle woman of my reverent worship has come woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man in dress voice and actions in sports and achievements of every kind tendency of women to push aside man supplanting old spirit of cooperation with him in all affairs of life is very disappointing to me although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying he had made too great a sacrifice to his work tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships instead finding all stimulation he needed in his work tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work however when he did engage in a social life many people spoke very positively and admiringly of tesla robert underwood johnson described him as attaining a distinguished sweetness sincerity modesty refinement generosity and force his secretary dorothy wrote his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul tesla s friend julian hawthorne wrote seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet a philosopher an of fine music a linguist and a connoisseur of food and drink tesla was a good friend of francis marion crawford robert underwood johnson stanford white fritz lowenstein george and kenneth swezey in middle age tesla became a close friend of mark twain they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere twain notably described tesla s induction motor invention as most valuable patent since telephone at a party thrown by actress sarah bernhardt in 1896 tesla met indian hindu monk vivekananda and two talked about how inventor s ideas on energy seemed to match up with vedantic cosmology kak s 2017 tesla wireless energy transmission and vivekananda current science vol 113 2210 in late 1920s tesla befriended george sylvester viereck a poet writer mystic and later a nazi propagandist tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by viereck and his wife tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight he was quick to criticize clothing on several occasions tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress when thomas edison died in 1931 tesla contributed only negative opinion to new york times buried in an extensive coverage of edison s life sleep habits tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night however he did admit to dozing from time to time to recharge his batteries during his second year of study at graz tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards chess and card playing sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table on one occasion at his laboratory tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest kenneth swezey a journalist whom tesla had befriended confirmed that tesla rarely slept swezey recalled one morning when tesla called him at 3 a m i was sleeping in my room like one dead suddenly telephone ring awakened me tesla spoke with pauses as he work ed out a problem comparing one theory to another commenting and when he felt he had arrived at solution he suddenly closed telephone work habits tesla worked every day from 9 00a m until 6 00p m or later with dinner from exactly 8 10 p m at delmonico s restaurant and later waldorf astoria hotel tesla would telephone his dinner order to who also could be only one to serve him meal was required to be ready at eight o clock he dined alone except on rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations tesla would then resume his work often until 3 00a m for exercise tesla walked between per day he curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night saying that it stimulated his brain cells in an interview with newspaper editor arthur brisbane tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy stating suppose i made up my mind to murder you he said in a second you would know it now isn t that wonderful by what process does mind get at all this in same interview tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one tesla became a vegetarian in his later years living on only milk bread honey and vegetable juices views and beliefs on experimental and theoretical physics tesla disagreed with theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge he believed that if electrons existed at all they were some fourth state of matter or sub atom that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity tesla believed that atoms are immutable they could not change state or be split in any way he was a believer in 19th century concept of an all pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about conversion of matter into energy he was also critical of einstein s theory of relativity saying tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892 and in 1937 at age 81 claimed in a letter to have completed a dynamic theory of gravity that would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions as that of curved space he stated that theory was worked out in all details and that he hoped to soon give it to world prepared statement by nikola tesla downloadable from http www tesla hu further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings on society thumb upright tesla circa 1885 tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook on top of his gifts as a technological scientist this did not preclude tesla like many of his era becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics tesla expressed belief that human pity had come to interfere with natural ruthless workings of nature though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a master race or inherent superiority of one person over another he advocated for eugenics in a 1937 interview he stated in 1926 tesla commented on ills of social subservience of women and struggle of women toward gender equality and indicated that humanity s future would be run by queen bees he believed that women would become dominant sex in future kennedy john b when woman is boss an interview with nikola tesla colliers 30 january 1926 tesla made predictions about relevant issues of a post world war i environment in a printed article science and discovery are great forces which will lead to consummation of war 20 december 1914 tesla believed that league of nations was not a remedy for times and issues on religion tesla was raised an orthodox christian later in life he did not consider himself to be a believer in orthodox sense said he opposed religious fanaticism and said buddhism and christianity are greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance he also said to me universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end and what we call soul or spirit is nothing more than sum of of body when this functioning ceases soul or spirit ceases likewise literary works tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals among his books are my inventions autobiography of nikola tesla compiled and edited by
