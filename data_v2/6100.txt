album s material had existed in band s live repertoire before in particular album s title track had been released in an early form on band s 2008 live album live at roadburn and rest of it was created during recording sessions and rehearsals despite band s preference for analog tape title track had to be recorded digitally to accommodate its length album was released to mostly positive critical reaction with criticisms usually directed at length of material and of title track in particular amid praises for its composition and depth a number of publications cited album as one of best 2013 releases on year end lists earthless earned two nominations at san diego music awards and from ages became band s second album to win best hard rock album award there background and recording earthless last studio album rhythms from a cosmic sky had come out in 2007 and their live album live at roadburn on which an early version of from ages was recorded in 2008 further releases had been delayed since then as members of earthless were becoming increasingly pre occupied with other matters constant touring in 2008 and 2009 kept band out of studio drummer mario rubalcaba began playing with off and guitarist isaiah mitchell became involved with howlin rain mitchell also moved to northern california which reduced available time to rehearse with earthless who are based in san diego after three rehearsals band recorded album in two days recording much of it live first day and additional details following day in san francisco with producer phil manley in his studio lucky cat recording song information songs on album began as very loose general ideas according to rubalcaba who also said violence of red sea was most organized structured song on album although he later said same of title track eginton wrote bass lines for violence of red sea inspired by funk and prog psych bands from uk and europe song which had been included in band s concert setlist for last few years prior to recording was named after combination of riffs and tempos which ed together like an angry sea song s finale was present in band s repertoire for almost a decade and was used to close song for tension it created whereas opening of song was considered more of a laid back groove after rubalcaba and eginton had outlined song s bass guitar and drum parts in mitchell s absence due to now living elsewhere mitchell was allowed to improvise lead guitar over them when he was able to play with duo uluru rock was named after uluru rock formation in australia as an homage to country and was written by mitchell and eginton through improvisations while they waited for rubalcaba to get on stage to begin band s first show in country at time band had not been to landmark as a tribute to natives song was specifically named uluru as opposed to ayers rock landmark s other official name uluru rock became opening song on band s setlist for all shows thereafter equus october was born out of a song that band were considering discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered studio and changed their minds wanting more material on album they decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long but they came up with more ideas about what to do with it during mixing process eventually increasing length of song rubalcaba explained that bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and eginton and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at album s sessions once mitchell also began adding material to song rubalcaba felt it started taking on a strong majestic yet mournful sensation almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice he later discovered ritual of october horse and based song s title on that of ritual it took on feeling i had about jam how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at end he explained expanding song in studio led group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into album s title track from ages was recorded for band s live album live at roadburn five years before and being very long was described by rubalcaba as a bastard to play and relearn band wanted to record it in as few takes as possible in spite of its length which they addressed by recording song in pro tools as they expected it could be up to forty minutes long in past they used analog tape which only allowed for about twenty minutes of music but according to rubalcaba yielded best recording quality earthless rehearsed from ages for three days before recording it in about three takes in last five minutes of song band very gently ease into end to avoid having to end song abruptly although he had said same of violence of red sea with respect to album itself in a previous interview rubalcaba later described from ages as most organized planned song band had yet ever recorded let alone recorded for this album he described mixture of influences in song as a supreme psycho delic buffet served up with all sour kraut all freshest sushi japan has to offer what not rubalcaba reiterated pre historic caveman dry mysterious wasteland feel that inspired title song expanded constantly during rehearsals and evolved after its debut on live at roadburn release and reception from ages was released on october 8 2013 by tee pee records artwork was created by artist alan forbes

length was commonly cited as a minor flaw metacritic reported a score of 84 based on five reviews indicating universal acclaim though silence may have been deafening for their small but devoted cadre

pulling mitchell back from potential unrestrained solos he rated album 8 out of 10 his only complaint being that listeners may consider title track too long conversely grayson currin of pitchfork media said that rhythm section did not serve to restrain mitchell at times but to instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms he echoed highter s opinion with respect to title track s length calling it one moment on album where band s patience might test your own and asked regarding length and repetitive nature of album as a whole is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody length of from ages was also criticized by exclaim reviewer macdonald who cited it as record s only flaw and rated album overall 8 out of 10 emusic contributor dan epstein rated album 4 5 stars out of 5 and described interaction between band members similarly to highter and currin saying that while mitchell s guitar leads are prominent
