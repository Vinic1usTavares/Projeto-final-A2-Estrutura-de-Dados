mercator by his friend and first biographer walter ghim this was published in preface to atlas of 1595 a translation is given in pages 7 24 of atlas text pdf pages 77 94 was a 16th century geographer cosmographer and cartographer from county of flanders he is most renowned for creating 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing rhumb lines as straight lines an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts mercator was one of pioneers of cartography and is widely considered most notable figure of school in its golden age approximately 1570s 1670s in his own day he was a notable as maker of globes and scientific instruments in addition he had interests in theology philosophy history mathematics and geomagnetism he was also an accomplished engraver and calligrapher unlike other great scholars of age he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps from his visitors and from his vast correspondence in six languages with other scholars statesmen travellers merchants and seamen mercator s early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but in second half of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his atlas of 1595 this was first appearance of word atlas in reference to a book of maps however mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise on creation history and description of universe not simply a collection of maps he chose word as a commemoration of titan atlas king of mauretania whom he considered to be first great geographer a large part of mercator s income came from sales of his terrestrial and celestial globes for sixty years they were considered finest in world and were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples this was a substantial enterprise involving manufacture of spheres printing gores building substantial stands packing and distributing all over europe he was also renowned for his scientific instruments particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study geometry of astronomy and astrology mercator wrote on geography philosophy chronology and theology all of wall maps were engraved with copious text on region concerned as an example famous world map of 1569 is inscribed with over five thousand words in fifteen legends 1595 atlas has about 120 pages of maps and illustrated title pages but a greater number of pages are devoted to his account of creation of universe and descriptions of all countries portrayed his table of chronology ran to some 400 pages fixing dates from time of creation of earthly dynasties major political and military events volcanic eruptions earthquakes and eclipses he also wrote on gospels and old testament mercator was a devout christian born into a catholic family at a time when martin luther s protestantism was gaining ground he never declared himself as a lutheran but he was clearly sympathetic and he was accused of heresy by catholic authorities after six months in prison he was released unscathed this period of persecution is probably major factor in his move from catholic leuven louvain to a more tolerant duisburg in holy roman empire where he lived for last thirty years of his life walter ghim mercator s friend and first biographer describes him as sober in his behaviour yet cheerful and witty in company and never more happy than in debate with other scholars above all he was pious and studious until his dying days full text of ghim s biography is

cremer seventh child of hubert de kremer and his wife in rupelmonde flanders a small village to southwest of antwerp all of which lied in fiefdom of habsburg netherlands his parents came from gangelt in holy roman duchy of julich present day germany at time of birth they were visiting hubert s brother or is some doubt about relationship of hubert and gisbert gisbert was either brother or uncle of hubert gisbert de kremer people in both locations at time spoke an early modern dutch dialects and there probably was close to no language barrier hubert was a poor artisan a shoemaker by trade but gisbert a priest was a man of some importance in community their stay in rupelmonde was brief and within six months they returned to gangelt and there mercator spent his earliest childhood until age of six evidence for mercator s place of birth is in his letter to haller and letter 152 and in biography by his personal friend in 1518 kremer family moved back to rupelmonde from 1518 are mentioned in archived records of rupelmonde possibly motivated by deteriorating conditions in gangelt famine plague and lawlessness chapter 1 pp10 13 mercator would have attended local school in rupelmonde from age of seven when he arrived from gangelt and there he would have been taught basics of reading writing arithmetic and latin chapter 2 school at s hertogenbosch 1526 1530 thumb macropedius thumb upright 0 72 macropedius after hubert s death in 1526 gisbert became mercator s guardian hoping that mercator might follow him into priesthood he sent 15 year old geert to famous school of brethren of common life at s hertogenbosch s hertogenbosch duke s forest is bois le duc in french and in german colloquially le bois or den bosch in sixteenth century it was second largest town in low countries in duchy of brabant brotherhood and school had been founded by charismatic geert groote who placed great emphasis on study of bible and at same time expressed disapproval of dogmas of church both facets of new heresies of martin luther propounded only a few years earlier in 1517 mercator would follow similar precepts later in life with problematic outcomes during his time at school headmaster was georgius macropedius and under his guidance geert would study bible trivium latin logic and rhetoric and classics such as philosophy of aristotle natural history of pliny and geography of ptolemy chapter 3 all teaching at school was in latin and he would read write and converse in latin and give himself a new latin name gerardus mercator mercator being latin translation of kremer which means merchant brethren were renowned for their scriptorium was where manuscripts were copied by hand in 1512 such endeavours had not been completely overtaken by printing and here mercator might have encountered italic script which he employed in his later work brethren were also renowned for their thoroughness and discipline well attested by erasmus who had attended school forty years before mercator letters of erasmus quoted in p33 university of leuven 1530 1532 from a famous school mercator moved to famous university of leuven where his full latin name appears in matriculation records for 1530 chapter 4 he lived in one of teaching colleges castle college and although he was classified as a pauper he rubbed shoulders with richer students amongst whom were anatomist andreas vesalius statesman antoine perrenot and theologian george cassander all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of mercator general first degree for magister centred on teaching of philosophy theology and greek under conservative scholasticism which gave prime place to authority of aristotle university statutes stated explicitly that to disbelieve teaching of aristotle was heretical and would be punished by expulsion see chapter 4 47 although trivium was now augmented by trivium and quadrivium together constitute seven liberal arts arithmetic geometry astronomy music their coverage was neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently mercator would have to resort to further study of first three subjects in years to come mercator graduated magister in 1532 antwerp 1532 1534 normal progress for an able magister was to go on to further study in one of four faculties at leuven theology medicine canon law and roman law gisbert might have hoped that mercator would go further in theology and train for priesthood but mercator did not like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts problem was contradiction between authority of aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations particularly in relation to creation and description of world such doubt was heresy at university and it is quite possible that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to notice of authorities university statutes declared that contradiction of aristotle was heresy p47 fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print he left leuven for antwerp there is uncertainty as to whether he was away in antwerp for a single long period or whether he simply made a number of visits see p20 footnote 2 there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy this period of his life is clouded in uncertainty simply states that mercator read philosophy privately for two years he certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between world of bible and world of geography a hiatus which would occupy him for rest of his life p49 he certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and world of aristotle left thumb upright 1 5 portuguese lusitanian and spanish hemispheres of globe of monachus during this period mercator was in contact with franciscan friar monachus who lived in monastery of mechelen p54 and p20 footnote 2 he was a controversial figure who from time to time was in conflict with church authorities because of his humanist outlook and his break from aristotelian views of world his own views of geography were based on investigation and observation mercator must have been impressed by monachus his map collection and famous globe that he had prepared for jean carondelet principal advisor of charles v see p49 p58 original text is globe was constructed by leuven goldsmith gaspar van der heyden gaspar a myrica with whom mercator would be apprenticed these encounters may well have provided stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography later he would say since my youth geography has been for me primary subject of study i liked not only description of earth but structure of whole machinery of world from dedication to volume of ptolemy mercator published in 1578 see p54 leuven 1534 1543 thumb upright 0 72 gemma end of 1534 twenty two year old mercator arrived back in leuven and threw himself into study of geography mathematics and astronomy under guidance of gemma frisius chapters 5 and 6 mercator was completely out of his depth but with help and friendship of gemma who was only four years older he succeeded in mastering elements of mathematics within two years and university granted him permission to tutor private students gemma had designed some of mathematical instruments used in these studies and mercator soon become adept in skills of their manufacture practical skills of working in brass mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce finished work thumb left upright 0 72 terrestrial globe of gemma images of terrestrial globe may be inspected on

but by 1535 they were planning a new globe embodying latest geographical discoveries chapters 7 and 8 gores were to be engraved on copper instead of wood and text was to be in an elegant italic script instead of heavy roman lettering of early globes globe was a combined effort gemma researched content van der heyden engraved geography and mercator engraved text including cartouche which exhibited his own name in public for first time globe was finished in 1536 and its celestial counterpart appeared one year later these widely admired globes were costly and their wide sales provided mercator an income which together with that from mathematical instruments and from teaching allowed him to marry and establish a home his marriage to barbara was in september 1536 and arnold first of their six children was born a year later chapter 8 pp 86 91 arrival of mercator on cartographic scene would have been noted by cognoscenti who purchased gemma s globe professors rich merchants prelates aristocrats and courtiers of emperor charles v at nearby brussels commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide an important source of income throughout his life his connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student antoine perrenot soon to be appointed bishop of arras and antoine s father nicholas perrenot chancellor of charles v working alongside gemma whilst they were producing globes mercator would have witnessed process of progressing geography obtaining previous maps comparing and collating their content studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents merchants pilgrims travellers and seamen he put his newly learned talents to work in a burst of productivity in 1537 aged only 25 he established his reputation with a map of holy land which was researched engraved printed and partly published by himself chapter 9 a year later in 1538 he produced his first map of world usually referred to as orbis imago orbis imago is a reference to text in legend cartouche at top centre of map first sentence contains phrase hic vides orbis which translates as this image of globe that you see text in 1539 40 he made a map of flanders and in 1541 a terrestrial globe all four works were received with acclaim and chapter 9 and they sold in large numbers dedications of three of these works witness mercator s access to influential patrons holy land was dedicated to franciscus van cranevelt who sat on great council of mechelen map of flanders was dedicated to emperor himself and globe was dedicated to nicholas perrenot emperor s chief advisor dedicatee of world map was more surprising johannes drosius a fellow student who as an unorthodox priest may well have been suspected of lutheran heresy chapter 14 given that symbolism of orbis imago map also reflected a lutheran view point mercator was exposing himself to criticism by hardline theologians of leuven chapter 10 p110 thumb upright right title page of literarum latinarum in between these works he found time to write literarum latinarum a small instruction manual on italic script italic script or chancery cursive reached low countries from italy at beginning of sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in leuven in 1522 p28 it was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as rapid fluency that could be attained with practice but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes maps and scientific instruments which typically used roman capitals or gothic script mercator first applied italic script to globe of gemma frisius and thereafter to all his works with ever increasing elegance title page of this work is an illustration of decorative style he developed top line of title page spells out a highly decorative form of word literarum in 1542 thirty year old must have been feeling confident about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life first leuven was besieged by troops of duke of cleves a lutheran sympathiser who with french support was set on exploiting unrest in low countries to his own ends chapter 14 p142 145 this was same duke to whom mercator turned ten years later siege was lifted but financial losses to town and its traders including mercator were great second interruption was potentially deadly inquisition called chapter 15 persecution 1543 at no time in his life did mercator claim to be a lutheran but there are many hints that he had sympathies in that direction as a child called geert he was surrounded by adults who were possibly followers of geert groote who placed meditation contemplation and biblical study over ritual and liturgy and who also founded school of brethren of common life at s hertogenbosch as an adult mercator had family connections to molanus a religious reformer who would later have to flee leuven also he was a close friend and correspondent of philip melanchthon one of principal lutheran reformers some of correspondence of mercator and melanchthon has been preserved see study of bible was something that was central to mercator s life and it was cause of early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy his visits to free thinking franciscans in mechelen may have attracted attention of theologians at university amongst whom were two senior figures of inquisition jacobus latomus and tapper words of latter on death of heretics convey atmosphere of that time persecution of heretics is discussed in chapter 14 it is no great matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or innocent provided we terrify people by these examples which generally succeeds best when persons eminent for learning riches nobility or high stations are thus sacrificed thumb upright 1 2 rupelmonde castle from flandria illustrata 1641 it may well have been these inquisitors who in 1543 decided that mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed chapter 15 p155 his name appeared on a list of 52 lutheran heretics which included an architect a sculptor a former rector of university a monk three priests and many others all were arrested except mercator who had left leuven for rupelmonde on business concerning estate of his recently deceased uncle gisbert that made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who by fleeing arrest had proved his own guilt chapter 15 p154 mercator was apprehended in rupelmonde and imprisoned in castle he was accused of suspicious correspondence with franciscan friars in mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at friary in mechelen at same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf it is known that pieter de corte an ex rector of university wrote to queen maria of hungary governor of province see chapter 15 p156 but whether his friend antoine perrenot was helpful is unknown perrenot as a bishop would have to support activities of inquisition after seven months mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on list suffered torture and execution two men were burnt at stake another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive leuven 1543 1552 mercator never committed any of his prison experiences to paper all he would say p15 letter to antoine perrenot was that he had suffered an unjust persecution for rest of his time in leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work his brush with inquisition did not affect his relationship with court and nicholas perrenot recommended him to emperor as a maker of superb instruments outcome was an imperial order for globes compasses astrolabe and astronomical rings p383 they were ready in 1545 and emperor granted royal seal of approval to his workshop sadly they were soon destroyed in course of emperor s military ventures and mercator had to construct a second set now lost chapter 16 p167 he also returned to his work on a large up to date and highly detailed wall map of europe which was he had already claimed on his 1538 world map very well advanced it proved to be a vast task and he perfectionist that he was seemed unable to cut short his ever expanding researches and publish as a result it was to be another ten years before map appeared thumb left upright 0 80 john dee in 1547 mercator was visited by young nineteen year old john dee who on completion of his undergraduate studies in cambridge 1547 went beyond seas to speak and confer with some learned men p 165 ch 16 dee and mercator were both passionately interested in same topics and they quickly established a close rapport which lasted throughout their lives in 1548 dee returned to leuven louvain in dee s text and registered as a student for three years he was constantly in mercator s company apart from a possible short visit to duisberg in 1562 p 197 ch 19 two men did not meet but they corresponded frequently and by good fortune a number of their letters are preserved dee took maps globes and astronomical instruments back to england and in return furnished mercator with latest english texts and new geographical knowledge arising from english explorations of world forty years later they were still co operating dee using mercator s maps to convince english court to finance martin frobisher s expeditions and mercator still avidly seeking information of new territories final success in leuven was 1551 celestial globe partner of his terrestrial globe of 1541 records of plantin press show that several hundred pairs of globes were sold before end of century despite their high price in 1570 they sold at 25 carolus guilders for a pair equivalent to 2 500 euro in modern currency celestial globes were a necessary adjunct to intellectual life of rich globes in holbein s ambassadors and academics alike for both astronomical and astrological studies two subjects which were strongly entwined in sixteenth century twenty two pairs are still in existence duisburg 1552 1594 in 1552 mercator moved from leuven to duisburg in duchy of cleves he never gave his reasons for move but several factors may have been involved not having been born in brabant he could never be a full citizen of leuven catholic intolerance of religious dissidents in low countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted erasmian constitution and religious tolerance of cleves must have appeared attractive there was to be a new university in duisburg and teachers would be required chapter 16 he was not alone over years to come many more would flee from oppressive catholicism of brabant and flanders to tolerant cities such as duisburg other refugees in duisburg included johannes oeste or otho georg cassander and cornelius see chapter 19 p191 peaceful town of duisburg untroubled by political and religious unrest was perfect place for flowering of his talent mercator quickly established himself as a man of standing in town an intellectual of note a publisher of maps and a maker of instruments and globes mercator s workshops produced items such as globes in a steady stream records of plantin press show that they received 1150 maps and globes from mercator over a thirty year period in particular they sold 185 copies of 1569 world map in three years at same time mercator was selling items at regular international frankfurt book fair and selling direct from his own workshop mercator never accepted privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance nevertheless he was on good terms with wealthier citizens and a close friend of walter ghim twelve times mayor and mercator s future biographer chapter 17 mercator was welcomed by duke wilhelm who appointed him as court cosmographer there is no precise definition of this term other than that it certainly comprehends disciplines of geography and astronomy but at that time it would also include astrology and chronology as a history of world from creation all of these were among mercator s accomplishments but his patron s first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of disputed boundary between duke s territory of county of mark and duchy of westphalia chapter 19 p194 thumb upright 0 6 right astronomical clock with rotating globes around this time mercator also received and executed a very special order for holy roman emperor a pair of small globes inner fist size earth was made of wood and outer celestial sphere was made of blown crystal glass engraved with diamond and inlaid with gold he presented them to emperor in brussels who awarded him title imperatoris domesticus a member of imperial household globes are lost but mercator describes them in a letter to philip is a significant correspondent of mercator since he was one of founders of lutheranism in which he declares that globes were rotated on top of an astronomical clock made for charles v by a speculative

important pamphlet on use of globes and instruments and his latest ideas on magnetism declaratio insigniorum quae sunt in globo et a description of most important applications of terrestrial and celestial globes and astronomical ring first section is prefaced by mercator s ideas on magnetism central thesis being that magnetic compasses are attracted to a single pole not a dipole along great circles through that pole he then shows how to calculate position of pole if deviation is known at two known positions leuven and corvo in azores he finds that it must be at latitude and longitude remarkably he also calculates longitude difference between pole and an arbitrary position he had solved longitude problem if his theory had been correct further comments on magnetism may be found in an earlier letter to s letter to perrenot is available on wikiquote along with an introduction by and on later world map for magnetism on world map see mercator 1569 world map prime meridian and magnetic pole note that he calculated two possible positions in hogenberg portrait below his dividers are set on position of magnetic pole thumb upright 1 5 an updated version of 1554 map of europe as it appears in 1595 atlas in 1554 mercator published long awaited wall map of europe dedicating it to his friend now cardinal antoine perrenot he had worked at it for more than twelve years collecting comparing collating and rationalising a vast amount of data and result was a map of unprecedented detail and accuracy for a description see chapter 17 it attracted more praise from scholars everywhere than any similar geographical work which has ever been brought out it also sold in large quantities for much of rest of century with a second edition in 1572 and a third edition in atlas of 1595 for example plantin alone sold 400 copies of map of europe in 1566 twelve years later proposed university in duisburg failed to materialise because papal licence to found university was delayed twelve years and by then duke wilhelm had lost interest it was another 90 years before duisburg had its university on other hand no papal permit was required to establish gymnasium where in 1559 mercator was invited to teach mathematics with cosmography one year later in 1560 he secured appointment of his friend jan vermeulen molanus as rector and then blessed vermeulen s marriage to his daughter his sons were now growing to manhood and he encouraged them to embark on his own profession arnold eldest had produced his first map of iceland in 1558 and would later take over day to day running of mercator s enterprises chapter 19 bartholemew his second son showed great academic promise and in 1562 aged 22 he took over teaching of his father s three year long lecture course after mercator had taught it once only much to mercator s grief bartholemew died young in 1568 aged 28 chapter 22 rumold third son would spend a large part of his life in london s publishing houses providing for mercator a vital link to new discoveries of elizabethan age in 1587 rumold returned to duisburg and later in 1594 it fell to his lot to publish mercator s works posthumously epilogue 320 thumb upright 1 5 abraham ortelius copy of 1564 map of britain in 1564 mercator published his map of britain a map of greatly improved accuracy which far surpassed any of his previous representations circumstances were unusual it is only map without a dedicatee and in text engraved on map he pointedly denies responsibility for map s authorship and claims that he is merely engraving and printing it for a very good friend identity of neither author nor friend has been established but it has been suggested that map was created by a scottish catholic priest called john elder who smuggled it to french clergy known to antoine perrenot mercator s friend chapter 19 pp189 205 chapter 14 pp156 166 british isles by peter m barber in chapter 54 of history of cartography volume 3 cartography in european renaissance mercator s reticence shows that he was clearly aware of political nature of pro catholic map which showed all catholic religious foundations and omitted those created by protestant henry viii moreover it was engraved with text demeaning history of england and praising that of catholic ireland and scotland it was invaluable as an accurate guide for planned catholic invasion of england by phillip ii of spain thumb left upright 1 5 lotharingia lorraine as it appeared in 1595 atlas as soon as map of britain was published mercator was invited to undertake surveying and mapping of lorraine lotharingia this was a new venture for him in sense that never before had he collected raw data for a new regional map he was then 52 already an old man by norms of that century and he may well have had reservations about undertaking accompanied by his son bartholemew mercator meticulously triangulated his way around forests hills and steep sided valleys of lorraine difficult terrain as different from low countries as anything could be he never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend ghim who would later write journey through lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement as a result of his terrifying experiences mercator returned home to convalesce leaving bartholemew to complete survey no map was published at time but mercator did provide a single drawn copy for duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas chapter 21 p212 thumb upright 1 5 chronologia title title see text over illustration is in via virtuti est via meaning no way is impassable to virtue ovid trip to lorraine in 1564 was a set back for his health but he soon recovered and embarked on his greatest project yet a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests first element was chronologia a list of all significant events since beginning of world compiled from his literal reading of bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed chapters 23 228 chapter 17 p185 mercator was first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of motions of sun moon and earth he then fixed dates of other events in babylonian greek hebrew and roman calendars relative to eclipses that they recorded time origin was fixed from genealogies of bible as 3 965 years before birth of christ see page showing birth of christ this huge volume 400 pages was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout europe and mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time on other hand catholic church placed work on index librorum prohibitorum list of prohibited books because mercator included deeds of martin luther had he published such a work in louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy in two online copies of chronologia listed under only one includes luther reference whilst in other all mention of luther has been erased chronologia developed into an even wider project cosmographia a description of whole universe mercator s outline was 1 creation of world 2 description of heavens astronomy and astrology 3 description of earth comprising modern geography geography of ptolemy and geography of ancients 4 genealogy and history of states and 5 chronology of these chronology had already been accomplished account of creation and modern maps would appear in atlas of 1595 his edition of ptolemy

chronologia was going to press in 1569 mercator also published what was to become his most famous map nova et orbis terrae descriptio ad a new and more complete representation of terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation chapter 24 chapter 21 as mariners had started to explore oceans in age of discovery problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea a rhumb line did not correspond to a straight line on their chart mercator s solution was to make scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map exactly how he arrived at required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars suggest that he used tables of devised by pedro nunes has shown that mercator s library contained a copy of theory of by pedro nunez this was published in 1566 three years before mercator completed map on new projection large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but within a hundred years of its creation mercator projection became standard for marine charts throughout world and continues to be so used to present day on other hand projection is clearly unsuitable as a description of land masses on account of its manifest distortion at high latitudes and its use is now deprecated other projections are more suitable see discussion at mercator projection although several hundred copies of map were produced it soon became out of date as new discoveries showed extent of mercator s inaccuracies of poorly known lands and speculations for example on arctic and southern continent for further comments on inaccuracies of 1569 map see mercator 1569 world map geography for a discussion of southern continent in particular see around this time marshall of julich approached mercator and asked him to prepare a set of european regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron s son crown prince johannes this remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in british library under title atlas of europe although mercator never used such a title many of pages were assembled from dissected mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from theatrum orbis terrarum of abraham ortelius a facsimile of mercator contributions in atlas of europe has been published by thumb upright 1 5 right mauretania in 1578 ptolemy apart from a revision of map of europe in 1572 there would be no more large wall maps and mercator began to address other tasks that he had outlined in cosmographia first of these was a new definitive version of ptolemy s maps chapter 26 that he should wish to do so may seem strange given that at same time he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers such as his friend abraham ortelius had forsaken ptolemy completely it was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another a final epitaph for ptolemy who had inspired mercator s love of geography early in his life he compared great many editions of ptolemy s written geographia which described his two projections and listed latitude and longitude of some 8000 places as well as many different versions of printed maps which had appeared over previous one hundred years all with errors and accretions once again this self imposed diligence delayed publication and 28 maps of ptolemy appeared in 1578 after an interval almost ten years it was accepted by scholars as last word

of ezekiel in 1589 at age of 77 mercator had a new lease of life he took a new wife gertrude wealthy widow of a former mayor of duisburg and at same time he arranged marriage of rumold to her daughter a second collection of 22 maps was published covering italy greece and balkans this volume has a noteworthy preface for it includes mention of atlas as a mythical king of mauretania i have set this man atlas explained mercator so notable for his erudition humaneness and wisdom as a model for my imitation chapter 30 a year later mercator had a stroke which left him greatly incapacitated he struggled with assistance of his family trying to complete remaining maps ongoing theological publications and a new treatise on creation of world this last work which he did succeed in finishing was climax of his life s activities work which in his own opinion surpassed all his other endeavours and provided a framework and rationale for complete atlas it was also his last work in a literal sense for he died after two further strokes in 1594 chapter 31 epitaph and legacy thumb 200px mercator epitaph in church of st salvator duisburg mercator was buried in church of st salvatore in duisburg where a memorial was erected about fifty years after his death main text of epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing heaven from inside and earth from outside greatly respected for his wide erudition particularly in theology and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life in addition on base of memorial there is an epigram text of mercator s memorial is given in p227 and a translation may be found at wikisource to reader whoever you are your fears that this small clod of earth lies heavily on buried mercator are groundless whole earth is no burden for a man who had whole weight of her lands on his shoulders and carried her as an atlas following mercator s death his family prepared atlas for publication in four months it was hoped for source of income that was needed to support them this work entailed supplementing maps of 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of mercator covering northern countries creating four maps of continents and a world map printing of mercator s account of creation and finally addition of eulogies and walter ghim s biography of mercator title itself provides mercator s definition of a new meaning for word atlas atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura which may be translated as atlas or cosmographical meditations upon fabric of world and figure of d or more colloquially as atlas or cosmographical meditations upon creation of universe and universe as created pdf p2 see for a discussion of concept of term atlas over years mercator s definition of atlas has become simply a collection of maps in a volume oxford english dictionary atlas was not an immediate success one reason may have been that it was incomplete spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside europe rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and whole project lost momentum rumold who was 55 years old in 1595 was in decline and died in 1599 his family did produce another edition in 1602 but only text was reset there were no new maps epilogue p320 another reason for failure of atlas was strength of continuing sales of theatrum orbis terrarum of abraham ortelius alongside sumptuous maps of that book mercator s un ornamented new maps looked very unattractive despite death of ortelius in 1598 theatrum flourished in 1602 it was in its thirteenth latin edition as well as editions in dutch italian french german and spanish mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion epilogue family was clearly in some financial difficulty for in 1604 mercator s library of some 1 000 books was sold at a public auction in leiden netherlands only known copy of sale catalogue perished in war but fortunately a manuscript copy had been made by van raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987 of titles identified there are 193 on theology both catholic and lutheran 217 on history and geography 202 on mathematics in its widest sense 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified by as rare books contents of library provide an insight into mercator s intellectual studies but mathematics books are only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis they cover arithmetic geometry trigonometry surveying architecture fortification astronomy astrology time measurement calendar calculation scientific instruments cartography and applications only one of his own copies has been found a first edition of copernicus s de revolutionibus orbium

9 title page of mercator hondius atlas of 1637 in english showing titan atlas mercator twice and personifications of continents sale catalogue doesn t mention any maps but it is known that family sold copper plates to jodocus hondius in 1604 epilogue p324 he transformed atlas almost 40 extra maps were added including spain and portugal and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by mercator title page now included a picture of hondius and mercator together although they had never met hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance atlas was an enormous success he followed by his son henricus and son in law johannes produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641 including one in english in addition they published atlas in a compact form atlas minor atlas minor may be viewed online at bavarian state library which meant that it was readily available to a wide market as editions progressed mercator s theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from atlas and images of king atlas were replaced by titan atlas by final edition number of his maps in atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added eventually atlas became out of date and by middle of seventeenth century publications of map makers such as joan blaeu and frederik de wit took over thumb upright 0 9 left statue of mercator jardin du petit brussels mercator s editions of ptolemy and his theological writings were in print for many years after demise of atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy epilogue p325 his construction of a chart on which courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised art of navigation making it simpler and therefore safer mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was edward wright who first clarified method in his book certaine errors 1599 relevant error being erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses wright s solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before projection formula was derived analytically wright published a new world map based on mercator projection also in 1599 slowly but steadily charts using projection appeared throughout first half of seventeenth century and by end of that century chart makers all over world were using nothing but mercator projection with aim of showing oceans and coastlines in detail without concern for continental interiors at some stage projection made unfortunate leap to portrayal of continents and it eventually became canonical description of world despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes distortions of mercator s map are discussed in article on mercator projection recently mercator s projection has been rejected for representations of critique of mercator and other projections in gall peters projection but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy many cities have a statue of mercator statues in rupelmonde duisburg
