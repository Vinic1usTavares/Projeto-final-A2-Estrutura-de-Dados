colour salt is a mineral consisting primarily of sodium chloride nacl a chemical compound belonging to larger class of salts salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite salt is present in vast quantities in seawater where it is main mineral constituent open ocean has about of solids per liter of sea water a salinity of 3 5 salt is essential for life in general and saltiness is one of basic human tastes salt is one of oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings and salting is an important method of food preservation some of earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6 000 bc when people living in area of present day romania boiled spring water to extract salts a salt works in china dates to approximately same period salt was also prized by ancient hebrews greeks romans byzantines hittites egyptians and indians salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across mediterranean sea along specially built salt roads and across sahara on camel caravans scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance salt is processed from salt mines and by evaporation of seawater sea salt and mineral rich spring water in shallow pools its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine salt is used in many industrial processes including manufacture of polyvinyl chloride plastics paper pulp and many other products of annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt about 6 is used for human consumption other uses include water conditioning processes de icing highways and agricultural use edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency as well as its use in cooking and at table salt is present in many processed foods sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute excessive salt consumption may increase risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension in children and adults such health effects of salt have long been studied accordingly numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2 000 mg of sodium equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day history thumb salt production in halle saxony anhalt 1670 all through history availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization what is now thought to have been first city in europe is solnitsata in bulgaria which was a salt mine providing area now known as balkans with salt since 5400 bc la find oldest european town a salt production center even name solnitsata means salt works while people have used canning and artificial refrigeration to preserve food for last hundred years or so salt has been best known food preservative especially for meat for many thousands of years a very ancient salt works operation has been discovered at archaeological site next to a salt spring in county romania evidence indicates that neolithic people of culture were boiling salt laden spring water through process of to extract salt as far back as 6050 bc salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to rapid growth of this society s population soon after its initial production began harvest of salt from surface of lake near in shanxi china dates back to at least 6000 bc making it one of oldest verifiable saltworks there is more salt in animal tissues such as meat blood and milk than in plant tissues nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food but agriculturalists feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter need to supplement their diet with salt with spread of civilization salt became one of world s main trading commodities it was of high value to ancient hebrews greeks romans byzantines hittites and other peoples of antiquity in middle east salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement and ancient hebrews made a covenant of salt with god and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him an ancient practice in time of war was salting earth scattering salt around in a defeated city to prevent plant growth bible tells story of king abimelech who was ordered by god to do this at shechem and various texts claim that roman general scipio aemilianus africanus ploughed over and sowed city of carthage with salt after it was defeated in third punic war 146 bc thumb left ponds near maras peru fed from a mineral spring and used for salt production since time of incas salt may have been used for barter in connection with obsidian trade in anatolia in neolithic era salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient egyptian tombs from third millennium bc as were salted birds and salt fish from about 2800 bc egyptians began exporting salt fish to phoenicians in return for lebanon cedar glass and dye tyrian purple phoenicians traded egyptian salted fish and salt from north africa throughout their mediterranean trade empire herodotus described salt trading routes across libya back in 5th century bc in early years of roman empire roads were built for transportation of salt from salt imported at ostia to capital in africa salt was used as currency south of sahara and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in abyssinia moorish merchants in 6th century traded salt for gold weight for weight tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across sahara especially for transportation of salt by salt caravans caravans still cross desert from southern niger to although much of trade now takes place by truck each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates in gabon before arrival of europeans coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of interior by medium of sea salt this was gradually displaced by salt that europeans brought in sacks so that coast natives lost their previous profits as of author s writing in 1958 sea salt was still currency best appreciated in interior schweitzer albert african notebook 1958 indiana university press salzburg hallstatt and lie within of each other on river salzach in central austria in an area with extensive salt deposits salzach literally means salt river and salzburg salt castle both taking their names

had previously used pickaxes and shovels began open pan salt making during first millennium bc celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to ancient greece and ancient rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries word salary comes from latin word for salt reason for this is unknown a persistent modern claim that roman legions were sometimes paid in salt is baseless word salad literally means salted and comes from ancient roman practice of salting leaf vegetables wars have been fought over salt venice fought and won a war with genoa over product and it played an important part in american revolution cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying duties and towns like liverpool flourished on export of salt extracted from salt mines of cheshire various governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples voyages of christopher columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern spain and oppressive salt tax in france was one of causes of french revolution after being repealed this tax was reimposed by napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars and was not finally abolished until 1946 in 1930 mahatma gandhi led at least 100 000 people on dandi march or salt satyagraha in which protesters made their own salt from sea thus defying british rule and avoiding paying salt tax this civil disobedience inspired millions of common people and elevated indian independence movement from an elitist movement to a national struggle chemistry thumb sem image of a grain of table salt salt is mostly sodium chloride ionic compound with formula nacl representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine sea salt and freshly mined salt much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas also contain small amounts of trace elements which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health mined salt is often refined in production of table salt it is dissolved in water purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution and re evaporated during this same refining process it is often also iodized salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape they normally appear white

shows a typical salt shaker and salt bowl with salt spread before each on a black background salt is essential to health of humans and other animals and it is one of five basic taste sensations salt is used in many cuisines around world and it is often found in salt shakers on diners eating tables for their personal use on food salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride table salt com au retrieved 7 july 2011 international codex alimentarius standard for food grade salt pdf retrieved 7 july 2011 usually anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free flowing iodized salt containing potassium iodide is widely available some people put a desiccant such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form fortified table salt some table salt sold for consumption contains additives which address a variety of health concerns especially in developing world identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country iodine is an important micronutrient for humans and a deficiency of element can cause lowered production of thyroxine hypothyroidism and enlargement of thyroid gland endemic goitre in adults or cretinism in children iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide sodium iodide or sodium iodate a small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize iodine iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around world and is leading preventable cause of mental retardation iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used amount of iodine and specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country in united states food and drug administration fda recommends 21 cfr 101 9 c 8 iv 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women us iodized salt contains 46 77 ppm parts per million whereas in uk iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10 22 ppm sodium ferrocyanide also known as yellow of soda is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent additive is considered safe for human consumption such anticaking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by committee on toxicity in 1988 discussions of safety of sodium in table salt hansard com 5 may 1993 retrieved 7 july 2011 other anticaking agents sometimes used include phosphate calcium or magnesium carbonates fatty acid salts acid salts magnesium oxide silicon dioxide calcium silicate sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate both european union and united states food and drug administration permitted use of aluminium in latter two compounds in doubly fortified salt both iodide and iron salts are added latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia which interferes with mental development of an estimated 40 of infants in developing world a typical iron source is ferrous fumarate another additive especially important for pregnant women is folic acid vitamin b9 which gives table salt a yellow color folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia which affect young mothers especially in developing countries a lack of fluorine in diet is cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental caries fluoride salts can be added to table salt with goal of reducing tooth decay especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water practice is more common in some european countries where water fluoridation is not carried out in france 35 of table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride other kinds thumb left irregular crystals of sea salt unrefined sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates traces of algal products salt resistant bacteria and sediment particles calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic i e it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered algal products contribute a mildly fishy or sea air odour latter from compounds sediments proportion of which varies with source give salt a dull grey appearance since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food when salt is added during cooking however these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of food ingredients refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases thumb himalayan salt is halite with a distinct pink color himalayan salt is known for its distinct pink hue it is used in cooking as a substitute for table salt is it also used as cookware in salt lamps and in spas it is mined from salt range mountains in pakistan different natural salts have different depending on their source giving each one a unique flavour fleur de sel a natural sea salt from surface of evaporating brine in salt pans has a unique flavour varying with region from which it is produced in traditional korean cuisine so called bamboo salt is prepared by roasting salt in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends this product absorbs minerals from bamboo and mud and has been claimed to increase and properties of a fermented bean paste kosher or kitchen salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking it can be useful for bread or pretzel making and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil pickling salt is made of ultra fine grains to speed dissolving to make brine gourmet salts may be used for specific tastes salt in food salt is present in most foods but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats vegetables and fruit it is present in very small quantities it is often added to processed foods such as canned foods and especially salted foods pickled foods and snack foods or other convenience foods where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring dairy salt is used in preparation of butter and cheese products as a flavoring salt enhances taste of other foods by suppressing bitterness of those foods making them more palatable and relatively sweeter before advent of electrically powered refrigeration salting was one of main methods of food preservation thus herring contains 67 mg sodium per 100 g while kipper its preserved form contains 990 mg similarly pork typically contains 63 mg while bacon contains 1 480 mg and potatoes contain 7 mg but potato crisps 800 mg per 100 g salt is also used in cooking such as with salt crusts main sources of salt in western diet apart from direct use of sodium chloride are bread and cereal products meat products and milk and dairy products in many east asian cultures salt is not traditionally used as a condiment in its place condiments such as soy sauce fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures they are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments sodium consumption and health table salt is made up of just under 40 sodium by weight so a 6g serving contains about 2 of sodium sodium serves a vital purpose in human body via its role as an electrolyte it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly and it is one factor involved in osmotic regulation of water content in body organs fluid balance most of sodium in western diet comes from salt habitual salt intake in many western countries is about 10 g per day and it is higher than that in many countries in eastern europe and asia high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on total amount consumed in united states 75 of sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods 11 from cooking and table use and rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs because consuming too much sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt high sodium intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease a reduction in sodium intake by 1 000 mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent in adults and children with no acute illness a decrease in intake of sodium from typical high levels reduces blood pressure a low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2 000 mg of sodium which is contained in 5g of salt per day guidelines by united states recommend that people with hypertension african americans and middle aged and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1 500 mg of sodium per day and meet potassium recommendation of 4 700 mg day with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables while reduction of sodium intake to less than 2 300 mg per day is recommended by developed countries one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1 200 mg contained in 3g of salt per day as a further reduction in salt intake greater fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and another review indicated that there is inconsistent insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2 300 mg per day is either beneficial or harmful more recent evidence is showing a much more complicated relationship between salt and cardiovascular disease according to a systematic review of multiple large studies mortality caused by levels of salt association between sodium consumption and cardiovascular disease or mortality is u shaped with increased risk at both high and low sodium intake findings showed that increased mortality from excessive salt intake was primarily associated with individuals with hypertension levels of increased mortality among those with restricted salt intake appeared to be similar regardless of blood pressure this evidence shows that while those with hypertension should primarily focus on reducing sodium to recommended levels all groups should seek to maintain a healthy level of sodium intake of between 4 and 5 grams a day one of two most prominent dietary risks for disability in world is eating too much sodium non dietary uses only about 6 of salt manufactured in world is used in food of remainder 12 is used in water conditioning processes 8 goes for de icing highways and 6 is used in agriculture rest 68 is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes and sodium chloride is one of largest inorganic raw materials used by volume its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine which are separated by electrolysis of a pure brine solution these are used in manufacture of pvc plastics paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds salt is also used as a flux in production of aluminium for this purpose a layer of melted salt floats on top of molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants it is also used in manufacture of soaps and glycerine where it is added to vat to precipitate out saponified products as an salt is used in manufacture of synthetic rubber and another use is in firing of pottery when salt added to furnace vaporises before condensing onto surface of ceramic material forming a strong glaze when drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel salt may be added to drilling fluid to provide a stable wall to prevent hole collapsing there are many other processes in which salt is involved these include its use as a mordant in textile dying to regenerate resins in water softening for tanning of hides preservation of meat and fish and canning of meat and vegetables production thumb left sea salt evaporation pond at walvis bay halophile organisms impart a red colour food grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries 7 in europe although worldwide food uses account for 17 5 of total production in 2018 total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes top six producers being china 68 million united states 42 million india 29 million germany 13 million canada 13 million and australia 12 million manufacture of salt is one of oldest chemical industries a major source of salt is seawater which has a salinity of approximately 3 5 this means that there are about of dissolved salts predominantly sodium and chloride ions per kilogram 2 2 lbs of water world s oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated evaporation of seawater is production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates salt evaporation ponds are filled from ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as water dries up sometimes these ponds have vivid colours as some species of algae and other micro organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity elsewhere salt is extracted from vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over millennia from evaporation of seas and lakes these are either mined directly producing rock salt or are extracted in solution by pumping water into deposit in either case salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine traditionally this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase rate of evaporation more recently process is performed in pans under vacuum raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics this usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities largely magnesium and calcium salts multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals which are kiln dried about salt production salt manufacturers association some salt is produced using process which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with seeding of solution with cubic crystals and produces a grainy type flake an indigenous group from paraguayan chaco obtain their salt from ash produced by burning timber of indian salt tree vitis idaea and other trees one of largest salt mining operations in world is at khewra salt mine in pakistan mine has nineteen storeys eleven of which are underground and of passages salt is dug out by room and pillar method where about half material is left in place to support upper levels extraction of himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at present rate of extraction of around 385 000 tons per annum in religion thumb bread and salt at a russian wedding ceremony salt has long held an important place in religion and culture at time of brahmanic sacrifices in hittite rituals and during festivals held by semites and greeks at time of new moon salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises ancient egyptians greeks and romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be origin of holy water in christian faith in aztec mythology was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water salt is considered to be a very auspicious substance in hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house and weddings in jainism devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person s cremated remains before ashes are buried salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in mahayana buddhist tradition and when returning home from a funeral a pinch of salt is thrown over left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering house in shinto is used for ritual purification of locations and people specifically and small piles of
