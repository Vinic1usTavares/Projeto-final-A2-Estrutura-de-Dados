was also last thin lizzy album to feature guitarist brian robertson who left band shortly after its release band decided to release a live album after their producer tony visconti did not have enough time to work on a full studio session group listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled album from best versions various studio overdubs were made to live recordings during early 1978 in paris exactly how much of album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release album reached no 2 in uk album charts ultimately selling over half a million copies it has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of greatest live albums of all time recording thumb 220px upright thin lizzy live on bad reputation tour in 1977 during which concerts at philadelphia and toronto were recorded for album by mid 1970s thin lizzy had stabilised around founding members lead singer and bassist phil lynott and drummer brian downey alongside guitarists scott gorham and brian robertson band had found commercial success with several hit singles and developed a strong live following including headlining reading festival robertson had briefly left band in 1977 but subsequently returned group had planned to make a new studio album at start of 1978 working with producer tony visconti thin lizzy retained commercial success with album bad reputation and group wanted to work with him again however visconti had a very tight schedule and had committed to producing several albums for other artists so lynott suggested instead that they spend two weeks together compiling a live album from earlier recordings band and visconti listened to over 30 hours of archive recordings looking for best performances to release album sleeve notes credit two concerts as source of album hammersmith odeon london england on 14 november 1976 as part of tour for johnny fox released earlier that year and seneca college fieldhouse don mills toronto ontario canada on 28 october 1977 as part of tour for bad reputation visconti later revealed that shows at tower theater philadelphia on 20 and 21 october 1977 a week earlier than toronto gig had also been recorded band had listened back to hammersmith tapes shortly after recording and agreed that performances sounded better than studio versions thin lizzy biographer mark putterford believes majority of recordings on finished album are from hammersmith show visconti later said performance of southbound came from a soundcheck before one of philadelphia gigs with audience reaction dubbed in from another song on this album band segues immediately from cowboy song into boys are back in town on line a cowboy s life is life for me last chord of former was first of latter although their studio versions were recorded as separate songs this segue between two tracks remained a staple of band s setlist for rest of their career and examples can be found on other live releases band had rearranged still in love with you to be slower and more emotional than original studio version and version recorded on live and dangerous was considered by putterford to be highlight of lynott s musical career to promote album group filmed a gig at rainbow theatre london on 29 march 1978 for a television broadcast however this was cancelled and footage went unaired production album was mixed and overdubbed at studio des dames paris in january 1978 all sources agree that overdubbing took place on live and dangerous although there is considerable disagreement about extent of them according to visconti album was 75 recorded in studio with only drums and audience noise remaining from original live recordings visconti later said overdubs and production were essential in order that listener could hear a professional sounding band he claims to have created some audience sounds from a keyboard triggered tape loop in a similar manner to a mellotron or sampling keyboard nevertheless visconti was happy with production and believes end result sounds authentic however manager chris o donnell said album was 75 live with overdubs restricted to backing vocals and a few guitar solos to clean sound up lynott said that there were a few necessary overdubs but anything else would have ruined atmosphere on those recordings and made a mockery of putting out a live album robertson has been particularly critical over visconti s view he has said album is almost all live and sound levels on stage would make overdubbing impossible due to lack of acoustic separation between instruments he claims a recording of still in love with you featuring a guitar solo he felt was better than one at gig that was eventually released could not be used due to phaser noise on bass from this he concluded that if bass could not be overdubbed nothing else could either o donnell hired chalkie davies a photographer for new musical express for two weeks to photograph band on a us tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for album artwork front cover featuring lynott in foreground was originally supposed to be back cover as group wanted equal coverage of all members o donnell disagreed and reversed front and back photographs at last minute album had a working title of thin lizzy live but lynott decided that live and dangerous was better record sleeve includes a montage photograph in studio consisting of a mirror straw razor blade and a rolled up five pound note as an overt reference to cocaine consumption lynott insisted on adding picture over rest of band s
