both skills service with new zealand company in 1841 brunner s father put his son s name forward to new zealand company which was seeking prospective emigrants for its proposed settlement in south island of new zealand company wanted to populate its new settlement with well educated young men of excellent character and with leadership potential furthermore apprentice surveyors at time known as improvers were in particular demand and brunner aided by character references from his employer and other notable residents of oxford was duly selected to join company in addition to his work as an he was to assist settlement s principal surveyor frederick tuckett brunner joined a party of six other young improvers which left england on 27 april 1841 aboard whitby during voyage to new zealand improvers received further instruction and were tested by having to prepare draft layouts for new settlement brunner s plan being best of these on 18 september whitby arrived at port nicholson new zealand company s first settlement approximate site for new settlement had yet to be finalised initially intended for banks peninsula this location was vetoed by governor of new zealand william hobson instead it was to be located at top of south island at tasman bay early following month a convoy of company s ships with brunner aboard one them crossed cook strait to tasman bay after scouting area for three weeks a site adjacent a deep and sheltered natural harbour was identified as being suitable for settlement for next two years brunner assisted in laying out of settlement which was to be called nelson a drawback with nelson settlement was its lack of pasture and colony began to appropriate more and more of nearby wairau plain much to displeasure of local maori several personnel of company including arthur wakefield senior official of company in nelson were killed in wairau affray in june 1843 new zealand company was forced to look south for more farming land brunner was sent to scout motueka valley but failed to penetrate far due to poor weather from local maori he heard of a large plain to south and passed on his findings to tuckett in august 1843 tuckett dispatched brunner to confirm reports brunner accompanied by kehu a maori he had befriended was again defeated by poor weather life in nelson was hard for colonists company had limited finances and tightened its expenditure which affected salaries of its employees in 1844 it had to halt its operations for a time although nelson had 300 landowners nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in town brunner lived at a nearby village and in addition to carrying out survey work along motueka river helped in design and building of houses in area he ended his service with company in august 1844 exploring west coast thumb william fox s painting of a scene from his february 1846 expedition with brunner and charles heaphy brunner and heaphy rest in front of a crude hut while expedition s maori guide kehu snares a weka with a lure of food on a stick and a long pole with a noose in february 1846 brunner and kehu accompanied by charles heaphy and william fox undertook an expedition southwest of nelson fox was resident agent for new zealand company in nelson and provided equipment and provisions for party in addition to paying a salary to brunner and heaphy land in nelson for farming was still scarce but it was hoped that beyond steep hills to southwest good pastoral land would be found difficult terrain faced them high mountain ranges topped with snow and ice steep bush numerous rivers and gorges food sources included roots and berries birds could be snared and eels caught from streams along coast shellfish and gull eggs added to diet party each carrying a load of trekked to lake rotoiti and then climbed high ranges that backed onto lake on 11 february they saw lake and made their way to its shores and spent two days exploring area they gained buller river on 18 february and walked its banks as far as maruia river here believing themselves to be only 20 miles from coast dwindling provisions prevented them proceeding to mouth of buller river guided by kehu party traversed hope saddle on their way back to nelson which they reached on 1 march brunner was keen for further exploration and fox persuaded him to scout along west coast to mouth of buller river in hope of finding suitable land for farming brunner kehu and heaphy left nelson on 17 march on what became a five month expedition tracing western coast of south island as far south as what is now known as hokitika their journey began from golden bay and they made their way to west wanganui where brunner hired a local maori etau as a porter for party expedition hit a snag when local chief barred their journey south but brunner and heaphy mollified him with some tobacco they continued along coast climbing sometimes steep cliffs and fording rivers as they went their movements would be held up at times due to rain and high tides at night they would shelter in small caves augmented with a screen of nikau palm leaves they crossed karamea river on 20 april and reached buller river ten days later this had to be crossed using an old canoe that was repaired by kehu and etau after safely getting across they stayed at local pa village in early may they sighted southern alps at arahura river a tributary of grey river southernmost point of expedition they were hosted by local ngai tahu tribe at taramakau pa poor weather plagued their return trip back along coast but they reached nelson on 18 august great journey on 3 december 1846 brunner began what became his longest and most arduous expedition he planned to follow buller river to sea and then trek down west coast as far south as milford sound during his previous expedition he had been told of existence of a route through southern alps by maori at arahura river he hoped to discover this route and use it to cross southern alps and reach canterbury he was accompanied once again by kehu who brought along his wife another maori pitewate a friend of kehu s also joined venture accompanied by his wife brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions wives proved problematic during journey as they quarrelled sometimes supported by their husbands and brunner would have to mediate stocked with provisions that included two guns of tobacco of flour salt and pepper biscuits and tea party travelled by mules and canoe for first two weeks until they reached buller river they then followed path of river down to coast journey was difficult party was constantly bothered by sandflies and rain and they had to ford river several times they settled into a routine of trekking for a week then camping for same period to restock their provisions living off freshwater fish and cabbage and fern tree roots by may 1847 they were at final reaches of buller but food was becoming so scarce to find they had to kill brunner s dog he noted its flesh was something between mutton and pork it is too richly flavoured to eat by itself this incident led to him being nicknamed kai kuri dog eater thumb right 270px a view of a section of west coast and typical of terrain and weather encountered by brunner and his companions during their journey brunner was disappointed at condition of land along banks of buller river as it neared coast he had briefly scouted area on his previous journey and believed it had potential for pastoral farming he now found it too damp and mossy to be cultivated party reached mouth of buller on 1 june and made their way to pa that brunner and heaphy had stayed at on their last journey but on arrival found that it had been abandoned they continued on down to arahura river and reached taramakau pa where they stayed for three months over worst of winter months on 12 october brunner continued south with some local maori he went as far south as tititira head near paringa where in december he severely sprained his ankle after recovering he decided to make his way back to taramakau pa from here he along with his companions journeyed up arahura river and in late january 1848 discovered coalfield and lake which now bears his name he wanted to continue on this route to canterbury but kehu and pitewate would have none of it party began to make their way back to nelson they travelled north via a tributary of arahura river which eventually met buller river which they reached in march in april while making his way up buller gorge brunner suffered paralysis of his leg party had to lay up for a week for brunner to recover some use of his body with aid of kehu pitewate and his wife abandoned party when brunner became ill he was able to reach nelson in june 1848 thus ending after 550 days what he described as his great journey in nelson many people had thought brunner dead and he readily recognised that he would not have survived his endeavours without aid of kehu writing i found my native ekehu of much use invaluable indeed but other three rather an encumbrance i could have made better progress without them but to ekehu i owe my life he is a faithful and attached servant as well as further information about west coast brunner informed colony that coal was to be found in grey river valley however he also considered mistakenly that there is nothing on west coast worth incurring expense of exploring reports of brunner s endeavours on west coast soon spread to wellington and england he wrote an account of his journey which was first published by charles elliott editor of local newspaper nelson examiner and later in 1850 in journal of royal geographical society royal geographical society also awarded him their patron s medal and appointed him a fellow of society his exploits were also recognised in france societe de geographie french geographic society awarding him a diploma in 1852 later life thumb st michael s church in waimea west was designed by brunner in 1866 brunner s constitution was considerably impaired by his exertions and his health never fully returned despite this after a period of recovery he set out in november 1848 with three companions including kehu to discover a quicker route between nelson and wairau this involved travelling paths of and wairoa rivers to their headwaters weather was poor throughout six week trip and brunner was in discomfort for much of ultimately unsuccessful venture which determined that existing route to wairau was fastest apart from a short period doing contract surveying for new zealand company in march 1849 brunner remained unemployed and wrote numerous letters to his contacts his former travelling companion william fox and dillon bell chief agent of new zealand company also sought to find him a job and through them he was able to find work as a clerk with canterbury association between september 1849 and february 1850 he returned to nelson in may 1850 and secured full time employment as a surveyor with new zealand company but with proviso that he would be able to take on private work which did not interfere with his duties to supplement his income brunner began to take on architectural commissions in 1851 new zealand company was still struggling financially and eventually transferred its land to new zealand government brunner s employment with company ceased and he after writing a letter soliciting for surveying work was appointed government surveyor with an annual salary of ps100 2014 approximation ps8 000 this was still a low salary for a professional and brunner was allowed to continue with his architectural commissions working from an office he had purchased in nelson he was kept busy for next several years in addition to carrying out and supervising survey work in area he took on responsibility for some public works he drew up plans for roading bridges and botanical gardens on 11 october 1855 brunner married jane robson 26 year old daughter of a labourer who had brought his family to new zealand previous year it was a respectable match for jane as brunner was considered a particularly eligible bachelor in nelson one of around 45 professionals working in town of about 1600 people his salary had increased to ps300 ps24 000 and he was now chief surveyor for nelson province local returning officer and commissioner of native reserves for nelson he also owned three properties including his nelson office brunner returned to mouth of buller river in march 1861 but this time aboard a ship working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to area in 1848 with other members of his staff he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become town of westport later that month he did same for greymouth work was soon completed and party returned to nelson in april 1861 brunner designed st michael s church in waimea west in 1866 which was probably new zealand s first memorial church it commemorates captain francis h blundell an early settler who died in 1865 and is buried here previous church on site from 1843 was first church in nelson province on 5 april 1984 st michael s was registered with new zealand

young age of 46 he remained employed by nelson provincial council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of nelson survey department his administration skills were not up to latter role and many of surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality he also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on suitability of buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873 on his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost cutting measures by nelson provincial council this did not meet with approval of locals in late 1873 brunner suffered a paralysis of his left side which prevented him from working by mid april 1874 he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting provincial government for suitable employment however on morning of 22 april he suffered a stroke and died few hours later his funeral service was held at nelson cathedral and was attended by several hundred people a large maori contingent including his long time friend kehu was also present brunner was buried at wakapuaka cemetery he was survived by his wife who moved to
