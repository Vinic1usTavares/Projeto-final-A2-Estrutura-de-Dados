howard staunton 1810 22 june 1874 was an english chess master who is generally regarded as having been world s strongest player from 1843 to 1851 largely as a result of his 1843 victory over pierre charles fournier de saint amant he promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape staunton pattern promulgated by nathaniel cooke that is still style required for competitions he was principal organiser of first international chess tournament in 1851 which made england world s leading chess centre and caused adolf anderssen to be recognised as world s strongest player from 1840 onwards he became a leading chess commentator and won matches against top players of 1840s in 1847 he entered a parallel career as a shakespearean scholar ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851 in 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between staunton and paul morphy but they failed it is often alleged that staunton deliberately misled morphy while trying to avoid match but it is also possible staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match modern commentators consider staunton s understanding of positional play to have been far ahead of his contemporaries although not an all out attacking player he attacked when his preparations were complete his chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged development of chess in united kingdom and his chess player s handbook 1847 was a reference for decades chess openings english opening and staunton gambit were named for his advocacy of them staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time and his chess writings could be spiteful on other hand he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts and demonstrated excellent management skills life thumb left 200px staunton c 1860 most information about staunton s early life is based on claims he made in 1871 census he claimed he was born in keswick record of his birth or baptism has never been found chess historian h j r murray summarised information that he gleaned from various sources staunton was born in 1810 reputedly natural son meaning illegitimately born of frederick howard fifth earl of carlisle he was neglected in youth receiving little or no education although he spent some time in oxford he was never a member of university when he came of age he inherited a few thousand pounds which he soon squandered in later life staunton often used to tell how he had once played lorenzo in merchant of venice with famous english actor edmund kean playing shylock 1836 1842 first steps in chess in 1836 staunton came to london where he took out a subscription for william greenwood walker s games at chess actually played in london by late alexander mcdonnell esq staunton was apparently twenty six when he took a serious interest in chess he said that at that time strongest players he saw in london saint amant and george walker could easily have given him rook odds in 1838 he played many games with captain evans inventor of evans gambit and also lost a match against german chess writer aaron alexandre he had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against german master h w popert a slow cautious player with great defensive skill from may to december 1840 staunton edited a chess column for new court gazette he then became chess editor of magazine british miscellany and his chess column developed into a separate magazine chess player s chronicle which staunton owned and edited until early 1850s and transformation can be seen at 1843 competitive peak early in 1843 staunton prevailed in a long series of games against john cochrane a strong player and chess theoretician chessmetrics treats these games incorrectly as one match when it was in fact a series of matches and lists it as staunton s best performance a little later that year he lost a short match 2 1 2 3 1 2 in london against visiting french player saint amant who was generally regarded as world s strongest active player fine 1951 staunton challenged saint amant to a longer match to be played in paris for a stake of ps100 equivalent to about ps73 000 in 2015 conversion based on average incomes most appropriate measure for several days hard work if conversion is based on prices result is about ps8 900 then he prepared new opening lines especially those beginning 1 c4 which became known as english opening after this match he also took thomas worrall and harry wilson to paris as his assistants this is first known case where seconds were used in a match staunton gained a seven game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning match 13 8 eleven wins four draws and six losses in december 1843 saint amant wanted a third match but staunton was initially unwilling as he had developed heart palpitations during second match von der lasa later suggested this was why staunton faded in second match however after a long difficult negotiation which he reported in chess player s chronicle staunton went to paris intending to start their third match in october 1844 but he caught pneumonia while travelling and almost died match was postponed and never took place several modern commentators regard staunton as de facto world champion after his match victory over saint amant although that title did not yet formally exist hooper and whyld refer to staunton as world s leading player in 1840s originally published in 1948 by david mckay as world s a chessboard after saint amant s defeat no other frenchmen arose to continue french supremacy in chess established by philidor la bourdonnais and saint amant some contemporary english commentators mainly in staunton s chess player s chronicle and some later writers hailed staunton as world champion earl of mexborough s speech to meeting of yorkshire chess clubs reported in 1845 chess player s chronicle with cover

after his victory over saint amant was generally regarded in england as world champion sergeant expressed agreement with this assessment stating by his victory over saint amant staunton may fairly be to have become unofficial chess champion of world id at 57 response was less enthusiastic elsewhere in europe even in england some writers suggested other players notably buckle or von der lasa were stronger letter from bledow to von der lasa written in 1846 and published in deutsche schachzeitung in 1848 george walker in bell s life quoted at 1845 1848 chess writer and promoter in 1845 staunton began a chess column for illustrated london news which became most influential chess column in world and which he continued for rest of his life although his articles mostly focused on over board play continuous play against an opponent correspondence chess is not continuous analysis may take several hours continuous work but there is no opponent a significant number featured correspondence chess some followed with enthusiasm progress of promising youngsters including paul morphy staunton produced over 1 400 weekly articles for illustrated london news right 200px thumb chess player s handbook first chess match by electric telegraph took place in 1844 between washington and baltimore in april 1845 staunton and captain kennedy travelled to gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in london staunton took a long term interest in this solution to difficulties of travel and reported telegraph games in illustrated london news in 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between sydney and adelaide calculated that 74 moves of longest game had travelled a total of 220 000 miles not much less than distance between earth and moon in 1847 staunton published his most famous work chess player s handbook which is still in print it contained over 300 pages of opening analysis and almost 100 pages of endgame analysis staunton s analysis of very rare rook versus three minor pieces endgame is surprisingly sophisticated for its time three minor pieces are much stronger than a rook and in cases where two of them are bishops will usually win without much difficulty because player of rook is certain to be compelled to lose him for one of his adversary s pieces if however there are two knights and one bishop opposed to a rook latter may generally be exchanged for bishop and as two knights are insufficient of themselves to force checkmate game will be drawn p 439 modern endgame tablebases confirm staunton s assessments of both endgames staunton s handbook was based on and

thumb right 300px front entrance of great exhibition in hyde park london staunton proposed and then took lead in organising first ever international tournament as he thought great exhibition of 1851 presented a unique opportunity because difficulties that obstructed international participation would be greatly reduced he may also have been motivated by reports that a few years earlier ludwig bledow had proposed to organise an international tournament in germany whose winner was to be recognised as world champion staunton and his colleagues had ambitious objectives for this tournament including convening a chess parliament to complete standardisation of various rules and procedures for competitive chess and for writing about chess staunton also proposed production of a compendium

anderssen was at first deterred by travel costs but accepted his invitation when staunton offered to pay anderssen s travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary committee had also organised a london provincial tournament for other british players and promoted some of entrants to play in international tournament to obtain right number of players for a knock out tournament tournament was a success but disappointing for staunton personally in second round he was knocked out by anderssen who won tournament convincingly and in play off for third place staunton was narrowly beaten by elijah williams williams beat staunton by one game in match this was before time controls were used and staunton resigned a crucial game because he claimed that williams was taking too long to move ref anne sunnucks encyclopedia of chess 1970 p 459 staunton s defeat by williams suggests that staunton had over stretched himself by acting as both a competitor and secretary of organising committee london chess club which had fallen out with staunton and his colleagues organised a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi national set of players many of whom had competed in staunton s tournament and result was same anderssen won in 1852 staunton published his book chess tournament which recounted in detail efforts required to make london international tournament happen and presented all games with his comments on play unfortunately some of staunton s comments in book and in illustrated london news were intemperate because he was disappointed with placing he achieved

accepted challenge but match could not be arranged staunton was physically unfit for an immediate contest and anderssen had to return to work carl jaenisch had arrived too late for tournament staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after seven wins one draw and two losses later in 1851 staunton played a match against elijah williams who had won their play off for third place in london international tournament staunton won more games six wins three draws and four losses but lost match because he had given williams a three game start in 1853 while trying to arrange a match against anderssen staunton met von der lasa in brussels two began a match but had to abandon it in middle of thirteenth game with von der lasa leading five wins four losses and three draws staunton was unfit to continue because of heart palpitations which had affected him in second match against saint amant in 1843 in von der lasa s opinion there was no chance that staunton s health would be good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards note some writers say staunton and von der lasa played a match in berlin in 1844 but staunton wrote in chess player s chronicle that he had pleasure of making personal acquaintance of von der lasa in their 1853 encounter see in mid 1850s staunton obtained a contract with publishers routledge to edit text of shakespeare this edition appeared in parts from 1857 to 1860 and staunton s work was praised by experts thumb right 200px paul morphy while staunton was busy with shakespeare edition he received a courteous letter from new orleans chess club inviting him to that city to play paul morphy who had won recent first american chess congress staunton replied thanking new orleans chess club and morphy for honor implied in your selection of me as opponent of such a champion and pointing out that he had not competed for several years and was working six days a week on editing shakespeare and that he could not possibly travel across atlantic for a match he also wrote in illustrated london news that he had been compelled by laborious literary occupation to abandon practice of chess beyond indulgence of an occasional game if mr morphy for whose skill we entertain liveliest admiration be desirous to win his spurs among chess chivalry of europe he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year he will then meet in this country in france in germany and in russia many champions ready to test and do honor to his prowess full text of staunton s letter was gentlemen in reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit new orleans for purpose of encountering mr paul morphy at chess permit me to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon practice of game almost entirely except in most desultory manner and at present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty i am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation under circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest even in this metropolis would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for recovery of my old strength in play together with such arrangements as would prevent sacrifice of my professional engagements for sake of a match at chess and that idea of undertaking one in a foreign country many thousand miles from here is admissible only in a dream with friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate and with compliments to you for honour implied in your selection of me as opponent of such a champion i beg to subscribe myself with every consideration yours obediently h staunton from evidently reprinted from chess historian h j r murray wrote that staunton s letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of offer but that morphy interpreted them differently and one of main reasons for his visit to europe in 1858 was hope of playing a match with staunton some other chess historians disagree with murray s interpretation of staunton s response konsala 1981 p 29 staunton did offer to play morphy by electric telegraph a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically however this offer arrived after morphy had left for europe which perhaps was fortunate as newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866 this cites entry for telegraph chess in upon arriving in england in june 1858 morphy promptly challenged staunton to a match at first staunton declined morphy s offer saying that challenge came too late konsala 1981 p 30 morphy did not give up negotiations and urging staunton to play in early july staunton agreed provided he was given time to get back into practice on openings and endgames konsala 1981 pp 31 32 and provided that he could manage all this without breaking publication contract for his shakespearean work in early august morphy wrote asking staunton when match could occur and staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks konsala 1981 p 33 staunton competed in a tournament that started on 22 august in birmingham but this was a knock out tournament and he was eliminated in second round by johann lowenthal after playing a total of four games this was to be staunton s last public chess competition h j r murray wrote that staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess just before staunton left london for birmingham his old enemy george walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay match indefinitely and staunton received another letter from morphy pressing him to name a date for match staunton and morphy met socially in birmingham and after a tense discussion staunton agreed to play in early november konsala 1981 p 34 just after tournament a letter signed by anti book appeared in staunton s column in illustrated london news alleging that morphy did not actually have money for his share of stakes this letter is widely thought to have been written by staunton himself if so he must have written it immediately after reading walker s article and morphy s letter and immediately before leaving for birmingham around this time morphy wrote to friends in us asking them to obtain stake money for staunton match morphy s family refused to contribute as they should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else s but new orleans chess club sent ps500 meanwhile morphy went to paris to play against continental masters in september illustrated london news printed both a complimentary full page article about morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column on 6 october 1858 while in paris morphy wrote staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications in which morphy complained about staunton s conduct copies were sent to illustrated london news bell s life in london era field and sunday times staunton replied on 9 october re stating difficulties he faced but now giving them as reasons to cancel match konsala 1981 p 43 on 23 october staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of morphy s open letter omitting reference to anti book letter various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters morphy took no part in any of this but wrote to lord lyttelton president of british chess association explaining his own efforts to bring about match accusing staunton of avoiding match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play complaining about staunton s representation of facts in illustrated london news and demanding that you shall declare to world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for staunton to decline match but that in his opinion staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to america but had instead often given impression that he would soon be ready to start match later life staunton continued writing chess column in illustrated london news until his death in 1874 greeting new developments with enthusiasm in 1860 he published chess praxis a supplement to his 1847 work chess player s handbook new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of morphy s games and praised american s play five years later staunton published great schools of england 1865 whose main subject was history of major english public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas learning can only take place successfully if active interest of student is engaged corporal punishment is to be avoided and should be abolished also summarised at but most of his later life was occupied in writing about shakespeare including a photolithographic reproduction of 1600 quarto of much ado about nothing in 1864 and of first folio of shakespeare in 1866 and papers on unsuspected corruptions of shakespeare s text published from 1872 to his death all these works were highly regarded at time when he died suddenly of heart disease on 22 june 1874 he was at his desk writing one of these papers at same time he was also working on his last chess book chess theory and practice which was published posthumously in 1876 a memorial plaque now hangs at his old residence of 117 lansdowne road london in 1997 a memorial stone bearing an engraving of a chess knight was raised over his grave at kensal green cemetery in london which had previously been unmarked and neglected an image of new headstone is at bottom of page assessment staunton has been a controversial figure ever since his own time in words of chess journalist mark weeks staunton represents a unique challenge to chess history many players immediately associate his name with paul morphy as in staunton ducked a match with morphy this is extremely unfair as it concentrates focus on staunton to a relatively minor factually controversial incident while it ignores his significant achievements as chess historian edward winter writes issue of national bias does unfortunately require consideration in staunton morphy affair chess historian dale brandreth makes a similar point from an american perspective fact is that british have always had their thing about morphy they just can t seem to accept that staunton was an unmitigated bastard in his treatment of morphy because he knew damned well he could never have made any decent showing against him in a match however frederick edge 1830 82 and philip w sergeant 1872 1952 two of staunton s harshest critics were british while former world champion bobby fischer 1943 2008 one of biggest fans of both staunton and morphy was american fischer in a famous 1964 article listed morphy and staunton as two of ten greatest players in history bobby fischer ten greatest masters in history vol 1 no 1 january february 1964 pp 56 61 staunton morphy controversy chess historians trace much of 20th century animosity against staunton to books by sergeant about morphy morphy s games of chess first edition 1916 there were several later editions morphy gleanings 1932 both works have been reprinted by dover publications latter under title unknown morphy but page numbers are not necessarily same sergeant in turn made use of a book by edge who accompanied morphy to europe in 1858 as his secretary and personal assistant but returned to us in january 1859 a few months before morphy us and uk editions had different titles and opinions of edge s value as a historical source vary widely american chess journalist daniel willard fiske reviewing edge s book commented mr morphy expressly disclaims any connection with it in any way or manner will afford reader a half hour s entertainment sergeant s books and david lawson s paul morphy pride and sorrow of chess new york 1976 make extensive use of edge s book but note edge s strong anti staunton bias quoted at quoted at lawson also suggests that morphy had seen manuscript of edge s book disliked its treatment of staunton affair so much that he disavowed it and objected to edge s treatment of other matters chess historians h j r murray and both quoted at david hooper and ken whyld described edge as unreliable and having an extreme bias against staunton and both quoted at edward winter wrote word liar has been applied to edge by a small number of english notably authors but what is precise basis that he was anti staunton is incontestable but was being anti staunton a sign of mendacity prejudice or for that matter clear sightedness edge s letters to fiske show that edge regarded morphy as lazy and rather helpless and himself as one who would make morphy s name immortal and that morphy wanted to keep negotiations with staunton discreet while edge insisted on making them as public as possible h j r murray wrote that staunton s response to morphy s initial challenge and his article about same in illustrated london news should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of offer but that morphy interpreted them differently and one of main reasons for his visit to europe in 1858 was hope of playing a match with staunton murray also commented on whole affair in all this there is but little in which we can reproach staunton beyond fact that he kept open possibility of a match for so long and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of course followed by staunton but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of public and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious in response to morphy s complaints lord lyttelton then president of british chess association said that it was reasonable for staunton to decline match but that in his opinion staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to america but had instead often given impression that he would soon be ready to start match von der lasa later wrote although not specifically about this affair that he thought there was no chance of staunton s health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards william norwood potter wrote in his obituary of staunton in city of london chess magazine nor were his innuendoes concerning morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means of getting out of an engagement which he could have either declined with a good grace at first or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from nevertheless all said and done staunton was as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say emphatically a man there was nothing weak about him and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one some 20th century commentators have been more critical of staunton however some well known chess writers including fred reinfeld israel al horowitz and reuben fine have been criticised by chess historians for their lack of accuracy both in general and specifically where staunton is concerned relevant part starts near end of page with diggle s comments as quoted from chess notes c n 1932 edward winter writes it is unwise for non playing historian to publish his own analysis although he may be a useful compiler similarly players who are in and indifferent to chess history should not touch it william hartston wrote of staunton s non match with morphy sadly this blemish on staunton man also did considerable harm to reputation among later generations of staunton chess player hartston p 46 g h diggle wrote in british chess magazine that staunton excused himself from playing a match against greatest player of century then at zenith of his youth and fame was no tragedy for chess contest would have been a fiasco but it would have been happier both for young champion and old had latter never said he would play at all republication of g h diggle staunton versus saint amant 1843 in british chess magazine november and december 1943 playing strength and style thumbnail a depiction of chess match between howard staunton and pierre charles saint amant on 16 december 1843 there is a famous story that paul morphy described staunton as author of some devilish bad games chess historian edward winter traced this back to a book published in 1902 whose author said he had seen a copy of staunton s chess tournament in which morphy had written some devilish bad games on title page winter was unable to trace copy book was around time of staunton s death morphy is said to have commented that staunton may have been strongest player of his time had great analytical ability and judgement of positions but lacked imagination required to deliberately create opportunities for combinations twentieth century opinions of staunton s play varied enormously fred reinfeld al horowitz and reuben fine all condemned it it takes too much time to find a game by him which one can enjoy it is just too incredible that anyone seemingly so weak as staunton could have achieved such success on other hand savielly tartakower wrote a remarkable feature of staunton s play is number of ultra modern ideas with which he was familiar e g restricted centre development bilateral work theory of local engagement etc and last but not least english opening sometimes called staunton opening garry kasparov considered staunton by early 1840s superior to all his rivals bobby fischer opined that staunton was most profound opening analyst of all time he was more theorist than player but nonetheless he was strongest player of his day in addition he understood all of positional concepts which modern players hold dear and thus with steinitz must be considered first modern player quoted in website chessmetrics ranks staunton as world number one from may 1843 to august 1849 in top ten from july 1851 to may 1853 and in top five from june 1853 to january 1856 from early 1840s to 1851 staunton could successfully give odds to almost any uk based player including eventually john cochrane exceptions were henry thomas buckle to whom staunton gave pawn and move in 1843 and lost their match six losses no draws one win and elijah williams in 1851 against whom staunton won more games but lost match because he had given williams a three game start according to match records collected by jeremy p only players who were successful against staunton without receiving odds from 1840 to 1852 were saint amant who won their first match in london in 1843 and lost their second longer match in paris same year adolf anderssen who eliminated staunton from 1851 london international tournament and elijah williams who beat staunton in play off for third place in same tournament before 1840 staunton was still a relative beginner and after 1851 his health was too fragile for serious competition in late 1840s some uk commentators wrote that buckle was stronger and von der lasa was regarded by some as world s best staunton did not play von der lasa until 1853 and was forced by ill health to abandon match in his own time staunton was regarded as belonging to closed category of chess players along with for example philidor and jozsef rather than to heroic category which included la bourdonnais morphy and anderssen instead of seeking immediate combat staunton deferred it until he was ready closed english opening got its name from staunton s frequent use of it especially against saint amant in 1843 however he was noted for accuracy and incisiveness of his combinations personality staunton s virtues and defects were both on a large scale ranken c 1897 quoted in former world champion kasparov commented that staunton founded and edited magazine chess player s chronicle wrote a chess column 1845 1874 studied opening theory published four remarkable books endorsed famous staunton pieces organized first international chess tournament in history last ellipsis as in original however british international master william hartston wrote that staunton s many achievements were done with full weight of an arrogant and pompous nature which has scarcely been matched in history of game even contemporaries sympathetic to staunton admitted that he could be spiteful in response to unexpected defeats and to proposals or arguments that he considered ill founded or malicious staunton had a highly volatile relationship with george walker founder of london chess club a dedicated populariser of chess and one of staunton s earliest supporters based on this cites staunton s enemies gave as good as they got chess journalism could be a bruising business in those days even when staunton was not involved george walker savaged a rival s book in a manner equal to staunton at his worst however it does seem that staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes h j r murray suggested that these frequent wars of words may have originated from leading players and commentators jealousy over staunton s unexpected rise to top in early 1840s and from snobbish disdain about his humble and possibly illegitimate birth saidy and lessing wrote that he can hardly be blamed if struggles and privations of his youth warped his character so that he became a jealous suspicious and vitriolic man on other hand staunton s often criticized description of anderssen as germany s second best player after anderssen had won 1851 london international tournament may have been reasonable on basis of what is now known about von der lasa s skill staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator a large percentage of his 1860 book chess praxis was devoted to morphy s games which he praised highly and in chess player s companion 1849 staunton sometimes criticised his own play and presented a few of his losses staunton showed excellent management skills in building team to organise london international tournament of 1851 and determination and resourcefulness in overcoming difficulties of getting enough competitors he also maintained good working relationships with important players and enthusiasts for example popert and cochrane helped him to prepare for his second match against saint amant captain evans agreed to be one of his seconds in that match and later helped staunton to organise 1845 telegraphic match calcutta chess club contributed ps100 to help finance london international tournament in 1851 and in addition its principal officers cochrane and t c morton made two of four largest personal contributions staunton corresponded with von der lasa for over 30 years although they only met once staunton s last letter to von der lasa november 1873 expressed his sorrow at deaths of various masters and enthusiasts including saint amant and especially carl jaenisch in conversation staunton was charming and witty attack on walker is from account of staunton s conversational skills is from despite disappointing way in which his playing career ended staunton continued to write with enthusiasm about progress of new technologies players and developments in chess theory at time of his death his last book chess theory and practice was sufficiently complete to be published posthumously in 1876 and it was described as up to date fourteen years after his death influence on chess staunton proposed and was principal organiser of first international chess tournament which proved that such events were possible and which produced a clear consensus on who was world s strongest player adolf anderssen all subsequent international tournaments took place in great britain until paris 1867 contemporaries including steinitz and morphy regarded staunton s writings on chess openings as among best of their time his chess player s handbook 1847 immediately became leading english language chess textbook it went through twenty one reprints by 1935 spawned several imitators and remained in print in a revised edition until 1940s around 1888 staunton s chess theory and practice published posthumously in 1876 was regarded as modern in most respects but there was a growing need for more up to date analysis of openings a s time passed a demand arose for more up to date works in english an example of which is and ranken s chess openings 1889 which had four editions up to 1910 in his obituary in city of london chess magazine said his literary labours are basis upon which english chess society stands his play however had little influence on other players of day william hartston explains that his chess understanding was so far ahead of his time a deep strategist living in an era when shallow tactics were still rule staunton s conceptions could not be assimilated by his contemporaries staunton s style and openings that accompanied it were eclipsed by more directly aggressive styles of anderssen and morphy which dominated chess from 1851 until steinitz unveiled his positional approach in 1873 there is little evidence that staunton had much direct influence on modern chess although he introduced english opening it has been called really a twentieth century invention that only became fully respectable after future world champion mikhail botvinnik began playing it in 1930s similarly although he was an early champion of sicilian defense which is today most popular opening and most successful response to 1 e4 new in chess stated in its 2000 yearbook that of games in its database white scored 56 1 with 1 d4 but two percent less 54 1 with 1 e4 primarily because of sicilian against which white scored only 52 3 new in chess yearbook 55 2000 p 227 a graph similar to that in 2000 yearbook can be found at he seems to have had little influence on how sicilian is played today he regarded it as a safe defensive line while it is now treated as a vigorous but slightly risky counter attack staunton wrote that sicilian is best possible reply to move of 1 p to k s 4th as it renders formation of a centre impracticable for white and prevents every attack also quoted at however grandmaster john nunn wrote in 2001 that sicilian is now popular because black is playing not just for equality but for advantage black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack on other hand raymond keene wrote that revived some old forgotten ideas of staunton in sicilian staunton introduced staunton gambit against dutch defense 1 d4 f5 2 e4 although it was once a feared attacking line staunton gambit offers white considerable attacking chances staunton gambit gives white sharp attacking chances for his pawn and places opponent at a psychological disadvantage fear of staunton gambit has discouraged many players from using dutch it has been out of favour since mid 1920s staunton gambit has fallen out of favour for no clear reason staunton gambit fell out of favour some time ago and still remains so staunton gambit is not in much favor today and is thought to offer white equality at best staunton also analysed a different gambit approach to dutch 2 h3 followed by g4 in 1979 viktor one of world s leading players successfully introduced this line into top class competition but later authorities concluded as staunton had that black gets a good game with 2 nf6 3 g4 d5 staunton also advocated opening 1 e4 e5 2 nf3 nc6 3 c3 which was often called staunton s opening it is rarely played today because it allows black to choose between a sharp counter attack and a safe line that usually leads to a draw his other writings staunton s edition of shakespeare s plays was respected quotes oxford
