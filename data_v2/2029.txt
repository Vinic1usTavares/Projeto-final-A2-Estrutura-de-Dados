charlotta sibelius borg family name stems from estate in eastern uusimaa which his paternal great grandfather owned sibelius s father died of typhoid in july 1868 leaving substantial debts as a result his mother who was again pregnant had to sell their property and move family into home of katarina borg her widowed mother who also lived in hameenlinna sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment only male influence coming from his uncle pehr ferdinand sibelius who was interested in music especially violin it was he who gave boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition for sibelius uncle pehr not only took place of a father but acted as a musical adviser from an early age sibelius showed a strong interest in nature frequently walking around countryside when family moved to loviisa on coast for summer months in his own words for me loviisa represented sun and happiness hameenlinna was where i went to school loviisa was freedom it was in hameenlinna when he was seven that his aunt julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on family s upright instrument rapping him on knuckles whenever he played a wrong note he progressed by improvising on his own but still learned to read music he later turned to violin which he preferred he participated in trios with his elder sister linda on piano and his younger brother christian on cello christian sibelius was to become an eminent psychiatrist still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in finland furthermore sibelius often played in quartets with neighboring families adding to his experience in chamber music fragments survive of his early compositions of period a trio a piano quartet and a suite in d minor for violin and piano around 1881 he recorded on paper his short pizzicato piece water drops for violin and cello although it might just have been a musical exercise first reference he to himself composing

take violin lessons from local bandmaster gustaf immediately developing a particularly strong interest in instrument setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso he soon succeeded in becoming quite an accomplished player performing david s concerto in e minor in 1886 and following year last two movements of mendelssohn s violin concerto in helsinki despite such success as an instrumentalist he ultimately chose to become a composer although his mother tongue was swedish in 1874 sibelius attended lucina hagman s finnish speaking preparatory school in 1876 he was then able to continue his education at finnish language hameenlinna normal lyceum where he was a rather absent minded pupil although he did quite well in mathematics and botany despite having to repeat a year he passed school s final examination in 1885 which allowed him to enter a university as a boy he was known as janne a colloquial form of johan however during his student years he adopted french form

academy where he studied from 1885 to 1889 one of his teachers was its founder martin wegelius who did much to support development of education in finland it was he who gave self taught sibelius his first formal lessons in composition another important influence was his teacher ferruccio busoni a pianist composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship his close circle of friends included pianist and writer adolf paul and conductor to be armas jarnefelt who introduced him to his influential family including his sister aino who would become sibelius s wife most remarkable of his works during this period was violin sonata in f rather reminiscent of grieg sibelius continued his studies in berlin from 1889 to 1890 with albert becker and in vienna from 1890 to 1891 with robert fuchs and hungarian jewish karl goldmark in berlin he had opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas including premiere of richard strauss s don juan he also heard finnish composer robert kajanus conducting berlin philharmonic in a program that included his symphonic poem aino a patriotic piece that may have triggered sibelius s later interest in using epic poem kalevala as a basis for his own compositions while in vienna he became particularly interested in music of anton bruckner whom for a time he regarded as greatest living composer although he continued to show interest in established works of beethoven and wagner he enjoyed his year in vienna frequently partying and gambling with his new friends it was also in vienna that he turned to orchestral composition working on an overture in e major and a scene de ballet while embarking on kullervo an orchestral work inspired by kalevala he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone excision surgery shortly after returning to helsinki sibelius thoroughly enjoyed conducting his overture and scene de ballet at a popular concert he was also able to continue working on kullervo now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things finnish premiered in helsinki on 28 april 1892 work was an enormous success thumb upright sibelius in 1891 it was around this time that sibelius finally abandoned his cherished aspirations as a violinist my tragedy was that i wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price since age of 15 i played my violin practically from morning to night i hated pen and ink unfortunately i preferred an elegant violin bow my love for violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when i had to admit that i had begun my training for exacting career of a virtuoso too late in addition to long periods he spent studying in vienna and berlin 1889 91 in 1900 he travelled to italy where he spent a year with his family he composed conducted and socialized actively in scandinavian countries uk france and germany and later travelled to united states marriage and rise to fame while sibelius was studying music in helsinki

governor of vaasa and elisabeth von a baltic aristocrat wedding was held on 10 june 1892 at they spent their honeymoon in karelia home of kalevala it served as an inspiration for sibelius s tone poem en saga lemminkainen legends and karelia suite their home ainola was completed on lake tuusula jarvenpaa in 1903 over their years in ainola they had six daughters eva ruth kirsti who died very young from typhoid katarina margareta and heidi eva married an industrial heir paloheimo and later became ceo of paloheimo corporation ruth was a prominent actress katarina ilves married a banker and heidi

visiting his hameenlinna home one last time before house was sold on 16 february 1893 first extended version of en saga was presented in helsinki although it was not too well received critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated as they were in sibelius s 1902 version even less successful were three more performances of kullervo in march which one critic found was incomprehensible and lacking in vitality following birth of sibelius s first child eva in april premiere of his choral work vainamoinen s boat ride was a considerable success receiving support of press on 13 november 1893 full version of karelia was premiered at a student association gala at in viipuri with collaboration of artist axel gallen and sculptor emil who had been brought in to design

presented an extended suite of work in helsinki conducting orchestra of philharmonic society sibelius s music was increasingly presented in helsinki s concert halls in 1894 95 season works such as en saga karelia and varsang composed in 1894 were included in at least 16 concerts in capital not to mention those in turku when performed in a revised version on 17 april 1895 composer oskar merikanto

considerable period sibelius worked on an opera veneen luominen building of boat again based on kalevala to some extent he had come under influence of wagner but subsequently turned to liszt s tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration adapted from material for opera which he never completed his lemminkainen suite consisted of four legends in form of tone poems they were premiered in helsinki on 13 april 1896 to a full house in contrast to merikanto s enthusiasm for finnish quality of work critic karl flodin found cor anglais solo in swan of tuonela long and boring although he considered first legend lemminkainen and maidens of island as representing peak of sibelius s achievement to date to pay his way from 1892 sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at music institute and at kajanus s conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant initially for ten years and later extended for life he was able to complete music for adolf paul s play king christian ii performed on 24 february 1898 its catchy tunes appealed to public scores of four popular pieces from play were published in germany and sold well in finland when orchestral suite was successfully performed in helsinki in november 1898 sibelius commented music sounded excellent and tempi seem to be right i think this is first time that i have managed to make something complete work was also performed in stockholm and leipzig in january 1899 sibelius embarked on his first symphony at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by russian emperor nicholas ii s attempt to restrict powers of grand duchy of finland symphony was well received by all when it was premiered in helsinki on 26 april 1899 but program also premiered even more compelling blatantly patriotic song of athenians for boys and men s choirs song immediately brought sibelius status of a national hero another patriotic work followed on 4 november in form of eight tableaux depicting episodes from finnish history known as press celebration music it had been written in support of staff of newspaper which had been suspended for a period after editorially criticizing russian rule last tableau finland awakens was particularly popular after minor revisions it became well known finlandia thumb left sibelius sketch by albert engstrom 1904 in february 1900 sibelius and his wife were deeply saddened by death of their youngest daughter nevertheless in spring sibelius went on an international tour with kajanus and

began to write his second symphony partly inspired by fate of don juan in mozart s don giovanni it was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in helsinki on 8 march work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by finns merikanto felt it exceeded even boldest expectations while evert katila qualified it as an absolute masterpiece flodin too wrote of a symphonic composition likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before sibelius spent summer in tvarminne near hanko where he worked on song var det en drom was it a dream as well as on a new version of en saga when it

valse triste one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother in law arvid jarnefelt s play kuolema death short of money he sold piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in finland but internationally during his long stays in helsinki sibelius s wife aino frequently wrote to him imploring him to return home but to no avail even after their fourth daughter katarina was born he continued to work away from home early in 1904 he finished his violin concerto but its first public performance on 8 february was not a success it led to a revised condensed version that was performed in berlin following year move to ainola thumb ainola photographed in 1915 in november 1903 sibelius began to build his new home ainola aino s place near lake tuusula some 45 km 30 miles north of helsinki to cover construction costs he gave concerts in helsinki turku and vaasa in early 1904 as well as in tallinn estonia and in latvia during summer

third symphony he completed work for a performance in helsinki on 25 september http www com sibelius symphony no3 although its more classical approach surprised audience flodin commented that it was internally new and revolutionary shortly afterwards sibelius met gustav mahler who was in helsinki two agreed that with each new symphony they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works

may 1908 sibelius s health deteriorated further he travelled with his wife to berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat after operation he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in following years including luonnotar and fourth symphony more pleasant times thumb finlandia first edition in 1909 successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between sibelius and aino in family home in britain too his condition was well received as he conducted en saga finlandia valse triste and spring song to enthusiastic audiences a meeting with claude debussy produced further support after another uneventful trip to paris he went to berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful sibelius started work on his fourth symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs in october he conducted concerts in kristiania now oslo where and in memoriam were first performed his valse triste and second symphony were particularly well received he then travelled to berlin to continue work on his fourth symphony writing finale after returning to jarvenpaa sibelius conducted his first concerts in sweden in early 1911 when even his third symphony was welcomed by critics he completed

himself last major contributions thumb sibelius and aino in jarvenpaa early 1940s year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in sibelius s output after his seventh symphony he produced only a few major works during rest of his life arguably two most significant of these were incidental music for tempest and tone poem tapiola for most of last thirty years of his life sibelius even avoided talking publicly about his music there is substantial evidence that sibelius worked on an eighth symphony he promised premiere of this symphony to serge koussevitzky in 1931 and 1932 and a london performance in 1933 under basil cameron was even advertised to public only concrete evidence of symphony s existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011 sibelius had always been quite self critical he remarked to his close friends if i cannot write a better symphony than my seventh then it shall be my last since no manuscript survives sources consider it likely that sibelius destroyed most traces of score probably in 1945 during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to flames his wife aino recalled in 1940s there was a great auto da fe at ainola my husband collected a number of manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on open fire in dining room parts of karelia suite were destroyed i later saw remains of pages which had been torn out and many other things i did not have strength to be present and left room i therefore do not know what he threw on to fire but after this my husband became calmer and gradually lighter in mood second world war years on sibelius s 70th birthday 8 december 1935 german nazi regime awarded him goethe medal with a certificate signed by adolf hitler after raid on finland by soviet union on 30 november 1939 sibelius family returned for good to ainola in summer of 1941 after a long absence anxious about bolshevism sibelius advocated that finnish soldiers march alongside german army against soviet union sibelius did not make any utterances about genocide of jews although in a diary entry in 1943 he wondered why he had signed aryan certificate dagbok p 336 on 1 january 1939 sibelius participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his andante performance was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on cd this is probably only surviving example of sibelius interpreting his own music final years and death thumb left sibelius in 1939 from 1903 and for many years thereafter sibelius had lived in countryside from 1939 he and aino again had a home in helsinki but they moved back to ainola in 1941 only occasionally visiting city after war he returned to helsinki only a couple of times so called silence of jarvenpaa became something of a myth as in addition to countless official visitors and colleagues his grandchildren and great grandchildren also spent their holidays in ainola sibelius avoided public statements about other composers but erik w tawaststjerna and sibelius s secretary have documented his private conversations in which he admired richard strauss and considered bela bartok and dmitri shostakovich most talented composers of younger generation in 1950s he promoted young finnish composer einojuhani rautavaara his 90th birthday in 1955 was widely celebrated and both philadelphia orchestra under eugene ormandy and royal philharmonic orchestra under sir thomas beecham gave special performances of his music tawaststjerna also relates an anecdote in connection with sibelius s death he was returning from his customary morning walk exhilarated he told his wife aino that he had seen a flock of cranes approaching there they come birds of my youth he exclaimed suddenly one of birds broke away from formation and circled once above ainola it then rejoined flock to continue its journey thumb sibelius funeral in helsinki 1957 two days later in ainola on evening of 20 september 1957 sibelius died of a brain haemorrhage at age 91 at time of his death his fifth symphony conducted by sir malcolm sargent was being radio broadcast from helsinki at same time united nations general assembly was in session and then general assembly president sir leslie munro of new zealand ordered a moment of silence saying sibelius belonged to whole world with his music he enriched life of entire human race another well known finnish composer heino died same day but his death was overshadowed by that of sibelius sibelius was honoured with a state funeral and is buried in garden at ainola aino sibelius lived there for next 12 years until she died on 8 june 1969 aged 97 she is buried alongside her husband music sibelius is widely known for his symphonies and his tone poems especially finlandia and karelia suite his reputation in finland grew in 1890s with choral symphony kullervo which like many subsequent pieces drew on epic poem kalevala his first symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when finnish nationalism was evolving in addition to six more symphonies he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems especially en saga swan of tuonela and valse triste sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a violin concerto opera jungfrun i tornet many shorter orchestral pieces chamber music works for piano and violin choral works and numerous songs in mid 1920s after his sixth and seventh symphonies he composed symphonic poem tapiola and incidental music for tempest thereafter although he lived until 1957 he did not publish any further works of note for several years he worked on an eighth symphony which he later burned as for his musical style hints of tchaikovsky s music are particularly evident in early works such as his first symphony and his violin concerto for a period he was nevertheless overwhelmed by wagner particularly while composing his opera more lasting influences included ferruccio busoni and anton bruckner but for his tone poems he was above all inspired by liszt similarities to bruckner can be seen in brass contributions to his orchestral works and generally slow tempo of his music sibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of sonata form in his work and instead of contrasting multiple themes focused on idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement his later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards although analyses showing these predominantly three and four note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into larger themes effectively prove opposite thumb upright portrait of sibelius from 1892 by his brother in law eero jarnefelt this self contained structure stood in stark contrast to symphonic style of gustav mahler sibelius s primary rival in symphonic composition while thematic variation played a major role in works of both composers mahler s style made use of disjunct abruptly changing and contrasting themes while sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements in november 1907 mahler undertook a conducting tour of finland and two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together leading sibelius to comment i said that i admired symphony s severity of style and profound logic that created an inner connection between all motifs mahler s opinion was just reverse no a symphony must be like world it must embrace everything symphonies left thumb robert kajanus founder and chief conductor of helsinki philharmonic orchestra who was a notable interpreter of sibelius s symphonies sibelius started work on his symphony no 1 in e minor op 39 in 1898 and completed it in early 1899 when he was 33 work was first performed on 26 april 1899 by helsinki philharmonic orchestra conducted by composer in an original well received version that has not survived after premiere sibelius made some revisions resulting in version performed today revision was completed in spring and summer of 1900 and was first performed in berlin by helsinki philharmonic conducted by robert kajanus on 18 july 1900 david ewen music for millions encyclopedia of musical masterpieces read books 2007 symphony begins with a highly original rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani his second symphony most popular and most frequently recorded of his symphonies was first performed by helsinki philharmonic society on 8 march 1902 with composer conducting opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for whole work heroic theme of finale with three tone motif is interpreted by trumpets rather than original woodwinds during a period of russian oppression it consolidated sibelius s reputation as a national hero after first performance sibelius made some changes leading to a revised version first performed by armas jarnefelt on 10 november 1903 in stockholm third symphony is a good natured triumphal and deceptively simple sounding piece symphony s first performance was given by helsinki philharmonic society conducted by composer on 25 september 1907 there are themes from finnish folk music in work s early chords composed just after his move to ainola it contrasts sharply with first two symphonies with its clear mode of expression developing into marching tones of finale his fourth symphony was premiered in helsinki on 3 april 1911 by philharmonia society with sibelius conducting it was written while sibelius was undergoing a series of

nature and finnish landscape often served as material for his music he once said of his sixth symphony it always reminds me of scent of first snow forests surrounding ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of tapiola on subject of sibelius s ties to nature his biographer tawaststjerna wrote even by nordic standards sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to moods of nature and changes in seasons he scanned skies with his binoculars for geese flying over lake ice listened to screech of cranes and heard cries of curlew echo over marshy grounds just below ainola he spring

relationship with sibelius throughout his life later in life sibelius was championed by american critic olin downes who wrote a biography of composer in 1938 theodor adorno wrote a critical essay

multi faceted in one adorno sent his essay to virgil thomson then music critic of new york herald tribune who was also critical of sibelius thomson while agreeing with essay s sentiment declared to adorno that tone of it was more apt to create antagonism toward adorno than toward sibelius later composer theorist and conductor rene leibowitz went so far as to describe sibelius as worst composer in world in title of a 1955 pamphlet perhaps one reason sibelius has attracted both praise and ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached basic problems of form tonality and architecture in unique individual ways on one hand his symphonic and tonal creativity was novel while others thought that music should be taking a different route sibelius s response to criticism was

ove andsnes offers a counterweight to page s assessment of sibelius s piano music acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality andsnes believes that common critical dismissal is
