parahughmilleria meaning near hughmilleria meaning of para at www dictionary com retrieved 17 july 2018 is a genus of eurypterid an extinct group of aquatic arthropods fossils of parahughmilleria have been discovered in deposits of devonian and silurian age in united states canada russia germany luxembourg and great britain and have been referred to several different species first fossils of parahughmilleria discovered in shawangunk mountains in 1907 were initially assigned to eurypterus it would not be until 54 years later when parahughmilleria would be described parahughmilleria is classified in family adelophthalmidae only clade in superfamily adelophthalmoidea this clade was characterised by their small size their parabolic approximately u shaped carapaces and presence of epimera lateral extensions of segment on seventh segment among others like its relatives parahughmilleria possessed reniform bean shaped eyes and spines on its appendages largest species was p major at 12 5 cm 5 in making it a small sized eurypterid although it has been suggested that it and p hefteri may represent same species description left 175px thumb restoration of p hefteri like other adelophthalmid eurypterids parahughmilleria was a small sized eurypterid largest species p major only reached 12 5 cm 5 in and smallest species p hefteri measured only 6 cm 2 4 in lamsdell james c

each other if so smallest species would be p maria and p bellistriata both at 7 cm 2 8 in it had a semicircular carapace head plate with reniform compound eyes placed forward which is its main characteristic metastoma a large plate that is part of abdomen had a deep anterior triangular notch telson most posterior segment of body was wide and lanceolate preabdomen body segments 1 to 7 had a lanceolate shape with a big epimera lateral extensions of segment on 7th tergite dorsal portion of an arthropod segment 3rd tergite was most wide segment on body parahughmilleria differs from other more basal members of adelophthalmidae in its reduced being spinous on appendages that along with other factors like large spatulae a long flat piece in operculum associated with genital operculum plate like segment which contains genital aperture suggests a closer relationship with adelophthalmus history of research first discoveries thumb 250px size comparison of well known species of parahughmilleria first fossil remains of parahughmilleria were found in shawangunk mountains new york john mason clarke described and assigned them in 1907 to eurypterus maria carapace of this species was somewhat elongate regularly rounded and with almost parallel lateral margins with near centre of carapace eyes of a crescentic half moon shaped form segments were wide a rapid contraction was observed in postabdomen segments 8 to 12 reminiscent of scorpion abdomen which seems to indicate a immature condition similar contraction is present in other immature eurypterids as well only known adult eurypterids to possess it are carcinosoma scorpioides and several species of eusarcana in which tail was heavily specialized ocelli light sensitive simple eyes were located in a line that connected centers of compound eyes and were located on a large prominent mound abdomen was thin and tapered towards telson which was lanceolate third and fourth segments were widest of preabdomen each tergite of was arched with a narrow flat strip epimera in this species appendages are rare and only swimming legs have been found in some mature specimens these were short and protuberant eighth segment or paddle was long and elliptical with a ninth segment forming a terminal claw clarke j k ruedemann r 1912 eurypterida of new york in 1961 erik n kjellesvig waering reclassified e maria to then new genus parahughmilleria in 1950 kjellesvig waering described a new species of hughmilleria h bellistriata holotype is dorsal side of a carapace in this carapace eyes ocelli and most of its surface with ornamentation are preserved prosoma head was broad evenly rounded at anterior lateral angles and anterior margin lateral and anterior margins were bounded by a thin rounded and raised rim eyes were lateral reniform bean shaped and intramarginal occurring within margin ornamentation of carapace consists of distinct transverse striations along previous part in front of eyes kjellesvig waering noted that this species was different from other hughmilleria species outline of carapace intramarginal eyes and small size 7 cm 2 8 in did not resemble other species as he did with p maria he reassigned species to parahughmilleria in 1961 in 1957 l p described two new species of eurypterids p matarakensis and nanahughmilleria and erroneously assigned them to genus rhenopterus p matarakensis is represented by well preserved carapaces these were semi oval and were girded by a narrow edge trailing edge was slightly concave inward towards anterior part eyes were large at 4 mm 0 16 in long and 2 mm 0 07 in wide they were reniform and rose slightly from surface of carapace at closest point between both eyes there were two round ocelli fossils were found at formation in siberia p matarakensis was assigned to its current genus by kjellesvig waering and willard p leutze creation of genus and additional species left 250px thumb fossils of p salteri a a carapace b holotype nearly complete operculum c metasomal tergites and telson d metastoma and e a specimen with complete mesosoma and part of walking legs in 1961 kjellesvig waering erected genus parahughmilleria meaning near hughmilleria and assigned p salteri as type species he noticed that parahughmilleria differed from hughmilleria in development of supplementary lobes on operculum as in adelophthalmus and in position of intramarginal eyes unlike marginal eyes of hughmilleria p salteri was described based on a holotype and four paratypes in this species prosoma was widely rounded smooth nearly semicircular and highly arched and was surrounded by a narrow and marginal rim base formed a straight line eyes were small reniform and placed ocelli were small and placed almost centrally on prosoma telson was flat lanceolate and broad at anterior an operculum that shows lobes has been described as holotype it comprises two opercular flaps protruding extensions lateral to genital appendage rounded at corners and separated they were separated from each other at midsection and above median appendage specific name of this species honors john william salter an english naturalist and paleontologist and its maximum size was of 8 cm 3 1 in kjellesvig waering also assigned p to genus but this species has since been raised to genus level under name later in 1973 leif stormer described two new species p major and p hefteri both represent largest and smallest species respectively p hefteri is a well known species that has been found both in europe and in north america it had enlarged spines on at least one podomere leg segment and a relatively wide swimming leg both species had a sharply truncated posterior margin in metastoma which only differ by their ratios p major had a longer telson with more lateral concave margins and a broader base a more slender body and narrower paddles than p hefteri stormer also noticed slight differences in genital appendage all these differences can be explained by ontogenetic stages that is different developmental stages of animal throughout its life in 2012 russian paleontologist evgeniy s shpinev described another species p longa from russia its specific name from latin longus refers to unusual length of its prosoma compared to other species of genus about 17 mm about 0 67 in long and 18 mm 0 71 in wide holotype and only known specimen 3 consists of an incomplete prosoma and fragments from a swimming leg in this species prosoma was surrounded by a narrow marginal margin posterior margin was slightly convex eyes were small and as in other species reniform swimming leg was of adelophthalmus type with fifth sixth seventh and part of eighth segment known seventh segment was very long and narrow while eight segment was irregular along outer edge this species is distinguished by having a prosoma narrower and longer than others in addition markus poschmann transferred erieopterus statzi to parahughmilleria in 2015 based on proportions of paddle segments which were more related to those of p hefteri this species is only known by a single specimen that was originally assigned to eurypterus but kjellesvig waering classified it to erieopterus based on shape of prosoma lacking of ornamentation and on highly serrated paddle nine years before poschmann referred e statzi to parahughmilleria he and o erik tetlie had already suggested this change which was not done because of need to study material classification thumb restoration of closely related adelophthalmus parahughmilleria is classified as part of family adelophthalmidae only family within superfamily adelophthalmoidea dunlop j a penney d jekel d 2015 a summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives in world spider catalog natural history museum bern online at http wsc nmbe ch version 18 5 http www wsc nmbe ch resources fossils 5 pdf pdf it is sister group closest relative of adelophthalmus parahughmilleria was classified in family hughmilleriidae until creation of adelophthalmidae by victor p jr in 1989 parahughmilleria and adelophthalmus form a derived group that differentiate them from other basal primitive adelophthalmids these eurypterids share a series of characteristics such as enlarged spines on at least one podomere in appendage v presence of epimera in postabdomen and long spatulae that has been associated with genital operculum this clade and nanahughmilleria have an almost identical carapace paddle eye shapes and eye position however parahughmilleria differs from adelophthalmus in that telson is generally shorter or that cuticular sculpture ornamentation consisting of small minute scales across back is much thinner among other characteristics another genus in family bassipterus was morphologically close to parahughmilleria based on shape of metastoma and telson as well as preabdomen and postabdomen slightly differentiated from each other some authors have even considered bassipterus virginicus type and only species as a synonym of p bellistriata cladogram below presents inferred phylogenetic positions of most of genera included in three most derived superfamilies of suborder of eurypterids adelophthalmoidea pterygotioidea and waeringopteroids as inferred by o erik tetlie and markus poschmann in 2008 based on results of a 2008 analysis specifically pertaining to adelophthalmoidea and a preceding 2004 analysis paleoecology fossils of parahughmilleria have been found from silurian deposits of llandovery epoch to devonian deposits of eifelian epoch in north america europe and siberia fossils of parahughmilleria are often recovered in non marine deposits such as in environments that were once brackish or estuarine habitats with possible tidal influences and with a marine influence more evident than in adelophthalmus dominated habitats in habitats where both parahughmilleria and early species of adelophthalmus are found such as in early devonian fossil sites in germany parahughmilleria occur in sections that are considerably more marginally marine than those sections inhabited by adelophthalmus as jaekelopterus and other some eurypterids parahughmilleria probably wandered in and out of lagoons argillaceous composed of clay like materials devonian deposits of alken germany where fossils of p and p major have been found contains various eurypterids such as rhenopterus jaekelopterus rhenaniae and fossils from other organisms have also been found including myriapod chasmataspidids diploaspis and heteroaspis and arachnid mirabilis in silurian deposits of shale england where type species has been discovered fossils of several organisms have been found most of them eurypterids such as erettopterus gigas salteropterus and nanahughmilleria pygmaea but also indeterminate species of osteostracid hemicyclaspis and thelodontid parahughmilleria fossils have also been discovered in united states russia luxembourg canada and scotland see also list of
