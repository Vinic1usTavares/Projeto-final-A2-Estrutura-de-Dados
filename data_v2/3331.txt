debates across state mccreary stressed what many kentuckians felt were abuses of power by republican president ulysses s grant during reconstruction era harlan countered by faulting state s democratic

areas of state proposed lowering maximum legal interest rate from ten percent to six percent tapp and klotter p 146 proposed legislation drew ire of bankers and capitalists it was also widely panned

cents per 100 dollars of taxable property encountered far less resistance and passed easily few bills passed during session had statewide impact despite mccreary s insistence that legislature prefer general bills over bills of local impact burckel in kentucky s governors p 106 this fact too was widely criticized by state s newspapers issue of improving navigation along kentucky river was raised numerous times by representative james blue during 1876 legislative session despite blue s promises of manifold benefits to state from such an investment parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for improvements issue gained traction with some voters during biennial legislative elections however which brought it back to floor in 1878 session prompted by recommendations from kentucky river navigation convention in 1877 mccreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined calls for improvements along river in response legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along river state would provide funds to maintain improvements tapp and klotter pp 146 154 156 also in 1878 session tax assessments for railroad property were raised to match those of other property agrarian interests were pleased when legal interest rate was again lowered now reaching six percent they had proposed in

continued his service in house until 1896 when he was defeated in his bid for a seventh consecutive nomination for seat in that same year his was among a myriad of names put forward for election to

controversial 1899 gubernatorial campaign tapp and klotter p 429 between 1900 and 1912 he represented kentucky at four consecutive democratic national conventions governor j c w beckham and his well established political machine supported mccreary s nomination to senate in 1902 klotter p 205 his opponent incumbent william j deboe had been elected as a compromise candidate six years earlier becoming kentucky s first ever republican senator deboe had done little to secure support from legislators since his election however and mccreary was easily elected by a vote of 95 30 following his election to senate mccreary supported beckham s gubernatorial re election bid in 1903 klotter p 206 in a largely undistinguished term as a senator he continued to advocate free coinage of silver and tried to advance state s agricultural interests mccreary s senate term was set to expire in 1908 same year as beckham s second term as governor desiring election to senate following his gubernatorial term beckham persuaded his democratic allies to choose party s nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 a year before gubernatorial election and two years before senatorial election this ensured that primary would occur during his term as governor when he still wielded significant influence within party mccreary now allied himself with j c s blackburn henry watterson and other beckham opponents and sought to defend his seat in primary during primary campaign he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues contrasting it with beckham s youth and inexperience at national level beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of prohibition as opposed to mccreary s more moderate position and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention which he said gave voters a choice in who would represent them in senate ultimately beckham prevailed in primary by an 11 000 vote margin rendering mccreary a lame duck with two years still left in his term klotter pp 210 211 second term as governor and death despite beckham s move to unseat mccreary in senate two were once again allies by 1911 when beckham supported aging mccreary for party s gubernatorial nomination it is unclear whether mccreary sought reconciliation in order to secure gubernatorial nomination or beckham made amends with mccreary because he thought he could control mccreary s actions as governor in democratic primary mccreary defeated william adams by a majority of 25 000 votes burckel in register p 298 republicans nominated judge edward c o rear to oppose mccreary there were few differences between two men s stands on issues both supported progressive reforms such as direct election of senators a non partisan judiciary and creation of a public utilities commission klotter pp 218 219 mccreary also changed his stance on liquor question now agreeing with beckham s prohibitionist position this also matched republican position klotter p 219 o rear claimed that democrats should have already enacted reforms their party platform advocated but his only ready line of attack against mccreary himself was that he would be a pawn of beckham and his allies burckel in register p 299 mccreary pointed out that o rear had been nominated at a party nominating convention instead of winning a primary though o rear claimed to support primary elections he also criticized o rear for continuing to receive his salary as a judge while running for governor mccreary cited what he called republicans record of assassination bloodshed and disregard of law an allusion to assassination of william goebel in aftermath of 1899 gubernatorial contest caleb powers convicted three times of being an accessory to goebel s murder had been pardoned by republican governor augustus willson and had recently been elected to congress he further attacked tariff policies of republican president william h taft in general election mccreary won a decisive victory garnering 226 771 votes to o rear s 195 435 several other minor party candidates also received votes including socialist candidate walter who claimed 8 718 votes 2 percent of total construction of new governor s mansion thumb 240px alt a pillared two story gray marble building with several flower gardens in front current kentucky governor s mansion was constructed during mccreary s second gubernatorial term one of mccreary s first acts as governor was signing a bill appropriating 75 000 for construction of a new governor s mansion legislature appointed a commission of five including mccreary to oversee mansion s construction governor exercised a good deal of influence over process including replacement of a conservatory with a ballroom in construction plan and selection of a contractor from his hometown of richmond as assistant superintendent of construction changing societal trends also affected construction a hastily constructed stable to house horse drawn carriages was soon abandoned in favor of a garage for automobiles clark and lane pp 89 93 mansion was completed in 1914 because mccreary was widowed before his second term in office his granddaughter harriet newberry mccreary served as mansion s first hostess during her summer vacations from her studies at wellesley college when harriet mccreary was away at college mccreary s housekeeper jennie shaw served as hostess mccreary authorized state to sell old mansion at auction but final bid of 13 600 was rejected as unfair by mansion commission clark and lane pp 80 81 84 progressive reforms among progressive reforms advocated by mccreary and passed in 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections mandating direct primary elections and allowing state s counties to hold local option elections to decide whether or not to adopt prohibition mccreary appointed a tax commission to study revenue system and board of assessments and valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property mccreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways and a bipartisan vote in general assembly established kentucky public service commission burckel in register p 302 near close of session mccreary county was created and named in governor s honor it was last of kentucky s 120 counties to be constituted klotter p 220 mccreary was not as successful in securing reforms during 1914 legislative session he advocated a comprehensive workmen s compensation law but law that was passed in 1914 general assembly was later declared unconstitutional klotter p 224 he also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures but majority of legislators in house of representatives voted to send it back to suffrage and elections committee from whence it was never recalled burckel in register p 301 although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at capitol a law that mccreary supported legislators showed responsiveness to mccreary s desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in legislative chambers while legislature was in session burckel in kentucky s governors p 108 some reforms were made in area of education school year was lengthened school attendance for children was mandated and legislature created a text book commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks burckel in register pp 303 304 public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent part of reason for inefficacy of 1914 session was that mccreary was engaged in a three way primary race for democratic nomination to u s senate other major candidates were former governor beckham and augustus owsley stanley a fourth candidate david h smith withdrew early from race mccreary ran a mostly positive campaign touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents beckham and stanley however were bitter political and personal enemies and campaign reflected their animosity without support of beckham s political machine that had helped him in gubernatorial contest mccreary never had a realistic chance to win nomination beckham secured nomination with 72 677 votes to stanley s 65 871 and mccreary s 20 257 klotter pp 224 225 following expiration of his term as governor mccreary continued to practice as a
