jemima confiding in fox her poke bonnet was not fashion among at time of book s publication but its incorporation in text and illustrations sets tale in a not too distant fairy tale past tale begins in a farmyard which is home to a duck called jemima puddle duck she wants to hatch her own eggs but farmer s wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow hens to incubate them jemima tries to hide her eggs but they are always found and carried away she sets off along road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from farm to lay her eggs at top of a hill she spies a distant wood flies to it and waddles about until she discovers an appropriate nesting place among however a charming gentleman with black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers persuades her to nest in a shed at his home jemima is led to his tumble down shed which is curiously filled with feathers and makes herself a nest with little ado jemima lays her eggs and fox suggests

jemima puddle duck is a tale of pursuit and prey theme runs through several of potter s tales mr mcgregor pursues peter rabbit simpkin lies in wait for mice in tailor s shop and trout attempts to devour jeremy fisher potter was following pattern of fairy tales by dwelling on theme of pursuit and prey and often pointed out that tale of jemima was a retelling of little red riding hood perrault s tale ends with death of heroine but potter understood children will not tolerate tragedy prey in her books survive for better or worse peter returns home for a dose of chamomile tea for example and though jemima loses her eggs to her hungry rescuers she lives to return to farm to raise a brood of ducklings lane 2001 pp 126 8 tale shows potter at her best in depicting life of farm and village of near sawrey but tale becomes one of something more than just local colour and interest archetypical tale upon which jemima is based foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by loyal and dependable is transformed in potter s hands to one in which self preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues graham greene thought sandy whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm wild animals invade precincts of domesticated ones and death is part of farming macdonald 1986 p 114 victor in tale is farmer s wife she regains her errant duck and is rid of predatory fox ostensibly she confiscates jemima s eggs believing jemima will abandon them but eggs are not confiscated for well being of jemima and her kin but for well being of farmer s wife and her family eggs or ducks hatched from them will end up on their dinner table in this respect farmer s wife is a predator like fox but fox is condemned for his predation human values are at top of tale s hierarchy potter argues for well ordered home and practicalities of farm life over fantasy lives of animals it was modus vivendi potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals kutzer 2003 pp 105 6 111 like many fairy tales jemima puddle duck belongs in a remote but not too distant past jemima s shawl reflects typical farm dress of lake district at time of tale s composition but poke bonnet does not and fox s long tail coat and exquisite manners also suggest another time jemima is a more interesting character when humanised with clothing without it she is just a farmyard duck as potter pointed out tale is a revision of a fairy tale and belongs in indefinite period of once upon a time story is one of potter s more ominous and is fraught with tension jemima is a headstrong innocent distracted by her overwhelming desire to nest and thus unable to penetrate fox s designs and comprehend her dangerous situation tension rises in increments from mysterious feather filled shed place of slaughter to fox s plan for an omelette of jemima s eggs to ultimate horror and crowning irony jemima s errand to fetch herbs that will be used to season herself macdonald 1986 pp 111 2 fox is first male villain in potter s work saving samuel whiskers in poly pudding companion piece to jemima and like all villains in potter gentleman with sandy whiskers presents a false social front that conceals his bestial nature he dresses and behaves as a country gentleman of leisure idling with a newspaper and living off labor of others by luring their fowl to his feather filled shed potter had little tolerance for indolence and lack of industry but as a country woman she knew foxes were clever and managed to escape more times than they were caught from first encounter between jemima and fox reader realises fox is more clever than jemima and is forced to extend him a grudging admiration kutzer 2003 p 109 background thumb upright left alt photograph of an older woman and a dog dated 1913

in their attempts to locate her eggs before she mismanaged their incubation mrs cannon believed ducks made poor sitters and routinely confiscated ducks eggs to allow hens to incubate them potter may have taken inspiration from a drawing in her father s 1853 sketchbook of a flying duck wearing a bonnet taylor 1987 p 37 potter almost certainly chose name jemima in honour of jemima blackburn an

lear 2008 p 428 tale of jemima puddle duck was published in july 1908 after heated discussions with publisher harold warne about dialogues and cover illustration book was an immediate success in later years ernest aris would blatantly plagiarise not only peter rabbit character in his treasure seekers but jemima in his mrs beak duck potter was restrained when alerted to imitations she praised his technical artistry but chastised him for a lack of originality at time her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm her restraint with aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator lear 2008 p 281 similarities to little red riding hood thumb little red riding hood illustration by walter crane 1875 crane randolph caldecott and kate greenaway were potter s childhood favourites potter indicated jemima was a revision of little red riding hood and similarities between two are numerous jemima and her eggs are substitutes for red riding hood and her grandmother farmer s wife and jemima s sister in law are substitutes for red riding hood s mother fox and wolf both conceal their bestial natures beneath polite behaviour of gentlemen and dogs are substitutes for woodcutters both tales touch upon physical appetite temptation and foolish behaviour kutzer 2003 pp 107 8 though tale has a happy ending tearful jemima is led back to farm in public humiliation after losing her eggs to her hungry rescuers she is allowed to hatch a brood on farm but it only produces four ducklings potter s revision of little red riding hood more nearly resembles perrault s tragic tale than happily ever after grimm version where heroine is rescued by woodcutters author knew her young audience would sympathise with unhatched ducklings and would not tolerate having jemima a mother figure suffer a bloody end in fox s shed loss of eggs is sad for reader but potter ended tale as happily as possible not only for her audience but for sake of real world children of her farm manager ralph and betsy cannon to whom tale was dedicated jemima is punished for her headstrong foolishness and must relinquish her hope of finding a nesting spot away from farm but punishment is mitigated when she is allowed to hatch one brood herself macdonald 1986 pp 112 3 merchandising jemima puddle duck was popular almost as popular as peter rabbit and became

painting book but in end eggs were rotten instructions in jemima s painting book were similar to those in tom kitten s painting book but kittens with crayons in tom s book accompanying instructions

for they took jemima home in painting book kep and fox hound puppies lead jemima away from her broken but uneaten eggs same theme was depicted on crabtree evelyn chocolate easter eggs painting book
