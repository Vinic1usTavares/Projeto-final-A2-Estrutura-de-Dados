again in 1862 and several postmasters were dismissed for disloyalty but john jr was not one of them in august 1863 he sought a job in paymaster s department in united states department of war but his application caused federal agents to be suspicious about his family s loyalties to union on november 17 1863 he was dismissed as postmaster for disloyalty steers 2001 p 81 surratt mary e jenkins 1823 1865 in women in american civil war p 533 larson p 37 38 loss of john jr s job as postmaster caused a financial crisis for surratt family when john sr s estate was probated in late november 1862

1864 mary surratt found that her husband s unpaid debts and bad business deals had left her with many creditors several of her slaves ran away steers 2001 p 138 maryland adopted a new constitution on november 1 1864 which emancipated all slaves in that state when he was not meeting with confederate sympathizers in city her son was selling vegetables to raise cash for family chamlee p 101 leonard p 88 mary was tired of running farm tavern and other businesses without her son s help steers 2010 p 518 in fall of 1864 she began considering moving to her townhouse in city on october 1 1864 she took possession of townhouse at 604 h street nw in washington d c house was made of gray brick wide deep and had four stories first floor which was level with street had two large rooms used as kitchen and dining room larson p 39 second floor had a front and back parlor with room in rear used as mary surratt s bedroom larson p 39 40 third floor had three rooms two in front and a larger one at back larson p 40 fourth floor which was considered an attic had two large and one small room occupied by a servant surratt began moving her belongings into townhouse that month steers 2001 p 139 and on november 1 1864 anna and john jr took up residence there mary surratt herself moved into home on december 1 that same day she leased tavern in surrattsville to a former washington d c policeman and confederate sympathizer john m lloyd for 500 a year larson p 38 on november 30 december 8 and december 27 mary surratt advertised for lodgers in daily evening star newspaper trindal p 86 larson p 42 chamlee p 164 165 she had initially said that she wanted only lodgers who were known to her personally or were recommended by friends but in her advertisements she said rooms were available for 4 gentlemen stern p 42 some scholars have raised questions about surratt s move into city historians kate larson and roy chamlee have noted that although there is no definite proof a case can be made that surratt made move into city in furtherance of her and her son s espionage activities for example larson and chamlee say that on september 21 1864 john surratt wrote to louis j weichmann observing that family s plans to move into city were advancing rapidly on account of certain events having turned up perhaps a cryptic reference to either his confederate activities in general or conspiracy to kidnap or kill lincoln larson has observed that although move made long term economic sense for surratt it also in short term would have meant moving expenses and furnishing up to 10 rooms in townhouse money that she did not have chamlee too found little economic reason to move into city and concluded that it would have been more profitable to rent h street boarding house entirely to lodgers during her time in city surratt tried to keep her daughter away from what she felt were negative influences moreover surratt still owed money on both tavern and townhouse and would take out yet another mortgage against townhouse in january 1865 john jr transferred all his title to family property to his mother in january 1865 that act may have additional implications a traitor s property could be seized and john s spy knowledge was certainly his motivation for relinquishing his title to houses and land mary may have known of his motivation as well or at least suspected if she did she would have possessed at least de facto knowledge of conspiracy conspiracy louis j weichmann moved into surratt s boarding house on november 1 1864 trindal p 85 weichmann and richards p 28 chamlee p xi on december 23 1864 dr samuel mudd introduced john surratt jr to john wilkes booth verge p 53 trindal p 276 griffin p 155 jones p 239 booth recruited john jr into his conspiracy to kidnap lincoln steers 2007 p 171 confederate agents began frequenting boarding house evans p 288 booth visited boarding house many times over next few months steers 2010 p 519 sometimes at mary s request george

times in first two months of 1865 leonard p 46 busch p 56 he stayed at surratt boarding house in february 1865 for one night or several sources differ but he proved to be a heavy drinker and surratt evicted him after just a few days heidler and heidler p 1910 griffin p 186 gamber p 109 ownsbey p 54 he continued to visit townhouse frequently afterward however rehnquist p 215 powell posed as a baptist preacher and stayed at boarding house for three days in march 1865 ownsbey p 41 51 52 david herold also called at home several times as part of plot to kidnap lincoln in march 1865 john atzerodt and herold hid two spencer carbines ammunition and some other supplies at surratt tavern in surrattsville turner p 155 griffin p 212 kauffmann p 187 188 on april 11 mary surratt rented a carriage and drove to surratt tavern larson p 77 steers 2010 p 349 kauffmann p 208 she said that she made trip to collect a debt owed her by a former neighbor however according to her tenant john lloyd surratt told him to get shooting irons ready to be picked up trindal p 161 larson p 130 on april 14 surratt said that she would once again visit family tavern in surrattsville to collect a debt larson p 83 shortly before she left city booth visited boarding house and spoke privately with her larson p 83 84 swanson p 19 he gave her a package later found to contain binoculars for lloyd to pick up later that evening surratt did so and according to lloyd again told lloyd to have shooting irons ready for pickup and handed him a wrapped package from booth swanson p 22 trindal p 157 booth s plan was to assassinate lincoln and have atzerodt kill vice president andrew johnson and powell kill secretary of state william h seward booth killed lincoln atzerodt never attempted to kill johnson and powell stabbed seward repeatedly but failed to murder him as they fled city after lincoln s assassination booth and herold picked up rifles and binoculars from surratt s tavern lloyd repaired a broken spring on surratt s wagon before she left leonard p 97 larson p 86 arrest and incarceration around 2 a m on april 15 1865 members of district of columbia police visited surratt boarding house seeking john wilkes booth and john surratt turner p 156 steers 2010 p 173 why police came to house is not entirely clear most historians conclude that weichmann s friend department of war employee daniel gleason had alerted federal authorities to confederate activity centered on surratt house but that does not explain why police rather than federal agents appeared there historian roy chamlee however says that there is evidence that gleason did not tell police about his suspicions of weichmann for several days chamlee p 10 within 45 minutes of attack on lincoln john surratt s name had become associated with attack on secretary of state william h seward chamlee p 11 police as well as provost marshal s office both had files on john surratt jr and knew he was a close friend of booth it is possible that either james l maddox property supervisor at ford s theatre and a friend of booth s or actor john matthews both of whom may have known about plot to attack government officials mentioned surratt s name historian otto eisenschiml has argued that david herold s attempt to steal a horse from john fletcher may have led them to surratt boarding house eisenschiml p 272 273 but at least one other scholar has called link uncertain other sources claim that eyewitnesses had identified booth as lincoln s attacker and detectives had information a tip from an unnamed actor and a bartender linking john jr to booth steers 2010 p 173 519 chamlee p 19 mary lied to detectives that her son had been in canada for two weeks busch p 22 pittman p 140 trindal p 120 larson p 93 she also did not reveal that she had delivered a package to tavern on booth s behalf only hours earlier steers 2010 p 174 thumb left lewis powell was co conspirator whose untimely arrival at surratt boarding house on april 17 convinced many of mary surratt s guilt on april 17 a surratt neighbor told us military authorities that he overheard one of surratt s servants saying that three men had come to house on night of lincoln s assassination and that one of men had mentioned booth in a theater turner p 157 larson p 98 steers 2010 p 301 servant was mistaken about date as john surratt jr had indeed been in elmira new york on a mission for a confederate general steers 2010 p 177 other pieces of information also mentioned boarding house as a key meeting place of possible conspirators either colonel henry h wells provost marshal head of military police of district of columbia or general christopher c augur told colonel henry steel olcott to arrest everyone in house federal soldiers visited surratt boarding house again late on evening of april 17 verge p 52 53 pittman p 122 john jr could not be found but after a search of house agents found in mary s room a picture of booth hidden behind another

arrested for conspiracy to assassinate lincoln powell appeared at her door in disguise verge p 54 cashin p 291 ownsbey p 137 although surratt denied knowing him powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by surratt to dig a ditch next morning discrepancy and powell s unusually well groomed appearance quite unlike a ditch digger prompted his arrest he was later identified as man who had attempted to assassinate secretary of state william seward after her arrest she was held at an annex to old capitol prison before being transferred to washington arsenal on april 30 trindal p 130 hartranft steers and holzer p 22 steers 2001 p 209 swanson and weinberg p 15 jampoler p 18 two armed guards stood before door to her cell from beginning of her imprisonment until her death watts p 87 ownsbey p

was served four times a day always of bread salt pork beef or beef soup and coffee or water ownsbey p 110 other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded canvas bag to prevent a suicide attempt klement p 35 miller p 251 252 sources disagree as to whether surratt was forced to wear it as well although others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles she was not manacled rumors to contrary were raised by reporters at trial who could not see her or heard clank of chains about her feet rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied turner p 158 159 she began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention steers 2010 p 512 she was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter anna goodrich p p 192 she and powell received most attention from press kunhardt and kunhardt p 198 northern press was also highly critical of her claiming that she had a criminal face due to her small mouth and dark eyes larson p xii john surratt jr was in elmira at time of assassination delivering messages on behalf of a confederate general after learning of lincoln s death he fled to montreal quebec canada surratt traveled to united kingdom in september 1865 and then rome he joined papal zouaves but in april 1866 he was recognized and arrested on november 7 1866 he escaped again and traveled to alexandria egypt arrested again he was returned to us and tried in june 1867 his first trial ended in a hung jury and he was indicted in district of columbia for treason because statute of limitations had run out on charges indictments were dismissed in december 1870 surratt admitted publicly in a lecture in rockville maryland that he was part of booth s plan to kidnap lincoln which made him culpable for assassination that occurred a month later see chaconas p 62 64 trial trial for alleged conspirators began on may 9 a military tribunal rather than a civilian court was chosen as venue because government officials thought that its more lenient rules of evidence would enable court to get to bottom of what was then perceived by public as a vast conspiracy boritt and forness p 351 all eight alleged conspirators were tried simultaneously historians have conflicting views regarding surratt s innocence historian laurie verge commented only in case of dr samuel alexander mudd is there as much controversy as to guilt or innocence of one of defendants verge p 51 lincoln assassination scholar thomas reed turner says that of eight people accused of plotting to kill lincoln case against surratt remains most controversial at that time and since a room on northeast corner of third floor of arsenal was made into a courtroom and prisoners were brought into room through a side door which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators watts p 89 90 federal writers project p 326 surratt was given special considerations during trial because of her illness and sex in courtroom she sat apart from other prisoners sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on either side of her as was done for other prisoners during trial jampoler p 21 watts p 91 while others wore wrist and ankle manacles in courtroom she did not chamlee p 440 she was also permitted a bonnet fan and veil to hide her face from spectators as her illness worsened during trial she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell surratt was charged with abetting aiding concealing counseling and harboring her co defendants watts p 92 federal government initially attempted to find legal counsel for her and others but almost no attorneys were willing to take job for fear they would be accused of disloyalty to union boritt and forness p 352 surratt retained reverdy johnson as her legal counsel heidler and heidler p 1076 larson p 144 a member of military commission trying conspirators challenged johnson s right to defend surratt as he had objected to requiring loyalty oaths from voters in 1864 presidential election steers 2001 p 221 larson p 146 after much discussion this objection was withdrawn but damage had been done to his influence and he did not attend most of court sessions chamlee p 270 trindal p 150 most of surratt s legal defense was presented by two other lawyers frederick aiken and john wesley clampitt thumb left louis j weichmann whose testimony proved critical in convicting mary surratt prosecution s strategy was to tie surratt to conspiracy powell s arrival at her boarding house three days after president s murder was critical evidence against her government argued prosecution presented nine witnesses but most of their case rested on testimony of just two men john m lloyd and louis j weichmann lloyd testified on may 13 and 15 p 109 on hiding of carbines and other supplies at tavern in march and two conversations he had with her in which she told him to get shooting irons ready george atzerodt made a statement to james mcphail civilian provost marshal of baltimore on may 1 1865 mcphail accompanied by atzerodt s brother in law john l smith interviewed atzerodt who revealed that mudd was much more intimately involved in kidnap and murder plots against lincoln than other evidence suggested confirming some of lloyd s testimony atzerodt also said that surratt had gone to tavern on april 15 specifically to retrieve weapons hidden there a month earlier by atzerodt herold and john jr however mcphail turned statement over to atzerodt s attorney william e doster rather than to john f hartranft doster perhaps realizing how damaging it was did nothing with it testimony was only briefly and tangentially raised at trial in 1977 historian joan chaconas contacted doster s grandson who showed her papers containing atzerodt s statement had it been revealed it most likely would have sent dr samuel mudd to gallows for information on statement its loss and its rediscovery see steers and holzer p 26 28 quote on p 27 for information on mcphail s role as provost marshal see fishel p 335 weichmann s testimony was important as it established an intimate relationship between her and other conspirators weichmann testified may 16 to 19 and said that he had resided at boarding house since november 1864 he had seen or overheard john jr meeting and talking with atzerodt booth and powell many times over past four and a half months verge p 55 weichmann had driven surratt to tavern on april 11 and 14 confirmed that she and lloyd had spent much time in private conversation testified that he saw booth give her package of binoculars and attested that she had turned package over to lloyd leonard p 108 weichmann also testified at length about surratt family s ties to confederate spy and courier rings operating in area and their relationships with atzerodt and powell he also testified about december 23 meeting with booth and john which he also attended and their subsequent meeting with booth at booth s room at national hotel finally he told military tribunal about general excitement in boarding house in march 1865 after failed attempt to kidnap lincoln other prosecution witnesses reinforced weichmann s testimony lodger honora fitzpatrick confirmed visits by atzerodt booth and powell to boarding house emma lloyd s sister in law testified that she saw but did not hear surratt speaking for long periods of time with lloyd on april 11 and 14 government agents testified about their arrest of surratt powell s arrival and her denial that she knew powell fact that powell sought refuge in boarding house after lincoln s murder left a bad impression on her surratt s refusal or failure to recognize him also weighed against her agents also testified about their search of house and evidence photographs weapons etc discovered there lloyd s testimony was most important for prosecution s case griffin p 349 for it indicated that she had played an active role in conspiracy in days before lincoln s death verge p 56 prosecution rested its case on may 22 defense strategy was to impeach testimony of key prosecution witnesses lloyd and weichmann it also wished to show that she was loyal to union her trips to surrattsville were of an innocent nature and she had not been aware of booth s plans there were 31 witnesses who testified for defense george h calvert testified that he had pressed surratt to pay a debt bennett gwynn said surratt had sought payment from john nothey to satisfy calvert debt and nothey agreed that he had received a letter from surratt for him to appear at tavern on april 11 to pay what was owed several witnesses impugned lloyd s character by testifying about his alcoholism while others said he was too intoxicated on day of lincoln s assassination to remember that day clearly leonard p 118 augustus howell a confederate agent testified weichmann was an untrustworthy witness as he had sought to become a confederate spy himself verge p 56 57 prosecution had attempted to show that howell was a confederate spy and should not be trusted verge p 57 anna surratt testified that it was weichmann who had brought atzerodt into boarding house that photograph of booth was hers and that she owned photographs of union political and military leaders anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in boarding house and that booth s visits to house were always short anna explained her mother s failure to recognize powell by asserting she could not see well leonard p 119 augusta howell honora fitzpatrick a former servant and a former slave testified to mary s poor eyesight as well leonard p 120 former servant and former slave both said surratt had given union soldiers food leonard p 120 numerous witnesses were called at end of defense s case to testify to her loyalty to union her deep christian faith and her kindness during prosecution s rebuttal government lawyers called four witnesses to stand who testified as to weichmann s unimpeachable character johnson and aiken presented closing arguments for defense johnson attacked jurisdiction of a military tribunal over civilians as had mudd s attorney aiken challenged court s jurisdiction as well verge p 57 58 he also reiterated that lloyd and weichmann were unreliable witnesses and that evidence against her was all circumstantial verge p 58 only evidence linking surratt to conspiracy to kill lincoln he said came from lloyd and weichmann and neither man was telling truth dorothy kunhardt has written that there is evidence latter s perjured testimony was suborned by secretary of war edwin m stanton kunhardt and kunhardt p 201 judge advocate john bingham presented closing argument for prosecution military tribunal had jurisdiction he said not only because court itself had ruled at beginning of trials that it did but because they were crimes committed in a military zone during a time of war and against high government officials in carrying out treasonous activities bingham pointed out that surratt boarding house was where conspiracy was planned and atzerodt booth and powell had all met with surratt booth had paid for rental of carriage that took surratt to surrattsville each time and bingham said that was evidence that surratt s trips were critical to conspiracy bingham also said that lloyd s testimony had been corroborated by others and that his unwillingness to

stay in her cell in opinion of historian roy z chamlee both legal teams appeared to have flaws in their cases and except for reverdy johnson neither team employed highly skilled attorneys government s case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness man who shared lloyd s carriage when he talked with surratt and could have verified lloyd s version of shooting irons story or metropolitan police chief a c richards whose investigation had had most success in early days of investigation government did not fully investigate booth s meetings with surratt at noon or evening of murder and its questioning and cross examination of witnesses was poorly prepared and weak what is most important according to historian roy z chamber jr is that government had botched attempt to apprehend john jr
