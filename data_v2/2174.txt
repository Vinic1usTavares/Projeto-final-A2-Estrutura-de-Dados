omaha commonly known as omaha beach was code name for one of five sectors of allied invasion of german occupied france in normandy landings on june 6 1944 during world war ii gal perl finkel 75 years from that long day in normandy we still have something to learn jerusalem post june 12 2019 omaha refers to a section of coast of normandy france facing english channel from east of sainte honorine des to west of vierville sur mer on right bank of douve river estuary and with an estimated tall cliffs landings here were necessary to link british landings to east at gold with american landing to west at utah thus providing a continuous lodgement on normandy coast of bay of seine taking omaha was to be responsibility of united states army troops with sea transport mine sweeping and a naval bombardment force provided predominantly by united states navy and coast guard with contributions from british canadian and free french navies primary objective at omaha was to secure a beachhead of depth between port en bessin and vire river linking with british landings at gold to east and reaching area of isigny to west to link up with vii corps landing at utah opposing landings was german 352nd infantry division of 12 020 men of division 6 800 were experienced combat troops detailed to defend a front german strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at water line and defenses were mainly deployed in strongpoints along coast untested american 29th infantry division along with nine companies of u s army rangers redirected from pointe du hoc assaulted western half of beach battle hardened 1st infantry division was given eastern half initial assault waves consisting of tanks infantry and combat engineer forces were carefully planned to reduce coastal defenses and allow larger ships of follow up waves to land very little went as planned during landing at omaha difficulties in navigation caused majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout day defenses were unexpectedly strong and inflicted heavy casualties on landing u s troops under heavy fire engineers struggled to clear beach obstacles later landings bunched up around few channels that were cleared weakened by casualties taken just in landing surviving assault troops could not clear heavily defended exits off beach this caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults scaling bluffs between most heavily defended points by end of day two small isolated footholds had been won which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland achieving original d day objectives over following days terrain and defenses thumb left upright 1 5 right diagrammatic cross section of beach at omaha coastline of normandy was divided into seventeen sectors with codenames using a spelling alphabet from able west of omaha to roger on east flank of sword eight further sectors were added when invasion was extended to include utah on cotentin peninsula sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by colors green red and white omaha was bounded at either end by large rocky cliffs crescent shaped beach presented a gently sloping tidal area averaging between low and high water marks above tide line was a bank of shingle high and up to wide in places at western end shingle bank rested against a stone further east becoming wood sea wall which ranged from in height for remaining two thirds of beach after seawall ended shingle lay against a low sand embankment behind sand embankment and sea wall was a level shelf of sand narrow at either end and extending up to inland in center and behind that rose steep escarpments or bluffs high which dominated

june 1944 german defensive preparations and lack of any defense in depth indicated that their plan was to stop invasion at beaches four lines of obstacles were constructed in intertidal zone first a non contiguous line with a small gap in middle of dog white and a larger gap across whole of easy red was out from highwater line and consisted of 200 belgian gates with mines lashed to uprights behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into sand pointing seaward every third one capped with an anti tank mine another shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards shore also with mines attached and designed to force flat bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate mine final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs from shoreline area between shingle bank and bluffs was both wired and mined and mines were also scattered on bluff slopes coastal troop deployments comprising five companies of infantry were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called resistance nests numbered wn 60 in east to wn 74 near vierville in west located primarily around entrances to draws and protected by minefields and wire positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels as well as basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes a further 18 anti tank guns completed disposition of artillery targeting beach areas between strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches rifle pits and 85 machine gun emplacements no area of beach was left uncovered and disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could be brought to bear anywhere along beach thumb left widerstandsnest 65 defending e 1 draw at omaha beach allied intelligence had identified coastal defenders as a reinforced

activated but capable 352nd infantry division was believed to be inland at saint lo and was regarded as most likely force to be committed to a counter attack as part of rommel s strategy to concentrate defenses at water s edge 352nd had been ordered forward in march taking over responsibility for defense of portion of normandy coast in which omaha was located as part of this

352nd artillery regiment area reserve comprising two battalions of 915th grenadier regiment and known as kampfgruppe meyer was located south east of bayeux outside immediate omaha area failure to identify reorganization of defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for allies post action reports still documented original estimate and assumed that 352nd had been deployed to coastal defenses by

according to plan ten landing craft were swamped by rough seas before they reached beach and several others stayed afloat only because their passengers bailed water out with their helmets seasickness was prevalent among troops waiting offshore on 16th rct front landing boats passed struggling men in life preservers and on rafts survivors of dd tanks which had sunk in rough sea navigation of landing vehicles was made difficult by smoke and mist obscuring landmarks they were to use in guiding themselves in while a strong current pushed them continually eastward as boats approached to within a few hundred yards of shore they came under increasingly heavy fire from automatic weapons and artillery force only then discovered ineffectiveness of pre landing bombardment bombers facing overcast conditions had been ordered to implement a pre arranged plan to compensate for decreased accuracy center of targeting was displaced inland to assure safety of landing allied troops as a result there was little or no damage to beach defenses tank landings because sea conditions were so rough decision was made for 116th rct to carry dd tanks of 743rd tank battalion all way to beach after 27 of initial 29 dd tanks of 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore coming in opposite heavily defended vierville draw company b of 743rd tank battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its dd tanks other two companies landed to left of b 743 without initial loss on 16th rct front two dd tanks from 741st tank battalion that had survived swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto beach because of their lct s damaged ramp remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks although three of these were quickly knocked out infantry landings of nine companies landing in first wave only company a of 116th rct at dog green and rangers to their right landed where intended e 116 aiming for easy green ended up scattered across two beaches of 16th rct area g 116 aiming for dog white opened up a 1 000 yard 900 m gap between themselves and a 116 to their right when they landed at easy green instead i 16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half as infantry disembarked from landing craft they often found themselves on sandbars out to reach beach they had to wade through water sometimes neck deep and they still had or more to go when they did reach shore those that made it to shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden most sections had to brave full weight of fire from small arms mortars artillery and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire where naval bombardment set grass fires burning as it had at dog red opposite les moulins strongpoint smoke obscured landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by defenders some sections of g 116 and f 116 were able to reach shingle bank relatively unscathed though latter became disorganized after loss of their officers g 116 was able to retain some cohesion but this was soon lost as they made their way westwards under fire along shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives scattering of boats was most evident on 16th rct front where parts of e 16 f 16 and e 116 had intermingled making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed situation caused by mis landings those scattered sections of e 116 landing at easy red were able to escape heavy casualties although having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make swim ashore casualties were heaviest among troops landing at either end of omaha in east at fox green and adjacent stretch of easy red scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by time they gained relative safety of shingle many of them having crawled of beach just ahead of incoming tide within 15 minutes of landing at dog green on western end of beach a 116 had been cut to pieces leaders among 120 or so casualties survivors reduced to seeking cover at water s edge or behind obstacles smaller ranger company to their right had fared a little better having made shelter of bluffs but were also down to half strength l 16 eventually landed 30 minutes late to left of fox green taking casualties as boats ran in and more as they crossed of beach terrain at very eastern end of omaha gave them enough protection to allow 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of bluffs they were only company in first wave able to operate as a unit all other companies were at best disorganized mostly leaderless and pinned down behind shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions at worst they had ceased to exist as fighting units nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task this was enough to throw whole plan off engineer landings like infantry engineers had been pushed off their targets and only five of 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them working under heavy fire engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through beach obstacles work made more difficult by loss of equipment and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind obstacles they were trying to blow they also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off explosives they were working with eight men of one team were dragging their pre loaded rubber boat off lcm when artillery hit only one survived resulting detonation of their supplies another team had just finished laying its explosives when area was struck by mortar fire premature explosion of charges killed or wounded 19 engineers as well as some nearby infantry nevertheless engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps one each at dog white and easy green on 116th rct front other four at easy red on 16th rct front they had suffered casualties of over 40 http www org veterans ross wesley html eyewitness account second assault wave thumb upright 1 3 official history map showing second assault wave landings with initial targets second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements support weapons and headquarters elements at 07 00 to face nearly same difficulties as had first second wave was larger and so defenders fire was less concentrated survivors of first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire and in places fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of first wave failure to clear paths through beach obstacles also added to difficulties of second wave in addition incoming tide was beginning to hide remaining obstacles causing high attrition among landing craft before they had reached shore as in initial landings difficult navigation caused disruptive scattering infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units on 116th rct front remainder of 1st battalion b 116 c 116 and d 116 were due to land in support of a 116 at dog green three boats including their headquarters and beach master groups landed too far west under cliffs their exact casualties in getting across beach are unknown but one third to one half that made it to shore spent rest of day pinned down by snipers not all sections of badly scattered b 116 landed there but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of a 116 fighting for survival at water s edge two companies of 2nd rangers coming in later on edge of dog green did manage to reach seawall but at cost of half their strength to left of dog green sat dog white between vierville and les moulins strongpoints defending draws d 1 and d 3 and here was a different story as a result of earlier mis landings and now because of their own mis landing troops of c 116 found themselves alone at dog white with a handful of tanks from first wave in sight smoke from grass fires covering their advance up beach they gained seawall with few casualties and were in better shape than any unit on 116th rct front so far although 1st battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when d 116 suffered a disastrous landing buildup at dog white continued c 116 was joined by 5th ranger battalion almost in its entirety ranger commander recognizing situation at dog green on run in ordered assault craft to divert into dog white like c 116 smoke covered their advance although 2nd rangers were caught out on right flank of ranger s landing this was where 116th rct regimental command group including 29th division assistant commander brig gen norman dutch cota was able to land relatively unscathed further east strongpoint defenses were effective on dog red easy green boundary defenses around les moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on remaining 2nd battalion with h 116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there survivors joined remnants of f 116 behind shingle and here battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across shingle a further advance up bluffs just east of les moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down to their left mainly between draws on easy green easy red boundary 116th rct s support battalion landed without too much loss although they did become scattered and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on bluffs on 16th rct front at eastern end of easy red was another area between strongpoints this allowed g 16 and support battalion to escape complete destruction in their advance up beach nevertheless most of g 16 s 63 casualties for day came before they had reached shingle other 2nd battalion company landed in second wave h 16 came in a few hundred yards to left opposite e 3 draw and suffered for it they were put out of action for several hours on eastern most beach fox green elements of five different companies had become entangled and situation was little improved by equally disorganized landings of second wave two more companies of 3rd battalion joined melee and having drifted east in first wave i 16 finally made their traumatic landing on fox green at 08 00 two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to east and as they came in under fire three of four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines and fourth was hung up on an obstacle a captain from this company found himself senior officer and in charge of badly out of shape 3rd battalion american situation thumb left assault troops of 3rd battalion 16th rct from first two waves shelter under chalk cliffs which identify this as an area of fox red along with infantry landing in second wave supporting arms began to arrive meeting same chaos and destruction as had rifle companies combat engineers tasked with clearing exits and marking beaches landed off target and without their equipment many half tracks jeeps and trucks foundered in deep water those that made it ashore soon became jammed up on narrowing beach making easy targets for german defenders most of radios were lost making task of organizing scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult and those command groups that did make shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there assault troops had only their personal weapons which having been dragged through surf and sand invariably needed cleaning before they could be used survivors at shingle many facing combat for first time found themselves relatively well protected from small arms fire but still exposed to artillery and mortars in front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from bluffs above morale naturally became a problem many groups were leaderless and witnesses to fate of neighboring troops and landings coming in around them wounded men on beach were drowning in incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze german situation by 07 35 third battalion of 726th grenadier regiment defending draw f 1 on fox green beach was reporting that 100 200 american troops had penetrated front with troops inside wire at wn 62 and wn 61 attacking germans from rear nevertheless as late as 13 35 352nd division was reporting that assault had been hurled back into sea from german vantage point at pointe de la percee overlooking whole beach from western end it seemed that assault had been stopped at beach an officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles and counted ten tanks burning casualties among defenders were mounting while 916th regiment defending center of 352nd zone was reporting that landings had been frustrated it was also requesting reinforcements request could not be met because situation elsewhere in normandy was becoming more urgent for defenders reserve force of german 352nd division 915th regiment which had earlier been deployed against us airborne landings to west of omaha was diverted to gold zone east of omaha where german defenses were crumbling breakthrough key geographical features that had influenced landings also influenced next phase of battle draws natural exits off beaches were main targets in initial assault plan strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault in areas between draws at bluffs units were able to land in greater strength defenses were also weaker away from draws thus most advances were made there other key aspect of next few hours was leadership original plan was in tatters with so many units mis landed disorganized and scattered most commanders had fallen or were absent and there were few ways to communicate other than shouted commands in places small groups of men sometimes scratched together from different companies in some cases from different divisions were inspired encouraged or bullied out of relative safety of shingle starting dangerous task of reducing defenses atop bluffs assaulting bluffs thumb upright 2 aerial view of omaha showing draws left to right vierville d 1 les moulins d 3 st laurent e 1 colleville e 3 and number 5 draw f 1 survivors of c company 2nd rangers in first wave landed on dog green around 06 45 by 07 30 they had scaled cliffs near dog green and vierville draw they were joined later by a mis landed section from b 116 and this group spent better part of day tying up and eventually taking wn 73 which defended draw d 1 at vierville at 07 50 cota led charge off of dog green between wn 68 and wn 70 by forcing gaps in wire with a bangalore torpedo and wire cutters twenty minutes later 5th rangers joined advance and blew more openings command party established themselves at top of bluff and elements of g 116 and h 116 joined them having earlier moved laterally along beach and now narrow front had widened to east before 09 00 small parties from f 116 and b 116 reached crests just east of dog white right flank of this penetration was covered by survivors of 2nd rangers a and b companies who had independently fought their way to top between 08 00 and 08 30 they took wn 70 already heavily damaged by naval shells and joined 5th rangers for move inland by 09 00 more than 600 american troops in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men had reached top of bluff opposite dog white and were advancing inland 3rd battalion 116th rct forced its way across flats and up bluff between wn 66 which defended d 3 draw at les moulins and wn 65 defending e 1 draw they advanced in small groups supported by heavy weapons of m 116 who were held at base of bluff progress was slowed by mines on slopes of bluff but elements of all three rifle companies as well as a stray section of g 116 had gained top by 09 00 causing defenders at wn 62 to mistakenly report that both wn 65 and wn 66 had been taken between 07 30 and 08 30 elements of g 16 e 16 and e 116 came together and climbed bluffs at easy red between wn 64 defending e 1 draw and wn 62 e 3 draw at 09 05 german observers reported that wn 61 was lost and that one machine gun was still firing from wn 62 150 men mostly from g 16 having reached top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire continued south to attack wn 63 command post on edge of colleville meanwhile e 16 led by second lieutenant john m spalding and captain robert l sheppard v turned westward along top of bluffs engaging in a two hour battle for wn 64 his small group of just four men had effectively neutralized this point by mid morning taking 21 prisoners just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops on beach below 16th rct commander colonel george taylor had landed at 08 15 with words two kinds of people are staying on this beach dead and those who are going to die now let s get hell out of here he organized groups of men regardless of their unit putting them under command of nearest non commissioned officer and sending them through area opened up by g 16 by 09 30 regimental command post was set up just below bluff crest and 1st and 2nd battalions of 16th rct were being sent inland as they reached crest on fox green at eastern end of omaha four sections of l 16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of i 16 k 16 and e 116 up slopes with supporting fire from heavy weapons of m 16 tanks and destroyers this force eliminated wn 60 which defended draw at f 1 by 09 00 3rd battalion 16th rct was moving inland naval support thumb left uss frankford only artillery support for troops making these tentative advances was from navy finding targets difficult to spot and in fear of hitting their own troops big guns of battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on flanks of beaches destroyers were able to get in closer and from 08 00 began engaging their own targets at 09 50 two minutes after destroyed a 75 mm gun position in wn 74 destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible some approached within several times scraping bottom and risking running aground an engineer who had landed in first wave at fox red watching frankford steaming in towards shore thought she had been badly hit and was being beached instead she turned parallel to beach and cruised westwards guns blazing at targets of opportunity thinking she would turn back out to sea engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up guns still firing at one point gunners aboard frankford saw an immobilized tank at water s edge still firing watching fall of its shot they followed up with a salvo of their own in this manner tank acted as ship s fire control party for several minutes official history attributes a similar action to german defenses inland while coastal defenses had not turned back invasion at beach they had broken up and weakened assault formations struggling through them german emphasis on this main line of resistance mlr meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength this tactic was enough to disrupt american advances inland making it difficult even to reach assembly areas let alone achieve their d day objectives as an example of effectiveness of german defenses despite weakness in numbers 5th ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow one platoon attempted to outflank position only to run into another machine gun position to left of first a second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position success of mlr in blocking movement of heavy weapons off beach meant that after four hours rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland beachhead thumb right omaha on afternoon of d day despite penetrations inland key beach objectives had not been achieved draws necessary for movement of vehicles off beach had not been opened and strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on easy green and easy red where vehicles were landing they found a narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire around 08 30 commanders suspended all such landings this caused a jam of landing craft out to sea dukws had a particularly hard time of it in rough conditions 13 dukws carried 111th field artillery battalion of 116th rct five were swamped soon after disembarking from lct four were lost as they circled in rendezvous area while waiting to land and one capsized as they turned for beach two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached beach and lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to sea this one gun eventually landed in afternoon official record of omaha reports that tanks were leading a hard life according to commander of 2nd battalion 116th rct tanks saved day they shot hell out of germans and got hell shot out of them as morning progressed beach defenses were gradually being reduced often by tanks scattered along length of beach trapped between sea and impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst commanders tanks had to be controlled individually this was perilous work commanding officer of 111th field artillery who had landed ahead of his unit was killed as he tried to direct fire of one tank command group of 741st tank battalion lost three out of their group of five in their efforts additionally commander of 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders when naval gunfire was brought to bear against strong points defending e 3 draw a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks colonel taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11 00 only three were able to reach rallying point and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up draw forcing remaining tank to back off thumb left an american casualty of morning s battle reinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion beginning with 18th rct at 09 30 on easy red first battalion to land 2 18 arrived at e 1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through congestion off shore casualties were light though despite existence of a narrow channel through beach obstacles ramps and mines there accounted for loss 22 lcvps 2 lci l s and 4 lcts supported by tank and subsequent naval fire newly arrived troops took surrender at 11 30 of last strong point defending entrance to e 1 draw although a usable exit was finally opened congestion prevented an early exploitation inland three battalions of 115th rct scheduled to land from 10 30 on dog red and easy green came in together and on top of 18th rct landings at easy red confusion prevented remaining two battalions of 18th rct from landing until 13 00 and delayed move off beach of all but 2 18 which had exited beach further east before noon until 14 00 even then this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up draw by early afternoon strong point guarding d 1 draw at vierville was silenced by navy but without enough force on ground to mop up remaining defenders exit could not be opened traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall and surviving tanks of 743rd tank battalion spent night near vierville advance of 18th rct cleared away last remnants of force defending e 1 draw when engineers cut a road up western side of this draw it became main route inland off beaches with congestion on beaches thus relieved they were re opened for landing of vehicles by 14 00 further congestion on this route caused by continued resistance just inland at st laurent was bypassed with a new route and at 17 00 surviving tanks of 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via e 1 draw f 1 draw initially considered too steep for use was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road in absence of any real progress opening d 3 and e 3 draws landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route and a company of tanks from tank battalion were able to reach high ground by 20 00 approaches to exits were also cleared with minefields lifted and holes blown in embankment to permit passage of vehicles as tide receded engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing beach obstacles and by end of evening 13 gaps were opened and marked german reactions observing build up of shipping off beach and in an attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at omaha a battalion was detached from 915th regiment being deployed against british to east along with an anti tank company this force was attached to 916th regiment and committed to a counterattack in colleville area in early afternoon it was stopped by firm american resistance and reported heavy losses strategic situation in normandy precluded reinforcement of weakened 352nd division main threat was felt by germans to be british beachheads to east of omaha and these received most attention from german mobile reserves in immediate area of normandy preparations were made to bring up units stationed for defense of brittany southwest of normandy but these would not arrive quickly and would be subject to losses inflicted in transit by overwhelming allied air superiority last reserve of 352nd division an engineer battalion was attached to 916th regiment in evening it was deployed to defend against expected attempt to break out of colleville st laurent beachhead established on 16th rct front at midnight general dietrich commander of 352nd division reporting total loss of men and equipment in coastal positions advised that he had sufficient forces to contain americans on d 1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter to be told that there were no more reserves available end of day thumb upright 1 3 official history map showing extent of advances made by evening following penetrations inland confused hard fought individual actions pushed foothold out deep in colleville area to east less than that west of st laurent and an isolated penetration in vierville area pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind american front line and whole beachhead remained under artillery fire at 21 00 landing of 26th rct completed planned landing of infantry but losses in equipment were high including 26 artillery pieces over 50 tanks about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels only 100 of 2 400 tons of supplies

with heaviest losses incurred by infantry tanks and engineers in first landings only five tanks of 741st tank battalion were ready for action next day german 352nd division suffered 1 200 killed wounded and missing about 20 of its strength its deployment at beach caused such problems that lieutenant general omar bradley commander of u s first army at one stage considered evacuating omaha

beaches with original objective yet to be achieved priority for allies was to link up all normandy beachheads during course of june 7 while still under sporadic shellfire beach was prepared as a supply area surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and while still less than planned 1 429 tons of stores were landed that day with beach assault phase completed reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions and over course of next two days achieved original d day objectives on 1st divisional front 18th infantry regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from 916th and 726th grenadiers to break out of wn 63 and colleville both of which were subsequently taken by 16th infantry regiment which also moved on port en bessin main advance was made by 18th infantry regiment with 3rd battalion of 26th infantry regiment attached south and south eastwards heaviest opposition was encountered at formigny where troops of 2nd battalion 915th grenadiers had reinforced headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th grenadiers attempts by 3 26 and b 18 with support from tanks of b 745 were held off and town did not fall until morning of june 8 threat of an armored counterattack kept 18th infantry regiment on defensive for rest of june 8 26th infantry regiment s three battalions having been attached to 16th 18th and 115th regiments previous day spent june 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards forcing 1st battalion of german 726th grenadiers to spend night extricating itself from pocket thus forming between bayeux and port en bessin by morning of june 9 1st division had established contact with british xxx corps thus linking omaha with gold on 29th divisional front two battalions of 116th infantry regiment cleared last defenders from bluffs while remaining 116th battalion joined rangers in their move west along coast this force relieved 2nd ranger companies who were holding pointe du hoc on june 8 and subsequently forced german grenadiers and 439th ost battalion to withdraw from grandcamp area which lay further to west early on june 7 wn 69 defending st laurent was abandoned and 115th infantry regiment was therefore able to push inland to south west reaching formigny area on june 7 and original d day phase line following day third regiment of 29th division 175th started landing on june 7 by morning of june 9 this regiment had taken isigny and on evening of following day forward patrols established contact with 101st airborne division thus linking omaha with utah thumb upright 2 omaha landscape 67 years after
