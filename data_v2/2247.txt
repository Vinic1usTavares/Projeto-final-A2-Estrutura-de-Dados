rights association for rental and sanitary reform was a radical far left anarchist organisation based in what is now manette street london originally centred around london s german community and acting as a meeting point for new immigrants it became one of leading radical clubs of victorian london in late nineteenth century although its roots went back to 1840s it was properly formed in 1877 by members of a german emigre workers education group which soon became frequented by london radicals and within a few years had led to formation of similar clubs sometimes in support and sometimes in rivalry rose street club provided a platform for radical speakers and agitators of day and produced its own paper which was distributed over europe and especially germany and pamphlets for other groups and individuals although radical club initially focused as much on providing a social service to its members as on activism with arrival of anarchist johann most in london in early 1880s and his increasing influence within club it became increasingly aligned with anarchism background late nineteenth century saw growth of political organisations in london many of which formed themselves

jubilee street club on commercial road clubs were primarily hubs for organised social networks but they performed other roles for example they linked immigrant politics with domestic english radicalism beneath clubs rooves latter ranged from national organisations such as o nationalists to local london groups including stratford dialectical and radical club origins of rose street club lay in late 19th century european reaction to radical ideas particularly formative were german anti socialist laws of 1878 and more broadly paris commune of 1871 and collapse of first international anarchists persecuted by authoritarian states in continental europe especially imperial germany fled to britain and many settled in london however jonathan moses has suggested that their political ideals destruction of hierarchy collective decision making hostility to state and capitalism atheism and free love did little to ingratiate them to victorian england in order to overcome political isolation of these immigrants they formed clubs such as rose street club founded in 1877 rose street club was a section of cabv german communist workers educational union previously known as german educational association for workers which split into three connected groups in 1879 apart from rose street first section there was one based in nearby tottenham street second section and another third section in whitechapel cabv then merged with blue post group and resultant merge was to create rose street club originally founded by members of german diaspora for which reason it was called german society by contemporary londoners membership swelled during german chancellor otto von bismarck s repression of social democracy with a wave of younger exiles from germany in london radical clubs such as in rose street were a predecessor to plethora of marxist clubs that developed later in 1880s a period that wise described as being between death of chartism and rise of new socialism in keeping

operation for european wide distribution this political allegiance position was shared by whitechapel club but not by that in tottenham street which by 1880 had become an offshoot of rose street club

gatherings of like minded people but a social one which provided succour for newly arrived refugees originally dedicated to political propaganda frank kitz later recalled how rose street club gave
