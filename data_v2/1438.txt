nature in broadest sense is natural physical or material world or universe nature can refer to phenomena of physical world and also to life in general study of nature is a large if not only part of science although humans are part of nature human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena word nature is derived from latin word natura or essential qualities innate disposition and in ancient times literally meant birth natura is a latin translation of greek word physis phusis which originally related to intrinsic characteristics that plants animals and other features of world develop of their own accord an account of pre socratic use of concept of phusis may be found in gerard 2006 greek concept of nature suny press word phusis while first used in connection with a plant in homer occurs very early in greek philosophy and in several senses generally these senses match rather well current senses in which english word nature is used as confirmed by guthrie w k c tradition from parmenides to democritus volume 2 of his history of greek philosophy cambridge up 1965 first known use of physis was by homer in reference to intrinsic qualities of a plant os ara pore argeiphontes ek kai moi autou so saying argeiphontes hermes gave me herb drawing it from ground and showed me its nature odyssey 10 302 03 ed a t murray word is dealt with thoroughly in liddell and scott s greek lexicon for later but still very early greek uses of term see earlier note concept of nature as a whole physical universe is one of several expansions of original notion it began with certain core applications of word phusis by pre socratic philosophers and has steadily gained currency ever since this usage continued during advent of modern scientific method in last several centuries isaac newton s philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica 1687 for example is translated mathematical principles of natural philosophy and reflects then current use of words natural philosophy akin to systematic study of nature etymology of word physical shows its use as a synonym for natural in about mid 15th century within various uses of word today nature often refers to geology and wildlife nature can refer to general realm of living plants and animals and in some cases to processes associated with inanimate objects way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord such as weather and geology of earth it is often taken to mean natural environment or wilderness wild animals rocks forest and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention or which persist despite human intervention for example manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature unless qualified as for example human nature or whole of nature this more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between natural and artificial with artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind depending on particular context term natural might also be distinguished from unnatural or supernatural earth thumb left view of earth taken in 1972 by crew of apollo 17 earth is only planet known to support life and its natural features are subject of many fields of scientific research within solar system it is third closest to sun it is largest terrestrial planet and fifth largest overall its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions two relatively narrow temperate zones and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region precipitation varies widely with location from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre 71 percent of earth s surface is covered by salt water oceans remainder consists of continents and islands with most of inhabited land in northern hemisphere earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of original conditions outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates interior remains active with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron filled core that generates a magnetic field this iron core is composed of a solid inner phase and a fluid outer phase convective motion in core generates electric currents through dynamo action and these in turn generate geomagnetic field atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from original conditions by presence of life forms which create an ecological balance that stabilizes surface conditions despite wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors long term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on ecological balance and on actual geography of earth geology geology is science and study of solid and liquid matter that constitutes earth field of geology encompasses study of composition structure physical properties dynamics and history of earth materials and processes by which they are formed moved and changed field is a major academic discipline and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards some geotechnical engineering fields and understanding past climates and environments geological evolution thumb left upright 1 3 three types of geological plate tectonic boundaries geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto surface or intrude into overlying rock deposition can occur when sediments settle onto surface of earth and later into sedimentary rock or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket surface igneous intrusions such as batholiths laccoliths dikes and sills push upwards into overlying rock and crystallize as they intrude after initial sequence of rocks has been deposited rock units can be deformed and or metamorphosed deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening horizontal extension or side to side strike slip motion these structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries divergent boundaries and transform boundaries respectively between tectonic plates historical perspective thumb 300px an animation showing movement of continents from separation of pangaea until present day earth is estimated to have formed 4 54 billion years ago from solar nebula along with sun and other planets moon formed roughly 20 million years later initially molten outer layer of earth cooled resulting in solid crust outgassing and volcanic activity produced primordial atmosphere condensing water vapor most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets produced oceans and other water sources highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago thumb left plankton inhabit oceans seas and lakes and have existed in various forms for at least 2 billion years continents formed then broke up and reformed as surface of earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years occasionally combining to make a supercontinent roughly 750 million years ago earliest known supercontinent rodinia began to break apart continents later recombined to form which broke apart about 540 million years ago then finally pangaea which broke apart about 180 million years ago during neoproterozoic era freezing temperatures covered much of earth in glaciers and ice sheets this hypothesis has been termed snowball earth and it is of particular interest as it precedes cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530 540 million years ago since cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago when a meteorite collision probably triggered extinction of non avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared small animals such as mammals over past 66 million years mammalian life diversified several million years ago a species of small african ape gained ability to stand upright subsequent advent of human life and development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect earth more rapidly than any previous life form affecting both nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate by comparison great oxygenation event produced by proliferation of algae during period required about 300 million years to culminate present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event holocene extinction event fastest ever to have occurred some such as e o wilson of harvard university predict that human destruction of biosphere could cause extinction of one half of all species in next 100 years extent of current extinction event is still being researched debated and calculated by biologists holocene extinction park org retrieved on november 3 2016 mass extinctions

wavelengths by gases in atmosphere giving earth a blue halo when seen from space earth s atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining ecosystem thin layer of gases that envelops earth is held in place by gravity air is mostly nitrogen oxygen water vapor with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide argon etc atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude ozone layer plays an important role in depleting amount of ultraviolet uv radiation that reaches surface as dna is readily damaged by uv light this serves to protect life at surface atmosphere also retains heat during night thereby reducing daily temperature extremes terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in lower part of atmosphere and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate particularly major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from equatorial oceans to polar regions these currents help to moderate differences in temperature between winter and summer in temperate zones also without redistributions of heat energy by ocean currents and atmosphere tropics would be much hotter and polar regions much colder thumb left lightning weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects extremes in weather such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones can expend large amounts of energy along their paths and produce devastation surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on seasonal variation of weather and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect both on vegetation and on animals which depend on its growth for their food climate is a measure of long term trends in weather various factors are known to influence climate including ocean currents surface albedo greenhouse gases variations in solar luminosity and changes to earth s orbit based on historical records earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in past including ice ages thumb a tornado in central oklahoma climate of a region depends on a number of factors especially latitude a latitudinal band of surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region there are a number of such regions ranging from tropical climate at equator to polar climate in northern and southern extremes weather is also influenced by seasons which result from earth s axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane thus at any given time during summer or winter one part of earth is more directly exposed to rays of sun this exposure alternates as earth revolves in its orbit at any given time regardless of season northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to environment so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days overall two things are happening worldwide 1 temperature is increasing on average and 2 regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes water on earth thumb

component of hydrosphere approximately 71 of earth s surface an area of some 361 million square kilometers is covered by ocean a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas more than half of this area is over deep average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand ppt 3 5 and nearly all seawater has a salinity in range of 30 to 38 ppt though generally recognized as several separate oceans these waters comprise one global interconnected body of salt water often referred to as world ocean or global ocean ocean columbia encyclopedia 2002 new york columbia university press distribution of land and water on planet un atlas of oceans this concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography major oceanic divisions are defined in part by continents various archipelagos and other criteria these divisions are in descending order of size pacific ocean atlantic ocean indian ocean southern ocean and arctic ocean smaller regions of oceans are called seas bays and other names there are also salt lakes which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with world ocean two notable examples of salt lakes are aral sea and great salt lake lakes thumb lake new zealand a lake from latin word lacus is a terrain feature or physical feature a body of liquid on surface of a world that is localized to bottom of basin another type of landform or terrain feature that is it is not global and

numerous river beds natural lakes on earth are generally found in mountainous areas rift zones and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along courses of mature rivers in some parts of world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from last ice age all lakes are temporary over geologic time scales as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of basin containing them ponds thumb westborough reservoir mill pond in westborough massachusetts a pond is a body of standing water either natural or man made that is usually smaller than a lake a wide variety of man made bodies of water are classified as ponds including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed while currents in streams are easily observed ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro currents and moderate wind driven currents these features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features such as stream pools and tide pools rivers thumb left nile

essential for continuing life although there is no universal agreement on definition of life scientists generally accept that biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization metabolism growth adaptation response to stimuli and reproduction life may also be said to be simply characteristic state of organisms properties common to terrestrial organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria are that they are cellular carbon and water based with complex organization having a metabolism a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce an entity with these properties is generally considered life however not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential human made analogs of life may also be considered to be life biosphere is

evidence of archean life stromatolites and microfossils precambrian research 158 141 55 during hadean or archean eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present these life forms possessed basic traits of self replication and inheritable traits once life had appeared process of evolution by natural selection resulted in development of ever more diverse life forms species that were unable to adapt to changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct however fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species current fossil and dna evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to first primitive life forms when basic forms of plant life developed process of photosynthesis sun s energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms resultant oxygen accumulated in atmosphere and gave rise to ozone layer incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes cells within colonies became increasingly specialized resulting in true multicellular organisms with ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation life colonized surface of earth microbes thumb upright a microscopic mite formosa first form of life to develop on earth were microbes and they remained only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi cellular organisms began to appear microorganisms are single celled organisms that are generally microscopic and smaller than human eye can see they include bacteria fungi archaea and protista these life forms are found in almost every location on earth where there is liquid water including in earth s interior their reproduction is both rapid and profuse combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability makes them highly adaptable and able to survive in new environments including outer space they form an essential part of planetary ecosystem however some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms plants and animals thumb left a selection of diverse plant species thumb a selection of diverse animal species originally aristotle divided all living things between plants which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice and animals in linnaeus system these became kingdoms later plantae and animalia since then it has become clear that plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups and fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms however these are still often considered plants in many contexts bacterial life is sometimes included in flora and some classifications use term bacterial flora separately from plant flora among many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras which depending on purpose of study can also include fossil flora remnants of plant life from a previous era people in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora which can vary widely across globe due to differences in climate and terrain regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated some types of native flora actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another and become an integral part of native or natural flora of place to which they were introduced this is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur boundary of what is considered nature another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds though term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize useless plants informal use of word weeds to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape course of nature similarly animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic farm animals wild animals pests etc according to their relationship to human life animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular although see myxozoa which separates them from bacteria archaea and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls with a few exceptions most notably two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues these include muscles which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may be calcified to form structures like shells bones and spicules a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation and which supports complex anatomy required for mobility human interrelationship thumb left despite their natural beauty secluded valleys along na pali coast in hawaii are heavily modified by introduced invasive species such as she oak although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of total living biomass on earth human effect on nature is disproportionately large because of extent of human influence boundaries between what humans regard as nature and made environments is not clear cut except at extremes even at extremes amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace development of technology by human race has allowed greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of risk from natural hazards in spite of this progress however fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in environment there exists a highly complex feedback loop between use of advanced technology and changes to environment that are only slowly becoming understood man made threats to earth s natural environment include pollution deforestation and disasters such as oil spills humans have contributed to extinction of many plants and animals humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of world s economic system some activities such as hunting and fishing are used for both sustenance and leisure often by different people agriculture was first adopted around 9th millennium bce ranging from food production to energy nature influences economic wealth although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed medicinal properties of vegetation for healing most modern human use of plants is through agriculture clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in amount available of forestation and wetlands resulting in loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion aesthetics and beauty thumb left upright grandiflora commonly known as a thumb aesthetically pleasing flowers beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books filling large sections of libraries and bookstores that nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art photography poetry and other literature shows strength with which many people associate nature and beauty reasons why this association exists and what association consists of are studied by branch of philosophy called aesthetics beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful opinions are virtually endless nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history an early tradition of landscape art began in china during tang dynasty 618 907 tradition of representing nature as it is became one of aims of chinese painting and was a significant influence in asian art although natural wonders are celebrated in psalms and book of job wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in 1800s especially in works of romantic movement british artists john constable and j m w turner turned their attention to capturing beauty of natural world in their paintings before that paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings william wordsworth s poetry described wonder of natural world which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place increasingly valuing of nature became an aspect of western culture history of conservation bc spaces for nature accessed may 20 2006 this artistic movement also coincided with transcendentalist movement in western world a common classical idea of beautiful art involves word mimesis imitation of nature also in realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that perfect is implied through perfect
