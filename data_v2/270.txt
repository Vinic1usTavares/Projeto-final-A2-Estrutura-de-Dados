solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in metal gear rising revengeance character design initial concept according to series creator hideo kojima decision to make a new character to replace solid snake for most of metal gear solid 2 sons of liberty stemmed from developer s desire to develop snake from a third person perspective kojima stated that raiden s character and his perception by audience were important to overall feel of story idea of having a second main character was inspired by sherlock holmes short stories and novels in which narrator is dr watson rather than holmes kojima said snake was game s protagonist rather than raiden yoshikazu assistant director for project was uncertain about this decision he considered raiden a weak looking character but decided to follow kojima codename raiden was based on that of mitsubishi raiden a historical combat aircraft of imperial japanese navy air service it was initially planned to be written in katakana as but was changed to kanji form because of a resemblance to bin laden s laden in katakana his full name was going to be raiden brannigan but idea was scrapped romantic relationship between raiden and

consideration he and his team designed raiden to be more appealing to women designer yoji shinkawa said he and other character designers took much inspiration for raiden s appearance from bishonen archetype because raiden was a new character staff designed him carefully giving him white hair to symbolize his introduction shinkawa also said raiden had an overall feminine appearance his outfit skull suit was difficult to design until staff decided on a bonelike concept shinkawa wanted to make raiden sexually appealing emphasizing tightness of his clothing design of raiden s aqua mask was inspired by ancient mystical ninjutsu where ninja bites a scroll in mouth during magic transformations raiden s final duel with boss solidus snake was revised in making of game originally to defeat solidus raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake like arms then he must attack solidus back and sever back bone vertebra connection rendering solidus no longer mobile following this raiden would

to simply raiden slicing solidus vertebral column with boss falling from area to give idea he could not accept his defeat konami kept raiden s starring role in metal gear solid 2 secret until game s north american release company replaced raiden with snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials although raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear his presence was not

illustrated raiden staff noted that raiden s debut in game s trailer received notably positive responses several video game magazines promoted game with raiden s screenshots shinkawa stated raiden was remade as a darker hero to appeal to western fanbase seeing gray fox as one of his favorite characters shinkawa made raiden be an archetype of such character kojima echoed similar comments indicating he wanted to expand character with another game in designing him shinkawa wanted to convey both raiden s beauty and sorrow in his cybernetic body he was given ability to wield swords with his own legs giving players impression he was a ninja raiden s first fight against vamp in game caused motion and voice actors difficulty because of carefully planned movements performed by two fighters staff was satisfied with outcome considering it one of best battles in game two actors were selected for motion capture of raiden one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences raiden s fights in guns of patriots were made to assist weaker solid snake and appealed to previous fans of series who disliked character when metal gear rising revengeance was known as metal gear solid rising

role in game as in metal gear solid 2 leading him to become its main character director kimura wanted raiden to be able to move way he did in metal gear solid 4 trailers wanting to show stealth of

comparison to previous metal gear games he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in first liberian civil war leading him to become a dark hero shinkawa designed raiden s new body to emphasize his dark heroism contrasting with his metal gear solid 4 persona later discussed with platinum games kenji saito about including his quasi human look raiden s loss of an eye also represents his transformation across story in response to complaints that rising appeared to contradict raiden s ending in guns of patriots kojima productions staff said game would explain what happened with raiden s life team in charge of revengeance depicted raiden as a more mature character than in his previous appearances they said his swordplay is not based on any samurai and that raiden s cybernetic body includes heels because they are very uncomfortable to run in or fight in and besides he s a guy when developing game s team thought of raiden s revenge against his enemies which resulted in title writer etsu tamari expressed joy in final product and expected that in future team could make another game focused on raiden in a further analysis of how to write raiden in revengeance tamari stated he needed a new character that would bring him support in form of dog like robot named bladewolf similar to how snake guides raiden in sons of liberty mature raiden acts like a mentor to bladewolf across story resulting in his character arc raiden is first depicted as a white haired adult who uses a protective suit known as a for his missions in metal gear solid 4 guns of patriots raiden s entire body below upper jaw is replaced with a prototype cybernetic body his blood is replaced with a military substitute called that requires regular maintenance his original cybernetic body is

rookie agent who is inexperienced as a result of training only in virtual reality he later reveals however that he was a child soldier known as who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed

to believe he has no free will solid snake encourages raiden to ignore what people tell him and to become self reliant when problem solving his original personality was that of a creep or a weirdo who licked bird but this was discarded by staff in japanese versions of games raiden has been voiced by kenyu horiuchi who felt he could understand character s pain despite becoming a cyborg raiden still acts like a human casting director kris zimmerman chose quinton flynn with whom she had previously worked to voice raiden in series english adaptation flynn remembers having a long time to develop character and being instructed by zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced flynn said raiden was one of his favorite video game voice characters and noted a difference between his roles in metal gear solid 2 and metal gear solid 4 english voice recording was overlooked by scott dolph who reported back saying english voice for raiden was more neutral than original japanese voice for metal gear solid 4 flynn used a deeper voice to match cyborg raiden in contrast to original youthful raiden of metal gear solid 2 flynn said voice he used was grizzled yeah but different enough from style of snake in 2015 flynn stated he was pleased with raiden s role in and that he would have liked a new sequel raiden as lead internal problems between kojima productions and konami however left flynn worried there might not be another game in series kojima productions compared experiences and ways of thinking of raiden and solid snake during game s climax raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against solidus snake snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow revolver ocelot emphasizing raiden s lack of freedom hideo kojima compared raiden and snake with movie monsters king kong and godzilla respectively former was taken from his home and his nature changes upon meeting rosemary whereas latter will continue fighting against mankind s menaces defeating solidus snake encourages raiden to trust himself and believe in his own choices this is further addressed by staff s motivation to make a new sequel to metal gear without kojima kojima also likened raiden with john rambo from rambo series because both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution raiden himself believes that he is destined to fight based on his upbringing during revengeance while also following concept of in which samurai kill in order to protect weak appearances main games metal gear solid 2 sons of liberty
