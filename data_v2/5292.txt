arbitration act 1979 c 42 was an act of parliament of united kingdom that reformed arbitration law in england and wales prior to 1979 arbitration law was based on arbitration act 1950 which allowed use of case stated procedure and other methods of judicial intervention which marked english arbitration law as significantly different from that of other jurisdictions prior law significantly increased cost and time required for arbitration which made england an unpopular jurisdiction to conduct such negotiations in as a result while london maintained its traditional position as a centre for arbitration in insurance admiralty and commodities trading it failed to attract more modern forms of trade following pressure from industry groups lord chancellor introduced arbitration bill into parliament having it passed hours before dissolution of james callaghan s government it was given royal assent on 4 april 1979 and commenced working on 1 august 1979 act completely abolished case stated procedure and other forms of judicial interference replacing it with a limited system of appeal to high court of justice and court of appeal of england and wales it also allowed for exclusion agreements limiting rights of parties to arbitration to appeal to courts and gave arbitrators ability to enforce interlocutory orders academics met act with a mixed response while some praised it for bringing english law more into line with that of other nations others criticised wording used as unnecessarily complex and hazy act did in eyes of some commentators lead to a shift in judicial policy away from legal certainty and towards a system focused on speed and finality having been repealed in its entirety by section 107 2 of arbitration act 1996 act is no longer in force background previous law london was historically a centre for trade and arbitration which peter s smedresman writing in journal of maritime law and commerce divides into three categories of transaction english commodities trading through bodies such as baltic exchange specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in london even when goods being traded have no relation to united kingdom smedresman 1979 p 319 london has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues and insurance however it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade such as major communications developments or high technology projects due to nature of its arbitration law these contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by international chamber of commerce which rarely sent arbitration cases to london due to individual nature of english law on subject smedresman 1979 p 320 in most nations arbitrators can apply principle of amiable composition case is decided under broad sweeping principles of equity without judicial oversight or application of national commercial law in england this was not case arbitration act 1950 in section 22 1 allowed courts to instruct an arbitrator to correct his decision if it had an incorrect statement of law immediately obvious in response to this english arbitrators simply stopped giving reasons for their decisions smedresman 1979 p 321 second form of judicial oversight was found in section 21 and was an application of case stated procedure this allowed judicial review of a decision by high court of justice and was regularly applied during 1970s because freeze on interest rates during a delayed case made it attractive for debtors to delay conversely this made london a far less attractive venue for creditors smedresman 1979 p 322 before 1979 act english law did not provide many ways to avoid case stated procedure even prohibiting parties from agreeing in advance not to use it this was due to scrutton lj s statement in czarnikow v roth schmidt co 1922 2 kb 478 that there must be no alsatia in england where king s writ does not run in 1973 1 qb 843 court of appeal of england and wales gave a decision interpreted as saying that courts must consider a case stated even if there is no great some in dispute no point of general importance is involved or answer is reasonably clear smedresman 1979 p 323 lord denning s statement in that case has been described as t he death knell of arbitrator autonomy and led to arbitrators almost automatically asking for judicial supervision for fear that they would otherwise be found to have committed misconduct jaffe 1989 p 185 for obvious reasons companies and parties to a case who submit their issues to arbitration expect something private quick and cheap with fixed results traditional english emphasis on judicial oversight therefore meant that with case stated procedure london was a highly unpopular venue for arbitration shenton 1980 p 644 development of act thumb right james callaghan a motion of no confidence in his government forced passage of act through house of commons in a few hours by 1960s even before increase of abuse of case stated procedure united kingdom was estimated to be losing ps500 million a year through movement of arbitration business to other countries abromson 1980 p 86 in response lord chancellor convened a commercial court users conference in 1960 and tasked them with reviewing system conclusion was that status quo should remain abromson 1980 p 87 with increased use of case stated procedure more calls for reform came in june 1977 london arbitration group lag was formed taking it upon itself to make government aware of damage current law was causing hacking 2010 p 125 in 1978 in reaction to continued pressure lord chancellor established a commercial court committee to again look at issue their report in june 1978 recommended changing system so that appeal was only allowed when either high court permitted it or both parties to arbitration agreed it was necessary this was intended to ensure that any new act of parliament fulfilled two roles firstly decreasing use of case stated procedure and secondly encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions smedresman 1979 p 324 report was endorsed by government and published following month kerr 1980 p 47 after being announced in queen s speech arbitration bill was introduced to house of lords by lord chancellor in late 1978 given its second reading on 12 december 1978 and after passing through committee stage its third reading on 15 february 1979 before it could be sent to house of commons however james callaghan s government collapsed following a motion of no confidence as final drama arbitration bill quickly made it to house of commons and was passed during few hours it took callaghan to get to buckingham palace and ask for a dissolution hacking 2010 p 127 royal assent was granted on 4 april 1979 and arbitration act 1979 came into force on 1 august kerr 1980 p 45 act act was a compromise between two opposing approaches to arbitration that courts should be kept out of arbitration altogether except to prevent abuses against rules of natural justice and that courts should retain a substantial measure of control over to ensure that arbitral awards apply law kerr 1980 p 48 section 1 thumb left high court of justice principal body that deals with arbitration appeals primary reforms are found in section 1 of act section 1 1 repeals section 21 of 1950 act abolishing case stated procedure in arbitration matters and states that courts cannot set aside a decision based on an error in law or fact that is blatantly obvious effectively repealing section 22 1 smedresman 1979 p 326 instead sections 1 2 and 1 3 provide that an appeal may be made on any question of law arising out of an award made on an arbitration agreement if either high court agrees appeal is valid or if both parties to arbitration request it kerr 1980 p 49 in bermuda ltd v international sa 1988 3 all er 484 court of appeal was asked to explain what guidelines should be applied by a high court judge when deciding whether or not to grant an appeal high court had refused leave to appeal because a point was raised which had not been mentioned during arbitration marshall 1989 p 415 staughton lj with rest of court in agreement explained that conditions for leave to appeal are laid out in section 1 4 no conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent but when permission of high court is sought judge may only grant leave if he considers that question of law concerned could substantially affect rights of one or more parties to arbitration agreement under sections 1 5 and 1 6 high court may ask for additional reasons as to why arbitrator reached decision that he did but only if one of parties gave notice to arbitrator that reasons would be required or there was some special reason why such a notice was not given smedresman 1979 p 327 in universal petroleum co v und transport gmbh 1987 1 wlr 1178 court of appeal interpreted meaning of sections 1 4 and 1 5 dispute came from a highly detailed schedule of further reasons ordered by high court because judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in reasons given marshall 1988 p 160 appellate judges found that section 1 5 required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from award material ambiguity was inadmissible and irrelevant for purpose of exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of act marshall 1988 p 161 if high court refuses to hear an appeal case cannot proceed further similarly with one exception once high court has heard a case no decision may be reviewed by court of appeal one exception is laid out in section 1 7 and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either high court or court of appeal certifies it as such and high court confirms that case concerns a point of law which merits consideration kolodziej 1987 p 206 in national westminster bank plc v arthur young mcclelland moores co no 1 1985 1 wlr 1123 court of appeal confirmed that once high court has decided not to allow an appeal registrar of court of appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request marshall 1986 p 136 sections 2 6 section 21 of 1950 act contained a secondary method of appeal to high court through consultative case procedure parties in a pending arbitration could ask high court to quickly give a decision on a point of law kerr 1980 p 51 this provision was maintained in 1979 act despite efforts by legislators to remove it section 2 provides that should a party apply to high court with either consent of arbitrator or other parties high court may explain any point of law given in reference on condition that point of law meets requirements laid out in section 1 and if determination of application might produce substantial savings in costs to parties smedresman 1979 p 328 czarnikow v roth schmidt co decision in which it was decided agreements excluding judicial supervision are invalid is partially overruled by sections 3 and 4 section 3 provides that where such an agreement is drafted high court no longer has automatic right to request additional reasons from arbitrator or grant leave to appeal decision such exclusion clauses must be specific but can be general in nature section 3 2 states that it can be framed to relate to a particular award to awards under a particular reference or to any other description of awards whether arising out of same reference or not kolodziej 1987 p 209 section 3 6 provides an exception which covers domestic arbitration agreements these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside united kingdom and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in uk in this situation exclusion clause is only valid if agreed to after start of arbitration a second exception is found in section 4 1 where contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction to do with commodities trading or an insurance agreement it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after start of arbitration or law applicable to contract is not that of england and wales in any situation high court can be asked to give a decision on a point of law or exclusion clause removed should all parties agree kolodziej 1987 p 210 prior to 1979 act arbitrators were allowed to make interlocutory orders penalising parties who failed to follow arbitrator s timetable or requests there was however no effective enforcement mechanism section 5 of act allows high court to intervene if a party fails to comply high court may on application of arbitrator or any other party order arbitrator to continue as if offending party was not there he can immediately issue an award without considering their missing submission or failure to appear shenton 1980 p 670 section 6 amends 1950 act which required any two arbitrators hearing a case to immediately appoint an umpire this caused unnecessary delay and expenditure section 6 instead provides that arbitrators can choose to appoint an umpire at any point but must do forthwith if they fundamentally disagree shenton 1980 p 671 assessment david shenton and gordon toland concluded that act brought judicial oversight in english law into compliance with that of other nations saying that it is broadly comparable to provisions to be found in swedish swiss and french law shenton 1980 p 675 smedresman however argued that it would do little to help attract new arbitration and would in fact drive it away saying that vagueness of statutory language combined with rather hazy policy considerations behind act make confusion and litigation likely smedresman 1979 p 331 david hacking who helped promote act says that it was not drafted with elegance of 1996 arbitration act in style of parliamentary draftsmen of that time many of its provisions were drafted with a complexity which was happily avoided in 1996 act and criticises failure to achieve more than minor reform of existing law however he does note that act led to a shift in judicial policy with future judgments to be issued with regards to need for finality striving for legal accuracy may be said to have been overtaken by commercial expediency hacking 2010 p 129 jaffe agrees writing in journal arbitration that i t is clear that with passage of 1979 act there has been a distinct and noticeable shift of emphasis from legal certainty to finality for arbitral awards jaffe 1989 p 193 act is no longer in force having been repealed in its entirety by section 107 2 of arbitration act 1996 references bibliography category united kingdom acts of
