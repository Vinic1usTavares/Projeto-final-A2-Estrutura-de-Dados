contemporary writers accused longchamp s father of being son of a peasant he held land as a knight longchamp first served henry ii s illegitimate son geoffrey but quickly transferred to service of richard i henry s heir when richard became king in 1189 longchamp paid ps3 000 for office of chancellor and was soon named to see or bishopric of ely and appointed legate by pope longchamp governed england while richard was on third crusade but his authority was challenged by richard s brother john who eventually succeeded in driving longchamp from power and from england longchamp s relations with other leading english nobles were also strained which contributed to demands for his exile soon after longchamp s departure from england richard was captured on his journey back to england from crusade and held for ransom by henry vi holy roman emperor longchamp travelled to germany to help negotiate richard s release although longchamp regained office of chancellor after richard s return to england he lost much of his former power he aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career but he retained richard s trust and was employed by king until bishop s death

unknown with it perhaps being near norman village of his father hugh de longchamp also held land in england as did many other norman nobles after norman conquest of england in 1066 hugh nonant one of longchamp s opponents declared that elder longchamp was son of a peasant which seems unlikely as hugh de longchamp appears to have held a knight s tenancy in normandy turner longchamp william de

fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 84 longchamp paid 3 000 pounds ps for office of chancellor this was followed by an increase in price of having chancery documents sealed with great seal

england in 1189 richard put tower of london in longchamp s hands and appointed him jointly with hugh de puiset bishop of durham to office of chief justiciar at that time not strictly a judicial office instead justiciar was person entrusted with much of king s authority when king was outside kingdom able to act in king s name saul justiciar companion to medieval england p 154 along with puiset king named hugh bardulf william geoffrey fitz peter and william marshall as associates in justiciarship under puiset and longchamp west justiciarship in england p 68 as justiciar longchamp sent judges throughout country to visit shires on judicial visits even though he had no previous knowledge of judiciary turner english judiciary pp 65 66 longchamp and puiset were unable to work together and so in march 1190 richard gave authority north of river humber to hugh and authority south of river to longchamp historian s opinions are divided whether richard explicitly made longchamp superior to puiset at this time or if in theory two were supposed to co equal in their respective spheres by june longchamp had eased puiset out of power and justiciar s office he also received a commission as a papal legate from pope clement iii at this time supposedly richard paid 1 500 marks ps1 000 to papacy to secure legateship for longchamp gillingham richard i p 130 longchamp granted citizens of london right to elect their own sheriffs and to collect and remit their monetary levy of ps300 directly to exchequer treasury of england poole domesday book to magna carta p 70 on longchamp s visits to his diocese he was accompanied by a large train of retainers and animals which became notorious throughout country as a sign of his extravagance poole domesday book to magna carta p 223 under his legatine authority bishop held legatine councils of church at gloucester and westminster in 1190 he also acted to restore authority in york which had suffered a breakdown in order after massacre of jews in march 1190 also in 1190 he sent an army against rhys ap gruffydd a welsh prince who was attempting to throw off control of marcher lords that surrounded wales left thumb gate at lincoln castle which longchamp besieged in 1190 alt a paved road leading to an arched opening in a tall thick stone wall disputes with john longchamp s relations with english people were made more difficult because he was a native of normandy and often insensitive to english customs medieval writer william of newburgh claimed that longchamp was an obscure foreigner of unproven ability and loyalty quoted in gillingham richard i p 121 for example it appears likely that longchamp did not speak english making his relations with his flock more difficult bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 488 leading nobles complained that longchamp marginalised other officials richard had appointed to serve with him and that he brought in foreigners to fill offices although first charge is mostly untrue second appears to have been valid as longchamp did install non natives in judicial offices and as sheriffs he also attempted to seize control of a number of english castles by granting their custody to relatives and dependents heiser castles constables and politics albion pp 19 20 throughout 1190 longchamp s relations with richard s younger brother john were difficult this led to longchamp besieging lincoln castle because castellan would not surrender castle and allow himself to be replaced by longchamp s nominee castellan gerard de had sworn allegiance to john and stated he would no longer recognise chancellor s authority in response john took two castles of tickhill and northampton huscroft ruling england p 144 news of dispute reached richard who sent walter de coutances archbishop of rouen to england in late spring 1191 with orders to negotiate a peace between john and longchamp barlow feudal kingdom of england pp 373 376 eventually walter brokered a compromise between two as a result of which gerard was confirmed as castellan and john relinquished castles longchamp also agreed to work to ensure john s succession to throne in event of richard s death longchamp s legatine commission from papacy expired in spring 1191 on death of clement iii thus removing one of longchamp s power bases legation was however renewed a few months later by clement s successor celestine iii a further complication for longchamp arose in september 1191 when henry ii s illegitimate son geoffrey archbishop of york was arrested by longchamp s subordinates led by castellan of dover castle longchamp s brother in law their orders had been to arrest archbishop of york as he landed at dover on archbishop s return to england but geoffrey had been warned of their plans and fled to sanctuary in st martin s priory longchamp s men laid siege to priory and after four days forcibly removed geoffrey violence of attack reminded public of thomas becket s martyrdom and public opinion turned against longchamp gillingham richard i pp 227 229 longchamp claimed that geoffrey had not sworn fealty to richard but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival lyon constitutional and legal history pp 233 236 an intense propaganda campaign led by partisans of john ensued one of leaders of campaign against longchamp was hugh nonant bishop of coventry and he along with other magnates including geoffrey who had been released convened a trial on 5 october 1191 at loddon bridge near london longchamp did not attend but he was deposed and excommunicated and after trying to hold tower of london he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from citizens of london council then declared his offices forfeit and ordered surrender of castles in his custody main charge against longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour longchamp went to dover in late 1191 to seek transport to continent during his escape he was unable to answer local people when they spoke to him in english he attempted to leave england in various disguises including a monk s habit and women s clothes hugh nonant wrote that longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving england on 29 october exile and return longchamp went to court of henry vi holy roman emperor who was holding king richard captive at bishop arranged for richard to be held at imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for ransom 100 000 marks under terms of which emperor agreed to release richard once 70 000 marks had been paid and hostages for payment of rest had been received gillingham richard i p 239 when emperor in january 1194 called a meeting of imperial magnates to debate king philip ii of france s offer to pay emperor to keep richard captive longchamp attended along with walter of coutances and eleanor of aquitaine richard s mother after further diplomatic wrangling richard was freed on 4 february 1194 gillingham richard i pp 247 248 richard rewarded longchamp with custody of eye and an appointment as sheriff of essex and sheriff of hertfordshire when pair returned to england but longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with archbishop geoffrey of york gillingham richard i p 272 richard left england in may 1194 and longchamp accompanied him to continent never to return to england poole domesday book to magna carta pp 368 369 longchamp returned to emperor s court in 1195 richard continued to use longchamp in richard i p 290 although it was geoffrey who arranged a truce with king philip in 1194 as well as retaining bishop as chancellor but main power in england was now hubert walter barlow feudal kingdom of england pp 385 386 longchamp spent rest of his life outside his diocese usually accompanying king sharpe richard barre s compendium journal of medieval latin p 134 death and legacy longchamp died in january 1197 at poitiers while on a diplomatic mission to rome for richard gillingham richard i p 302 footnote 5 and was buried at abbey of le pin much of information on his career comes from people hostile to him for example gerald of wales called longchamp that monster with many heads quoted in barlow feudal kingdom of england p 353 historian austin lane poole says that gerald described longchamp as more like an ape than a man longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well educated man he was supported by others among his contemporaries including pope clement iii who when he appointed longchamp legate wrote that he did so at urging of english bishops poole domesday book to magna carta p 358 when he was one of four men named bishop in 1189 medieval chronicler richard of devizes wrote that four new bishops were men of no little virtue and fame quoted in gillingham richard i p 109 historian john gillingham wrote that longchamp s record of his life in politics and administration was a good one spoiled only by his failure in 1191 one of longchamp s probable innovations as chancellor was replacement of first person singular previously used in documents drafted in king s name with majestic plural or royal we he wrote a work on law entitled practica legum et a manual on usage of both civil and canon law in angevin possessions on continent turner roman law
