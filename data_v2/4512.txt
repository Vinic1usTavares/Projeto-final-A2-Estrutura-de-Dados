selfishness and mean behavior of michael in episode in a new york magazine article entitled michael finally goes too far will leitch describes it as one of funnier recent episodes but found michael s willingness to sell out dwight unsettling usually when he s about to do something over top like plant drugs on toby he backs off at last second this time he s willing to go all way and sell out dwight his most loyal friend it s a little jarring leitch however said sweetness of subplot involving kevin and lynne offset some of darker aspects of episode and praised several of jokes including michael s shoe la la shoe store idea dwight s idea for a horse boat invention and kgb knock knock jokes kona gallagher of tv squad praised golden ticket especially final act between michael s face and dwight s conference call last ten minutes of this episode were absolutely golden gallagher said episode returned to season one levels of michael scott stupidity and particularly liked way dwight so readily accepted credit once golden ticket promotion proved to be a success nathan rabin of a v club gave golden ticket an a grade and particularly praised steve carell s willy wonka impression and way michael tried to distance himself after promotional idea went bad rabin said tonight s episode lacked a certain gravity but it delivered goods comedy wise he also pointed out that script was technically illogical in that michael pretended he did not come up with golden ticket idea despite documentary camera crew filming his earlier discussions about it entertainment weekly writer whitney pastorek described episode as kind of cute tonight and kind of flat in places and kind of sad pastorek said one of most interesting aspects of golden ticket was relationship between michael and dwight after their respective failed romances with holly and angela michael and dwight may be coming to awkward realization that most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another and that may be causing a little tension travis fickett of ign said golden ticket was a solid offering but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into fickett said it was fun to watch michael squirm both when he thought he was in trouble and when he was robbed credit for his good idea he also liked when jim encouraged dwight not to take fall for michael and when others in office rallied around dwight when david wallace gave dwight credit for success alan sepinwall television writer for star ledger said michael acted so nakedly selfish and unfeeling that it made episode unpleasant to watch if last week s blood drive gave us michael at his most human and sympathetic then golden ticket showed how a human michael could also be a monster however sepinwall said he did think subplot involving kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet brian baumgartner s just been aces last two weeks and if it hadn t been for this story i might have found golden ticket unbearable dan hopper of vh1 s best week ever strongly criticized episode and behavior of characters why was every single character on last night s willy wonka episode acting like a complete idiot not idiot in sense that characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way but idiot as in none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch golden ticket was voted eleventh highest rated episode out of 26 from fifth season according to an episode poll at fansite officetally episode was rated 8 33 out of 10
