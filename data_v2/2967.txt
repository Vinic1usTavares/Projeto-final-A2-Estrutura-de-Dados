artist s official tumblr account this marked first time that wolfhard was credited as a storyboard artist this is due to fact that he was largely responsible for storyboarding episodes third act at this time in show s production wolfhard was only a storyboard revisionist and as such he originally was supposed to have only revised act however he added so much to section that he was credited as episode s third storyboard artist initially series creator pendleton ward felt that wolfhard s scenes were not effective he wanted finn s nightmares to be composed largely of scary dream imagery upon further consideration however he changed his mind applauding how section focuses on finn s personal fears episode s story itself was developed by ward patrick mchale and kent osborne it was directed by larry leichliter ward s goal for episode was to weird it up and play off bizarre ideas and imagery ward latter revealed on his twitter that many scenes were inspired by popular youtube poops which are idiosyncratic and often nonsensical mashups which have been uploaded on video site youtube ward explained that he enjoyed concept of poops and wanted to put them in episode note information taken from artist s official twitter account while storyboarding episode xayaphone exaggerated elongation of finn s ears this was originally going to be revised but ward liked that effect because it fit in with concept of an unstable and unreliable dream world episode features erik estrada voicing titular king worm he had originally voiced character in first season episode evicted tom kenny did voice of lady rainicorn episode was also embedded with references to future episodes for instance large penguin monster designed by michael deforge later appeared in reign of gunters similarly lich fourth season finale had already been storyboarded by time king worm was entering into production as a result crew was able to take model of alternate universe finn who is introduced at end of lich and add him as a mirror reflection in king worm at end of evicted finn and jake encounter king worm who puts them in a trance ending of king worm however seems to imply that finn and jake were stuck in a trance between events of evicted and king worm this could be interpreted as suggesting that events between two episodes existed only as part of an elongated dream ward however stated in dvd commentary for episode that such an idea bothered him because he did not want to destroy reality of series in end he noted that he wanted to preserve status quo by making real finn where he is now he isn t still dreaming adam muto later noted on his spring me account that were events between evicted and king worm to have existed only as a part of a dream then there wouldn t be much point to that note information taken from artist s official spring me account reception king worm first aired on cartoon network on august 13 2012 according to nielsen ratings episode ranked first in its timeslot among children aged 2 11 and 6 11 as well as in all boy demographics episode first saw physical release as part of 2014 dvd suitor which included 16 episodes from series first five seasons it was later re released as part of complete fourth season dvd in october 2014 oliver sava of a v club awarded episode a c largely criticizing installment for its apparent randomness he argued that being in a dream allows writers to do whatever they want without any explanation meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly leaving viewer as confused as finn sava felt that only scenes with any pathos were to be found near end of episode but even they were still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth such as sequence wherein finn s fears manifest themselves by emerging from his navel sava did compliment episode s designs however writing that this episode puts show s off kilter design sense on full display nicole klein of geekadelphia however applauded episode s exploration of finn s psyche noting that she was pleased with this episode and fifth season episode vault because she love s any episode that involves going into finn s crazy screenrant writer jack o keefe named episode one of best television dream sequences writing adventure time dips into surreal often and without hesitation making it nearly impossible to pick a stand out dream sequence however dream sequence that makes up king worm is one of adventure time s highest artistic achievements among many explanatory notes references external links category 2012 american television episodes
