i ching or yi jing also known as classic of changes or book of changes is an ancient chinese divination text and oldest of chinese classics possessing a history of more than two and a half millennia of commentary and interpretation i ching is an influential text read throughout world providing inspiration to worlds of religion psychoanalysis literature and art originally a divination manual in western zhou period over course of warring states period and early imperial period it was transformed into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as ten wings after becoming part of five classics in 2nd century bc i ching was subject of scholarly commentary and basis for divination practice for centuries across far east and eventually took on an influential role in western understanding of eastern thought i ching uses a type of divination called cleromancy which produces apparently random numbers six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a hexagram which can then be looked up in i ching book arranged in an order known as king wen sequence interpretation of readings found in i ching is a matter of centuries of debate and many commentators have used book symbolically often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by confucianism taoism and buddhism hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for processes of change such as yin and yang and wu xing divination text zhou yi core of i ching is a western zhou divination text called changes of zhou various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between 10th and 4th centuries bc for assembly of text in approximately its current form based on a comparison of language of zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions american sinologist edward shaughnessy dated its compilation in its current form to early decades of reign of king xuan of zhou in last quarter of 9th century bc a copy of text in shanghai museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips recovered in 1994 shows that zhou yi was used throughout all levels of chinese society in its current form by 300 bc but still contained small variations as late as warring states period it is possible that other divination systems existed at this time rites of zhou name two other such systems and name and origins name zhou yi literally means changes of zhou dynasty changes involved have been interpreted as transformations of hexagrams of their lines or of numbers obtained from divination feng proposed that word for changes originally meant easy as in a form of divination easier than oracle bones but there is little evidence for this there is also an ancient folk etymology that sees character for changes as containing sun and moon cycle of day modern sinologists believe character to be derived either from an image of sun emerging from clouds or from content of a vessel being changed into another zhou yi was traditionally ascribed to zhou cultural heroes king wen of zhou and duke of zhou and was also associated with legendary world ruler fu xi according to canonical great commentary fu xi observed patterns of world and created eight trigrams in order to become thoroughly conversant with numinous and bright and to classify myriad things zhou yi itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins rites of zhou however also claims that hexagrams of zhou yi were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams during han dynasty there were various opinions about historical relationship between trigrams and hexagrams eventually a consensus formed around 2nd century ad scholar ma rong s attribution of text to joint work of fu xi king wen of zhou duke of zhou and confucius but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted structure thumbnail right upright alt a turtle shell inscribed with primitive chinese characters oracle turtle shell featuring ancient form 15px of zhen to divine basic unit of zhou yi is hexagram gua a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines yao each line is either broken or unbroken received text of zhou yi contains all 64 possible hexagrams along with hexagram s name a short hexagram statement tuan and six line statements statements were used to determine results of divination but reasons for having two different methods of reading hexagram are not known and it is not known why hexagram statements would be read over line statements or vice versa book opens with first hexagram statement yuan heng li zhen these four words translated traditionally by james legge as originating and penetrating advantageous and firm are often repeated in hexagram statements and were already considered an important part of i ching interpretation in 6th century bc edward shaughnessy describes this statement as affirming an initial receipt of an offering beneficial for further divining word zhen ancient form 15px was also used for verb divine in oracle bones of late shang dynasty which preceded zhou it also carried meanings of being or making upright or correct and was defined by eastern han scholar zheng xuan as to enquire into correctness of a proposed activity names of hexagrams are usually words that appear in their respective line statements but in five cases 2 9 26 61 and 63 an unrelated character of unclear purpose appears hexagram names could have been chosen arbitrarily from line statements but it is also possible that line statements were derived from hexagram names line statements which make up most of book are exceedingly cryptic each line begins with a word indicating line number base 2 3 4 5 top and either number 6 for a broken line or number 9 for a whole line hexagrams 1 and 2 have an extra line statement named yong following line number line statements may make oracular or prognostic statements some line statements also contain poetry or references to historical events usage thumb left alt a bundle of thin sticks fifty yarrow achillea millefolium subsp m var millefolium stalks used for i ching divination archaeological evidence shows that zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used stalks of yarrow plant but it is not known how yarrow stalks became numbers or how specific lines were chosen from line readings in hexagrams broken lines were used as shorthand for numbers 6 and 8 and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 and 9 great commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks leaving remainders of 6 to 9 like zhou yi itself yarrow stalk divination dates to western zhou period although its modern form is a reconstruction ancient narratives zuo zhuan and contain oldest descriptions of divination using zhou yi two histories describe more than twenty successful conducted by professional soothsayers for royal families between 671 bc and 487 bc method of divination is not explained and none of stories employ predetermined commentaries patterns or interpretations only hexagrams and line statements are used by 4th century bc authority of zhou yi was also cited for rhetorical purposes without relation to any stated divination zuo zhuan does not contain records of private individuals but qin dynasty records found at shuihudi show that hexagrams were privately consulted to answer questions such as business health children and determining lucky days most common form of divination with i ching in use today is a reconstruction of method described in these histories in 300 bc great commentary and later in huainanzi and lunheng from great description neo confucian zhu xi reconstructed a method of yarrow stalk divination that is still used throughout far east in modern period gao heng attempted his own reconstruction which varies from zhu xi in places another divination method employing coins became widely used in tang dynasty and is still used today in modern period alternative methods such as specialized dice and cartomancy have also appeared in zuo zhuan stories individual lines of hexagrams are denoted by using genitive particle zhi followed by name of another hexagram where that specific line had another form in later attempts to reconstruct ancient divination methods word zhi was interpreted as a verb meaning moving to an apparent indication that hexagrams could be transformed into other hexagrams however there are no instances of changeable lines in zuo zhuan in all 12 out of 12 line statements quoted original hexagrams are used to produce oracle classic i ching in 136 bc emperor wu of han named zhou yi first among classics dubbing it classic of changes or i ching emperor wu s placement of i ching among five classics was informed by a broad span of cultural influences that included confucianism daoism legalism yin yang cosmology and wu xing physical theory while zhou yi does not contain any cosmological analogies i ching was read as a microcosm of universe that offered complex symbolic correspondences official edition of text was literally set in stone as one of stone classics canonized i ching became standard text for over two thousand years until alternate versions of zhou yi and related texts were discovered in 20th century ten wings part of canonization of zhou yi bound it to a set of ten commentaries called ten wings ten wings are of a much later provenance than zhou yi and are production of a different society zhou yi was written in early old chinese while ten wings were written in a predecessor to middle chinese specific origins of ten wings are still a complete mystery to academics regardless of their historical relation to text philosophical depth of ten wings made i ching a perfect fit to han period confucian scholarship inclusion of ten wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient china found in zuo zhuan and other pre han texts that i ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination arguably most important of ten wings is great commentary or xi ci which dates to roughly 300 bc great commentary describes i ching as a microcosm of universe and a symbolic description of processes of change by partaking in spiritual experience of i ching great commentary states individual can understand deeper patterns of universe among other subjects it explains how eight trigrams proceeded from eternal oneness of universe through three other wings provide different perspectives on essentially same viewpoint giving ancient cosmic authority to i ching for example provides a moral interpretation that parallels first two hexagrams gan qian and kun kun with heaven and earth and attributes to symbolic function of hexagrams ability to understand self world and destiny throughout ten wings there are passages that seem to purposefully increase ambiguity of base text pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism great commentary associates knowledge of i ching with ability to delight in heaven and understand fate sage who reads it will see cosmological patterns and not despair in mere material difficulties japanese word for metaphysics pinyin xing er shang xue is derived from a statement found in great commentary that what is above form xing er shang is called dao what is under form is called a tool word has also been borrowed into korean and re borrowed back into chinese ten wings were traditionally attributed to confucius possibly based on a misreading of records of grand historian although it rested on historically shaky grounds association of i ching with confucius gave weight to text and was taken as an article of faith throughout han and tang dynasties i ching was not included in burning of confucian classics and textual evidence strongly suggests that confucius did not consider zhou yi a classic an ancient commentary on zhou yi found at mawangdui portrays confucius as endorsing it as a source of wisdom first and an imperfect divination text second hexagrams in canonical i ching hexagrams are arranged in an order dubbed king wen sequence after king wen of zhou who founded zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed method of interpretation sequence generally pairs hexagrams with their upside down equivalents although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion another order found at mawangdui in 1973 arranges hexagrams into eight groups sharing same upper trigram but oldest known manuscript found in 1987 and now held by shanghai library was almost certainly arranged in king wen sequence and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from western zhou period contains four hexagrams in king wen sequence whichever of these arrangements is older it is not evident that order of hexagrams was of interest to original authors of zhou yi assignment of numbers binary or decimal to specific hexagrams is a modern invention following table numbers hexagrams

michael describes i ching as best known chinese book in world in east asia it is a foundational text for confucian and daoist philosophical traditions while in west it attracted attention of enlightenment intellectuals and prominent literary and cultural figures eastern han and six dynasties during eastern han i ching interpretation divided into two schools originating in a dispute over minor differences between different editions of received text first school known as new text criticism was more egalitarian and eclectic and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between natural world and hexagrams their commentaries provided basis of school of images and numbers other school old text criticism was more scholarly and hierarchical and focused on moral content of text providing basis for school of meanings and principles new text scholars distributed alternate versions of text and freely integrated non canonical commentaries into their work as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as most of this early commentary such as image and number work of jing fang yu fan and xun shuang is no longer extant only short fragments survive from a tang dynasty text called zhou yi with fall of han i ching scholarship was no longer organized into systematic schools most influential writer of this period was wang bi who discarded numerology of han commentators and integrated philosophy of ten wings directly into central text of i ching creating such a persuasive narrative that han commentators were no longer considered significant a century later han added commentaries on ten wings to wang bi s book creating a text called zhouyi zhu principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by soothsayer guan lu tang and song dynasties at beginning of tang dynasty emperor taizong of tang ordered kong to create a canonical edition of i ching choosing 3rd century zhouyi zhu as official commentary he added to it a drawing out subtler levels of wang bi s explanations resulting work zhouyi became standard edition of i ching through song dynasty by 11th century i ching was being read as a work of intricate philosophy as a jumping off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues cheng yi patriarch of neo confucian cheng zhu school read i ching as a guide to moral perfection he described text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions root out corruption and solve problems in government contemporary scholar shao yong rearranged hexagrams in a format that resembles modern binary numbers although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically this arrangement sometimes called binary sequence later inspired leibniz neo confucian 12th century neo confucian zhu xi cofounder of cheng zhu school rejected both of han dynasty lines of commentary on i ching proposing that text was a work of divination not philosophy however he still considered it useful for understanding moral practices of ancients called rectification of mind in great learning zhu xi s reconstruction of i ching yarrow stalk divination based in part on great commentary account became standard form and is still in use today as china entered early modern period i ching took on renewed relevance in both confucian and daoist study kangxi emperor was especially fond of i ching and ordered new interpretations of it qing dynasty scholars focused more intently on understanding pre classical grammar assisting development of new philological approaches in modern period korean and japanese in 1557 korean neo confucian yi hwang produced one of most influential i ching studies of early modern era claiming that spirit was a principle li and not a material force qi hwang accused neo confucian school of having misread zhu xi his critique proved influential not only in korea but also in japan other than this contribution i ching was not central to development of korean confucianism and by 19th century i ching studies were integrated into reform movement in medieval japan secret teachings on i ching were publicized by rinzai zen master kokan shiren and yoshida i ching studies in japan took on new importance in edo period during which over 1 000 books were published on subject by over 400 authors majority of these books were serious works of philology reconstructing ancient usages and commentaries for practical purposes a sizable minority focused on numerology symbolism and divination during this time over 150 editions of earlier chinese commentaries were reprinted in japan including several texts that had become lost in china in early edo period writers such as ito kumazawa banzan and ranked i ching greatest of confucian classics many writers attempted to use i ching to explain western science in a japanese framework one writer tadao even attempted to employ newtonian mechanics and copernican principle within an i ching cosmology this line of argument was later taken up in china by qing scholar and official zhang zhidong early european thumb right alt a circular diagram of i ching hexagrams a diagram of i ching hexagrams sent to gottfried wilhelm leibniz from joachim bouvet arabic numerals were added by leibniz leibniz who was corresponding with jesuits in china wrote first european commentary on i ching in 1703 arguing that it proved universality of binary numbers and theism since broken lines 0 or nothingness cannot become solid lines 1 or oneness without intervention of god this was criticized by hegel who proclaimed that binary system and chinese characters were empty forms that could not articulate spoken words with clarity of western alphabet in their discussion i ching hexagrams and chinese characters were conflated into a single foreign idea sparking a dialogue on western philosophical questions such as universality and nature of communication in 20th century jacques identified hegel s argument as but accepted without question hegel s premise that chinese language cannot express philosophical ideas modern after xinhai revolution of 1911 i ching was no longer part of mainstream chinese political philosophy but it maintained cultural influence as china s most ancient text borrowing back from leibniz chinese writers offered parallels between i ching and subjects such as linear algebra and logic in computer science aiming to demonstrate that ancient chinese cosmology had anticipated western discoveries sinologist joseph needham took opposite stance arguing that i ching had actually impeded scientific development by incorporating all physical knowledge into its metaphysics psychologist carl jung took interest in possible universal nature of imagery of i ching and he introduced an influential german translation by richard wilhelm by discussing his theories of archetypes and synchronicity jung wrote even to most biased eye it is obvious that this book represents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one s own character attitude and motives book had a notable impact on 1960s counterculture and on 20th century cultural figures such as philip k dick john cage jorge luis borges terence mckenna and hermann hesse modern period also brought a new level of skepticism and rigor to i ching scholarship li spent several decades producing a new interpretation of text which was published posthumously in 1978 gao heng an expert in pre qin china its use as a zhou dynasty oracle edward shaughnessy proposed a new dating for various strata of text new archaeological discoveries have enabled a deeper level of insight into how text was used in centuries before qin dynasty proponents of newly reconstructed western zhou readings which often differ greatly from traditional readings of text are sometimes called modernist school translations i ching has been translated into western languages dozens of times most influential edition is 1923 german translation of richard wilhelm later translated to english by cary baynes earliest complete published i ching translation in a western language was a latin translation done in 1730s by jesuit missionary jean baptiste regis that was published in germany in 1830s although thomas mcclatchie and james legge had both translated text in 19th century text gained significant traction during counterculture of 1960s with translations of wilhelm and john blofeld attracting particular interest richard rutt s 1996 translation incorporated much of new archaeological and philological discoveries of 20th century gregory s 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct zhou period readings most commonly used english translations of i ching are legge james 1882 yi king in sacred books
