winner while his mercedes team mate nico rosberg was drivers championship leader coming into round during qualifying which saw second iteration of heavily criticised elimination format hamilton achieved pole position ahead of rosberg and ferrari s sebastian vettel rosberg won race from kimi raikkonen with hamilton completing podium report background following widespread criticism over elimination qualifying format used in australia teams voted to abandon format and revert to system used between and however in week after race sport s strategy working group met to formally vote on matter and chose to keep elimination format in place for bahrain grand prix and subject to a more thorough review ahead of next round in china it was subsequently reported that teams had only been given option of retaining elimination format or adopting a hybrid of elimination and pre 2016 formats and that an outright reversion to 2006 2015 format was never discussed mercedes motorsport director toto wolff remained adamant that format needed to be reverted saying that he did not expect qualifying to be more entertaining than it had been two weeks before drivers were equally critical of retention of changed format ferrari s sebastian vettel told press that he was as disappointed as probably anyone i know while mercedes s lewis hamilton called decision strange particularly because most important thing is fans were unhappy another meeting was scheduled for race day to discuss format with both jean todt president of fia and bernie ecclestone formula one s commercial rights holder in attendance thumb left stoffel vandoorne replaced fernando alonso at mclaren in aftermath of a collision with esteban gutierrez in australian grand prix fernando alonso was ruled out of event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax and as a result was replaced with mclaren reserve driver stoffel vandoorne gutierrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired mostly caused by crane during recovery process and not in accident itself meanwhile ferrari were able to use same engine in kimi raikkonen s car as they had done in australia even though it had caught fire following a failure of turbo charger swift reactions by team on scene prevented damage to combustion engine with only turbo changed for bahrain alfonso celis jr made his first appearance in a formula one session during first free practice for force india tyre supplier pirelli brought three compounds to bahrain from which drivers were allowed to choose three options for event were super soft soft and medium compounds same as for previous round in australia frontrunners mercedes and ferrari opted for different strategies in tyre allocation as mercedes took only one set of harder medium tyres for both their drivers while ferrari chose three sets at expense of soft compound tyres as in previous years race was accompanied by concerns about human rights situation in bahrain bahrain institute for rights and democracy wrote an open letter to jean todt in week before race pointing out that severe human rights violations have been committed during race authorised by fia and urged sport s governing body to be prepared to cancel race in coming years free practice thumb sebastian vettel was fastest in third practice per regulations for season three practice sessions were held two ninety minute sessions on friday and another one hour session before qualifying on saturday during first practice session on friday mercedes set times well clear of their closest rivals nico rosberg was fastest on a time of 1 32 292 more than half a second quicker than his teammate lewis hamilton in second place kimi raikkonen was third fastest albeit almost two seconds slower than rosberg newcomers stoffel vandoorne and alfonso celis jr were 18th and 21st fastest respectively both slower than their teammates celis went off track at one point at turn 3 leading him to back off pace in order not to damage car as his responsibility laid mainly with gathering information for team session was marked by unusually cool weather said to be representative of expected race conditions for sunday s race held at night therefore many teams decided to send their cars out for a large number of laps with sixteen drivers recording twenty laps or more rosberg was again fastest in second practice session on friday evening his time of 1 31 001 was more than one and a half seconds faster than pole position time in previous year s event lewis hamilton finished second fastest 0 241 seconds adrift of rosberg jenson button set third fastest time for mclaren although he was more than a second off fastest time several drivers voiced surprise over mclaren s pace during friday s practice sessions described by button as team s best for a couple of years max verstappen followed in fourth ahead of two ferrari cars of raikkonen and vettel latter had set third fastest time on soft tyre compound but mistakes during his runs on super soft tyres meant that he was unable to place higher than sixth he had to end his session fifteen minutes early when his rear left wheel nut came loose vandoorne was eleventh fastest in his second session while sergio perez who took back car from celis was fifteenth two places ahead of his teammate nico hulkenberg vibrations from running over kerbs caused front wing on romain grosjean s car to dislodge forcing him off track he was able to get back into pitlane and had wing replaced at end of session renault s kevin magnussen failed to stop for weighing instead returning to his garage where work was conducted on his car as a consequence he was forced to start race from pitlane sebastian vettel led a ferrari 1 2 in third practice ahead of raikkonen setting a time of 1 31 683 two mercedes drivers of rosberg and hamilton followed ahead of valtteri bottas and romain grosjean on soft compound tyres both mercedes drivers had set identical times before rosberg edged out hamilton on super softs higher temperatures in afternoon sun meant that times dropped from second practice felipe massa ran a new shorter nase for williams but managed only ninth fastest time more than half a second slower than teammate bottas not running super soft tyres toro rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively jolyon palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre at end of session qualifying thumb nico rosberg qualified second and went on to win race qualifying on saturday was contested under retained

his second lap he was quickly dropped back into elimination by a faster lap from stoffel vandoorne pascal wehrlein qualified in 16th place ahead of force india s sergio perez kevin magnussen qualified

representatives of fia and fom a new proposal was set before teams which would see every driver set two timed laps in every part of qualifying both times would than be added and aggregate time would determine grid positions reactions to proposal were mixed while sebastian vettel described it as a shit idea and daniel ricciardo said that he wouldn t be too keen on that jenson button deemed it a better plan than existing elimination format on 7 april teams unanimously rejected scheme instead demanding a return to format used between 2006 and 2015 decision was finalised four days later race
