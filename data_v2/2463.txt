english football league system traditionally play off final matches were held at wembley stadium in london but redevelopment of ground saw matches moved to millennium stadium in cardiff during construction works neither cardiff or qpr had ever played a match at ground in previous years british national anthem god save queen had been sung by during pre match ceremony as cardiff are a welsh team enquiries were made to football league regarding welsh national anthem hen wlad fy nhadau also being sung but was rejected with football league stating that match was a club game not an international fixture this was despite both anthems being played prior to 1997 football league third division play off final when another welsh team swansea city played at original wembley stadium first minister of wales rhodri morgan criticised decision commenting that anthems should not be a part of match but if they were then both should be played three days before match football league announced that no anthems would be played before match or division one and division three play off finals spokesman john nagle commenting playing of anthem this weekend has become a subject of some controversy this has begun to detract from both games themselves this should clearly not be case teams were instead allowed to play their club songs 30 minutes prior to kick off cardiff selecting men of harlech and qpr pig bag qpr manager ian holloway made one change from side that started their play off semi final second leg with richard pacquette replacing andy thomson while richard langley served second match of his ban following his sending off in first leg before match striker paul furlong stated his belief that pressure was on cardiff to win and described rangers as underdogs as cardiff won a coin toss to decide which team would wear their home colours qpr chose to wear an all white strip rather than their normal red and black away kit in reference to strip worn by qpr side that won 1967 football league cup final thumb right celtic manor resort where qpr team stayed night before match night before match members of qpr s team were woken at 3am by a fire alarm being triggered at their hotel celtic manor resort perpetrator was later arrested and named as neil mcnamara a cardiff city fan who had previously worked for club as a minder for chairman sam hammam he was charged with criminal damage and making a false and malicious fire call mcnamara pled guilty to charges and was given a five year banning order after judges ruled act was committed deliberately to disrupt qpr squad qpr player richard langley described actions as very unsporting hammam stated before game that he would provide a ps30 million transfer budget if club achieved promotion and a planned new stadium at received approval hammam also called on fans of cardiff s south wales rivals swansea city to support side and described match as for whole of wales however holloway refuted hammam s call for swansea fans to back cardiff calling them something that should be in a mills boon novel although playing in their home city cardiff players stayed at vale of glamorgan hotel and country club night prior to match defender andy legg commented that team was a bag of nerves beforehand but believed that match being played in city of cardiff made occasion extra special striker andy campbell was a major doubt to feature in match having struggled with a hernia during season several days prior to match he decided to have an operation in hope of being fit to play and was passed fit just before kick off to take a place on bench cardiff manager lennie lawrence made no changes from second leg of their play off semi final against bristol and named same starting eleven and substitutes from match choosing to leave out loan player gareth ainsworth who missed both legs of play off semi final through suspension match summary cardiff started better of two sides as robert earnshaw graham kavanagh and peter thorne all had chances at goal in opening ten minutes of match kevin gallen forced a save from cardiff goalkeeper neil alexander from a free kick soon after and a slip by danny in 26th minute allowed paul furlong space to shoot but he was unable to hit target cardiff had majority of possession during first half but strikers earnshaw and thorne struggled to beat qpr s central defenders danny shittu and clarke carlisle who received significant praise for their control of game match remained 0 0 at half time both sides being described as tense and nervy in second half qpr began to seize control and gallen wasted an early chance by shooting straight at alexander after being played through by furlong pair both missed chances in second half as qpr began to dominate match in 79th minute cardiff manager lennie lawrence decided to substitute earnshaw in place of andy campbell substitution was seen as a significant gamble by lawrence earnshaw s 35 goals in all competitions during season had broken a club record that had stood since 1927 and campbell had not scored since january 2003 however cardiff s approach to game had limited earnshaw and thorne s support to high passes that favoured qpr s physically larger defenders in final minute of game a misjudged header by cardiff defender spencer prior fell to opposition substitute andy thomson but he could only direct his header wide of goal after finishing 0 0 after 90 minutes match entered extra time in first half of extra time qpr goalkeeper chris day produced a save to deny prior from scoring with a header with less than ten minutes remaining of extra time carlisle s forward pass was intercepted by cardiff midfielder gareth whalley who played a long pass over head of shittu into path of
