respective book opting instead to write a three part adaptation with some sequences missing some sequences created from scratch and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in books to allow story to be clearer for viewers jackson takes a more chronological approach to story than did tolkien during shooting screenplays continued to evolve in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters each film had benefit of a full year of post production time before its respective december release often finishing in

awards ceremony hosted by andrew johnston chair of organization at that time who called it a masterful piece of filmmaking comparisons between film series and book trilogy film series provoked both positive and negative reaction from fans and scholars of novels and was sometimes seen as changing parts tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters themes events and subtlety some fans of book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of films such as lord of rings purist edition which removed many of changes to bring them closer to original it was rumoured that tolkien family became split on series with christopher tolkien and his son simon tolkien feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt christopher has since denied these claims saying my own position is that lord of rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form suggestions that have been made that i disapprove of films even to extent of thinking ill of those with whom i may differ are wholly without foundation he added that he had never expressed any such feeling in 2012 however he described films as having eviscerated book and criticized resulting commercialisation of his father s work various changes to characters such as gandalf aragorn arwen denethor faramir gimli and frodo when considered together were seen by some to alter tone and themes found in books several critics contend that portrayal of women especially arwen in films is thematically faithful to or compatible with tolkien s writings despite some differences wayne g hammond a tolkien scholar said of first two films that he found them to be travesties as adaptations faithful only on a basic level of plot and that many characters had not been depicted faithfully to their appearance in novel sean tolkien scholar stings rings films review of lord of rings fellowship of ring and lord of rings two towers first published in syracuse post standard 4 february 2003 janet brennan croft criticized films using tolkien s own terms anticipation and flattening which she used in critiquing a proposed film script she contrasts tolkien s subtlety with jackson s tendency to show too much too soon other critics have argued that tolkien s characters were weakened and misinterpreted by their portrayal in films changes to events such as elves participating at battle of helm s deep faramir taking hobbits to osgiliath and deletion of chapter scouring of shire are also seen as changing tolkien s themes supporters of series assert that it is a worthy interpretation of book and that most of changes were necessary many who worked on series are fans of book including christopher lee who alone among cast had actually met tolkien in person and boyens once noted that no matter what it is simply their interpretation of book jackson once said that to simply summarize story on screen would be a mess and in his own words sure it s not really lord of rings but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie other fans also claim that despite any changes films serve as a tribute to book appealing to those who have not yet read it and even leading some to do so movie guide for encyclopedia of arda an online tolkien encyclopedia states that jackson s films were exceptional since filming whole story of lord of rings was probably impossible this notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of faithfulness to tolkien s spirit and tone douglas kellner argues that conservative community spirit of tolkien s shire is reflected in jackson s films as well as division of fellowship into squabbling races in a 2006 review film theorist kristin thompson was critical about fact that film studies were undertaken by literary researchers and about frequent denigration of jackson s work in collected essays home media first two films were released on standard two disc edition dvds containing previews of next film
