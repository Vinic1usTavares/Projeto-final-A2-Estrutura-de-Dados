led respectively by king wladyslaw ii jagiello jogaila and grand duke vytautas decisively defeated german prussian teutonic knights led by grand master ulrich von jungingen most of teutonic knights leadership were killed or taken prisoner although defeated teutonic knights withstood siege of their fortress in marienburg malbork and suffered minimal territorial losses at peace of thorn 1411 torun with other territorial disputes continuing until peace of melno in 1422 knights however would never recover their former power and financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in lands under their control battle shifted balance of power in central and eastern europe and marked rise of polish lithuanian union as dominant political and military force in region battle was one of largest in medieval europe and is regarded as one of most important victories in histories of poland and lithuania and is also widely celebrated in belarus it has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders during 20th century battle was used in nazi german and soviet propaganda campaigns only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate scholarly assessment of battle reconciling previous narratives which differed widely by nation it is widely considered a polish lithuanian

battle by an eyewitness its authorship is uncertain but several candidates have been proposed polish deputy chancellor mikolaj and wladyslaw ii jagiello s secretary zbigniew olesnicki while original cronica conflictus did not survive a short summary from 16th century has been preserved another important source is historiae by polish historian jan dlugosz 1415 1480 it is a comprehensive and detailed account written several decades after battle reliability of this source suffers not only from long gap between events and chronicle but also dlugosz s alleged biases against lithuanians banderia prutenorum is a mid 15th century manuscript with images and latin descriptions of teutonic battle flags captured during battle and displayed in wawel cathedral and vilnius cathedral other polish sources include two letters written by wladyslaw ii jagiello to his wife anne of cilli and bishop of poznan wojciech jastrzebiec and letters sent by jastrzebiec to poles in holy see german

attention to pagan grand duchy of lithuania for about 100 years knights raided lithuanian lands particularly samogitia as it separated knights in prussia from their branch in livonia while border regions became an uninhabited wilderness knights gained very little territory lithuanians first gave up samogitia during lithuanian civil war 1381 84 in treaty of territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure teutonic support for one of sides in internal power struggle in 1385 grand duke jogaila of lithuania agreed to marry queen jadwiga of poland in union of kreva jogaila converted to christianity and was crowned king of poland wladyslaw ii jagiello thus creating a personal union between kingdom of poland and grand duchy of lithuania official lithuanian conversion to christianity removed religious rationale for order s activities in area its grand master conrad zollner von supported by hungarian king sigismund of luxemburg responded by publicly contesting sincerity of jogaila s conversion bringing charge to a papal court territorial disputes continued over samogitia which had been in teutonic hands since peace of in 1404 poland also had territorial claims against knights

grand master ulrich von jungingen declared war on kingdom of poland and grand duchy of lithuania on 6 august 1409 knights hoped to defeat poland and lithuania separately and began by invading greater poland and kuyavia catching poles by surprise knights burned castle at dobrin dobrzyn nad wisla captured after a 14 day siege conquered bydgoszcz bromberg and sacked several towns poles organized counterattacks and recaptured bydgoszcz samogitians attacked memel klaipeda however neither side was ready for a full scale war wenceslaus king of romans agreed to mediate dispute a truce was signed on 8 october 1409 and was set to expire on 24 june 1410 both sides used this time to prepare for war gathering troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvering both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to christendom wenceslaus who received a gift of 60 000 florins from knights declared that samogitia rightfully belonged to knights and only dobrzyn land should be returned to poland knights also paid 300 000 ducats to sigismund of hungary who had ambitions regarding principality of moldavia for mutual military assistance sigismund attempted to break polish lithuanian alliance by offering vytautas a king s crown vytautas acceptance would have violated terms of ostrow agreement and created polish lithuanian discord at same time vytautas managed to obtain a truce from livonian order by december 1409 wladyslaw ii jagiello and vytautas had agreed on a common strategy their armies would unite into a single massive force and march together towards marienburg malbork capital of teutonic knights knights who took a defensive position did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion by poles along vistula river towards danzig gdansk and lithuanians along neman river towards ragnit neman to counter this perceived threat ulrich von jungingen concentrated his forces in schwetz swiecie a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly sizable garrisons were left in eastern castles of ragnit rhein ryn near and memel klaipeda to keep their plans secret and mislead knights

unclear how many men were under each banner structure and number of infantry units pikemen archers crossbowmen and artillery units is unknown estimates often biased by political and nationalistic considerations were produced by various historians german historians tend to present lower numbers while polish historians tend to use higher estimates high end estimates by polish historian stefan kuczynski of 39 000 polish lithuanian and 27 000 teutonic men have been cited in western literature as commonly accepted while less numerous teutonic army had advantages in discipline military training and equipment they were particularly noted for their heavy cavalry teutonic army was also equipped with bombards that could shoot lead and stone projectiles both forces were composed of troops from several states and lands including numerous mercenaries for example bohemian mercenaries fought on each side knights also invited guest crusaders twenty two different peoples mostly germanic joined them teutonic recruits included soldiers from westphalia frisia austria swabia and stettin szczecin two hungarian nobles nicholas ii garay and stibor of stiboricz brought 200 men for

directly participate in battle lithuanian units were commanded directly by grand duke vytautas who was second in command and helped design grand strategy of campaign vytautas actively participated in battle managing both lithuanian and polish units jan dlugosz stated that low ranking sword bearer of crown of commanded polish army but that is highly doubtful more likely marshal of crown zbigniew of

lithuanian troops at czerwinsk a designated meeting point about from prussian border where joint army crossed vistula over a pontoon bridge this maneuver which required precision and intense coordination among multi ethnic forces was accomplished in about a week from 24 30 june 1410 polish soldiers from greater poland gathered in poznan and those from lesser poland in wolborz on 24 june 1410 wladyslaw ii jagiello and czech mercenaries arrived in wolborz three days later polish army was already at meeting place lithuanian army marched out from vilnius on 3 june and joined ruthenian regiments in hrodna they arrived in czerwinsk on same day poles crossed river after crossing masovian troops under siemowit iv and janusz i joined polish lithuanian army massive force began its march north towards marienburg malbork capital of prussia on 3 july prussian border was crossed on 9 july river crossing remained secret until hungarian envoys who were attempting to negotiate a peace informed grand master as soon as ulrich von jungingen grasped polish lithuanian intentions he left 3 000 men at schwetz swiecie under heinrich von plauen and marched main force to organize a line of defense on drewenz river near river crossing was fortified with stockades on 11 july after meeting with his eight member war council wladyslaw ii jagiello decided against crossing river at such a strong defensible position army would instead bypass river crossing by turning east towards its sources where no other major rivers separated his army from marienburg march continued east towards soldau although no attempt was made to capture town teutonic army followed drewenz river north crossed it near lobau and then moved east in parallel with polish lithuanian army according to order

area covering approximately between villages of grunwald tannenberg stebark and ludwigsdorf lodwigowo armies formed opposing lines along a northeast southwest axis polish lithuanian army was positioned in front and east of ludwigsdorf and tannenberg polish heavy cavalry formed left flank lithuanian light cavalry right flank and various mercenary troops made up center their men were organized in three lines of wedge shaped formations about 20 men deep teutonic forces concentrated their elite heavy cavalry commanded by grand marshal frederic von wallenrode against lithuanians knights who were first to organize their army for battle hoped to provoke poles or lithuanians into attacking first their troops wearing heavy armor had to stand in scorching sun for several hours waiting for an attack one chronicle suggested that they had dug pits that an attacking army would fall into they also attempted to use field artillery but a light rain dampened their powder and only two cannon shots were fired as wladyslaw ii jagiello delayed grand master sent messengers with two swords to assist wladyslaw ii jagiello and vytautas in battle swords were meant as an insult and a provocation known as grunwald swords they became one of national symbols of poland battle begins lithuanian attack and retreat vytautas supported by polish banners started an assault on left flank of teutonic forces after more than an hour of heavy fighting lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat jan dlugosz described this development as a complete annihilation of entire lithuanian army according to dlugosz knights assumed that victory was theirs broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of retreating lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to battlefield to face polish troops he made no mention of lithuanians who later returned to battlefield thus dlugosz portrayed battle as a single handed polish victory this view contradicted cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians starting with an article by in 1909 they proposed that retreat had been a planned maneuver borrowed from golden horde a feigned retreat had been used in battle of vorskla river 1399 when lithuanian army had been dealt a crushing defeat and vytautas himself had barely escaped alive this theory gained wider acceptance after discovery and publication in 1963 by swedish historian sven ekdahl of a german letter written a few years after battle it cautioned new grand master to look out for feigned retreats of kind that had been used in great battle stephen turnbull asserts that lithuanian tactical retreat did not quite fit formula of a feigned retreat such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units as opposed to almost an entire army and was swiftly followed by a counterattack whereas lithuanians had returned late in battle battle continues polish teutonic fight thumb 260px banners of kingdom of poland and lwow land during battle while lithuanians were retreating heavy fighting broke out between polish and teutonic forces commanded by grand komtur kuno von lichtenstein teutonic forces concentrated on polish right flank six of von s banners did not pursue retreating lithuanians instead joining attack on right flank a particularly valuable target was royal banner of krakow it seemed that knights were gaining upper hand and at one point royal standard bearer marcin of wrocimowice lost krakow banner however it was soon recaptured and fighting continued wladyslaw ii jagiello deployed his reserves second line of his army grand master ulrich von jungingen then personally led 16 banners almost a third of original teutonic strength to right polish flank and wladyslaw ii jagiello deployed his last reserves third line of his army melee reached polish command and one knight identified as or of charged directly against king wladyslaw ii jagiello wladyslaw s secretary zbigniew olesnicki saved king s life gaining royal favor and becoming one of most influential people in poland battle ends teutonic knights defeated at that time reorganized lithuanians returned to battle attacking von jungingen from rear teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by mass of polish knights and advancing lithuanian cavalry as von jungingen attempted to break through lithuanian lines he was killed according to cronica conflictus of olesnica thrust a lance through grand master s neck while dlugosz presented of as killer surrounded and leaderless teutonic knights began to retreat part of routed units retreated towards their camp this move backfired when camp followers turned against their masters and joined manhunt knights attempted to build a wagon fort camp was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification however defense was soon broken and camp was ravaged according to cronica conflictus more knights died there than on battlefield battle lasted for about ten hours teutonic knights attributed defeat to treason on part of nikolaus von renys mikolaj of commander of culm chelmno banner and he was beheaded without a trial he was founder and leader of lizard union a group of knights sympathetic to poland according to knights von renys lowered his banner which was taken as a signal of surrender and led to panicked retreat legend that knights were stabbed in back was echoed in post world war i stab in back legend and preoccupied german historiography of battle until 1945 aftermath casualties and captives thumb left upright battle as depicted in berner chronik of schilling a note sent in august 1410 by envoys of king sigismund of hungary nicholas ii garai and stibor of stiboricz put total casualties at 8 000 dead on both sides however wording is vague and it is unclear whether it meant a total of 8 000 or 16 000 dead a papal bull from 1412 mentioned 18 000 dead christians in two letters written immediately after battle wladyslaw ii jagiello mentioned that polish casualties were small valde and and jan dlugosz listed only 12 polish knights that were killed a letter by a teutonic official from mentioned that only half of lithuanians returned but it is unclear how many of those casualties are attributable to battle and how many to later siege of marienburg defeat of teutonic knights was resounding according to teutonic payroll records only 1 427 men reported back to marienburg to claim their pay of 1 200 men sent from danzig only 300 returned between 203 and 211 brothers of order were killed out of 270 that participated in battle including much of teutonic

komtur of brandenburg and heinrich schaumburg voigt of were executed by order of vytautas after battle bodies of von jungingen and other high ranking officials were transported to marienburg castle for burial on 19 july bodies of lower ranking teutonic officials and 12 polish knights were buried at church in tannenberg rest of dead were buried in several mass graves highest ranking teutonic official to escape battle was werner von komtur of elbing elblag polish and lithuanian forces took several thousand captives among these were dukes konrad vii of oels olesnica and casimir v of pomerania most of commoners and mercenaries were released shortly after battle on condition that they report to krakow on 11 november 1410 only those who were expected to pay ransom were kept considerable ransoms were recorded for example mercenary von had to pay 150 kopas of prague groschen amounting to more than of silver further campaign and peace thumb upright after battle castle of

after battle polish and lithuanian forces delayed their attack on teutonic capital in marienburg malbork remaining on battlefield for three days and then marching an average of only about per day main forces did not reach heavily fortified marienburg until 26 july this delay gave heinrich von plauen enough time to organize a defense wladyslaw ii jagiello also sent his troops to other teutonic fortresses which often surrendered without resistance including major cities of danzig gdansk thorn torun and elbing elblag only eight castles remained in teutonic hands besiegers of marienburg expected a speedy capitulation and were not prepared for a long siege suffering from lack of ammunition low morale and an epidemic of dysentery knights appealed to their allies for help and sigismund of hungary wenceslaus king of romans and livonian order promised financial aid and reinforcements siege of marienburg was lifted on 19 september polish lithuanian forces left garrisons in fortresses they had taken and returned home however knights quickly recaptured most of castles by end of october only four teutonic castles along border remained in polish hands wladyslaw ii jagiello raised a fresh army and dealt another defeat to knights in battle of on 10 october 1410 following other brief engagements both sides agreed to negotiate peace of thorn was signed in february 1411 under its terms knights ceded dobrin land dobrzyn land to poland and agreed to resign their claims to samogitia during lifetimes of wladyslaw ii jagiello and vytautas although another two wars hunger war of 1414 and war of 1422 would be waged before treaty of melno permanently resolved territorial disputes poles and lithuanians were unable to translate military victory into territorial or diplomatic gains however peace of thorn imposed a heavy financial burden on knights from which they never recovered they had to pay an indemnity in silver estimated at ten times annual income of king of england in four annual installments to meet these payments knights borrowed heavily confiscated gold and silver from churches and increased taxes two major prussian cities danzig gdansk and thorn torun revolted against tax increases defeat at grunwald left teutonic knights with few forces to defend their remaining territories since samogitia became officially christened as both poland and lithuania were for a long time knights had difficulties recruiting new volunteer crusaders grand masters then needed to rely on mercenary troops which proved an expensive drain on their already depleted budget internal conflicts economic decline and tax increases led to unrest and foundation of prussian confederation or alliance against lordship in 1441 this in turn led to a series of conflicts that
