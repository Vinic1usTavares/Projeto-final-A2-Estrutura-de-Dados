many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from fund in addition to its stated purpose fund was used as a last resort source of funding for nsdap which was chronically short of money at time after nsdap s success in 1930 general election where they won 107 seats party membership grew dramatically by 1932 fund was collecting 3 million reichsmarks per year bormann

beginning with hermann goring albert speer and bormann himself bormann commissioned building of kehlsteinhaus eagle s nest a tea house high above berghof as a gift to hitler on his fiftieth birthday 20 april 1939 hitler seldom used building but bormann liked to impress guests by taking them there while hitler was in residence at berghof bormann was constantly in attendance and acted as hitler s personal secretary in this capacity he began to control flow of information and access to hitler during this period hitler gave bormann control of his personal finances in addition to salaries as

of it for hitler s personal use bormann and others took notes of hitler s thoughts expressed over dinner and in monologues late into night and preserved them material was published after war as hitler s table talk office of deputy fuhrer had final approval over civil service appointments and bormann reviewed personnel files and made decisions regarding appointments this power impinged on purview of minister of interior wilhelm frick and was an example of overlapping responsibilities typical of nazi regime bormann travelled everywhere with hitler including trips to austria in 1938 after anschluss annexation of austria into nazi germany and to sudetenland after signing of munich agreement later that year bormann was placed in charge of organising 1938 nuremberg rally a major annual party event thumb upright 1 3 bormann directly to hitler s left in paris june 1940 hitler intentionally played top party members against one another and nsdap against civil service in this way he fostered distrust competition and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power he typically did not give written orders instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through bormann falling out of favour with bormann meant that access to hitler was cut off bormann proved to be a master of intricate political infighting along with his ability to control access to hitler this enabled him to curtail power of joseph goebbels goring himmler alfred rosenberg robert ley hans frank speer and other high ranking officials many of whom became his enemies this ruthless and continuous intriguing for power influence and hitler s favour came to characterise inner workings of third reich as world war ii progressed hitler s attention became focused on foreign affairs and conduct of war to exclusion of all else hess not directly engaged in either of these endeavours became increasingly sidelined from affairs of nation and from hitler s attention bormann had successfully supplanted hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at hitler s side hess was concerned that germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for operation barbarossa invasion of soviet union scheduled to take place later that year he flew solo to britain on 10 may 1941 to seek peace negotiations with british government he was arrested on arrival and spent rest of war as a british prisoner eventually receiving a life sentence for war crimes at nuremberg trials in 1946 speer later said hitler described hess departure as one of worst blows of his life as he considered it a personal betrayal hitler ordered hess to be shot should he return to germany and abolished post of deputy fuhrer on 12 may 1941 assigning hess former duties to bormann with title of head of parteikanzlei party chancellery in this position he was responsible for all nsdap appointments and was answerable only to hitler associates began to refer to him as brown eminence although never to his face bormann s power and effective reach broadened considerably during war by early 1943 war produced a labour crisis for regime hitler created a three man committee with representatives of state army and party in an attempt to centralise control of war economy committee members were hans lammers head of reich chancellery field marshal wilhelm keitel chief of oberkommando der wehrmacht armed forces high command okw and bormann who controlled party committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of wishes of various ministries with hitler reserving most final decisions to himself committee soon known as dreierausschuss committee of three met eleven times between january and august 1943 however they ran up against resistance from hitler s cabinet ministers who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from committee seeing it as a threat to their power goebbels goring and speer worked together to bring it down result was that nothing changed and committee of three declined into irrelevance anti church campaign while article 24 of national socialist program called for conditional toleration of christian denominations and a reichskonkordat reich concordat treaty with vatican was signed in 1933 purporting to guarantee religious freedom for catholics hitler believed that religion was fundamentally incompatible with national socialism bormann who was strongly anti christian agreed he stated publicly in 1941 that national socialism and christianity are irreconcilable out of political expediency hitler intended to postpone elimination of christian churches until after war however his repeated hostile statements against church indicated to his subordinates that a continuation of kirchenkampf church struggle would be tolerated and even encouraged bormann was one of leading proponents of ongoing persecution of christian churches in february 1937 he decreed that members of clergy should not be admitted to nsdap following year he ruled that any members of clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed and that any party member who was considering entering clergy had to give up his party membership while bormann s push to force closure of theological departments at reich universities was unsuccessful he was able to reduce amount of religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated removal of crucifixes from classrooms speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for welthauptstadt germania planned rebuilding of berlin he was told by bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites as part of campaign against catholic church hundreds of monasteries in germany and austria were confiscated by gestapo and their occupants were expelled in 1941 catholic bishop of munster clemens august graf von galen publicly protested against this persecution and against action t4 nazi involuntary euthanasia programme under which mentally ill physically deformed and incurably sick were to be killed in a series of sermons that received international attention he criticised programme as illegal and immoral his sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders strongest protest against a nazi policy up until that point bormann and others called for galen to be hanged but hitler and goebbels concluded that galen s death would only be viewed as a martyrdom and lead to further unrest hitler decided to deal with issue when war was over george mosse wrote of bormann s beliefs however richard overy describes bormann as an atheist personal secretary to fuhrer preoccupied with military matters and spending most of his time at his military headquarters on eastern front hitler came to rely more and more on bormann to handle domestic policies of country on 12 april 1943 hitler officially appointed bormann as personal secretary to fuhrer by this time bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters and this new appointment gave him power to act in an official capacity in any matter thumb 267px bormann behind and to hitler s right on old bridge maribor slovenia april 1941 bormann was invariably advocate of extremely harsh radical measures when it came to treatment of jews conquered eastern peoples and prisoners of war he signed decree of 31 may 1941 extending 1935 nuremberg laws to annexed territories of east thereafter he signed decree of 9 october 1942 prescribing that permanent final solution in greater germany could no longer be solved by emigration but only by use of ruthless force in special camps of east that is extermination in nazi death camps a further decree signed by bormann on 1 july 1943 gave adolf eichmann absolute powers over jews who now came under exclusive jurisdiction of gestapo historian richard j evans estimates that 5 5 to 6 million jews representing two thirds of jewish population of europe were exterminated by nazi regime in course of holocaust knowing hitler viewed slavic people as inferior bormann opposed introduction of german criminal law into conquered eastern territories he lobbied for and eventually achieved a strict separate penal code that implemented martial law for polish and jewish inhabitants of these areas edict on criminal law practices against poles and jews in incorporated eastern territories promulgated 4 december 1941 permitted corporal punishment and death sentences for even most trivial of offences bormann supported hard line approach of erich koch reichskommissar in reichskommissariat ukraine in his brutal treatment of slavic people alfred rosenberg serving as head of reich ministry for occupied eastern territories favoured a more moderate policy after touring collective farms around vinnytsia ukraine bormann was concerned about health and good physical constitution of population as he was concerned that they could constitute a danger to regime after discussion with hitler he issued a policy directive to rosenberg that read in part bormann and himmler shared responsibility for volkssturm people s militia which drafted all remaining able bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last ditch militia founded on 18 october 1944 poorly equipped and trained men were sent to fight on eastern front where nearly 175 000 of them were killed without having any discernible impact on soviet
