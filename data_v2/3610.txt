battle of kinburn a combined land naval engagement during final stage of crimean war took place on tip of kinburn peninsula on south shore of dnieper river estuary in what is now ukraine on 17 october 1855 during battle a combined fleet of vessels from french navy and british royal navy bombarded russian coastal fortifications after an anglo french ground force had besieged them three french ironclad batteries carried out main attack which saw main russian fortress destroyed in an action that lasted about three hours battle although it was strategically insignificant and had little effect on outcome of war is notable for first use of modern ironclad warships in action although frequently hit french ships destroyed russian forts within three hours suffering minimal casualties in process this battle convinced contemporary navies to abandon wooden warships and to focus on armour plating this instigated a naval arms race between france and britain that lasted for more than a decade background in september 1854 anglo french army that had been at varna was ferried across black sea and landed on crimean peninsula they then fought their way to main russian naval base on peninsula city of sevastopol which they placed under siege russian garrison eventually withdrew from city in early september 1855 freeing french and british fleets for other tasks sondhaus pp 59 61 a discussion ensued over what target should be attacked next french and british high commands considered driving from crimea to kherson and launching major campaigns in bessarabia or caucasus instead at urging of french commanders they settled on a smaller scale operation to seize russian fort at kinburn which protected mouth of dneiper british argued that to seize kinburn without advancing to nikolaev would only serve to warn russians of threat to port fox maule ramsay then british secretary of state for war suggested that without a plan to exploit capture of fortress only purpose of operation would be to give fleets something to do lambert pp 269 270 forces involved thumb left ironclad battery c 1855 fortress was located on kinburn spit at extreme western end of kinburn peninsula and consisted of three separate fortifications primary fort built of stone square and equipped with bastions held 50 guns some of which were mounted in protective casemates rest were in en barbette mountings firing over parapets two smaller fortresses were located further down spit mounting ten and eleven guns respectively first was a small stone fort while second was a simple sand earthwork forts were armed only with medium and smaller calibre guns largest guns being 24 pounders major general maxim kokhanovitch commanded garrison of 1 500 men most of whom were stationed in main fort across estuary was fort nikolaev in town of ochakov with fifteen more guns but these were too far away to play a role in battle wilson p xxxiv to attack forts british and french assembled a fleet centred on four french and six british ships of line led by british rear admiral edmund lyons and french vice admiral armand joseph bruat british contributed a further seventeen frigates and sloops ten gunboats and six bomb vessels along with ten transport vessels french squadron included three corvettes four avisos twelve gunboats and five bomb vessels wilson p xxxiii transports carried a force of 8 000 men from french and british army regiments that would be used to besiege forts in addition to contingent of conventional sailing warships french squadron brought three experimental ironclad warships that had recently arrived from france these first three ironclad batteries of and had been sent to black sea in late july but they arrived too late to take part in siege of sevastopol greene massignani p 27 these vessels first ironclad warships carried eighteen 50 pounder guns and were protected with of wrought iron armour observers speculated that these untested warships would be ineffective in combat owing to their slow speed and poor handling wilson p xxxii battle thumb upright map showing arrangement of fleet and fortifications during battle in an effort to confuse russians combined fleet made a feint westward toward odessa on 8 october before turning east to kinburn wilson pp xxxiii xxxiv combined french and british fleet arrived off kinburn on 14 october that night a force of nine gunboats escorted transports carrying 8 000 men led by francois achille bazaine who were landed behind forts further up peninsula gunboat force was commanded by rear admiral houston stewart who ordered his crews to hold their fire in darkness unless they were able to clearly see a russian target russians did not launch a counterattack on landing allowing french and british soldiers to dig trench positions while gunboats shelled main fort albeit ineffectively by morning of 17th soldiers had completed significant entrenchments with french troops facing fortifications and british troops manning outward defences against a possible russian attempt to relieve garrison by this time french had begun building sapping trenches which then came under fire from russian fortress grant pp 118 120 in meantime on night of 16th a french vessel had taken depth soundings close to main fort to determine how closely ships could approach it throughout this time heavy seas prevented fleet from launching a sustained bombardment of russian positions lambert p 271 at around 9 00 on 17 october anglo french fleet moved into position to begin their bombardment grant p 120 ships of line had a difficult time getting into effective positions owing to shoals in surrounding water and so much of work fell to smaller and shallower draught vessels most prominently three ironclad batteries floating batteries were anchored just from russian fortress where they proved to be immune to russian artillery fire which either bounced off or exploded harmlessly on their wrought iron armour plating french and british ships of line were anchored further out at around while bomb vessels were placed further still at grant p 118 while their guns battered at fortifications ironclads each had a contingent of royal marines who inflicted significant casualties on russian gun crews only significant hit on ironclad batteries was one shell that entered a gunport on devastation which killed two men but otherwise caused no serious damage to ship wilson p xxxv cannonade started fires in main fortress and rapidly disabled russian guns once russian fire started to decrease gunboats moved into position behind fortresses and began to bombard them as well in course of morning three french vessels fired some 3 000 shells into fort and by 12 00 it had been neutralized by combined firepower of anglo french fleet sondhaus p massignani p 26 a single russian hoisted a white flag above fort to indicate their surrender and kokhanovitch walked out to speak with french ground commander according to historian james grant around 1 100 russians of 1 500 man garrison survived battle and were allowed to leave without their weapons grant pp 121 123 herbert wilson puts russian casualties much lower at 45 dead and 130 wounded for french and british only men killed were two aboard devastation with a further 25 wounded all of whom were aboard floating batteries in course of battle devastation was hit 75 times while lave received 66 hits and was hit around same number of times none of ships emerged from battle with more than minor dents in their armour plate wilson p xxxvi aftermath thumb first british sea going ironclad warship on 20 october bazaine s infantry conducted reconnaissance toward kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing after they returned to kinburn french and british commanders determined that fort could be rebuilt and held through upcoming winter a force of 1 700 men was left behind to garrison position along with three ironclad batteries rest of force returned to crimea though british had initially considered continuing up dneiper to capture nikolaev it became clear after seizure of kinburn that to do so would require much larger numbers of soldiers to clear cliffs that dominated river than had been originally estimated british planned to eventually launch an offensive to take nikolaev in 1856 but war ended before it could be begun lambert p 275 since they lacked forces to take nikolaev in a single campaign seizure of kinburn proved to have limited strategic effect nevertheless attack on kinburn was significant in that it demonstrated that french and british fleets had developed effective amphibious capabilities and had technological advantages that gave them a decisive edge over their russian opponents lambert p 276 destruction of kinburn s coastal fortifications completed anglo french naval campaign in black sea russians no longer had any meaningful forces left to oppose them at sea british and french navies planned to transfer forces to baltic sea following year to strengthen operations there diplomatic pressure from still neutral austria convinced czar nicholas i of russia to sue for peace which was concluded following february with treaty of paris sondhaus pp 61 62 in his report bruat informed his superiors that e verything may be expected from these formidable engines of war effectiveness of ironclad batteries in neutralizing russian guns though still debated by naval historians nevertheless convinced french emperor napoleon iii to order more ironclad warships sondhaus p 66 their success at kinburn coupled with devastating effect new shell firing guns had had on wooden warships at battle of sinop earlier in war led most french naval officers to support new armoured vessels wilson p xxxi napoleon iii s programme produced first sea going ironclad initiating a naval construction race between france and britain that would last until outbreak of franco prussian war in 1870 british royal navy which had five ironclad batteries under construction laid down another four after victory at kinburn and replied to gloire with a pair of armoured frigates of their own and france built a further eleven batteries built to three different designs and russian navy built fifteen armoured rafts for harbour defence sondhaus pp 61 massignani pp 31 35 notes references kinburn 1855 kinburn
