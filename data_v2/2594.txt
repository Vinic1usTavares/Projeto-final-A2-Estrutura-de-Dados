file potato battery jpg thumb right arg s theme of potatoes reflected a part of portal 2s story in which game s antagonist glados is powered by a potato battery potato sack is name of an alternate reality game arg created by valve and developers of thirteen independent video games to promote release of valve s game portal 2 in april 2011 valve president gabe newell envisioned game as a cross game design event in december 2010 and allowed developers a free rein to design game using valve s portal intellectual property game requiring players to find and solve a number of puzzles hidden within updates of thirteen games led to opportunity for players to release portal 2 about 10 hours earlier than its planned release by playing games under pretense of powering up glados sentient computer antagonist from portal series arg s theme of potatoes is based on plot elements within portal 2 specifically that for part of game glados s personality module is run off a potato battery large numbers of people participated in solving puzzles reaction from players and journalists was mixed while some felt arg had limited benefit some saw arg as a show of commitment from valve to independent game development history potato sack bundle arg began without announcement with release of potato sack bundle on steam on april 1 2011 which offered included games at 75 off their normal price games included in potato sack are listed below with their developer and release year game developer release year 1 2 3 kick it drop that beat like an ugly baby dejobaan games 2011 a reckless

letter later combined with other letters to get a complete password on release date of potato sack bundle players found games within it had recently received updates most provided an immediate cosmetic change by replacing or adding assets that referred to potatoes when players started looking deeper into these new assets they discovered a series of glyphs that referred to other games associated with specific letters as well as nonsense sentences that lead to specific cyphers other hints were less direct using online services such as twitter and youtube to embed clues in case of toki tori sections of new levels included braille code that referred to latitude and longitude coordinates of two tribes headquarters one player jake r traveled to two tribes where he discovered glyphs and cyphers posted outside their headquarters several of two tribes developers upon learning of his presence began filming him from a barbershop across street they would later use this footage of him climbing a pole to find these clues as part of another clue during second phase second update on april 7 each of games in potato sack received a second major update players found that by completing certain tasks in game they would be presented with login screens for fictional aperture science corporation within steam interface other tasks and clues led to passwords that could be used to log into these aperture science screens these provided players with compressed archives of pictures that consisted of portal 2 artwork including photographs from around seattle where valve is based embedded in their alpha channels each archive included a portion of a larger archive that was password protected password was unveiled using glyphs cyphers and letters from first update larger archive gave further photographs of seattle area when locations of these points were mapped and connected per puzzle s instructions map showed word prelude furthermore players that reached and logged into these screens received a potato icon for each accessed screen on their steam profile third update thumb upright 1 3 for third update teotl studios integrated their own mayan inspired level design with portal themed aspects to create additional content for ball on april 12 another update for each game was released these updates were all portal themed such as levels based on aperture science in ball and killing floor again players found that by completing specific tasks in new content they would be presented with an aperture science screen though this time screens provided a cryptic audio clue these clues were found to be two part clues relating to previously identified locations around seattle by mapping these points using locations commonly shared by one clue players were led to name of a steam group that contained a single member by name of dinosaur a reference to an earlier arg used for portal 2s announcement screenshots within this user s profile gave a qr code that pointed to a website with a countdown time set to expire on morning of april 15 2011 players who discovered these audio clues would be awarded another potato on their steam profile a total of 36 possible potatoes were found 35 within games and referenced steam group and a 36th earned by obtaining all 35 of other potatoes concurrent with these changes portal 2 became available for pre loading on steam client at this point several journalists and players suspected that portal 2 may have been unlocked early at end of countdown timer this correlated with a separate puzzle embedded in messages sent by newell to a number of gaming sites message suggested early release of material and thirteen offsite chambers seemingly referring to independent games as well as a message 4 19 2011 7 am 4 15 2011 9 am again referencing planned portal 2 release date and countdown timer as april 15 drew near about nine heavily involved players from arg appeared to disengage from various chat rooms leaving with message there s a hole in sky through which i can fly a line used in early advertisements for portal when contacted by other players these individuals remained coy and cryptic about their actions appearing to have been infected by glados it was later revealed that these players contacted by valve a few days prior were invited to valve s headquarters to be first to play portal 2 glados home at end of countdown timer countdown website redirected to a new page on fictional aperture science website calling itself glados home spoofing other distributed computing efforts like folding home site stated that if players generated enough cpu cycles by playing thirteen games in potato sack glados would be rebooted earlier effectively suggesting an earlier release of portal 2 before originally scheduled time of 7 00 am pdt on april 19 2011 number of potatoes found would also serve to help to boost effort only one game killing floor saw an update in this phase where a special chamber in their portal themed map would be opened for players to complete for an in game achievement players organized a schedule of games to be played to maximize rate of progression and eventually ended up unlocking portal 2 on steam about ten hours before this scheduled time approximately 1800 players that had successfully earned all 36 potatoes by time of portal 2s launch were given valve complete pack including portal 2 which they could gift to other players players who had found at least thirteen potatoes or played each of potato sack games for a minimum amount of time received portal 2 themed items within team fortress 2 reunion on june 13 2012 potato sack bundle briefly returned to steam under name potato sack june 2012 development valve had previously performed an arg in week prior to announcement of portal 2 at start of march 2010 arg was initiated by a new patch to portal that led to a sequence of puzzles which were ultimately solved within hours of patch s release thumb right gabe newell president of valve is credited with concept behind potato sack arg idea of potato sack arg came from valve president gabe newell sometime around december 2010 following on success of first arg he saw a way to promote both highly anticipated portal 2 release along with several independent games through a cross game design event dejobaan games leo jaitley believed that valve targeted developers that had proven track records of working with other developers and not necessarily for sales or popularity of specific games valve invited twenty independent developers to their headquarters on december 16 though did not explain rationale for visit only there did valve explain promotion with ultimate goal being early release of portal 2 at conclusion of arg according to gaijin games ceo alex neuse according to rob jagnow of lazy 8 studios valve assured developers of an open relationship stating that they had no constraints no and that project was built on trust and mutual respect jaitley commented most studios got involved knowing that there was likely to be some payoff but without anything upfront or any promises of riches to help with arg valve gave developers a free rein over game s structure and full access to portal intellectual property to include within their games such assets included further voice work from ellen mclain voice actress for glados who recorded additional lines for developers of games to taunt players with furthermore developers were given opportunity to play what had existed of portal 2 to build ideas for arg valve and indie developers worked together over next few days to design arg creating three phases timing between phases to allow for puzzles to be solved and general fiction of game developers decided to design fiction of arg around return of glados who had been apparently destroyed at end of portal leaving clues to her revival in various games potato theme was based on portal 2s fiction in which during a portion of game glados personality is placed into a potato battery to help promote arg valve and developers arranged for potato sack sale as to make it easier for hard core fans to participate in every aspect of arg between december meeting and second gathering in march 2011 prior to arg s launch there was no direct verbal communication between valve or developers instead independent developers spent time using a shared wiki provided by valve to plan out and coordinate game they also had to develop new content for their games which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking others had to go back to older programming code and re acquaint themselves with it before undertaking new additions for arg valve s jeep barnett helped to coordinate large effort second visit to valve in march 2011 was to affirm plans for launch of arg thumb left edmund mcmillen left one of developers of super meat boy and creators of arg first update was tied with april fools day with addition of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with pranks one normally sees on that day throughout arg players were monitored by developers through internet relay chat forums and web sites that were being used to coordinate solving effort this allowed for example two tribes to prepare for jake r s visit and integration of a screenshot of chat log into one of puzzles in another example another chat room user following a red herring visited a physical location near california studio for team meat edmund mcmillen was able to arrange to meet user and give him a signed copy of super meat boy monitoring of players enabled developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow arg to progress in a timely manner while many puzzles of arg included cross game clues such as finding password for one of aperture science login screens from another game neuse felt they could have increased cross game complexity of puzzles if they had more time to plan it out developers were aided by agility of valve in its participation during second phase one of developers asked if newell would become involved in arg newell then fed image with encrypted message to media outlets valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for portal 2 which helped to point arg players in specific directions including calling some of players out by name there were points during arg that players used unexpected means to solve a puzzle but developers and player community worked around these issues in some cases players attempted to download beta versions of patches to games but valve was able to respond usually in minutes to block access to these valve also quickly responded to a web site that used steam credentials to award players potatoes without having to complete target achievements only about 1 of potatoes were earned this way and valve later revoked them though let players earn them again though legitimate means other players examined files and binary code of patched games to try to find password strings or other identifiers that would normally be seen only while playing game in at least one case where this action served to reveal solution to puzzle before it was truly solved arg players discouraged this behavior and apologized to valve for these actions when possible developers laid red herrings for those that tried to hack arg including use of jagnow commented on several changes developers would have made in hindsight after completion of arg one aspect he considered was weak part of fiction of arg something he believed they would have integrated more in game from start release of potato sack on april 1 may have been a bad decision according to jagnow as they did not get press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with other april fool s events occurring that day with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later in third phase where certain players were taken over by glados jagnow felt they extracted these players from game too early as they were influential in coordinating chat rooms and wiki leaving remaining players confused instead jagnow suggested they should have found a way to allow these players to continue participating until near end jagnow considered push of crescendo of arg appearance of glados home to have been biggest failing originally scheduled for april 16 or 17 it was pushed to april 15 to allow more players including international ones to participate in effort to release portal 2 early and to gain media attention instead developers found that existing players of arg were frustrated with no new puzzles to solve while new players brought to site by media were skeptical and saw event as a cheap media ploy to get players to buy potato sack in hope of an early portal 2 release reception overall alternate reality game received mixed response from gamers some praising it as outstanding marketing between portal 2 and indie gamers others considering it a way to force players to buy games they do not want to gain access to portal 2 earlier pete davison of gamepro considered it a risky marketing move that relied on valve s long standing reputation with community to build on their trust as well as a hugely positive sign of support for indie games from company david of forbes considered tactic a huge benefit for indie developers whose games led steam sales charts in weeks leading to portal 2s release ben kuchera of ars technica noted that it was entirely possible to ignore alternate reality game without any negative effects or losing any potential benefits luke plunkett of kotaku was more critical commenting that for most players in north america having release only ten hours earlier occurring overnight for many would be business as usual in that they would not be able to play until next day thus players that purchased and spent time in potato sack games may have simply wasted their money for something they didn t want to gain almost nothing back leigh alexander of gamasutra also criticized arg for not providing an idea of expectation of reward when it was successfully completed comparing ten hour gain to a vignette in movie a christmas story where main character after saving up money and waiting weeks for a secret decoder ring to decipher a message from a radio program finds that coded message is only an advertising blurb alexander suggested that instead args should give players an idea of type of reward that may be offered and then can exceed player s expectations when it is completed retailers in countries where disc based version of game would have lagged a few days behind steam release opted to break their street date to avoid losing sales to digital downloads though direct sales from steam are unknown potato sack arg helped to boost sales of independent games whole potato sack promotion was second highest selling compilation on steam in week prior to portal 2s release following portal 2 itself and ahead of potato sack portal 2 bundle dylan fitterer programmer for audiosurf noted that during promotion more than 6000 people were playing his game at a time compared to 300 players before event fitterer also saw an opportunity to create a new game based upon arg themed addition to audiosurf ichiro lambe of dejobaan games was also pleased with sales increased while not a windfall it helped him to continue to live comfortably thomas grip of frictional games claimed that boost of sales for amnesia within first two days of potato sack sale completely covered development costs for added justine content they had developed for arg john gibson of tripwire interactive believed that similar args could be run in future without presence of a major title like portal 2 as long as there is a significant payoff for players journalists noted that many of user reviews for portal 2 on metacritic evoked negative opinion of game believed to be tied to minimal impact on portal 2 s release time these users cited complaints about game being too short with some saying it is only four hours long existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions and supposed evidence that game on microsoft windows and mac os x were ports of console version journalists have defended valve in these claims countering that game s length depends on amount of immersion player puts into game that downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for co op mode and that quality of graphics on windows and mac version do not suggest a simple console port references external links glados home valve arg network category promotional alternate reality games category portal video game
