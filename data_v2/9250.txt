ounce and by 1643 only one third of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in

graduates by 16th century maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade 4 and above were exempt from scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over 4 000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years chief instructor on prefectural level was classified as equal to a second grade county graduate of imperial instruction oversaw education of heir apparent

performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank one great advantage of lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and

scholar officials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely merit based and confucian values that dictated those who chose profession of violence wu over cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after 1478 military even held their own examinations to test military

arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st paul s college on macau after its founding in 1579 most influential was matteo ricci whose map of myriad countries of world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with convert xu guangqi led to first chinese translation of euclid s elements in 1607 discovery of a nestorian stele at xi an in 1625 also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to nanjing incident of 1616 which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by chinese astronomers including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de and a return by jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in confucian mold restored their fortunes however by end of ming dominicans had begun chinese rites controversy in

since zhu xi during ming dynasty neo confucian doctrines of song scholar zhu xi were embraced by court and chinese literati at large although direct line of his school was destroyed by yongle emperor s extermination of ten degrees of kinship of fang in 1402 ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming 1472 1529 whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xi s concept of extension of knowledge or gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone no matter their pedigree or education could become as wise as confucius and had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized classics but not experienced real world conservative reaction thumb a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholar bureaucrats were wary of wang s heterodoxy increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question validity of social hierarchy and idea that scholar should be above farmer wang yangming s disciple and salt mine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he challenged elevation and emphasis of family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by censorate and by donglin academy re established in 1604 these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu 1550 1612 argued against wang s idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among

were becoming less isolated as distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within walls of a city not only was blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in traditional four occupations chinese since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into city to find work during times of dearth a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a father s line of work this would include but was not limited to coffin makers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodle makers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a proto banking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in south myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although south had characteristic of wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more owner cultivators north of huai river due to harsher climate living not far above subsistence level early ming dynasty saw strictest sumptuary laws in chinese history it was illegal for commoners to wear fine silk or dress in bright red dark green or yellow colors nor could they wear boots or guan hats women could not use ornaments made from gold jade pearl or emerald merchants and their families were further banned from using silk however these laws were no longer enforced from middle ming period onwards science and technology

heliocentric model of solar system was rejected by catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galilei s ideas slowly trickled into china starting with polish jesuit michael boym 1612 59 in 1627 adam schall von bell s treatise in 1640 and finally joseph alex wylie and john fryer in 19th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at same time embrace ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until 1865 that catholic missionaries in china sponsored heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo 1031 95 and guo shoujing 1231 1316 had laid basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until 1607 with efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during late ming for example field mill chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured solar year at 365 1 4 days giving an error of 10 min and 14 sec a year or roughly a full day every 128 years although ming had adopted guo shoujing s calendar of 1281 which was just as accurate as gregorian calendar ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in ming and statutes of ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixth generation descendant of hongxi emperor prince zhu zaiyu 1536 1611 submitted a proposal to fix calendar in 1595 but ultra conservative astronomical commission rejected it this was same zhu zaiyu who discovered system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin 1548 1620 in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on calendar in 1597 a year earlier memorial of xing suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by supervisor of

of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by divisional director of ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on architecture and layout of yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that 16th century european clockworks were far more advanced than common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese chinese records namely yuan shi describe five wheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl 1360 80 which featured scoop wheel of su song s earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of time this sand driven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou fl 1530 58 who added a

while enjoying beauty of plum sinologist historians debate population figures for each era in ming dynasty historian timothy brook notes that ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout ming even adult women were underreported for example daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of 378 167 males and 226 982 females in 1502 government attempted to revise census figures using estimates of expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve widespread problem of tax registration some part of gender imbalance may be attributed to practice of female infanticide practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding 2 1 by 1586 cannot likely be explained by infanticide alone thumb upright xuande emperor r 1425 35 he stated in 1428 that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen governor of south zhili in his 1432 report to throne about widespread itinerant commerce number of people counted in census of 1381 was 59 873 305 however this number dropped significantly when government found that some 3 million people were missing from tax census of 1391 even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381 need for survival pushed many to abandon tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on populace government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60 545 812 people in 1393 in his studies on population of china ho ping ti suggests revising 1393 census to 65 million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that population figures gathered in official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million while population was in fact increasing even hongzhi emperor r 1487 505 remarked that daily increase in subjects coincided with daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around 1400 population of china was perhaps 90 million people citing and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using gazetteers brook estimates that overall population under chenghua emperor r 1464 1487 was roughly 75 million despite mid ming census figures hovering around 62 million while prefectures across empire in mid ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or wood cutters that contributed to deforestation hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened penalties against those who had fled their home region while jiajing emperor r 1521 67 finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by late ming era government census still did not accurately reflect enormous growth in population gazetteers across empire noted this and made their own estimations of overall population in ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since 1368 fairbank estimates that population was perhaps 160 million in late ming dynasty while brook estimates 175 million and ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million however a great epidemic that entered china through northwest in 1641 ravaged densely populated areas along grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half population fell ill that year and
