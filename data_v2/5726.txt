by william a wellman with an original orchestral score by john stepan which was uncredited it was rewritten to accommodate clara bow as she was paramount s biggest star but wasn t happy about her part wings is a man s picture and i m just whipped cream on top of pie producers lucien hubbard and jesse l lasky hired director wellman as he was only director in hollywood at time who had world war i combat pilot experience actor richard arlen and writer john monk saunders had also served in world war i as military aviators arlen was able to do his own flying in film and rogers a non pilot underwent flight training during course of production so that like arlen rogers could also be filmed in closeup in air lucien hubbard offered flying lessons to all and despite number of aircraft in air only two incidents occurred one involved stunt pilot dick grace while other was fatal crash of a united states army air corps pilot wellman was able to attract war department support and involvement in project and displayed considerable prowess and confidence in dealing with planes and pilots onscreen knowing exactly what he wanted bringing with it a no nonsense attitude according to military film historian lawrence h filming aerial and battle sequences thumb right a thomas morse mb 3 at selfridge field one of types of planes used in film wings was shot and completed on a budget of 2 million at kelly field san antonio texas between september 7 1926 and april 7 1927 primary scout aircraft flown in film were thomas morse mb 3s standing in for american flown and curtiss p 1 hawks painted in german livery developing techniques needed for filming closeups of pilots in air and capturing speed and motion of planes onscreen took time and little usable footage was produced in first two months wellman soon realized that kelly field did not have adequate numbers of planes or skilled pilots to perform needed aerial maneuvers and he had to request technical assistance and a supply of planes and pilots from washington air corps sent six planes and pilots from 1st pursuit group stationed at selfridge field near detroit including 2d lt clarence s bill irvine who became wellman s adviser irvine was responsible for engineering an airborne camera system to provide close ups and for planning of dogfights and when one of pilots broke his neck performed in one of battle scenes himself hundreds of extras were brought in to shoot picture and some 300 pilots were involved in filming because aerial battles required ideal weather to shoot production team had to wait on one occasion for 18 consecutive days for proper conditions in san antonio if possible wellman attempted to capture footage in air in contrast to clouds in background above or in front of cloud banks to generate a sense of velocity and danger wellman later explained motion on screen is a relative thing a horse runs on ground or leaps over fencers or streams we know he is going rapidly because of his relation to immobile ground against clouds wellman enabled planes to dart at each other and to swoop down and disappear in clouds and to give audience sense of disabled planes plummeting during delay in aerial shooting wellman extensively rehearsed scenes for battle of saint mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen a large battlefield with trenches and barbed wire was created on location for filming wellman took responsibility for meticulously planned explosions himself detonating them at right time from his control panel according to peter hopkinson at least 20 young men including cameraman william clothier were given hand held cameras to film anything and everything during filming wellman frequently conflicted with military officers brought in to supervise picture especially infantry commander whom he considered to have two monumental hatreds fliers and movie people after one argument wellman retorted to commander you re just a goddamn fool because government has told me you have to give me all your men and do just exactly what i want you to do although wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting he used cars and clothing of year during filming forgetting to use those of world war i he took six weeks to fully edit film and prepare it for release cast exploits thumb left clara bow whereas most hollywood productions of day took little more than a month to shoot wings took approximately nine months to complete in total although wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making hollywood film history paramount expressed concerns with cost of production and expanding budget they sent an executive to san antonio to complain to wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options a trip home or a trip to hospital according to biographer frank t thompson wellman approached producer david o selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which selznick replied just keep your mouth shut you ve got em where it hurts otto kahn financier production arrived on set as wellman was filming st mihiel battle sequence inadvertently disrupted wellman s detonation timings and caused several extras to be seriously injured wellman loudly and ordered kahn off set that evening kahn visited wellman in his hotel room told him he was impressed with his direction and he could have whatever he needed to finish picture brownlow gill episode hollywood goes to war 1980 cast and crew had a lot of time on their hands between shooting sequences and according to director wellman san antonio became armageddon of a magnificent sexual donnybrook he recalled that they stayed at saint anthony hotel for nine months and by time they left elevator girls were all pregnant he stated that clara bow openly flirted with male cast members and several of pilots which was reciprocated despite having become engaged to victor fleming day after arriving in san antonio on september 16 1926 gary cooper appearing in a role which helped launch his career in hollywood began a tumultuous affair during production with bow cooper reportedly showed howard hughes script to film and he was not impressed considering drama in it to be sudsy although he informed cooper that he looked forward to seeing how wellman would accomplish technical aerial sequences bow strongly detested costumes which were made for film by paramount designer travis banton and slit necklines and cut off sleeves of his clothing much to chagrin of banton memorable scenes wings is also one of first widely released films to show nudity in enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams who can be seen from behind through a door which is opened and closed bow s breasts are revealed for a second during paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing her clothes in scene in which rogers becomes drunk intoxication displayed on screen was genuine as although 22 years of age he had never tasted liquor

film wellman dedicated film to those young warriors of sky whose wings are folded about them forever a sneak preview was shown may 19 1927 at texas theater on houston street in san antonio premiere was held at criterion theater in new york city on august 12 1927 and was screened for 63 weeks before being moved to second run theaters original paramount release of wings was color tinted and had some sequences in an early widescreen process known as also used in 1926 paramount film old ironsides original release also had aerial scenes use handschiegl color process for flames and explosions some prints had synchronized sound effects and music using general electric later rca sound on film process wings was an immediate success upon release and became yardstick against which successive aviation films were measured for years thereafter in terms of authenticity of combat and scope of production one of reasons for its resounding popularity was public infatuation with aviation in wake of charles lindbergh s transatlantic flight air corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with end product critical response was equally enthusiastic and film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess despite a superficial plot an aviation picnic as gene brown called it combat scenes of film were so realistic that one writer studying film in early 1970s was wondering if wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during world war i one critic observed exceptional quality of wings lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of at least some of actualities of flying under wartime conditions another wrote nothing in line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage as a spectacle wings is a technical triumph it piles punch upon punch until spectator is almost nervously exhausted mordaunt hall of new york times praised cinematography of flying scenes and direction and acting of entire cast in his review dated august 13 1927 hall notes only two criticisms one slight on richard arlen s performance and of ending which he described as like so many screen stories much too sentimental and there is far more of it than one wants accolades on may 16 1929 first academy award ceremony was held at hotel roosevelt in hollywood to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 1928 wings was entered in a number of categories and was first film to win academy award for best picture then called best picture production and best engineering effects for roy pomeroy for year sunrise a song of two humans which won unique and artistic production was considered an equal top winner of night but following year academy dropped unique and artistic production award and decided retroactively that award won by wings was highest honor that could be awarded statuette not yet known as oscar was presented by douglas fairbanks to clara bow on behalf of producers adolph zukor and b
