principal habitat of upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland heath and blanket bog while in lowland sections hedgerows marking boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife way also passes monastic city at glendalough founded in 6th century by saint kevin wicklow way was originally proposed by j b malone in a series of newspaper articles in 1966 in 1977 malone was appointed to long distance walking routes committee of national sports council and set about making concept a reality malone s original proposal for a circular route around wicklow was dropped in favour of linear route that exists today because government wanted wicklow way to form part of a network of walking routes around country first section opened in 1980 and trail was fully completed in 1982 it became first of many national waymarked trails to be developed in ireland there are now over forty such trails covering a distance of over way forms part of european walking route e8 which stretches from atlantic coast of county cork to istanbul in turkey a memorial to j b malone who died in 1989 was erected on wicklow way near lough tay in honour of his contribution provision of and access to routes through countryside used by wicklow way is dependent on agreement with local authorities and landowners accordingly route has been criticised for excessive use of routes through forestry plantations and roads proposals to address these issues were put forward in a review of national waymarked trails published in 2010 history concept of a long distance trail through county wicklow was first published by j b malone 1914 1989 in a series of newspaper articles in 1966 malone had a regular column on walking in wicklow in evening herald newspaper and had published two books open road 1950 and walking in wicklow 1964 on subject as well as contributing to rte television series mountain and meadow 1962 he proposed a circular route dubbed twelve days of wicklow which he considered to be a journey comparable to that along celebrated pennine way but i would say more varied than its north british counterpart route consisted of twelve stages beginning at bohernabreena near tallaght dublin 24 and ending at stepaside county dublin as follows bohernabreena to baltyboys near valleymount via baltyboys to ballinclea near donard via hollywood ballinclea to aghavannagh via lugnaquilla summit a rest day at aghavannagh aghavannagh to tinahely a circular day route beginning and ending in tinahely via shillelagh tinahely to avoca avoca to glenmalure via glenmalure to glendalough a rest day at glendalough glendalough to knockree and knockree to stepaside in 1977 malone was appointed by john bruton t d then parliamentary secretary to minister for education to a committee to develop rural pathways in ireland this evolved into long distance walking routes committee ldwrc of national sports council where malone acting as field officer set about developing a scheme for a wicklow way along lines of what he had proposed twelve years earlier government s decision to develop a series of walking routes was prompted in response to development of ulster way in northern ireland malone s original concept of a circular route returning to dublin via west wicklow was dropped in favour of linear path between marlay park and clonegal that exists today mainly because government wanted wicklow way to form part of national network of trails to cover ireland issues regarding access were another reason nevertheless route remains substantially as planned in 1966 in developing route ldwrc made use of many existing paths tracks and forest roads but having no compulsory powers to include any of these provision of and access to such routes was and continues to be achieved by agreement with local authorities and landowners thumb right walking man on wicklow way first section of way from marlay park to luggala was opened by jim tunney t d minister of state for education on 15 august 1980 second section from luggala to moyne was opened by michael keating t d minister of state for education on 27 september 1981 final stretch as far as clonegal was completed in 1982 irish name of wicklow way is not a literal translation but means new cuala way a reference to one of five ancient routes that radiated from hill of tara that ran through land of cuala modern day wicklow route of wicklow way has been altered on a number of occasions since opening in 1980 generally as a result of problems with erosion or difficulties with rights of way for instance concerns about erosion led to way being diverted away from fairy castle summit of two rock mountain similarly way was also diverted away from summit of mullacor which at was highest point on way before trail was rerouted in 1999 way was diverted away from village of laragh on foot of an objection by a local landowner to chagrin of businesses in village dependent on custom of walking tourists a number of information boards and stone landmarks were erected in 2006 to mark 25th anniversary of opening of way state owned forestry company coillte has in recent years worked with a number of tourism and voluntary bodies to upgrade sections of way that run through its lands today wicklow way is managed by wicklow outdoor recreation committee wicklow way was first waymarked way to be opened in ireland ldwrc now national trails advisory committee of irish sports council went on to develop many more long distance walking routes intention at time being to develop a walking route around ireland there are now more than forty national waymarked trails comprising over of trails in ireland usage and criticism thumb left wicklow way has been criticised for its monotonous forest paths on account of being first to be developed in ireland and also on account of its proximity to dublin wicklow way is one of most popular of ireland s national waymarked trails it has however been subject to some criticisms since access to lands along way is on a permissive basis much of walk is on tarred country roads is highly dependent on access provided by state is on land owned by coillte and is on land owned by wicklow mountains national park and covers a relatively small amount of private land most of road walking is confined to southernmost section of way between tinahely and clonegal where some 63 of route is on roads research by wicklow uplands council showed that while up to 24 000 people a year walk along busiest sections this number falls to under 2 500 a year on stretches south of glenmalure extensive use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism authors of lonely planet guidebook walking in ireland found way s one shortcoming is character of walking you ll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations where they re surrounded by tall dense forest they re not particularly interesting similarly paul gosling who walked way for independent found that while long distance path is on occasion very attractive it is not so much hazardous as unadventurous over next four and a half days we lost our enthusiasm for conifers views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife in irish times john g o dwyer described them as gloomy trails through invading armies of monoculture as memorable as a motorway median a review of national waymarked trails in ireland by national trails office in 2010 acknowledged these shortcomings and recommended that wicklow way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a national long distance trail this is a proposed new standard of trail in ireland intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails it would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10 of total trail and for appropriate support services accommodation meals transport luggage transfer etc to be available review also recommended development of shorter looped walks off wicklow way and improving parking facilities route wicklow way is waymarked in both directions and can be started at marlay park or clonegal trail is marked
