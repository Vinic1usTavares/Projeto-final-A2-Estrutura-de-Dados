his invitation by british admiralty to join james cook s second expedition to pacific 1772 75 georg forster joined his father in expedition again and was appointed as a draughtsman to his father johann reinhold forster s task was to work on a scientific report of journey s discoveries that was to be published after their return they embarked hms resolution on july 13 1772 in plymouth ship s route led first to south atlantic then through indian ocean and southern ocean to islands of polynesia and finally around cape horn back to england returning on july 30 1775 during three year journey explorers visited new zealand tonga islands new caledonia tahiti marquesas islands and easter island they went further south than anybody before them almost discovering antarctica journey conclusively disproved terra australis incognita theory which claimed there was a big habitable continent in south supervised by his father georg forster first undertook studies of zoology and of southern seas mostly by drawing animals and plants however georg also pursued his own interests which led to completely independent explorations in comparative geography and ethnology he quickly learned languages of polynesian islands his reports on people of polynesia are well regarded today as they describe inhabitants of southern islands with empathy sympathy and largely without western or christian bias ackerknecht pp 85 86 thumb resolution and adventure in bay by william hodges unlike louis antoine de bougainville whose reports from a journey to tahiti a few years earlier had initiated uncritical noble savage romanticism forster developed a sophisticated picture of societies of south pacific islands ackerknecht pp 86 87 he described various social structures and religions that he encountered on society islands easter island and in tonga and new zealand and ascribed this diversity to difference in living conditions of these people at same time he also observed that languages of these fairly widely scattered islands were similar about inhabitants of islands in ha apai island group of present day tonga he wrote that their languages vehicles weapons furniture clothes tattoos style of beard in short all of their being matched perfectly with what he had already seen while studying tribes on tongatapu however he wrote we could not observe any subordination among them though this had strongly characterised natives of tonga who seemed to descend even to servility in their obeisance to king forster georg a voyage round world book ii chapter viii journey was rich in scientific results however relationship between forsters and cook and his officers was often problematic due to elder forster s fractious temperament as well as cook s refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with forsters saine p 22 founder of modern travel literature thumb one of forster s many illustrations of birds now extinct tanna ground dove also known as forster s dove of tanna these conflicts continued after journey with problem of who should write official account of travels lord sandwich although willing to pay promised money was irritated with johann reinhold forster s opening chapter and tried to have it edited however forster did not want to have his writing corrected like a theme of a school boy and stubbornly refused any compromise as a result official account was written by cook and forsters were deprived of right to compile account and did not obtain payment for their work during negotiations younger forster decided to release an unofficial account of their travels in 1777 his book a voyage round world in his britannic majesty s sloop resolution commanded by capt james cook during years 1772 3 4 and 5 was published this report was first account of cook s second voyage it appeared six weeks before official publication and was intended for general public english version and his own translation into german published 1778 80 earned young author real fame poet christoph martin wieland praised book as most important one of his time and even today it remains one of most important journey descriptions ever written book also had a significant impact on german literature culture and science influencing such scientists as alexander von humboldt and it inspired many ethnologists of later times forster wrote well polished german prose which was not only scientifically accurate and objective but also exciting and easy to read this differed from conventional travel literature of time insofar as it presented more than a mere collection of data it also demonstrated coherent colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation he often interrupted description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations his main focus was always on people he encountered their behavior customs habits religions and forms of social organization in a voyage round world he even presented songs sung by people of polynesia complete with lyrics and notation book is one of most important sources concerning societies of southern pacific from times before european influence had become significant both forsters also published descriptions of their south pacific travels in berlin based magazin von neuen magazine of strange new travel accounts and georg published a translation of a voyage to south sea by lieutenant william bligh london 1792 in 1791 93 forster at universities publication of a voyage round world brought forster scientific recognition all over europe respectable royal society made him a member on january 9 1777 though he was not even 23 years old he was granted similar titles from academies ranging from berlin to madrid these appointments however were unpaid in 1778 he went to germany to take a teaching position as a natural history professor at collegium carolinum in kassel where he met therese heyne daughter of classicist christian gottlob heyne she later became one of first independent female writers in germany they married in 1785 which was after he left kassel and had three children but their marriage was not happy from his time in kassel on forster actively corresponded with important figures of enlightenment including lessing herder wieland and goethe he also initiated cooperation between carolinum in kassel and university of gottingen where his friend georg christoph lichtenberg worked together they founded and published scientific and literary journal magazin der wissenschaften und litteratur saine p 27 forster s closest friend samuel thomas von arrived in kassel shortly after forster and both were soon involved with rosicrucians in kassel where forster took secret name amadeus however by 1783 forster saw that his involvement with rosicrucians not only led him away from real science but also deeper into p 33 it is said he was not good at money for these reasons forster was happy to accept a proposal by polish lithuanian commonwealth commission of national education and became chair of natural history at vilnius university in 1784 reintjes p 50 initially he was accepted well in vilnius but he felt more and more isolated with time most of his contacts were still with scientists in germany especially notable is his dispute with immanuel kant about definition of race saine pp 43 48 in 1785 forster traveled to halle where he submitted his thesis on plants of south pacific for a doctorate in medicine back in vilnius forster s ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from authorities in polish lithuanian commonwealth moreover his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843 these events led to high tensions between him and local community eventually he broke contract six years short of its completion as catherine ii of russia had offered him a place on a journey around world expedition for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in saint petersburg this resulted in a conflict between forster and influential polish scientist jedrzej sniadecki however russian proposal was withdrawn and forster left vilnius he then settled in mainz where he became head librarian of university of mainz a position held previously by his friend johannes von muller who made sure forster would succeed him when muller moved to administration of elector friedrich karl josef von saine p 59 forster regularly published essays on contemporary explorations and continued to be a very prolific translator for instance he wrote about cook s third journey to south pacific and about bounty expedition as well as translating cook s and bligh s diaries from these journeys into german from his london years forster was in contact with sir joseph banks initiator of bounty expedition and a participant in cook s first journey while at university of vilnius he wrote article und die colonie in botany bay published in allgemeines historisches taschenbuch berlin december 1786 an essay on future prospects of english colony founded in new south wales in 1788 another interest of his was indology one of main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by catherine ii had been to reach india he translated sanskrit play shakuntala using a latin version provided by sir william jones this strongly influenced herder and triggered german interest in culture of india ackerknecht p 85 views from lower rhine thumb left one of entrances of cologne cathedral which was praised in ansichten vom niederrhein in second quarter of 1790 forster and young alexander von humboldt started from mainz on a long journey through southern netherlands united provinces and england eventually finishing in paris impressions from journey were described in a three volume publication ansichten vom niederrhein von

said about book one wants after one has finished reading to start it over and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer book includes comments on history of art that were as influential for discipline as a voyage round world was for ethnology forster was for example one of first writers who gave just treatment to gothic architecture of cologne cathedral saine p 103 which was widely perceived as barbarian at that time book conformed well to early romantic intellectual movements in german speaking europe forster s main interest however was again focused on social behavior of people as 15 years earlier in pacific national uprisings in flanders and brabant and revolution in france sparked his curiosity journey through these regions together with netherlands and england where citizens freedoms were equally well developed in end helped him to resolve his own political opinions from that time on he was to be a confident opponent of ancien regime with other german scholars he welcomed outbreak of revolution as a clear consequence of enlightenment as early as july 30 1789 shortly after he heard about storming of bastille he wrote to his father in law philologist christian gottlob heyne that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people s minds and then had realized in state to educate people about their rights in this way he wrote was after all surest way rest would then result as if by itself life as a revolutionary foundation of mainz republic thumb right a liberty pole a symbol of revolutionary france as used in republic of mainz watercolor by johann wolfgang von goethe french revolutionary army under general custine gained control over mainz on october 21 1792 two days later forster joined others in establishing a jacobin club called freunde der freiheit und friends of freedom and equality in electoral palace from early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing mainz republic this first republic located on german soil was constituted on principles of democracy and encompassed areas on left bank of rhine between landau and bingen forster became vice president of republic s temporary administration and a candidate in elections to local parliament rhenish german national convention from january to march 1793 he was an editor of new mainz newspaper or people s friend a name chosen in reference to marat s das der freiheit p 33 in his first article he wrote this freedom did not last long though mainz republic existed only until retreat of french troops in july 1793 after siege of mainz forster was not present in mainz during siege as representatives of mainz national convention he and adam lux had been sent to paris to apply for mainz which was unable to exist as an independent state to become a part of french republic application was accepted but had no effect since mainz was conquered by prussian and austrian troops and old order was restored forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in paris death in revolutionary paris thumb pinnacle of liberty a satire by james gillray based on a decree by emperor francis ii inflicting punishments on german subjects who collaborated with french revolutionary government forster was declared an outlaw and placed under imperial ban a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to germany saine p 154 devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife who had stayed in mainz with their children and her later husband ludwig ferdinand huber he remained in paris at this point revolution in paris had entered reign of terror introduced by committee of public safety under rule of maximilien robespierre forster had opportunity to experience difference between promises of revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice in contrast to many other german supporters of revolution like for instance friedrich schiller forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under pressure of terror he viewed events in france as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive saine p 152 before reign of terror reached its climax forster died after a rheumatic p 136 in his small attic apartment at rue des moulins in paris in january 1794 at age of thirty nine at time he was making plans to visit india views on nations and their culture forster had partial scottish roots and was born in polish royal prussia and therefore was by birth a polish subject he worked in russia england poland and in several german countries of his time finally he finished his life in france he worked in different milieus and traveled a lot from his youth on it was his view that this together with his scientific upbringing based on principles of enlightenment gave him a wide perspective on different ethnic and national communities thumb johann reinhold forster and georg forster in tahiti by john francis rigaud 1780 in his opinion all human beings have same abilities with regard to reason feelings and imagination but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations according to him it is obvious that culture on tierra del fuego is at a lower level of development than european culture but he also admits that conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture based on these opinions he was classified as one of main examples of 18th century german cosmopolitanism in contrast to attitude expressed in these writings and to his enlightenment background he used insulting terms expressing prejudice against poles in his private letters during his stay in vilnius and in a diary from journey through poland but he never published any manifestation of this attitude these insults only became known after his death when his private correspondence and diaries were released to public since forster s published descriptions of other nations were seen as impartial scientific observations forster s disparaging description of poland in his letters and diaries was often taken at face value in imperial and nazi germany where it was used as a means of science based support for a purported german superiority spreading of polnische wirtschaft polish economy stereotype is most likely due to influence of his letters forster s attitude brought him into conflict with people of different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere as he was too revolutionary and for germans proud and opposing in his dealings with englishmen too unconcerned about polish science for poles and too insignificant politically and ignored while in france legacy after forster s death his works were mostly forgotten except in professional circles this was partly due to his involvement in french revolution however his reception changed with politics of times with different periods focusing on different parts of his work in period of rising nationalism after napoleonic era he was regarded in germany as a traitor to his country overshadowing his work as an author and scientist this attitude rose even though philosopher karl wilhelm friedrich schlegel wrote about forster at beginning of 19th century some interest in forster s life and revolutionary actions was revived in context of liberal sentiments leading up to 1848 revolution saine introduction but he was largely forgotten in germany of wilhelm ii and more so in third reich where interest in forster was limited to his stance on poland from his private letters interest in forster resumed in 1960s in east germany where he was interpreted as a champion of class struggle gdr research station in antarctica that was opened on october 25 1987 was named after him in west germany search for democratic traditions in german history also lead to a more diversified picture of him in 1970s alexander von humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him his reputation as one of first and most outstanding german ethnologists is indisputable and his works are seen as crucial in development of ethnology in germany into a separate branch of science ethnographical items collected by georg and johann
