feminine clothing geeta kapoor in song na meri hiroo johar in cameo as a college professor walking down steps of college when anjali wears feminine clothing production story after experience of assisting and acting in aditya chopra s directorial debut romance film dilwale dulhania le jayenge karan johar was encouraged to try his own hand at directing with kuch kuch hota hai he chose to pair up same lead actors shah rukh khan and kajol for his own romance film they were signed by producer and his father yash johar in early 1997 during filming of dilwale dulhania le jayenge khan had also encouraged johar to make his own film and said that he would be willing to star in it johar first wrote a story which was a love triangle between a tomboy a very pretty girl and a slightly insensitive boy but he shelved idea because he was not very satisfied with it then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child which he shelved as well eventually he decided to merge two stories into one he explained in an interview with rediff com it was about trauma of a widower and his little child how child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father s life then i thought why not bring a youth aspect to story why not a flashback that s how story got made story also includes a personal desires vs parental loyalties theme and has some east meets west themes but instead of characters going abroad it creates a virtual west inside india development karan johar was certain from beginning that he wanted to cast shah rukh khan in lead role having observed him during making of dilwale dulhania le jayenge it took longer to fill role of tina role was written with twinkle khanna in mind but she turned it down other actresses such as tabu shilpa shetty urmila matondkar aishwarya rai raveena tandon and karisma kapoor were offered role but also turned it down aditya chopra and shah rukh khan noticed rani mukerji s beauty and acting talent in raja ki and suggested her to karan johar he thus signed her giving a boost to her career saif ali khan ajay devgan and singh were initially offered role of aman but they all turned it down thus prompting johar to rope in salman khan johar who is also a costume designer wanted to set a new level for style in hindi cinema with this film he and his friend manish malhotra film s costume designer made trips to london for costumes much to chagrin of his father and producer yash johar who was concerned about budget many of costumes in film prominently displayed logos from designers such as dkny and polo in addition to designer fashions johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where students speak and enjoy a pristine college campus where there is no crime or hate and traditional hindu values are pervasive johar admitted that look and feel of college scenes in film were patterned after beverly hills 90210 saying art costumes tilt toward west but soul of film is indian he hired sharmishta roy as art director and told her to produce something similar to riverdale high school of archie comics with some 90210 influence as well johar said of outcome if you see kkhh shahrukh plays archie rani mukherji plays veronica and kajol played betty it was exactly that and principal looked like and ms grundy was archana puran singh johar also hired farah khan to do choreography jatin lalit to provide music santosh thundiyil as cinematographer and nikhil advani as his associate director khan assisted manish malhotra with costume design filming filming began on 21 october 1997 crew was young and inexperienced to point where shah rukh khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming khan later said karan makes no bones of fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made biggest hit of decade entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in mauritius title song was filmed over a ten day period in several picturesque locations in scotland including eilean donan glen coe loch lomond and tantallon castle with nearby bass rock as a backdrop in one scene scenes from summer camp in shimla were filmed at wenlock downs in ooty tamil nadu during bicycle sequence in yeh hai deewana song kajol lost control of her bike fell flat on her face and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee during promotional making of kuch kuch hota hai tv special kajol stated that accident was her most memorable part of shooting film because she doesn t remember it making of kuch kuch hota hai event occurs from 15 55 to 16 25 during preparation for reunion scene where two leads met after more than 8 years apart director told them to improvise and rehearse reactions that they might use but he secretly taped them and

second place in a similar poll conducted by bbc first place being taken by dilwale dulhania le jayenge an album which was also composed by jatin lalit while film was still untitled javed akhtar was signed to write lyrics and even wrote and recorded one song however when movie was titled kuch kuch hota hai he found title mediocre obscene and vulgar and decided to quit project akhtar later regretted leaving film as he found it decent and could see that title has become quite a buzz word realizing that he was only one who disliked title release critical reception while comparing film to dil to pagal hai of 1997 nikhat kazmi of times of india gave kuch kuch hota hai 3 5 out of 5 stars she especially liked performance of kajol and thought that film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its mtv ambiance and valentine day flavours on negative side she said second half however gets drowned in a sea of emotions too many people begin to cry a bit too much anish khanna of planet bollywood rated film 9 5 out of 10 stars calling it pure escapist cinema at its best he praised cinematography choreography set decoration and also raved over kajol s performance along with her onscreen chemistry with shah rukh khan overall he said karan johar makes an impressive directorial debut has a good script sense and knows how to make a film with s t y l e in contrast to these views reaction of sujata c j writing for rediff com was that film was very disappointing with many cliches and a bad story line though santosh thundiyil and sharmishta roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction respectively nandita chowdhury in a review for india today said that karan johar was almost able to rekindle khan kajol magic of dilwale dulhania le jayenge and that
