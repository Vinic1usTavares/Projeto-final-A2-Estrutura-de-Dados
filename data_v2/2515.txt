to reaching top flight of english football for 1987 88 season he shared a room with david batty swan also set up first of batty s four leeds goals in a boxing day clash with manchester city at maine road though he was never consistently in first eleven under bremner when new manager howard wilkinson was appointed in 1988 89 swan fell out of first team picture completely he did not take to wilkinson and ended his first team chances at leeds when he told wilkinson s assistant mike that i don t want to play for you i just don t like him wilkinson swan handed in seven written transfer

strachan playing a large part in success however swan and hull did not find success gray used swan in defence and lost his job in summer following a run of just one win in twelve games new manager colin appleton used swan in all four playing position within first fourteen days of 1989 90 campaign his time in goal came when goalkeeper iain was injured in a defeat to bournemouth and had to leave field at half time appleton failed to control his players and with his team bottom of division he was sacked in october much to amusement of swan and team his replacement stan ternent managed to instil discipline necessary to get best performances out of swan and other big characters at club ternent dragged swan off just fifteen minutes into his first match as manager but calmed fury of his player when he explained change was a tactical one ternent then put swan up front with andy payton and pair put in a 28 goal haul in league between them with swan claiming eleven of these despite missing fifteen games with anterior cruciate ligament damage in his knee following his recovery swan played in defence and tigers managed to save their second tier status and finish in mid table 1990 91 campaign was a disaster and hull suffered relegation after finishing in last place swan also suffered as he played game with middlesbrough at ayresome park despite suffering from a painful heel injury only to require stitches to his eye socket following a kick to face from simon coleman despite all of this ternent still insisted that swan got back on field for final fifteen minutes of a 3 0 defeat swan went public with his desire to leave club in november 1990 and handed in a transfer request after ternent refused to use him as a defender rather than an attacker following ternent s dismissal new boss terry dolan agreed to let swan go for a reasonable price as he was aware that swan was liable to kick off a bit if his requests were not granted and dolan was also in need of money to build a new team whilst waiting for an offer he played swan as a target man alongside strike partner andy payton swan scored thirteen goals and payton scored twelve though this was not enough to prevent club from suffering relegation port vale in summer four clubs chased swan s signature in sunderland bristol city wolverhampton wanderers and port vale eddie gray was now working swan s agent and he arranged a ps300 000 move to john rudge s port vale in august 1991 with a ps52 500 signing on bonus for swan in addition to his ps650 a week wages and complimentary new car swan later revealed in his autobiography that he only passed his medical by concealing all evidence of cruciate injury to his right knee rudge played swan almost exclusively as a defender and never had significant problems with his knee but did have to issue many fines and for many practical jokes swan would carry out after recovering from a foot injury rudge played swan in attack in an fa cup tie with liverpool at anfield and swan set up martin foyle for valiants equalising goal despite his cross being a miscued shot foot injury then turned out to be a stress fracture and swan was sidelined until christmas at end of season vale were relegated into third tier and swan was sent off for dissent in defeat to cambridge united that confirmed club s relegation he added to his inevitable fine from club by continuing his verbal attack on referee after game and following an investigation by fa he continued to land himself in hot water with an elaborate practical joke he played on fa officials who came to speak to rudge at vale park a first team regular alongside defensive partners neil aspin and dean glover in summer 1992 he helped club to win pre season tnt tournament his performances in 1992 93 season saw him awarded a place on pfa second division team he was man of match in league trophy final victory over stockport county despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret session night before season finished on a negative note though in second half of 1993 second division play off final against west bromwich albion with game still goalless swan was sent off after bringing down bob taylor who was through on goal this proved to turning point in game as west brom went on to win 3 0 to secure promotion at vale s expense it also meant that he went down in history as only third englishman to be sent off at wembley after kevin keegan and lee dixon sidelined for a period recovering from a hernia operation swan spent much of 1993 94 pre season making visits to local children s hospital as he was moved by patients he met there particularly by a small girl called lisa who died later that summer once he made it back onto training field he had a small fight with teammate bernie slaven though rumours that spread through stoke on trent that this was due to him having an affair with slaven s wife were false as rudge built a solid team club earned automatic promotion with swan being a vital contributor to this success however by october swan fancied a new club and a new challenge and so handed in a transfer request in july 1994 he was sold on to peter shilton s plymouth argyle for a fee of ps300 000 then a plymouth record this was despite vale s valuation of ps350 000 and reported interest from burnley and from first division club s bolton wanderers leicester city notts county and west brom plymouth argyle swan s time on south coast was miserable family dog zee died wife bex had a difficult birth with baby george and swan became a hate figure with his teammates and local population at large after club suffered a poor start to season swan s problems then took a supernatural bent as young couple became convinced that their plymouth home was haunted family moved 260 miles back to more friendly surroundings of stoke he got off on wrong foot with argyle fans after local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at vale park on 19 february 1994 had cost plymouth promotion vale had finished three points ahead of plymouth who lost out to burnley in playoffs shilton also did little to help swan s cause by appointing him as captain at expense of fan s favourite steve castle his new teammates also resented record signing northerner for intruding on their clique rudge offered shilton ps150 000 to bring swan back to vale park but was refused local press asked swan if you re so desperate to leave why did you come to plymouth in first place his answer of for money only served to further incense supporters meanwhile he had off field scuffles with teammates alan nicholls and kevin nugent despite this swan s form on pitch did improve towards end of season shilton was replaced by steve mccall who was in turn replaced by caretaker manager russell osman though neither men were able to steer club away from relegation at end of 1994 95 to swan s delight burnley after club withheld payment to swan pfa put an embargo on new manager neil warnock though only after swan began to disrupt training sessions did warnock arrange a move to second division burnley for ps200 000 swan stalled move in anticipation for his missing wages from plymouth and continued to disrupt pre season friendlies when warnock called him up due to a developing injury crisis eventually he negotiated a settlement of ps25 000 burnley manager jimmy mullen got sack after a poor start to 1995 96 and his replacement adrian heath was appointed in march 1996 bury swan had no respect for heath and was not afraid to show it and so heath kept swan s appearances to a minimum in 1996 97 he offered loan moves to third division hartlepool united and hereford united offers which swan dismissed out of hand and so heath placed him on transfer list transfer took until august 1997 at which point he moved on to bury for a fee of ps50 000 this reunited him with manager stan ternent move had been delayed after heath left burnley to be replaced by chris waddle though waddle quickly sanctioned transfer ternent moved swan back to his role as a striker despite player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs he scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen game goal drought he helped club to narrowly avoid relegation at end of season return to burnley with warnock replacing ternent as bury manager and ternent moving on to manage burnley this signalled a return to turf moor for swan ternent moved swan back into defence but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions illness and injury a collision with wycombe wanderers jason cousins on 20 february 1999 spelt beginning of end for swan s career as result of a scan showed he had snapped cruciate ligament in his right knee ternent allowed swan to play on a month to month contract for 1999 2000 season swan rushed his nine month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers he secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting painkillers fighting a losing battle against injuries in march 2000 ternent allowed him to leave club before he took decision swan and ronnie jepson began to polish boots of legendary new signing ian wright just to be able to say they had done so five days after leaving burnley he went to york city in fourth tier this reunited him with former manager terry dolan who offered him a contract until end of season york city dolan gave him a contract for 2000 01 season and appointed him as york s captain despite concerns over his knee swan battled against his own body to play all pre season friendlies including a clash with manchester united and their star players of david beckham roy keane ryan giggs and paul scholes he was sent off in first game of season after attempting to headbutt chesterfield s steve blatherwick he captained minstermen for first and only time at bootham crescent against cheltenham town before he went in for some keyhole surgery to clean out his knee surgeon told swan that mess in there is unbelievable there s no cartilage there are bits floating around everywhere and it s riddled with arthritis and warned him that any further matches could see him confined to a wheelchair after a few weeks swan accepted both dolan s and surgeon s advice and retired style of play a tough player with a frame he prided himself on his ability to out muscle either his marker or player he was marking depending on position he was playing though as a result he was sent off ten times in his career and was occasionally criticised for using foul play his no nonsense approach was criticised by footballing purists such as dario gradi as swan s crunching tackles could cause injuries to opposition players post retirement though he secretly played a game for rothwell town in 1988 he played amateur football for first time since childhood with pub side new wheel in 2000 and broke his nose in a game for club he gained his a licence which allowed him to coach in professional game and he took up coaching at ossett town he and

garden he also found work as an expert witness for hull city s games at bbc radio humberside in 2003 next year he also began working as a pundit for hull daily mail and did occasional work for bbc
