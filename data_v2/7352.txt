not to be confused with bluespotted stingray neotrygon kuhlii bluespotted ribbontail ray taeniura lymma is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae found from intertidal zone to a depth of this species is common throughout tropical indian and western pacific oceans in nearshore coral reef associated habitats it is a fairly small ray not exceeding in width with a mostly smooth oval pectoral fin disc large protruding eyes and a relatively short and thick tail with a deep fin fold underneath it can be easily identified by its striking color pattern of many electric blue spots on a yellowish background with a pair of blue stripes on tail at night small groups of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow rising tide onto sandy flats to root for small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes in sediment when tide recedes rays separate and withdraw to shelters on reef reproduction is aplacental viviparous with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young this ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines though it prefers to flee if threatened because of its beauty and size bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private despite being poorly suited to captivity international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species as near threatened as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its

potamotrygonidae than to congeneric blotched fantail ray t meyeni which is closer to dasyatis and indo pacific himantura distribution and habitat widespread in nearshore waters of tropical indo pacific region bluespotted ribbontail ray has a range that extends around periphery of indian ocean from south africa to arabian peninsula to southeast asia including madagascar mauritius zanzibar seychelles sri lanka and maldives it is rare in persian gulf and gulf of oman in pacific ocean this species is found from philippines to northern australia as well as around numerous melanesian and polynesian islands as far east as solomon islands rarely found deeper than bluespotted ribbontail ray is a bottom dwelling species that frequents coral reefs and adjacent sandy flats it is also commonly encountered in intertidal zone and tidal pools and has been sighted near seagrass beds every summer considerable numbers of bluespotted ribbontail rays arrive off south africa description thumb left alt photo of a stingray lying on sand showing its oval shape and brilliant blue spots bluespotted ribbontail ray has distinctive coloration pectoral fin disc of bluespotted ribbontail ray is oval in shape around four fifths as wide as long with a rounded to broadly angular snout large protruding eyes are immediately followed by broad spiracles there is a narrow flap of skin between nares with a fringed posterior margin reaching past mouth lower jaw dips at middle and deep furrows are present at mouth corners there are 15 24 tooth rows in either jaw arranged into pavement like plates and two large papillae on floor of mouth pelvic fins are narrow and angular thick depressed tail measures about 1 5 times disc length and bears one or two usually two serrated spines well behind tail base there is a deep fin fold on ventral surface reaching tip of tail and a low midline ridge on upper surface skin is generally smooth save for perhaps a scattering of small thorns on middle of back dorsal coloration is striking consisting of numerous circular neon blue spots on a yellowish brown or green background spots vary in size becoming smaller and denser towards disc margin tail has two stripes of same blue running along each side as far as spines eyes are bright yellow and belly is white individuals found off southern africa may lack blue tail stripes bluespotted

one of most abundant stingrays inhabiting indo pacific reefs bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris including from shipwrecks often with only its tail showing at night small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with rising tide to feed unlike many other stingrays this species seldom buries itself in sand bester

summer male follows female and nips at her disc eventually biting and holding onto her for copulation there is also a documented instance of a male holding onto disc of a smaller male bluespotted stingray dasyatis kuhlii in a possible case of mistaken identity adult males have been observed gathering in shallow water which may relate to reproduction like other stingrays this species is aplacental viviparous embryos are initially sustained by yolk which later in development is supplemented by histotroph uterine milk containing mucus fat and proteins produced by mother gestation period is uncertain but is thought to be between four and twelve months long females bear litters of up to seven young each a miniature version of adult measuring around across males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of maturation size of females is unknown known predators of bluespotted ribbontail ray include hammerhead sharks sphyrna and bottlenose dolphins tursiops it is also potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals when threatened this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern to throw off pursuers numerous parasites have been identified from this species tapeworms anthobothrium taeniuri elegans and e polypocephalus and rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and r taeniuri monogeneans australis and taeniurae flatworms ghardaguensis and nematode australis copepod sheina orri and protozoan trypanosoma taeniurae this ray has been observed soliciting cleanings from bluestreak cleaner wrasse labroides dimidiatus by raising margins of its disc and

long while timid and innocuous towards humans bluespotted ribbontail ray is capable of inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines its attractive appearance and relatively small size has resulted in its being most common stingray found in home aquarium trade however it seldom fares well in captivity and very few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long many specimens refuse to feed in aquarium and even seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding a higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by european association of zoos and aquaria for example a total of 15 pups were born at lisbon oceanarium from 2011 to 2013 bluespotted ribbontail ray is utilized as food in east africa southeast asia and australia it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets longlines spears and fence traps international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed bluespotted ribbontail ray as near threatened although still relatively common and widely distributed this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite in addition its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries and by local collecting for aquarium trade references
