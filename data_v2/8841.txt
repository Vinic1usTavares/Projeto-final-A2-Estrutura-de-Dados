witnessing men made of metal tearing cities apart production development and casting in july 2014 executive producers stated that they had plans to incorporate cobie smulders maria hill into second

christine adams as agent weaver mark allan stewart as agent oliver maya stojan as kara agent 33 dichen lachman as jiaying luke mitchell as lincoln campbell and chad cleven as a hydra tactical agent stewart and cleven did not receive guest star credit in episode simon kassianides also guest stars simmons negga goodman richards maclachlan olmos harris adams stewart stojan lachman mitchell and kassianides reprise their roles from earlier in series with episode exploring new clairvoyant abilities of negga s raina executive producer tancharoen noted irony of this as raina had spent much of her time on series obsessed with another character who she believed was clairvoyant on death of his character in episode kassianides said i m sad to see him go but i m happy to see someone like that get their comeuppance noting that character was originally intended to be killed off in a hen in wolf house kassianides felt that way bakshi and his relationships had developed throughout season was fantastic and made character s final sacrifice a much more beautiful death filming thumb left actress chloe bennet broke her arm while filming episodes one take fight sequence director tancharoen and series stunt team led by stunt coordinator tanner gill and fight choreographer matt mullins created a previsualization of a fight sequence between character skye and several hydra agents in which it would be filmed in a single take tancharoen and mullins conceived idea while looking for a way to top may vs may fight in face my enemy executive producers were enthusiastic about idea being used and actors including bennet rehearsed sequence on prior weekend for a couple of hours at a gymnastics place because series production doesn t build sets till a couple of days before shoot or even day before shoot or sometimes even morning of shoot stunt team was not able to coordinate with art department and set decorators in construction of set so fight sequence had to be slightly reconfigured on day of shoot to fit set a steam effect in sequence proved difficult due to special effects operator having to time it with bennet s shooting working around a delay in air canister system of several seconds tancharoen used a handheld camera with operator having to run all over place with this really heavy camera on his shoulder but wanted to move away from jason bourne shaky cam style of filming saying that because of his background in choreography it s drilled in my head that camera has to complement movement of action shot took four takes to get right with bennet breaking her arm during filming of final take and having to carry out rest of her fight scenes for season with injury visual effects for destruction of bus s h i e l d s plane that serves as a mobile command center series lead visual effects provider fusefx were able to storyboard and plot out sequence earlier than usual before creating a completely computer generated sequence in which plane is hit by a missile while flying in arctic as plane is brought down pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth there is also a smaller plane that flies through airborne debris it s a very complex sequence combining cg effects simulations and pyrotechnics series visual effects supervisor mark kolpack elaborated that doing fire realistically on television is a tall order you don t get representation of what a real fire element looks like using software but guys at fusefx those fx animators are amazing it takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right and it wasn t just fire it was smoke and debris and then it was cloaking device and may show star ming na wen in cockpit and it was may on bluescreen between houdini and particles we had to create for that one shot a big giant virtual shot where we had a quinjet come down and all debris is falling all around and there s fire and smoke that sequence was what that episode was about it was a big scene to pull off for bakshi s death by splinter bomb visual effects team had created effect before for earlier episodes so they had that pretty much dialed in kolpack explained that kassianides was shot against greenscreen and background plates and we added several layers of different erosion techniques taking his body away and then having all actual particles dynamically coming off of him as he moved marvel cinematic universe tie ins dirty half dozen features easter eggs plot threads and other connective tissue leading into opening scene of avengers age of ultron including appearance of goodman as list and smulders as hill reprising their roles from films executive producer jed whedon described tie in as more nuanced than previous one which connected series to captain america winter soldier given that crossover has relatively little impact on ongoing storylines of season release broadcast dirty half dozen was first aired in united states on abc on april 28 2015 marketing for final twelve episodes of season

great episode highlighting reunion of six original team members and their evolved dynamic despite what he called a contrived set up for that situation he felt that using characters of list and hill to tie series into age of ultron was right way to tie two together and was also positive of character beats for simmons and palamas goldman also made special mention of tancharoen s direction of one shot fight though he felt that tancharoen s may vs agent 33 fight from face my enemy was superior sequence and of visual effects for shooting down of bus a v clubs oliver sava graded dirty half dozen a b also noting that has to take some shortcuts to reunite original team but momentum picks up considerably once everyone is in same room discussing changed in main characters from start of series sava particularly noted development of skye into kick ass agent of s h i e l d and praised tancharoen as one director on this series that is really going out of his way to create memorable action sequences sava called age of ultron tie in overt with raina s clairvoyance a convenient plot device to put certain pieces in place but ultimately felt that those big screen connections don t interrupt focus on relationships marc buxton at den of geek scored episode 3 5 out of 5 calling age of ultron tie in anti climactic it felt like a bit of a cheat criticizing what he saw as too much of s h i e l d s own storyline being left for film to resolve but said that all in all it was a rather good episode buxton said that skye really shined this episode and called her one shot fight worthy of a rewind or two while highlighting one of biggest character moments in episode with simmons decision to kill ward rob leane also at den of geek was more positive of age of ultron tie in calling it next best allusion to movies we ve ever had following series connections to captain america winter soldier and praising use of list and hill he positively compared skye s one shot fight sequence to well known single take sequences in avengers and daredevil calling it very welcome tv equivalent of air punching fan pleasing moments often found in marvel s films leane also compared coulson s real mission within a mission reveal to a similar moment in winter soldier and summarized dirty half dozen as a thoroughly entertaining episode thanks in equal part to tie in stuff some solid action and several strong character moments ward s return was handled well too although something needs to be done about simmons growing unlikeable ness joseph mccabe reviewing episode for nerdist gave a positive review saying that episode pulls off neat trick of tying into age of ultron without necessarily feeling like an ad for it and feeling that it benefited immensely from skills of s h i e l d s best director in tancharoen and his choreography of one shot fight sequence he also praised all of character pairings that action heavy episode managed to explore and positively compared overall episode to a kind of thinking person s g i joe it s satisfying to see agents of s h i e l d s original lineup on one more joe like mission accolades episode was nominated for outstanding special and visual effects at 67th
