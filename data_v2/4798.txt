suillus collinitus is a pored mushroom of genus suillus in family suillaceae it is an edible mushroom found in european pine forests mushroom has a reddish to chestnut brown cap that reaches up to in diameter and a yellow stem measuring up to tall by thick on underside of cap are small angular pores initially bright yellow before turning greenish brown with age a characteristic feature that helps to distinguish it from similar suillus species such as s granulatus is pinkish mycelia at base of stem molecular analysis has shown species to be related to other typical mediterranean suillus species such as s bellinii s luteus and s mediterraneensis s collinitus is a mycorrhizal species and forms associations with several species of pine most notably aleppo pine this tree species is commonly used in reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in mediterranean region and s collinitus is often used as a beneficial to help young trees better survive in typically harsh soil conditions taxonomy phylogeny and naming species was first described as boletus collinitus by elias magnus fries in 1838 otto kuntze transferred it to genus suillus in his 1898 revisio generum plantarum in 1969 dutch mycologist h s c described variety s collinitus var aureus as s fluryi var aureus s fluryi is a synonym of s collinitus based on a collection from switzerland variety velatipes was described in 1998 by giampaolo simonini and colleagues from italian collections a 1996 molecular analysis of 38 different suillus species used sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify taxonomy of genus results indicated that s collinitus is most closely related to a specimen of s collected from nepal according to authors this nepalese isolate probably represents a species distinct from north american and european isolates based on morphology and host tree association in 2006 a phylogenetic analysis of suillus isolates collected from spain showed that s collinitus was closely related to other species typical of mediterranean area namely s bellinii s luteus and s mediterraneensis specific epithet collinitus is derived from latin and means smeared or greased british botanist mordecai cubitt cooke called mushroom ringless yellow boletus in an 1873 publication description thumb left view of flesh and pore structure fruit body of suillus collinitus is a medium to large fleshy bolete cap is initially rounded becoming convex and finally flat reaching up to in diameter cap is covered with a brown cuticle of variable shade that is decorated with minuscule radial striations which become more obvious in fully expanded specimens and especially in dry weather cap is often shaped irregularly and becomes viscid sticky when damp tubes are short and their stem attachment is usually slightly decurrent to adnate small and angular pores are yellow but darken with age young fresh specimens sometimes bear droplets of a clear fluid that collect on pore surface cylindrical stem is often short and stubby typically tall by thick coloured yellowish and ornamented with sparse reddish brown granules there is no ring base of stem bears pink overtones and is attached to distinctively pink mycelial threads which are visible when fruit body is uprooted flesh is yellowish thick and soft in a colour reaction test with ammonia solution flesh turns reddish spores are seen ochre brown in mass but pale yellow when viewed with a light microscope they are fusiform tapered at each end sized 8 10 5 by 3 4 5 mm basidia spore bearing cells of hymenium are four spored especially characteristic for s collinitus are cap striations and pink mycelium fungus in many aspects resembles s granulatus a common species in european pine forests s granulatus however has a homogenous brown cap without striations and its mycelium is characteristically white varieties two varieties of s collinitus have been described s collinitus var aureus has a golden yellow cap s collinitus var velatipes originally found in italy growing in poor acidic soil in association with aleppo pine pinus halepensis is distinguished by a glutinous brown veil at base of stem and a slender white at cap margin similar species suillus collinitus is often found in same habitat with other thermophilic species including s mediterraneensis and s bellinii especially in mediterranean basin some common species which occur throughout much of europe and also associate with two needled pines include s luteus and s granulatus edibility various authors regard suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste it is advisable as for all species of suillus to pick only young specimens and to peel cuticle before preparation mushroom contains several tocopherols a class of chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin e and which confer antioxidant activity they also contain several organic acids most predominantly pairs malic and acids and citric and acid which respectively make up 42 and 30 of total organic acids composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity distribution habitat and ecology thumb left aleppo pine pinus halepensis is one of several species with which s collinitus forms mycorrhizae suillus collinitus is found throughout europe it is an ectomycorrhizal fungus forming mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships with several species of pine pinus these include several two needled european species of pine aleppo pine p halepensis european black pine p nigra stone pine p pinea and scots pine p sylvestris fungus favours limestone soils s collinitus is thermophilic commonly occurring in southern europe it is rarely seen in more northern regions such as british isles and poland it is red listed in denmark as near threatened and in estonia as endangered it has also been collected in iran mushroom was reported in municipality of in department of boyaca in colombia it was reported by juan camilo rodriguez martinez suillus collinitus is most frequent fungus associating with aleppo pine a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in mediterranean region a study performed in south of france discovered that s collinitus and s mediterraneensis are multi stage ectomycorrhizal fungi associating with both young and mature stands of aleppo pine these two species may play a key role in survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites roots mycorrhizal with s collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing moreover fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees fungus has also been shown to improve growth of mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries unlike other suillus species that grow in wet climates such as s and s spraguei s collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations this fruiting behaviour may be attributed to typically nutrient poor xeric mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy absence of above ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations formed between several suillus species and aleppo pine has been studied under in vitro conditions in laboratory tree shoots inoculated with either s collinitus s bellinii and s mediterraneensis tended to grow better and showed superior mycorrhizal development than other tested suillus species suggesting that three have a physiological specificity for tree a 2010 publication reported that fungal hyphae are covered in crystals of oxalic acid which in addition to reducing soil ph reduces grazing by soil candida references external links youtube video describing features in french www ch images of s collinitus var
