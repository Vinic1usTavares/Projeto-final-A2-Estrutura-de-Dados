conisbrough castle is a medieval fortification in conisbrough south yorkshire england castle was initially built in 11th century by william de warenne earl of surrey after norman conquest of england in 1066 hamelin plantagenet illegitimate parvenu son of henry ii acquired property by marriage in late 12th century hamelin and his son william rebuilt castle in stone including its prominent high keep castle remained in family line into 14th century despite being seized several times by crown fortification was then given to edmund of langley passing back into royal ownership in 1461 conisbrough castle fell into ruin its outer wall badly affected by subsidence and was given to carey family in 16th century its derelict state prevented it from involvement in english civil war of 17th century and remains were bought by duke of leeds in 1737 sir walter scott used location for his 1819 novel ivanhoe and by end of 19th century ruins had become a tourist attraction despite increasing industrial character of area state took over management of property in 1950 but by 1980s visitor facilities were felt to be unsuitable leading to a three way partnership being created between local council state agency english heritage and a local charitable trust to develop castle keep was re roofed and re floored in 1990s with help of european union funding english heritage took over control of castle in 2008 and continues to operate property as a tourist attraction castle is made up of an inner and an outer bailey former surrounded by a stone curtain wall defended by six mural or fortified towers and castle keep inner bailey would have included a hall solar chapel and other service buildings of which only foundations survive design of conisbrough s keep is unique in england and historians oliver creighton and stephen johnson consider it an architectural gem and one of finest examples of late norman defensive architecture keep comprises a circular central tower with six massive buttresses its four floors would have included a main chamber and a private chamber for lord above it although militarily weak design would have been a powerful symbol of hamelin plantagenet s new social status as a major lord history 11th 12th centuries thumb 300px aerial photograph in 2007 showing outer and inner baileys bottom left and top right conisbrough castle was founded by william de warenne first earl of surrey who had taken part in norman conquest of england in 1066 and was rewarded by his father in law william conqueror with extensive estates in yorkshire norfolk and sussex as part of these lord de warenne was given manor of conisbrough which had previously been owned by late harold godwinson manor took its name from anglo saxon name for settlement meaning king s fortress and formed a large estate comprising 28 townships centred on an anglo saxon fortified burh at conisbrough itself william built his castle on a rocky magnesian limestone spur surrounded by steep banks and fortification included a motte an inner bailey protected by an earth bank and palisades an outer bailey and possibly a timber keep castle was located around above river and would have dominated this part of don valley it was positioned directly opposite village which probably contained old anglo saxon burh castle was held by william s son also called william from 1088 to 1138 and then by his son another william until his death in 1147 conisbrough and earldom then passed through isabel william s daughter to her first husband william de blois and then on to her second husband hamelin plantagenet whom she married in 1163 hamelin was illegitimate half brother of king henry ii who had arranged marriage and union brought him great wealth hamelin extensively rebuilt castle around 1180 to 1190 including constructing stone keep given his parvenu status he probably hoped to reinforce perceptions of his new elevated rank king john visited castle in 1201 13th 15th centuries thumb inner bailey seen from east showing former locations of gatehouse and solar block left and castle s hall right castle continued in ownership of hamelin plantagenet s family passing to his son william de warenne in 1202 william was probably responsible for construction of new stone curtain walls around inner bailey destroying former earthwork defences in process inner bailey was levelled and william built a hall and service buildings inside castle again in stone conisbrough was inherited by william s young son john de warenne in 1239 but he was still a minor and castle was initially managed by his mother maud under john conisbrough s constables carried out a range of what historian stephen johnson terms colourful if rather unlawful dealings one was ultimately charged with having conducted devilish and innumerable oppressions further work was carried out in castle during john s ownership including modernising castle hall and solar castle passed to john s grandson also called john who in 1304 married joan de barr marriage broke down but john s attempts to gain a divorce in 1316 failed in law courts john blamed thomas earl of lancaster for this and in response he kidnapped thomas wife thomas then retaliated by seizing conisbrough castle edward ii intervened in dispute and confirmed thomas as new owner of castle in 1322 however thomas rebelled against king and was executed resulting in edward taking control of conisbrough himself king visited castle in 1322 and spent 40 marks on repairing both conisbrough and neighbouring castle of pontefract edward was overthrown by his wife isabella in 1326 and castle was returned to john john had hoped to pass property to his mistress and two illegitimate sons but he outlived them and on his death in 1347 it reverted to control of crown edward iii gave castle to his own son edmund of langley duke of york who controlled it until 1402 edmund s eldest son edward owned it until 1415 when it passed to maud clifford widow of edmund s younger son richard who lived there until 1446 richard of york then inherited castle and on his death in 1460 during wars of roses it passed to his son edward who seized throne in 1461 bringing conisbrough back into crown ownership once again 16th 19th centuries thumb engraving of castle in 1785 by 16th century conisbrough castle was in a poor state of repair and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that gates bridge and parts of walls had collapsed in a spectacular land slippage and that one floor of keep had also fallen in collapse of walls was a consequence of instability of topsoil on top of limestone spur which was a mixture of clay and sandstone once clay was washed away over time remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack henry viii gave ruins to carey family who retained it until it passed by marriage into first and then coke families castle was not involved in events of english civil war in 17th century and escaped slighting that affected many similar properties probably because collapse of outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value in 1737 after death of edward coke castle and surrounding manor were bought by thomas osborne duke of leeds for ps22 500 in 1811 novelist sir walter scott passed by castle and later used it as location for his novel ivanhoe published in 1819 scott only had a partial view of property from road and events portrayed in novel set at end of 12th century are fictitious scott believed castle to have been saxon in origin a view shared by many 19th century commentators although writer john wainwright was still able to praise picturesque view around castle in 1826 antiquarian smith commented with concern in 1887 on changing character of location in particular factories that were growing up around new railway line and murky atmosphere industrial works created in 1859 francis d arcy osborne duke of leeds died leaving conisbrough to his nephew sackville lane fox baron conyers keep remained in good condition but by 1884 it was apparent that repairs were needed and antiquarian george clark recommended urgent work to repair stonework if finances allowed it he also urged reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors limited repairs were subsequently approved by trustees of lord conyers although clark s colleague a ellis expressed concerns that railings to protect visitors who routinely climbed to top of keep had not been funded a reported ps500 was spent by trustees renovating castle ruins including construction of a lodge in outer bailey for castle keeper completed in 1885 and improvements to footpaths 20th 21st centuries thumb inner bailey seen from outer bailey showing remains of barbican and mural towers conisbrough castle was bought by conisbrough local council in 1940s who placed castle into guardianship of ministry of public works in 1949 but retained freehold ownership of land two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on site between 1967 and 1969 exposing foundations of buildings in inner bailey and then from 1973 to 1977 examining options for future visitor facilities by 1984 when government agency english heritage took over management of property condition of visitor services was unsatisfactory and industrial character of surrounding area was discouraging tourists in response english heritage and doncaster metropolitan borough council formed a three way agreement in 1988 with ivanhoe trust a local charity designed to generate new employment in region under this agreement trust would manage site english heritage would maintain historic fabric of castle while council would construct a new visitors centre a new controversial visitor s centre was built in style of a collection of jousting tents while floors and roof of keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with european union funding in an attempt to limit erosion of castle stonework visitor numbers following investments fell far short of expectations however and by 2006 had settled at around 30 000 each year only slightly above level in early 1980s external facilities did not age well and funding shortages led to new audio visual effects in keep being turned off to save money discussions between three partners about future of castle took place but relations broke down and english heritage resumed direct management of castle in 2008 castle was closed for a ps1 1 million programme of renovations in 2013 funded by heritage lottery fund as part of which a new visitors centre and visitor facilities were constructed castle is protected under uk law as a grade i listed building and as a scheduled ancient monument architecture inner and outer

formed by scarping and counter scarping natural contours of hill producing a bank now largely destroyed and a protective ditch early 13th century curtain wall is mostly of roughly dressed coursed stone up to thick and high with two sections repaired with ashlar facings wall was defended by six mural towers along its southern and western sides of which three still survive reasonably intact and strengthened with pilaster buttresses along northern edge bases of walls and towers were splayed spreading their weight out more broadly but their footings are only deep in places a barbican protected link from drawbridge to gatehouse of inner bailey complete with an additional corner turret remains of collapse of curtain wall are still visible in ditch various buildings were constructed along inside of inner bailey wall of similar rough stonework to curtain wall but only their foundations remain today in south west corner was solar block containing solar and various chambers along north side was hall pushed into an awkward corner of curtain wall in size and originally probably built two storeys high initially constructed with a central hearth a fireplace was added into outer wall in later 13th century alongside hall were a kitchen and pantry former with a cellar on south east side of inner bailey was castle chapel across keep conisbrough s keep was positioned on north east side of inner bailey it is an important medieval survival historian sidney toy considered it to be one of finest keeps in england archaeologist oliver creighton describes it as an architectural gem and stephen johnson as one of finest examples of late norman defensive architecture thumbnail upright keep re roofed and floored between 1993 and 1995 keep comprises a central circular tower in diameter with six large solid buttresses projecting outwards to form an hexagonal design unique in england it was made from magnesian limestone and tall with walls up to thick in places it has four floors a ground floor that serves as a basement and a vaulted stone support for chamber above first floor through which keep was accessed two upper floors and a roof walk which was probably covered by a pentice and defended by battlements current concrete stairs to keep are modern and original medieval stairway made from timber and stone would have incorporated a drawbridge just before castle doors basement contained a well which could also be drawn from 1st floor through a hole in stone floor keep was designed as a private tower for hamelin plantagenet rather than a grander residence as a result it was not designed to accommodate several different households and its layout was simpler than that seen at contemporary keep of orford castle for example 2nd and 3rd floor would have served as main chamber and lord s private chamber forming a vertical sequence of rooms with a vaulted hexagonal chapel leading off private chamber cut into one of buttresses most of castle would have been very dark due to lack of natural light main chamber however had a large window by with deep recesses to allow for thickness of walls two carved seats sat alongside window a similar window was placed above it in private chamber keep had relatively advanced fireplaces and flues for this period fireplace in main chamber being exceptionally large and decorated with stone columns and carved capitals conisbrough castle was probably similar to two other castles owned by warren earls hamelin plantagenet was also responsible for development of castle in france where a similar keep was built on top of a motte and conisbrough might also have had resemblances to sandal castle in north of england also owned by earls design of keep was poor from a military perspective central circular tower provided defensive advantages but buttresses introduced 12 vulnerable corners into stonework and keep itself had no arrow slots to permit defenders to fire on any attackers rather than being designed primarily for military defence it was constructed to symbolise and reinforce hamelin s lordship and new social status see also castles in great britain and ireland list of castles in england notes references
