space interferometry mission or sim also known as sim lite formerly known as sim planetquest was a planned space telescope proposed by u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa in conjunction with contractor northrop grumman one of main goals of mission was hunt for earth sized planets orbiting in habitable zones of nearby stars other than sun sim was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010 in addition to detecting extrasolar planets sim would have helped astronomers construct a map of milky way galaxy other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars assisting in determination of spatial distribution of dark matter in milky way and in local group of galaxies and using gravitational microlensing effect to measure mass of stars spacecraft would have used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals initial contracts for sim lite were awarded in 1998 totaling us 200 million work on sim project required scientists and engineers to move through eight specific new technology milestones and by november 2006 all eight had been completed sim lite was originally proposed for a 2005 launch aboard an evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv as a result of continued budget cuts launch date was pushed back at least five times nasa had set a preliminary launch date for 2015 as of february 2007 many of engineers working on sim program had moved on to other areas and projects and nasa directed project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction however preliminary budget for nasa for 2008 included zero dollars for sim in 2007 congress restored funding for fiscal year 2008 as part of an omnibus appropriations bill which president later signed at same time congress directed nasa to move mission forward to development phase in 2009 project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for findings and recommendations of astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey astro2010 performed by national academy of sciences which would determine project s future in 2010 astro2010 decadal report was released and did not recommend that nasa continue development of sim lite astrometric observatory this prompted nasa astronomy and physics director jon morse to issue a letter on 24 september 2010 to sim lite project manager informing him that nasa was discontinuing its sponsorship of sim lite mission and directing project to discontinue phase b activities immediately or as soon as practical accordingly all sim lite activities were closed down by end of calendar year 2010 mission thumb left a 2006 artist s impression of sim lite predecessor sim planetquest design sim lite would have operated in an earth trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away from earth at rate of 0 1 au per year ultimately reaching a distance of 82 million km from earth this would have taken approximately years sun would have continuously

retrieved 8 march 2010 through technique of interferometry spacecraft would be able to detect earth sized planets sim lite was to perform its search for nearby earth like planets by looking for wobble in parent star s apparent motion as planet orbits spacecraft would have accomplished this task to an accuracy of one millionth of an arcsecond or thickness of a nickel viewed at distance from earth to moon titled deep search planet hunting program was intended to search approximately 60 nearby stars for terrestrial planets like earth and venus in habitable zone where liquid water can exist throughout a full revolution one year of planet around its star deep search was to be most demanding in terms of astrometric accuracy hence name deep search this program would have used full capability of sim lite spacecraft to make its measurements a flexible search strategy tunes sim lite s mass sensitivity at each star to a desired level in habitable planet search value of eta earth fraction of stars carrying earth analog planets will be estimated by kepler mission some time before sim lite launches one strategy for a habitable planet search is to do a deeper search i e to lower mass sensitivity in habitable zone of a smaller number of targets if earth analogs are common a shallower search of a larger number of targets could have been done if earth analogs are rarer for example assuming that 40 of mission time is allocated for planet search sim lite could have surveyed 65 stars for planets down to one earth mass in scaled 1 au orbits or 149 stars for planets down to two earth masses in scaled 1 au orbits or 239 stars for planets down to three earth masses in scaled 1 au orbits aside from searching for earth sized planets sim lite was scheduled to perform what has been dubbed broad survey broad survey would have looked at approximately 1 500 stars to help determine abundance of neptune mass and larger planets around all star types in earth s sector of milky way

techniques pioneered by albert a michelson that sim would have been able to execute its three primary planet finding missions mission s planet finding component was set up to serve as an important complement to future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets sim lite was to perform an important task that these missions will not be capable of determining planet

terrestrial and other planets sim has detected stellar mass thumb right white dwarfs imaged by nasa s hubble space telescope another key aspect of sim lite s mission was determining upper and lower limits of star s masses today scientists understand that there are limits to how small or large a star can be objects that are too small lack internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion which is what causes a star to shine these objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent lower end of stellar mass scale stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova stars neutron

to provide pinpoint measurements for two extremes in stellar mass and evolution telescope will not be able to measure mass of every star in galaxy since there are over 200 billion but instead it will take a population census through this technique sim will be able to output accurate masses for representative examples for nearly every star type including brown dwarfs hot white dwarfs red giant stars and elusive black holes current space telescopes including nasa s hubble space telescope can accurately measure mass for some types of stars but not all estimates put range for stellar mass somewhere between 8 mass of sun and in excess of 60 times mass of sun entire study was to focus on binary star systems stars coupled through a mutual gravitational attraction galactic mapping thumb

portion of this pie graph shows estimated distribution of dark matter in universe dark matter is matter in universe that cannot be seen because of gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies scientists know that approximately 80 of matter in universe is dark matter spatial distribution of dark matter in universe is largely unknown sim lite would have helped scientists answer to this question strongest evidence for dark matter comes from galactic motion galaxies rotate much faster than amount of visible matter suggests they should gravity from ordinary matter is not enough to hold galaxy together scientists theorize that galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter similarly clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance high speed motions of their component galaxies besides measuring stellar motions within milky way sim lite was to measure internal and average galactic motion of some of neighboring galaxies near milky way telescope s measurements were to be used in conjunction with other currently available data to provide astronomers with first total mass measurements of individual galaxies these numbers would enable scientists to estimate spatial distribution of dark matter in local group of galaxies and by extension throughout universe development beginnings space interferometry mission began as a
