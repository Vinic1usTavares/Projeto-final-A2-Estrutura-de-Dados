in death cast cast is listed below production development thumb sanjay leela bhansali pictured in 2011 had been longing to make film for over a decade alt a photograph of sanjay leela bhansali looking towards camera sanjay leela bhansali had conceived historical romance about maratha peshwa bajirao and his second wife mastani even before he had directed his first feature musical in 1996 several other directors such as muzaffar ali manmohan desai and kamal had tried to make a film about two historical figures but they were never made bhansali had intended to make bajirao mastani after release of devdas 2002 and had officially announced it in 2003 with filming scheduled to begin in may 2004 film however was shelved indefinitely reports about a possible revival had made headlines ever since bhansali had planned to revive it every other year but project never came to fruition in an interview with telegraph bhansali spoke about his intention to make bajirao mastani after finishing every film he made in between saying i kept trying to revive it over and over again but if there is one thing that filmmaking has taught me it s that every film has its own destiny and i strongly believe that souls of bajirao mastani and kashibai wanted us to make this film only now in process film became a passion project for him after spending eleven years in development hell bhansali revived project in 2014 film was reported to be an adaptation of marathi language novel raau 1976 by nagnath s inamdar after project was shelved bhansali said he struggled to put film together and that he considered project impossible to make nevertheless he clung to his ambition to make film someday saying there is magic to it some film industry professionals believed it would never be made calling it jinxed bhansali always believed in project assuring himself script was so powerful he had to make it one day he told telegraph honestly i want very few things in life so i know that i am resilient enough to get them all deep down i kept asking for universe to let me make this film when you dream very genuinely then i believe you also get power to fulfill it in pursuing bajirao mastani i have been resilient and very focused i have sacrificed a lot of things primarily known for making romantic dramas bhansali was intrigued about romance between two people who defied everything just to be in love with each other and was excited to tell a 200 year old story he wanted to show relationship between bajirao and mastani because it was rarely depicted in history books and little was known about it he had long admired maratha backdrop and different religions of was hindu and mastani was further drove his interest towards knowing more and telling story he saw it as a chance to comment on religion and love saying in those times people were offended by same things that offend them today through this film i want to show that love is greatest religion prakash r kapadia wrote screenplay makers acquired rights of novel and worked with historian ninad bedekar kapadia said writing screenplay was a difficult task and a huge responsibility considering historical context kapadia and bhansali had consistently worked on script since its conception refining several aspects of film considering script was written twelve years before several changes were made to it such as decreasing length and increasing pace to suit modern audiences although adapted from novel romance between film s protagonists has not been well documented in history books or archives and several versions of story exist many cinematic liberties were taken to build drama and highlight incidents casting bhansali originally wanted to repeat his hum dil de chuke sanam 1999 pairing of salman khan with aishwarya rai for eponymous roles but could not cast them together after their highly publicised break up khan then tried to suggest his then girlfriend katrina kaif for role of mastani but things did not materialise when film was finally announced in 2003 bhansali had cast khan and kareena kapoor in titular roles with rani mukerji playing baji rao s first wife kashibai however idea was scrapped when khan and kapoor signed other films together bhansali wanted to be first director to showcase their pairing hence film was shelved and bhansali went on to direct other films thumb left 250px

revived in 2014 reports of ajay devgn and deepika padukone being approached for film made headlines in february devgn dropped out of film however due to differences with bhansali about several terms of his contract such as dates and remuneration next month it was reported that ranveer singh was in talks to play bajirao same month reports suggested priyanka chopra was cast to play kashibai bajirao s first wife in july 2014 it was officially confirmed that singh padukone and chopra were finalised to play principal roles chopra was first actor to be cast in film bhansali wanted kashibai to be cast first only after which he could decide who to cast for title roles bhansali who produced chopra starrer mary kom 2014 went on to that film s set in manali to narrate it with writer prakash kapadia bhansali was adamant in his choice of chopra who recalled rest of film hadn t been cast yet my picture would be there and pictures for bajirao and mastani would keep changing milind soman

whereas padukone had to take kathak dance lessons in preparation for her role of kashibai chopra had 15 days of language training in peshwai marathi dialect spoken during time of ascension of peshwas to perfect accent azmi shaved her head completely for her role singh has described his character as a true maratha saying deeper i get into it more i realise what a great man he was it is a great honour to be selected to play this character he has said he always wanted to transform himself into a character and playing bajirao gave him that scope which he said was draining and tiring in every way for portraying bajirao singh s preparations required him to isolate himself from his own being and living like bajirao he instructed crew members to address him as bajirao which helped him to remain in his character singh would not respond to people who used his real name he said it takes a lot of work and effort to be different from whom i am and two hours to get ready complete with makeup and heavy costumes after all this if someone just tells me ranveer your shot is ready all that goes to waste padukone found her character to be very relatable saying she was so brave strong determined and yet fragile and vulnerable she was also inspired by her character and found playing role challenging it was physically demanding and required a lot of dancing padukone said character had different layers one minute she goes on battlefield next minute she s romancing him chopra was drawn towards film because of her character which she thought was very heart breaking she said playing kashibai was emotionally difficult and a complete contrast to strong women she has portrayed in most of her films she described her character as someone who is heartbroken a silent sufferer dignified resilient can t take charge of her life goes with whatever life throws her way just grace under fire pre production considering its scale film required detailed and extravagant pre production work which required extensive research and planning dhatrak sriram iyengar and sawant worked as production designers on film iyengar and sawant had heard about film while working on another

purple inspired from raja ravi varma paintings for chopra custom made nine yard saris were weaved by craftsmen from maheshwar chander and varanasi they were made a little lighter than usual to avoid

is regarded as an authority on peshwas according to an article published by quartz love story of bajirao and mastani is almost entirely fictional writing that even most reliable sources do not give details about nature of their relationship there has been controversy over mastani s true lineage two accounts of mastani exist one which says she was a courtesan and bajirao s mistress or concubine and another that is depicted in film according to historian palande datar very little is known about women of that era due to orthodoxy women were not given many privileges and rights and most of sources from that period are accounts of political battles revenues and socio economic records palande datar also said that there is no evidence of way bajirao and mastani s political marriage became part of folklore and was later transformed into a symbolic representation of great romance historian prachi deshpande notes in her book creative pasts historical memory and identity in western india 1700 1960 that public fascination started after their romanticisation began in 1890s more than 150 years after they had died after marathi playwrights began writing a series of nationalistic plays based on historical figures first such play that portrayed them as a star crossed couple was bajirao mastani 1892 by n b quartz also said play portrayed them as star crossed lovers and others playwrights followed making it as familiar to marathi audiences as that of other epic romances by 1930s a number of historical novels that also added to myth making were written fascinating another generation film gives a more of a personal account of bajirao s life which is hard to prove since it has not been covered much by historians bhansali has said it was his interpretation of how bajirao was in his home and in personal life and there was no way to know that because of this lack of information bhansali took liberties with historical facts and exaggerated a few things for cinematic effects a disclaimer on film s credits stated it does not claim to be historically accurate dance sequences have been widely seen as fictional and out of place in historical context bajirao s dance sequence in malhari has been criticised saying a chief minister such as bajirao would never dance in public similarly pinga dance sequence between kashibai and mastani has been deemed inappropriate for women of that era some historians have said that apart from inappropriateness of a woman of kashiabi s stature dancing in public she suffered from a type of arthritis and that dancing was not physically possible for her while some historians have claimed both women met socially only once others have said they never met at all mastani was put under house arrest by balaji while bajirao was on military campaign as opposed to film s depiction of mastani s imprisonment film shows bajirao and mastani dying at same time in different places which did not happen in reality bajirao died a few days earlier than mastani however cause of her death is not known some have claimed she died from shock other accounts say she committed suicide film portrays mastani being chained at time of her death but she was never chained and she and kashibai were both present at bajirao s last rites after death of mastani kashibai raised mastani s son as her own which is not shown in film other
