how goals were chosen and obtained show s possible unintended effects and its portrayal of minorities and women lesser pp 174 175 refn see lesser pp 175 201 for his response to early critics of sesame street group note historian robert w morrow suggested that much of early criticism which he called surprisingly intense morrow p 3 stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to as he put it place of children in american society and controversies about television s effects on them most important morrow p 146 studies that found negative effects of sesame street were conducted by educator herbert a sprigle and psychologist thomas d cook during its first two seasons both studies found that show increased educational gap between poor and middle class children morrow reported

by inner city child morrow p 98 head start director edward zigler was probably sesame street s most vocal critic in show s early years he withdrew head start s funding of show becoming first of ctw s original investors to do so morrow suggested that basis of zigler s criticism was concern that federal government would transfer their funding of head start to ctw morrow p 147 also according to morrow these studies were utilized by critics in sesame street s later years especially by child development psychologists jerome and dorothy g singer who insisted television shortened children s attention spans and by author neil postman in his book amusing ourselves to death who believed that television could not teach children morrow p 149 postman claimed that sesame street also introduced children to a shallow pop culture undermined american education and relieved parents of their responsibility of teaching their children how to read davis p 200 since federal funds had been used to produce show more segments of population insisted upon being represented on sesame street morrow credited ctw s commitment to multiculturalism as one source for their conflicts with leadership of minority groups especially latino groups and feminists these conflicts were resolved when ctw added or substituted offending segments and characters by 1977 cast consisted of two african american women one of whom was single two african american men a chicano man two white men an american indian woman a puerto rican woman and a deaf white woman morrow pp 157 158 thumb right alt handsome latino man in his late sixties smiling at camera and wearing a striped shirt emilio delgado luis who joined cast of sesame street in 1971 latino groups criticized show for lack of hispanic characters during its early years a committee of hispanic activists commissioned by ctw in 1970 called sesame street racist and said that show s bilingual aspects were of poor quality and patronizing according to morrow cooney admitted that show s bilingual elements were not well thought out morrow p 154 by 1971 ctw hired hispanic actors production staff and researchers and by mid 70s morrow reported that show included chicano and puerto rican cast members films about mexican holidays and foods and cartoons that taught spanish words morrow p 155 in 1989 sesame street created a four year race relations curriculum that focused on introducing its viewers to various cultural backgrounds new york times reported that creating strong female characters that make kids laugh but not as female stereotypes gikow p 142 has been a challenge for producers of sesame street davis reported that national organization for women now expressed concerns that show needed to be less male oriented members of now were rankled by portrayal of susan whom they saw as a subservient powerless dispenser of milk and cookies davis p 213 in spring of 1970 boston globe columnist ellen goodman objected to what she considered sesame street s portrayal of women and girls as passive in late 1970 now threatened to boycott show morrow p 156 show s producers satisfied these critics by making susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer according to morrow change regarding how women and girls were depicted on sesame street occurred slowly ctw s research staff which were mostly made up of women worked with mostly male production staff to raise their consciousnesses about how women and girls were portrayed in their scripts another source of friction between ctw and feminists were lack of female muppets for which they held jim henson responsible as well as his organization of all male puppeteers who tended to create male characters demanding production schedule tended to attract only men and henson expressed his opinion that women were incapable of withstanding it gikow believed that difficulty creating breakout muppet characters was due to children s viewing styles girls have tended to become attached to male characters they like but boys did not tend to form same attachments to female characters gikow p 143 show s inventory of material some of which many feminists found sexist and which were shown over and over were slowly replaced by new less sexist segments morrow pp 156 157 as more female muppets performers like fran brill stephanie d abruzzo and leslie carrara rudolph were hired and trained stronger female characters like abby cadabby were created as an interesting contrast sesame street was also chastised by a louisiana critic for presence of strong single women on show in 1995 journalist kay hymowitz called sesame street a triumph of appearance over substance and credited its success not with quality but with a combination of savvy timing sophisticated image making and vigorous promotion she held show partly responsible for declining verbal abilities of american students and accused show of affirming negative stereotypes about women according to hymowitz show s creators discouraged children s natural curiosity about world she criticized show for instead of transforming television being devoured by it she took issue with its use of cultural references stating that show taught young children to embrace negative values of commercialism celebrity and anti intellectualism she insisted that by using television s production values producers of sesame street emphasized their jazzy medium more than educational content they were supposed to convey hymowitz took issue with show s educational claims stating that sesame street diminished young children s readiness for reading by limiting their abilities to engage in analytical and creative thinking she reported that most of positive research conducted on show has been done by ctw and then sent to a sympathetic press she charged that studies conducted by ctw hint at advocacy masquerading as social science in 2003 one of sesame street s international co productions sesame caused some controversy
