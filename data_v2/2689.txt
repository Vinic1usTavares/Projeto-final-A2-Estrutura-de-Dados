christina a widow when he married her was governess for children of henry mordaunt 4th baron mordaunt at drayton in northamptonshire and for this keyes gained use of horses and other amenities gunpowder plot english catholics had hoped that persecution of their faith would end when apparently more tolerant king james i succeeded queen elizabeth i but robert catesby a catholic zealot from ashby st ledgers remained unimpressed by new royal dynasty he therefore planned to kill james by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder following which he would help incite a popular revolt to install james s daughter princess elizabeth as titular queen his role being to guard gunpowder and other items stored at catesby s house in lambeth keyes joined conspiracy in october 1604 jesuit priest john gerard described keyes as a grave and sober man and of great wit and sufficiency father oswald tesimond claimed that keyes had tasted persecution himself having lost his goods because of it while historian and author cyril northcote parkinson s image of him was of a desperate man ruined and indebted tall with a red beard despite his relative poverty catesby declared him a trusty honest man and may have paid him for his services like fellow plotter guy fawkes he was thought capable of looking after himself several conspirators expressed concerns about safety of fellow catholics who would be at parliament on day of planned explosion keyes was particularly worried about lord mordaunt his wife s employer thomas percy was concerned for his patron henry percy 9th earl of northumberland and lords vaux montague monteagle and stourton were also mentioned keyes s suggestion to warn lord mordaunt was treated by catesby with derision when he answered that he would not

more near temple bar they were visited late that evening by fawkes in charge of explosives beneath house of lords who collected a watch left by percy for timing fuse several hours later fawkes was discovered guarding explosives and was arrested failure and death when keyes heard that fawkes had been captured he took to his horse and fled for midlands he was overtaken at highgate by rookwood who was rushing to inform catesby and others of what had transpired after he and rookwood had caught up with catesby percy thomas bates and john and christopher wright keyes left group and headed instead for lord mordaunt s house at drayton where he went to ground he was identified as a suspect on 6 november and captured several days later conspirators were tried on 27 january 1606 at westminster hall despite entering pleas of not guilty only digby professed his guilt all eight were found guilty they were each allowed to speak wherefore judgement of death should not be pronounced against them keyes made no attempt to excuse his actions claiming that death was as good now as at any other time preferable to living in midst of so much tyranny jesuit oswald tesimond wrote in his narrative of keyes s defence on 31 january 1606 keyes rookwood thomas wintour and fawkes were taken to old palace yard in westminster to be hanged drawn and quartered rookwood and wintour were first to ascend to gallows
