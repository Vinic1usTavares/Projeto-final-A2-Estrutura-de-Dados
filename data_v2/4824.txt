s knives are hard ground from differentially heat treated a2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel ground blades more accurately they are zero ground that is edge has no secondary bevel minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes emerson had long been impressed by cutting ability of chisel ground edge and had asked hartsfield s permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives which hartsfield granted when seals asked hartsfield to make them a folding knife he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to emerson who manufactured folding knives utilizing walker linerlock dockery 2004 according to seals requirements knife had to be corrosion resistant designed for easy cleaning in field durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool and capable as a weapon should need arise emerson s folding chisel ground tanto became sixth model in his viper series and while a handful of prototypes were referred to as viper 6 model was soon named cqc 6 cqc refers to close quarters combat and was chosen by seals for use writer david steele refers to cqc 6 as sixth model after five prototypes as opposed to next in evolution of viper line of knives emerson himself says moniker six was used because seals in question were members of seal team six ownership of a cqc6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of
