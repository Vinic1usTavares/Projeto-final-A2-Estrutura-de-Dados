hal sedgwick at telluride house in her time at cornell women had only recently been allowed to join telluride house and it still had a predominantly male membership as a result telluride house was reportedly a strongly masculine environment and proved a rich vein of experience for sedgwick to mine in her explorations of homosociality a term she popularized unlike perkins and feynman writer william t vollmann had an unfavourable view of house life and his experiences there in early 1980s he described house culture as elitist inbred and and criticized house members use of jargon such as
