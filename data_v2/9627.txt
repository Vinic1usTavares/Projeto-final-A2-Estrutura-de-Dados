own psyche it s almost like wrong program could be a mental disease she elaborated that fembot is not really about future or about space or anything saying that it is about present time technology is becoming more organic and using word fembot or robot in a song makes things more human to me she said in an interview with music website stereogum she explained that song also chronicles her personal

feelings too according to lindsey fortier of billboard fembot sees robyn get ting in touch with her urban side reception thumb left robyn performing fembot on body talk tour michael of musicomh wrote that though lyrics are daft it s exuberance and general sense of fun is so infectious that when chorus kicks in you barely notice what she s saying jer fairall of popmatters wrote look no further than wry chorus hook of fembot for proof of robyn s deftly subversive sense of humor fairall also pointed out that chorus might hint at first in direction of some blade runner esque sci fi pathos but robyn turns it towards a canny meta commentary on fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom fairall however thought that verses are nothing more than an inventory of titular bot s synthetic virtues ben norman of about com selected song as his favorite track on body talk pt 1 and wrote that fembot is incredibly quirky and well written robyn rap track that needs to be heard to be
