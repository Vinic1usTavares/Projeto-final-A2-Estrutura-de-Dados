siege of svetigrad began on 14 may 1448 when an ottoman army led by sultan murad ii besieged fortress of svetigrad now after many failed ottoman expeditions into albania against league of lezhe a confederation of albanian principalities created in 1444 and headed by skanderbeg murad ii decided to march an army into skanderbeg s dominions in order to capture key albanian fortress of svetigrad fortress lay on an important route between macedonia and albania and thus its occupation would give ottomans easy access into albania force prepared by murad was largest force with which ottomans had ever attacked skanderbeg murad planned to take fortress march into albanian interior and capture main citadel of kruje thus crushing albanian league at same time skanderbeg had been at war with venice realizing magnitude of his challenge skanderbeg attempted to relieve garrison by engaging in skirmishes with ottoman army his forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on turkish forces through guerrilla style attacks efforts were made by skanderbeg to use intelligence forces operating as far as constantinople to gather information on murad s plans of action meanwhile near scutari he had been able to defeat a venetian force and managed to considerably weaken venetian presence in albania despite these efforts on 31 july garrison of svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in water supply garrison was spared and a force of ottoman janissaries was stationed inside fortress instead two years later murad would march against kruje only to suffer a heavy defeat prelude in 1444 major princes of albanian principalities which up to that point had been vassals of ottoman empire united and formed league of lezhe an anti ottoman confederacy under skanderbeg s lead as a result ottoman empire sought to crush league and re establish control over albania as of 1448 all ottoman expeditions into albania had failed and murad ii chose lead a force in person into albanian territory and fragment league sultan decided to capture fortress of svetigrad this fortress served strategic purpose of protecting albanian eastern frontier while also allowing albanians to launch their own assaults on ottoman territory hodgkinson p 95 in late 1447 war began between venice and league but had not yet escalated into full scale conflict skanderbeg had declared war on venice as a result of a diplomatic impasse this left him open to invasion from east frasheri p 152 schmitt p 87 albanian intelligence groups informed skanderbeg main leader of revolt that a large ottoman army was preparing to march into albania number of which was reported by some as being as high as 170 000 this army however is likely to have contained no more than 80 000 soldiers nevertheless murad marched his army into monastir skanderbeg urgently called for material aid venice answer however was negative francione p 74 instead only aid received came from neapolitans and ragusans nonetheless murad soon marched into ohrid and black drin valley traveling near svetigrad in response skanderbeg strengthened garrisons of kruje svetigrad and berat by ordering populations around these fortress to take up arms francione p 76 shortly before ottoman siege began skanderbeg positioned himself and 4 000 cavalry from turkish camp franco p 98 force also included 8 000 other soldiers skanderbeg ordered that no campfires should be lit in order to keep his position secret moisi and muzaka of angelina were ordered with thirty horsemen to dress as peasants and enter fortress plot was discovered however and company was attacked but attackers were driven off upon returning to main ottoman camp one of commanding saw that this was one of skanderbeg s plots and sent 4 000 horsemen to find out where skanderbeg was camping by following moisi s band moisi led ottoman force into a valley and skanderbeg who was ready for such an enterprise surrounded valley with his forces when ottoman force was within distance albanians sprung ambush and ottoman force was annihilated this happened on 14 may 1448 after which murad ordered siege to begin franco p 99 siege ottoman arrival murad s force contained approximately 80 000 men and two cannons which could fire balls his army contained a fresh corps of janissaries and 3 000 debtors and bankrupts fighting to regain their freedom count of persuaded skanderbeg to incorporate a scorched earth strategy by destroying all supplies that might be used by ottoman army francione pp 76 77 ottoman force paraded around fortress and offered 300 000 turkish currency to those who would open gate and let ottoman army in fortress without a fight heralds proposing these offers went into fortress at night time and garrison commanders gave them a splendid dinner so that they would get impression that enemy was well prepared for a lengthy siege after dinner their offers were rejected and they were sent back to sultan hodgkinson p 97 size of ottoman army troubled skanderbeg because of effects it could have on morale of his soldiers and on local population which supported princes skanderbeg thus moved from village to village disguised as a common soldier and invoked fighting spirit of population as a result of this activity local chieftains agreed to fight ottomans and persuaded skanderbeg to draw up his plans in concert with theirs hodgkinson p 98 albanian guerrilla attacks to relieve garrison of svetigrad skanderbeg continually harassed ottoman army many of these attacks had been surprise ambushes of isolated ottoman forces hoping to evade ottoman patrols skanderbeg moved towards ottoman camp on 22 june skanderbeg led a night attack on ottoman camp which disillusioned ottoman soldiers who had been expecting a quiet campaign soon after when besiegers were taking their afternoon naps skanderbeg sent moses with some men again dressed as peasants inside ottoman camp to reconnoiter for a future assault hodgkinson p 99 skanderbeg spoke to his troops encouraging them not to take booty from camp as this might give ottoman forces time to react and launch a counterattack that night albanians launched their attack but noise of armor and neighing of horses inhibited a complete surprise periphery of camp was thrown into confusion but bulk of turkish troops gathered and organized themselves pushing albanians out of camp but not before suffering heavy casualties to prevent further attacks of this sort murad detached a contingent of troops under firuz pasha to watch albanians but it was prone to desertion and thoroughly destroyed with its baggage train being captured hodgkinson p 100 a breach in walls of svetigrad was made but following infantry assault was repulsed albanians began to hope that sultan would now be returning to edirne stalemate fighting had reached a stalemate and murad contemplated his next move he was advised to pillage countryside but surrounding fields had already been burned by skanderbeg sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into forests to prevent further casualties mehmed murad s son proposed leaving svetigrad to strike at kruje murad sternly rejected this reasoning that supplies to take svetigrad would have been wasted and that kruje would be more strongly defended than svetigrad sultan thus decided to remain at svetigrad in an attempt to starve garrison into submission hodgkinson 101 meanwhile garrison under leadership of peter perlati made several successful sorties against ottomans in order to ease encirclement and strengthen his soldiers morale surrender of fortress while campaigning against venetian forces skanderbeg managed to inflict a serious defeat on 23 july 1448 seriously weakening venetian power in albania frasheri p 155 siege of svetigrad continued however and marin barleti writes that ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into well of fortress forcing garrison to refuse to drink out of it it is more likely however that ottomans had cut off water supply and induced garrison to surrender noli p 199 note 95 given circumstance perlati promised a surrender if garrison were allowed a safe passage through ottoman lines prince mehmed suggested that garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred but murad rejected his son s proposal in fear that rebellion would only be intensified through such an act he decided to instead return garrisoning force to skanderbeg on 31 july 1448 garrison of svetigrad surrendered aftermath once fortress had been captured murad placed his own garrison of janissaries and ordered his men to repair walls perlati and his soldiers came to skanderbeg begging for mercy skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for surrender and even thanked them for holding out for as long as they did skanderbeg continued to shadow ottoman army as it headed back home in hopes of dealing some serious damage but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them hodgkinson p 103 in october of same year murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on john hunyadi s forces in kosovo frasheri p 161 skanderbeg had planned to join hunyadi s offensive with 20 000 men but he was not able to get there in time due to durad brankovic blocking roads to kosovo frasheri pp 159 160 loss of svetigrad allowed ottomans easy access into albania from northeast they could now launch three coordinated invasions from south southeast and northeast into albania a few weeks after siege mustafa pasha led 15 000 men into albania as requested by skanderbeg s venetian rivals only to be heavily defeated with mustafa being captured francione p 69 skanderbeg tried to regain svetigrad next year but he did not have proper artillery to do so he surrounded fortress but he realized that his position was hopeless and lifted siege in early 1450 turks would take berat through a night time stratagem and later that same year murad would besiege p 43 references sources category warfare by
