melniker and michael e uslan purchased film rights of batman from dc comics on october 3 1979 it was uslan s wish to make definitive dark serious version of batman way bob kane and bill finger had envisioned him in 1939 a creature of night stalking criminals in shadows richard maibaum was approached to write a script with guy hamilton to direct but two turned down offer uslan was unsuccessful with pitching batman to various movie studios because they wanted film to be similar to campy 1960s tv series columbia pictures and united artists were among those to turn down film a disappointed uslan then wrote a script titled return of batman to give film industry a better idea of his vision for film uslan later compared its dark tone to that of dark knight returns which his script pre dated by six years in november 1979 producers jon peters and peter guber joined project melniker and uslan became executive producers four felt it was best to pattern film s development after that of superman 1978 uslan melniker and guber pitched batman to universal pictures but studio turned it down michael uslan benjamin melniker peter guber tom mankiewicz sam hamm shadows of bat cinematic saga of dark knight road to gotham city 2005 warner home video though no movie studios were yet involved project was publicly announced with a budget of 15 million in july 1980 at comic art convention in new york warner bros studio behind successful superman film franchise decided to also accept and produce batman tom mankiewicz completed a script titled batman in june 1983 focusing on batman and dick grayson s origins with joker and rupert thorne as villains and silver st cloud as romantic interest mankiewicz took inspiration from limited series batman strange apparitions written by steve englehart comic book artist marshall rogers who worked with englehart on strange apparitions was hired for concept art batman was then announced in late 1983 for a mid 1985 release date on a budget of 20 million originally mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for batman william holden for james gordon david niven as alfred pennyworth and peter o toole as penguin whom mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature holden died in 1981 and niven in 1983 so this would never come to pass a number of filmmakers were attached to mankiewicz script including ivan reitman and joe dante reitman wanted to cast bill murray as batman and eddie murphy as robin nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers most of them were based on strange apparitions however it was mankiewicz s script that was still being used to guide project after financial success of pee wee s big adventure 1985 warner bros hired tim burton to direct batman burton had then girlfriend julie hickson write a new 30 page film treatment feeling previous script by mankiewicz was campy success of dark knight returns and batman killing joke rekindled warner bros interest in a film adaptation burton was initially not a comic book fan but he was impressed by dark and serious tone found in both dark knight returns and killing joke warner bros enlisted aid of englehart to write a new treatment in march 1986 like mankiewicz s script it was based on his own strange apparitions and included silver st cloud dick grayson joker and rupert thorne as well as a cameo appearance by penguin warner bros was impressed but englehart felt there were too many characters he removed penguin and dick grayson in his second treatment finishing in may 1986 burton approached sam hamm a comic book fan to write screenplay hamm decided not to use an origin story feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that unlocking mystery would become part of storyline he reasoned you totally destroy your credibility if you show literal process by which bruce wayne becomes batman hamm replaced silver st cloud with vicki vale and rupert thorne with his own creation carl grissom he completed his script in october 1986 which demoted dick grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character one scene in hamm s script had a young james gordon on duty night of murder of bruce wayne s parents when hamm s script was rewritten scene was deleted reducing it to a photo in gotham globe newspaper seen in film http wikia net images f f4 jpg revision latest cb warner bros was less willing to move forward on development despite their enthusiasm for hamm s script which kane greeted with positive feedback hamm s script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in united states batman was finally given greenlight to commence pre production in april 1988 after success of burton s beetlejuice 1988 when comic book fans found out about burton directing film with michael keaton starring in lead role controversy arose over tone and direction batman was going in hamm explained they hear tim burton s name and they think of pee wee s big adventure they hear keaton s name and they think of any number of michael keaton comedies you think of 1960s version of batman and it was complete opposite of our film we tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone but fans didn t believe us to combat negative reports on film s production kane was hired as creative consultant batman s co creator bill finger was uncredited at time of film s release and his name was not added to any batman related media until 2016 casting thumb right 195px michael keaton as batman and kim basinger as vicki vale parallel to superman casting a who s who of hollywood top stars were considered for role of batman including mel gibson kevin costner charlie sheen tom selleck bill murray harrison ford and dennis quaid burton was pressured by warner bros to cast an obvious action movie star and had approached pierce brosnan but he had no interest in playing a comic book character burton was originally interested in casting an unknown actor and offered ray liotta a chance to audition after having completed something wild but liotta declined a decision he regrets willem dafoe who was falsely reported to be considered for joker had actually been considered for batman early in development producer jon peters suggested michael keaton arguing he had right edgy tormented quality after having seen his dramatic performance in clean and sober john peters death of superman lives what happened

canton michael keaton shadows of bat cinematic saga of dark knight gathering storm 2005 warner home video kane hamm and uslan also heavily questioned casting obviously there was a negative response from comic book people i think they thought we were going to make it like 1960s tv series and make it campy because they thought of michael keaton from mr mom and night shift and stuff like that keaton studied dark knight returns for inspiration brad dourif tim curry david bowie john lithgow and james woods were considered for joker lithgow during his audition attempted to talk burton out of casting him a decision he would later publicly regret stating i didn t realize it was such a big deal burton wanted to cast dourif but studio refused robin williams lobbied hard for part jack nicholson had been uslan s and kane s choice since 1980 peters approached nicholson as far back as 1986 during filming of witches of eastwick unlike keaton he was a popular choice for role nicholson had what was known as an off clock agreement his contract specified number of hours he was entitled to have off each day from time he left set to time he reported back for filming as well as being off for los angeles lakers home games nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three week block schedule lapsed into 106 days as well as top billing on promotional materials he received a 6

originally supposed to die by joker s poison gas in climax but filmmakers liked my character so much wuhl said that they decided to let me live robert wuhl billy dee williams pat hingle batman heroes 2005 warner home video burton chose billy dee williams as harvey dent because he wanted to include villain two face in a future film using concept of an african american two face for black and white

william hootkins as lt eckhardt and jack palance as crime boss carl grissom design burton had been impressed with design of neil jordan s company of wolves 1984 but was unable to hire its production designer anton furst for beetlejuice as furst had instead committed to jordan s london filmed ghost comedy high spirits 1988 a choice he later regretted a year later burton successfully hired furst for batman and they enjoyed working with each other i don t think i ve ever felt so naturally in tune with a director furst said conceptually spiritually visually or artistically there was never any problem because we never fought over anything texture attitude and feelings are what burton is a master at furst and art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to make gotham city ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable anton furst derek meddings visualizing gotham production design of batman 2005 warner home video furst continued w e imagined what new york city might have become without a planning commission a city run by crime with a riot of architectural styles an essay in ugliness as if hell erupted through pavement and kept on going 1985 film brazil by terry gilliam was also a notable influence upon film s production design as both burton and furst studied it as a reference black and white charcoal drawings of key locations and sets were created by furst s longtime draftsman nigel phelps derek meddings served as visual effects supervisor over seeing miniatures and animation conceptual illustrator julian designed batmobile batwing and assorted bat gadgets that were later constructed by prop builder john evans keith short sculpted final body of 1989 batmobile adding two browning machine guns keith short building batmobile 2005 warner home video on designing batmobile furst explained we looked at jet aircraft components we looked at war machines we looked at all sorts of things in end we went into pure expressionism taking salt flat racers of 30s and sting ray macho machines of 50s car was built upon a chevrolet impala when previous development with a jaguar and ford mustang failed costume designer bob ringwood turned down chance to work on licence to kill in favor of batman ringwood found it difficult designing batsuit because image of batman in comics is this huge big six foot four hunk with a dimpled chin michael keaton is a guy with average build he stated problem was to make somebody who was average sized and ordinary looking into this bigger than life creature burton commented michael is a bit claustrophobic which made it worse for him costume put him in a dark batman like mood though so he was able to use it to his advantage burton s idea was to use an all black suit and was met with positive feedback by bob kane vin burnham was tasked with sculpting batsuit in association with alli jon peters wanted to use a nike product placement with batsuit bob ringwood tim burton designing batsuit 2005 warner home video ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration 28 sculpted latex designs were created 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made accumulating a total cost of 250 000 comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against batsuit burton opted not to use tights spandex or underpants as seen in comic book feeling it was not intimidating prosthetic makeup designer nick dudman used acrylic based makeup paint called pax for nicholson s chalk white face part of nicholson s contract was approval over makeup designer filming thumb right 300px knebworth house served as wayne manor in film filmmakers considered filming batman entirely on warner bros backlot in burbank california but media interest in film made them change location it was shot at pinewood studios in england from october 1988 to january 1989 18 sound stages were used almost entirety of pinewood s 95 acre backlot locations included knebworth house and hatfield house doubling for wayne manor plus acton lane power station and little barford power station hanke p 87 96 original production budget escalated from 30 million to 48 million filming was highly secretive unit publicist was offered and refused ps10 000 for first pictures of jack nicholson as joker police were later called in when two reels of footage about 20 minutes worth were stolen with various problems during filming burton called it torture worst period of my life hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during 1988 writers guild of america strike warren skaaren who had also worked on burton s beetlejuice did rewrites jonathan gems and charles mckeown rewrote script during filming salisbury burton p 145 only skaaren received screenplay credit with hamm hamm criticized rewrites but blamed changes on warner bros burton explained i don t understand why that became such a problem we started out with a script that everyone liked although we recognized it needed a little work dick grayson appeared in shooting script but was deleted as filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to plot kane supported this decision keaton used his comedic experience for scenes such as bruce and vicki s wayne manor dinner he called himself a logic freak and was concerned that batman s secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover keaton discussed ideas with burton to better disguise character including use of contact lenses ultimately keaton decided to perform batman s voice at a lower register than when he was portraying bruce wayne which became a hallmark of film version of character with christian bale later using same technique originally in climax joker was to kill vicki vale sending batman into a vengeful fury jon peters reworked climax without telling burton and commissioned production designer anton furst to create a model of cathedral this cost 100 000 when film was already well over budget burton disliked idea having no clue how scene would end here were jack nicholson and kim basinger walking up this cathedral and halfway up jack turns around and says why am i walking up all these stairs where am i going we ll talk about it when you get to top i had to tell him that i didn t know music burton hired danny elfman of oingo boingo his collaborator on pee wee s big adventure and beetlejuice to compose music score for inspiration elfman was given dark knight returns elfman was worried as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale danny elfman tim burton nocturnal overtures music of batman 2005 warner home video in addition producer jon peters was skeptical of hiring elfman but was later convinced when he heard opening number peters and peter guber wanted prince to write music for joker and michael jackson to do romance songs elfman would then combine style of prince and jackson s songs together for entire film score burton protested ideas citing my movies aren t commercial like top gun elfman enlisted help of oingo boingo lead guitarist steve bartek and shirley walker to arrange compositions for orchestra elfman was later displeased with audio mixing of his film score batman was done in england by technicians who didn t care and non caring showed he stated i m not putting down england because they ve done gorgeous dubs there but this particular crew elected not to batman was one of first films to spawn two soundtracks one of them featured songs written by prince while other showcased elfman s score both were successful and compilations of elfman s opening credits were used in title sequence theme for batman animated series also composed by shirley walker themes thumb 225px batman and joker face off in a scene dubbed duel of freaks when discussing central theme of batman director tim burton explained whole film and mythology of character is a complete duel of freaks it s a fight between two disturbed people adding that joker is such a great character because there s a complete freedom to him any character who operates on outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has freedom to do what they want they are darker sides of freedom insanity is in some scary way most freedom you can have because you re not bound by laws of society burton saw bruce wayne as bearer of a double identity exposing one while hiding reality from world burton biographer ken hanke wrote that bruce wayne struggling with his alter ego as batman is depicted as an antihero hanke felt that batman has to push boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals such as joker kim newman theorized that burton and writers saw batman and joker as a dramatic antithesis and film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent batman conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines notably design of gotham city stylized with art deco design richard corliss writing for time observed that gotham s design was a reference to films such as cabinet of dr caligari 1920 and metropolis 1927 gotham city despite being shot on a studio backlot he continued is literally another character in script it has demeaning presence of german expressionism and fascist architecture staring down at citizens hanke further addressed notions of batman being a period piece in that citizens cops people and black and white television looks like it takes place in 1939 but later said had filmmakers made vicki vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress this could have made batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir portions of climax pay homage to vertigo 1958 marketing production designer anton furst conceived of idea for teaser poster which he called evocative but ubiquitous only featuring bat symbol not too much and not too little final airbrush painting of logo was created by bill garland for b d fox ad agency earlier designs had word batman spelled in robocop or conan barbarian type font jon peters unified all film s tie ins even turning down 6 million from general motors to build batmobile because car company would not relinquish creative control during production peters read in wall street journal that comic book fans were unsatisfied with casting of michael keaton in response peters rushed first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during christmas it was simply an assemblage of scenes without music but created enormous

than a great movie despite initial negative reactions from comics fans prior to film s release keaton s portrayal of batman was generally praised patrick july 1998 dark knight triumphant wizard p 208 james berardinelli called film entertaining with highlight being production design however he concluded best thing that can be said about batman is that it led to batman returns which was a far superior effort variety felt jack nicholson stole every scene but still greeted film with positive feedback roger ebert was highly impressed with production design but claimed batman is a triumph of design over story style over substance a great looking movie with a plot you can t care much about he also called film a depressing experience his reviewing partner gene siskel disagreed describing
