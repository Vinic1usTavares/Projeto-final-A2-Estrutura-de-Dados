three fingered jack is a summit of a shield volcano of cascade range in u s state of oregon formed during pleistocene epoch mountain consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava and was heavily glaciated in past while other oregon volcanoes that were heavily glaciated such as mount washington and mount thielsen display eroded volcanic necks three fingered jack s present summit is a comparatively narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only thick on a generally north south axis radiating dikes and plugs that support this summit have been exposed by glaciation volcano has long been inactive and has been highly eroded diverse flora and fauna can be found surrounding three fingered jack area around volcano was historically inhabited by molala people one of indigenous groups in northwestern united states not much is known about their culture other than that group fished for salmon and collected berries fruits obsidian and dried herbs first person of non indigenous descent to reach area was david douglas in 1825 followed by peter skene ogden following year first group to ascend volcano reached its summit in september 1923 three fingered jack can still be climbed but when its face becomes foggy climbers can become disoriented due to low visibility conditions of climbing mountain requiring rescue geography three fingered jack lies in u s state of oregon in linn and jefferson counties it has a volume of and a summit elevation of with a proximal topographic relief of and a draping relief of its jagged edifice rises between mount jefferson and three sisters volcanic complex three fingered jack lies within mount jefferson wilderness and is not accessible by paved road but can be approached by pacific crest trail located about northwest of city of sisters it acts as a prominent landmark in area mount jefferson wilderness lies within willamette national forest and deschutes national forest wilderness area covers with more than 150 lakes it also has of trails including of pacific crest national scenic trail three fingered jack and mount jefferson are both prominent features of wilderness area physical geography thumb jack glacier and summit lake in summer alt a lake on slope of three fingered jack can be seen next to ice of a glacier during last major advance of glacial ice in area during wisconsin glaciation lateral and terminal moraines formed along with glacial striations altered vegetation patterns and lithologies that suggest glacial transport of material sole glacier remaining on volcano is unofficially named jack glacier located in a shaded cirque on northeast side because glacier is covered by tall ridges to south and west it resides at an unusually low altitude for central oregon cascades jack glacier has an area of though historically it has reached estimated areas of up to it is likely stagnant during little ice age which spanned roughly 1350 to 1850 glacier produced moraines with heights close to which are dotted with of ash from sand mountain cinder cone chain and of ash from blue lake crater cinder cone as of 1993 moraine for jack glacier dammed a lake with a volume of a surface area of and a maximum depth of though this lake did not appear on united states geological survey topographic maps made during 1920s its presence was documented by a report in 1937 lake sits precariously moraines on volcano are steep unstable and populated with boulders before september of 1960 there was a partial breach of this moraine dammed lake that covered an area of near moraine s base since 1960 there have been at least two incidents in which moraine dammed lakes on volcano have caused floods down slopes local soil is thin and it has been buried by a layer of weathered holocene tephra from three fingered jack which has a maximum thickness of ecology thumb a herd of mountain goats seen on flank of three fingered jack alt mountain goats seen on bare rocky slope of volcano to right of a forested area along

animals in vicinity roughly half lakes in mount jefferson wilderness area contain rainbow trout geology and subfeatures thumb three fingered jack as seen from santiam lake alt three fingered jack can be seen in top left of image with a heavily forested area and a lake beneath three fingered jack is a shield volcano and it is part of group of volcanoes known as oregon s whose tall pinnacle spires resemble matterhorn in switzerland volcano along with mount thielsen mount bailey diamond peak and mount washington had a shorter lifespan than larger volcanoes in cascade range ceasing eruptive activity more than 100 000 years ago three fingered jack marks northernmost point for this group south of mount jefferson high cascades of oregon consist of a broad ridge produced by shield volcano activity and eruptions from cinder cones vents range from deeply eroded complexes to recently active volcanoes with most of region mantled by normally polarized rock produced within past 730 000 years mountain also forms part of a group of more than 30 large shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes that form a segment of pleistocene to holocene epoch volcanic vents that produced mafic lava rich in magnesium and iron three fingered jack includes several overlapping cinder cones and composite cones over underlying lava flows from shield volcano activity these volcanic edifices and their lava flow deposits cover an area of between three fingered jack and north sister volcano and among recently active basalt lava fields there is an array of cinder cones encompassing an area of thumb left three fingered jack has a dissected jagged appearance alt volcano s bare dissected edifice rises above a forested region major edifice which consists of light gray basaltic andesite lava flow deposits sits to west of first tephra cone variegated pyroclastic rock is embedded among these flows element abundance analysis suggests that lava in three fingered jack area can be grouped into discrete units based on its source magma chamber except for jorn lake basalt produced by underlying shield volcano and basaltic andesite erupted by three fingered jack analysis shows high and low pressures for crystallization of these lava flow deposits and that basaltic andesite was distinct from basalt due to longer fractionation times though three fingered jack does not have a high level conduit filling volcanic plug its summit sits atop a pyroclastic cone another cone lies to south of major cone and there are secondary craters on sides as well as radial dikes and volcanic plugs known subfeatures include two shield volcanoes maxwell butte less eroded than three fingered jack and turpentine peak which have elevations of and respectively there are six additional known volcanic cones duffy butte at an elevation of hogg rock a tuya at an elevation of marion mountain at an elevation of red butte with an elevation of and marion peak and saddle mountain which do not have elevations listed other shield volcanoes and cinder cones that were active during pleistocene epoch occur to northwest and southwest volcano has a long ridge that trends from north to south it is highly eroded shaped like a sawtooth it consists of tephra deposits supported by a vertical dike with a thickness of erosion has been so extensive that climbers claim that summit moves in wind during pleistocene epoch glaciers exposed its inner contents providing evidence for its eruptive history though it has not been dated by radiometric approaches volcano is likely between 500 000 and 250 000 years old and has been carved out by at least three glacial periods eruptive history three fingered jack shows a similar eruptive history to many high cascade volcanoes activity began with formation of a pyroclastic cone over shield volcanoes later eruptions formed a main volcanic cone from lava flows and more pyroclastic rock there are dikes that radiate from a plug which deformed tephra in surrounding strata northern and southern flanks of three fingered jack feature lava flows made of olivine and augite basalt three fingered jack is estimated to be between 500 000 and 250 000 years old it underwent more explosive eruptions as its eruptive history progressed generating large amounts of tephra which created a loose unconsolidated summit and upper cone lava flows near summit have an average thickness of secondary volcanic craters produced lava flows and pyroclastic material which traveled both north and south of volcano cone building eruptions ceased before pleistocene epoch s glacial period allowing expanded glacial cover to remove most of cone especially on eastern and northeastern sides during ongoing holocene epoch there has been volcanic activity between three sisters volcanoes and three fingered jack such eruptive episodes have produced tephra and lava flows that cover several hundred square kilometers in region these eruptions occurred after climactic eruption of mount mazama which took place roughly 6 600 years ago human history surrounding area has traditionally been inhabited by molala people one of indigenous groups in northwestern united states group fished for salmon collecting berries fruits obsidian and dried herbs their culture was not well documented first person of non indigenous descent to reach area was david douglas in 1825 followed by peter skene ogden following year sources disagree about affiliation of mountain s first ascenders some calling them boys from bend others saying they were members of mountaineering club nonetheless a source written by one of these first ascenders clearly states who was in party and when they climbed ervin mcneal phil armin wilbur watkins leo and ronald sellars were first to ascend three fingered jack on september 3 1923 origins of three fingered jack s name remain unclear one account claims that volcano received its name from joaquin murrieta a gold miner and vaquero during california gold rush also known as three fingered jack others allege that volcano was named after a trapper with less than five fingers on one of his hands recreation three fingered jack s surrounding area can be hiked offering views of volcano canyon creek meadows hiking trail begins at jack lake progresses through mount jefferson wilderness and runs for about it has an elevation gain of and can be hiked by children and families an additional connected hiking trail runs for another up rocky glacial washout plain adjacent to volcano becoming steeper as it approaches three fingered jack and gaining in elevation base can also be reached on pacific crest trail 2000 which runs for round trip and offers views of volcano and its summit lake moreover three fingered jack loop trail runs for around volcano gaining in elevation when three fingered jack s face becomes foggy climbers have become disoriented due to low visibility conditions of climbing mountain requiring rescue notes a sources disagree on volcano s height national oceanic and atmospheric administration and global volcanism program lists it at wood and 1990 list its elevation as and geographic names information system lists it at b according to hildreth s definitions proximal relief refers to difference between summit elevation and highest exposure of old rocks under main edifice while draping relief marks difference between summit elevation and edifice s lowest distal lava flows excluding pyroclastic and debris flows c hildreth 2007 lists three fingered jack as a stratovolcano as do o connor harrison and costa 2001 and scott 1977 references
