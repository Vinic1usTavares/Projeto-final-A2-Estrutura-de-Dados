intention of having students learn about information encoding which is process of converting a piece of information into another form or representation torv later remarked in a dvd special featurette

many key details were provided by characters who don t often serve that function such as with broyles and numbers stations he called it a terrific almost astrid centric episode los angeles times writer andrew hanson enjoyed episode s many puzzles and expressed appreciation for first people revelation as well as walternate s long con concerning doomsday device hanson was skeptical that peter had not yet figured out fauxlivia s true identity but praised anna torv s performance anyone who doubted her acting chops in first couple of seasons should be eating their words like andrew hanson a v club s noel murray called introduction of first people a masterstroke on part of fringe writers murray graded episode with a b explaining it was a strange fringe for me dialogue was often painfully expository with liberal doses of adr to make sure that we viewers didn t miss any of massive amounts of significant information we need to understand as story moves forward and yet episode was also funky and philosophical in way i like my fringe to be using plot and even setting to put across more than just pieces of series mythology fearnet critic alyse wax wrote this episode made my brain hurt and i mean that in nicest way possible they were throwing a lot of weird shit at us it was great because i feel like we are finally getting answers like we will finally get some closure and just maybe get rid of red universe this episode was so ridiculously dense i am sure i missed some of deeper scientific facts i got gist of it though and frankly i much prefer these jam packed episodes i like when puzzle pieces start falling into place it s calming sfscope s sarah stegall believed episode start ed out interestingly enough but unlike other reviewers she was very critical of first people mythology stating this is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended it got up and walked out of room i still don t like premise of evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind it s more like fantasy than science fiction stegall praised torv s acting as she plays two people very subtly very convincingly and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch series because she trusts writers will supply us with plausible answers from time to time but is losing some respect for it references external links 6955 khz at fox category
