thumb illustration for to autumn by william james neatby from a day with keats 1899 alt drawing of trees with orange and red leaves with a lake at bottom and hills in distance to autumn is a poem by english romantic poet john keats 31 october 1795 23 february 1821 work was composed on 19 september 1819 and published in 1820 in a volume of keats s poetry that included lamia and eve of st agnes to autumn is final work in a group of poems known as keats s 1819 odes although personal problems left him little time to devote to poetry in 1819 he composed to autumn after a walk near winchester one autumnal evening work marks end of his poetic career as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to lifestyle of a poet a little over a year following publication of to autumn keats died in rome poem has three eleven line stanzas which describe a progression through season from late maturation of crops to harvest and to last days of autumn when winter is nearing imagery is richly achieved through personification of autumn and description of its bounty its sights and sounds it has parallels in work of english landscape artists bewell 1999 p 176 with keats himself describing fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as conveying warmth of some pictures bate 1963 p 580 work has been interpreted as a meditation on death as an allegory of artistic creation as keats s response to peterloo massacre which took place in same year and as an expression of nationalist sentiment one of most anthologised english lyric poems to autumn has been regarded by critics as one of most perfect short poems in english language background thumb left sketch of keats by charles brown august 1819 one month before composition of to autumn alt portrait in pencil of a man in his mid twenties with medium length curly hair he is leaning on his right arm and faces right he is wearing a white jacket during spring of 1819 keats wrote many of his major odes ode on a grecian urn ode on indolence ode on melancholy ode to a nightingale and ode to psyche after month of may he began to pursue other forms of poetry including verse tragedy otho great in collaboration with friend and roommate charles brown second half of lamia and a return to his unfinished epic hyperion bate 1963 pp 526 562 his efforts from spring until autumn were dedicated completely to a career in poetry alternating between writing long and short poems and setting himself a goal to compose more than fifty lines of verse each day in his free time he also read works as varied as robert burton s anatomy of melancholy thomas chatterton s poetry and leigh hunt s essays gittings 1968 pp 269 270 although keats managed to write many poems in 1819 he was suffering from a multitude of financial troubles throughout year including concerns over his brother george who after emigrating to america was badly in need of money despite these distractions on 19 september 1819 he found time to write to autumn poem marks final moment of his career as a poet no longer able to afford to devote his time to composition of poems he began working on more lucrative projects keats s declining health and personal responsibilities also raised obstacles to his continuing poetic efforts motion 1999 p 461 on 19 september 1819 keats walked near winchester along river itchen in a letter to his friend john hamilton reynolds written on 21 september keats described impression scene had made upon him and its influence on composition of to autumn how beautiful season is now how fine air a temperate sharpness about it i never lik d stubble fields so much as now somehow a stubble plain looks warm in same way that some pictures look warm this struck me so much in my sunday s walk that i composed upon it keats 2008 p 184 not everything on keats s mind at time was bright poet knew in september that he would have to finally abandon hyperion thus in letter that he wrote to reynolds keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem bate 1963 p 585 keats did not send to autumn to reynolds but did include poem within a letter to richard woodhouse keats s publisher and friend and dated it on same day evert 1965 pp 296 297 poem was revised and included in keats s 1820 collection of poetry titled lamia isabella eve of st agnes and other poems although publishers taylor and feared kind of bad reviews that had plagued keats s 1818 edition of endymion they were willing to publish collection after removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure that there would be no politically motivated reviews that could give volume a bad reputation mcgann 1979 pp 988 989 poem right thumb manuscript copy of to autumn page 1 alt a white sheet of paper that is completely filled with a poem in cursive

original manuscript of john keats s poem to autumn season of mists and mellow fruitfulness close bosom friend of maturing sun conspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit vines that round thatch eves run to bend with apples moss d cottage trees and fill all fruit with ripeness to core to swell gourd and plump hazel shells with a sweet kernel to set budding more and still more later flowers for bees until they think warm days will never cease for summer has o er brimm d their clammy cells who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find thee sitting careless on a granary floor thy hair soft lifted by winnowing wind or on a half reap d furrow sound asleep drows d with fume of poppies while thy hook spares next swath and all its twined flowers and sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep steady thy laden head across a brook or by a cider press with patient look thou last hours by hours where are songs of spring ay where are they think not of them thou hast thy music too while barred clouds bloom soft dying day and touch stubble plains with rosy hue then in a choir small gnats mourn among river borne aloft or sinking as light wind lives or dies and full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn hedge crickets sing and now with treble soft red breast whistles from a garden croft and gathering swallows twitter in skies themes to autumn describes in its three stanzas three different aspects of season its fruitfulness its labour and its ultimate decline through stanzas there is a progression from early autumn to mid autumn and then to heralding of winter parallel to this poem depicts day turning from morning to afternoon and into dusk these progressions are joined with a shift from tactile sense to that of sight and then of sound creating a three part symmetry which is not present in keats s other odes sperry 1973 p 337 as poem progresses autumn is represented metaphorically as one who conspires who ripens fruit who harvests who makes music first stanza of poem represents autumn as involved with promotion of natural processes growth and ultimate maturation two forces in opposition in nature but together creating impression that season will not end bate 1963 p 582 in this stanza fruits are still ripening and buds still opening in warm weather stuart sperry says that keats emphasises tactile sense here suggested by imagery of growth and gentle motion swelling bending and thumb left harvested field hampshire in second stanza autumn is personified as a harvester full personification of autumn emerges only in second stanza mcfarland 2000 p 222 to be seen by viewer in various guises performing labouring tasks essential to provision of food for coming year there is a lack of definitive action all motion being gentle autumn is not depicted as actually harvesting but as seated resting or watching in lines 14 15 personification of autumn is as an exhausted labourer near end of stanza steadiness of gleaner in lines 19 20 again emphasises a within poem wagner 1996 pp 110 111 progression through day is revealed in actions that are all suggestive of drowsiness of afternoon harvested grain is being harvester is asleep or returning home last drops issue from cider press last stanza contrasts autumn s sounds with those of spring sounds that are presented are not only those of autumn but essentially gentle sounds of evening gnats wail and lambs bleat in dusk as night approaches within final moments of song death is slowly approaching alongside end of year full grown lambs like grapes gourds and hazel nuts will be harvested for winter twittering swallows gather for departure leaving fields bare whistling red breast and chirping cricket are common sounds of winter references to spring growing lambs and migrating swallows remind reader that seasons are a cycle widening scope of this stanza from a single season to life in general bate 1963 pp 582 583 of all of keats s poems to autumn with its catalogue of concrete images sperry 1973 p 341 most closely describes a paradise as realized on earth while also focusing on archetypal symbols connected with season within poem autumn represents growth maturation and finally an approaching death there is a fulfilling union between ideal and real bate 1963 pp 581 583 scholars have noted a number of literary influences on to autumn from virgil s georgics o rourke 1998 p 173 to edmund spenser s mutability cantos helen vendler discussed in o rourke 1998 p 165 to language of thomas chatterton hartman 1975 p 100 bewell 1999 pp 182 183 to samuel taylor coleridge s frost at midnight bloom 1968 p 96 to an essay on autumn by leigh hunt which keats had recently read bewell 1999 p 178 to autumn is thematically connected to other odes that keats wrote in 1819 for example in his ode to melancholy a major theme is acceptance of process of life when this theme appears later in to autumn bate 1962 p 522 however it is with a difference this time figure of poet disappears and there is no exhortation of an imaginary reader there are no open conflicts and dramatic debate protest and qualification are absent bate 1963 p 581 in process there is a harmony between finality of death and hints of renewal of life in cycle of seasons paralleled by renewal of a single day bate 1963 p 583 critics have tended to emphasize different aspects of process some have focused on renewal walter jackson bate points to theme of each stanza including its contrary idea here death implying though only indirectly renewal of life also noted by both bate and jennifer wagner structure of verse reinforces sense of something to come placing of couplet before end of each stanza creates a feeling of suspension highlighting theme of continuation others like harold bloom have emphasized exhausted landscape completion finality of death although winter descends here as a man might hope to die with a natural sweetness if death in itself is final here it comes with a lightness a softness also pointing to an acceptance of process beyond possibility of grief bloom 1968 pp 95 97 progress of growth is no longer necessary maturation is complete and life and death are in harmony rich description of cycle of seasons enables reader to feel a belonging to something larger than self as james o rourke expresses it but cycle comes to an end each year analogous to ending of single life o rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied at end of poem o rourke 1998 p 177 although unlike other great odes in this poem person of poet is entirely submerged so there is at most a faint hint of keats s own possible fear according to helen vendler to autumn may be seen as an allegory of artistic creation as farmer processes fruits of soil into what sustains human body so artist processes experience of life into a symbolic structure that may sustain human spirit this process involves an element of self sacrifice by artist analogous to living grain s being sacrificed for human consumption in to autumn as a result of this process rhythms of harvesting artist goddess permeate whole world until all visual tactile and kinetic presence is into music for ear sounds of poem itself vendler 1988 pp 124 125 in a 1979 essay jerome mcgann argued that while poem was indirectly influenced by historical events keats had deliberately ignored political landscape of 1819 mcgann 1979 pp 988 1032 countering this view andrew bennett nicholas roe and others focused on what they believed were political allusions actually present in poem roe arguing for a direct connection to peterloo massacre of 1819 strachan 2003 p 175 later paul fry argued against mcgann s stance when he pointed out it scarcely seems pertinent to say that to autumn is therefore an evasion of social violence when it is so clearly an encounter with death itself it is not a politically encoded escape from history reflecting coerced betrayal of its author s radicalism mcgann thinks to rescue keats from imputation of political naivete by saying that he was a radical browbeaten into quietism fry 1995 pp 123 124 more recently in 2012 a specific probable location of cornfield that inspired keats was discussed in an article by richard marggraf turley jayne archer and howard thomas which draws upon new archival evidence traditionally water meadows south of winchester along which keats took daily leisurely walks were assumed to have provided sights and sounds of his ode marggraf turley archer and thomas argue that ode was more directly inspired by keats s visit to st giles s hill site of a new cornfield at eastern extremity of market city land previously a copse had recently been turned over to food production to take advantage of high bread prices this new topography authors argue enables us to see hitherto unsuspected dimensions to keats s engagement with contemporary politics in particular as they pertained to management of food production and supply wages and productivity site now lies under a multi storey car park in his 1999 study of effect on british literature of diseases and climates of colonies alan bewell read landscape of to autumn as a kind of biomedical allegory of coming into being of english climatic space out of its dangerous geographical alternatives bewell 1999 p 177 britain s colonial reach over previous century and a half had exposed mother country to foreign diseases and awareness of dangers of extreme tropical climates keats with medical training bewell 1999 p 162 having suffered chronic illness himself bewell 1999 p 163 and influenced like his contemporaries by colonial medical discourse bewell 1999 p 231 was deeply aware of this threat according to bewell landscape of to autumn presents temperate climate of rural england as a healthful alternative to disease ridden foreign environments bewell 1999 p 182 though clammy aspect of fever excessive ripeness associated with tropical climates intrude into poem these elements less prominent than in keats s earlier poetry are counterbalanced by dry crisp autumnal air of rural england in presenting particularly english elements of this environment keats was also influenced by contemporary poet and essayist leigh hunt who had recently written of arrival of autumn with its migration of birds finished harvest making and migration of swallows as well as by english landscape painting and pure english idiom of poetry of thomas chatterton bewell 1999 pp 182 83 in to autumn bewell argues keats was at once voicing a very personal expression of desire for health bewell 1999 p 183 and constructing a myth of a national environment this political element in poem bewell points out has also been suggested by geoffrey hartman who expounded a view of to autumn as an ideological poem whose form expresses a national idea hartman 1975 p 88 qtd in bewell 1999 p 176 thomas mcfarland on other hand in 2000 cautioned against overemphasizing political social or historical readings of poem which distract from its consummate surface and bloom mcfarland quotes shelley mcfarland 2000 pp 224 25 most important about to autumn is its concentration of imagery and allusion in its evocation of nature mcfarland 2000 pp 223 24 conveying an interpenetration of and as contained in very nature of autumn mcfarland 2000 p 221 structure to autumn is a poem of three stanzas each of eleven lines like others of keats s odes written in 1819 structure is that of an hymn having three clearly defined sections corresponding to classical divisions of strophe and bate 1963 p 499 stanzas differ from those of other odes through use of eleven lines rather than ten and have a couplet placed before concluding line of each stanza bate 1962 pp 182 184 to autumn employs poetical techniques which keats had perfected in five poems written in spring of same year but departs from them in some aspects dispensing with narrator and dealing with more concrete concepts bate 1963 pp 581 582 there is no dramatic movement in to autumn as there is in many earlier poems poem progresses in its focus while showing little change in objects it is focusing on there is in words of walter jackson bate a union of process and stasis energy caught in repose an effect that keats himself termed stationing bate 1963 pp 581 584 at beginning of third stanza he employs dramatic ubi sunt device associated with a sense of melancholy and questions personified subject where are songs of spring flesch 2009 p 170 like other odes to autumn is written in iambic pentameter but greatly modified from very beginning with five stressed syllables to a line each usually preceded by an unstressed syllable blades 2002 p 104 keats varies this form by employment of augustan inversion sometimes using a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable at beginning of a line including first season of mists and mellow fruitfulness and employing in which two stressed syllables are placed together at beginnings of both following stanzas adding emphasis to questions that are asked who hath not seen thee where are songs rhyme of to autumn follows a pattern of starting each stanza with an abab pattern which is followed by rhyme scheme of in first verse and in second and third stanzas in each case there is a couplet before final line some of language of to autumn resembles phrases found in earlier poems with similarities to endymion sleep and poetry and ridley 1933 pp 283 285 keats characteristically uses monosyllabic words such as how to load and bless with fruit vines that round thatch eves run words are weighted by emphasis of bilabial consonants b m p with lines like for summer has o er brimm d their clammy cells there is also an emphasis on long vowels which control flow of poem giving it a slow measured pace while barred clouds bloom soft dying day between manuscript version and published version of to autumn keats tightened language of poem one of keats s changes emphasised by critics is change in line 17 of drows d with red poppies to drows d with fume of poppies which emphasises sense of smell instead of sight later edition relies more on passive past participles as apparent in change of while a gold cloud in line 25 to while barred clouds bate 1962 p 183 other changes involve strengthening of phrases especially within transformation of phrase in line 13 whoever seeks for thee may find into whoever seeks abroad may find many of lines within second stanza were completely rewritten especially those which did not fit into a rhyme scheme some of minor changes involved adding punctuation missing from original manuscript copy and altering capitalisation ridley 1933 pp 285 287 critical reception critical and scholarly praise has been unanimous in declaring to autumn one of most perfect poems in english language a c swinburne placed it with ode on a grecian urn as nearest to absolute perfection of keats s odes aileen ward declared it keats s most perfect and untroubled poem and douglas bush has stated that poem is flawless in structure texture tone and rhythm bennett 1991 qtd p 159 walter evert in 1965 stated that to autumn is only perfect poem that keats ever wrote and if this should seem to take from him some measure of credit for his extraordinary enrichment of english poetic tradition i would quickly add that i am thinking of absolute perfection in whole poems in which every part is wholly relevant to and consistent in effect with every other part evert 1965 p 298 early reviews of to autumn focused on it as part of keats s collection of poems lamia isabella eve of st agnes and other poems an anonymous critic in july 1820 monthly review claimed this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy and even a of latter faculty is displayed in his lines on autumn which bring reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember if we did not fear that young as is mr k his peculiarities are fixed beyond all power of criticism to remove we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original to be less fond of folly of too new or too old phrases and to believe that poetry does not consist in either one or other matthews 1971 qtd p 162 josiah conder in september 1820 eclectic review mentioned one naturally turns first to shorter pieces in order to taste flavour of poetry following ode to autumn is no unfavourable specimen matthews 1971 qtd p 233 an anonymous reviewer in edinburgh magazine for october 1820 added to a discussion of some of keats s longer poems afterthought that ode to fancy and ode to autumn also have great merit matthews 1971 qtd p 215 although after keats s death recognition of merits of his poetry came slowly by mid century despite widespread victorian disapproval of alleged weakness of his character and view often advanced that keats s work represented mere sensuality without substance matthews 1971 pp 27 33 34 some of his poems began to find an appreciative audience including to autumn in an 1844 essay on keats s poetry in dumfries herald george gilfillian placed to autumn among finest of keats smaller pieces matthews 1971 qtd p 306 in an 1851 lecture david macbeth moir acclaimed four exquisite odes to a nightingale to a grecian urn to melancholy and to autumn all so pregnant with deep thought so picturesque in their and so suggestive matthews 1971 qtd pp 351 352 in 1865 matthew arnold singled out indefinable delicacy charm and perfection of keats s touch in his autumn arnold 1962 pp 376 380 john dennis in an 1883 work about great poets wrote that ode to autumn ripe with glory of season it describes must ever have a place among most precious gems of lyrical poetry dennis 1883 p 372 1888 britannica declared of these odes perhaps two nearest to absolute perfection to triumphant achievement and accomplishment of very utmost beauty possible to human words may be that to autumn and that on a grecian urn baynes 1888 p 23 at turn of 20th century a 1904 analysis of great poetry by stephen gwynn claimed above and before all of keats s poems are three odes to a nightingale on a grecian urn and to autumn among these odes criticism can hardly choose in each of them whole magic of poetry seems to be contained gwynn 1904 p 378 sidney colvin in his 1917 biography pointed out that ode to autumn opens up no such far reaching avenues to mind and soul of reader as odes to a grecian urn to a nightingale or on melancholy but in execution is more complete and faultless than any of them colvin 1917 pp 421 22 following this in a 1934 analysis of romantic poetry margaret sherwood stated that poem was a perfect expression of phase of primitive feeling and dim thought in regard to earth processes when these are passing into a thought of personality sherwood 1934 p 263 harold bloom in 1961 described to autumn as most perfect shorter poem in english language bloom 1993 p 432 following this walter jackson bate in 1963 claimed that each generation has found it one of most nearly perfect poems in english later in 1973 stuart sperry wrote to autumn succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience natural rhythm of seasons it is a poem that without ever stating it inevitably suggests truth of ripeness is all by developing with a richness of profundity of implication simple perception that ripeness is fall sperry 1973 p 336 in 1981 william walsh argued that among major odes no one has questioned place and supremacy of to autumn in which we see wholly realized powerfully embodied in art complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in keats s life so persuasively argued about in his letters walsh 1981 p 118 literary critic and academic helen vendler in 1988 declared that in ode to autumn keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for social value of art vendler 1988 p 124 in 1997 andrew motion summarised critical view on to autumn it has often been called keats s most untroubled poem to register full force of its achievement its tensions have to be felt as potent and demanding following in 1998 m h abrams explained to autumn was last work of artistic consequence that keats completed he achieved this celebratory poem with its calm acquiescence to time transience and mortality at a time when he was possessed by a premonition that he had himself less than two years to live abrams 1998 pp 51 52 james chandler also in 1998 pointed out that if to autumn is his greatest piece of writing as has so often been said it is because in it he arguably set himself most ambitious challenge of his brief career and managed to meet it chandler 1998 p 430 timothy corrigan in 2000 claimed that to autumn may be as other critics have pointed out his greatest achievement in its ability to redeem english vernacular as casual expression of everyday experience becoming in this his most exterior poem even in all its bucolic charm corrigan 2000 p 156 in same year thomas mcfarland placed to autumn with ode to a nightingale ode on a grecian urn eve of st agnes and hyperion as keats s greatest achievement together elevating keats high in ranks of supreme makers of world literature mcfarland 2000 pp 225 26 in 2008 stanley plumly wrote history posterity immortality are seeing ode to a nightingale ode on a grecian urn and to autumn as three of most anthologized lyric poems of tragic vision in english plumly 2008 p 343 notes references abrams m h keats
