geoffrey c 1152 12 december 1212 was an illegitimate son of henry ii king of england who became bishop elect of lincoln and archbishop of york identity of his mother is uncertain but she may have been named ykenai geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming bishop of lincoln in 1173 though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189 in 1173 1174 he led a campaign in northern england to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half brothers this campaign led to capture of william king of scots by 1182 pope lucius iii had ordered that geoffrey either resign lincoln or be consecrated as bishop he chose to resign and became chancellor instead he was only one of henry ii s sons present at king s death geoffrey s half brother richard i nominated him archbishop of york after succeeding to throne of england probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for throne after some dispute geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191 he soon became embroiled in a conflict with william longchamp richard s regent in england after being detained at dover on his return to england following his consecration in france geoffrey claimed sanctuary in town but he was seized by agents of longchamp and briefly imprisoned in dover castle subsequently a council of magnates ordered longchamp out of office and geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half brothers first richard and then john who succeeded to english throne in 1199 geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops his cathedral chapter and other clergy in his diocese his last quarrel with john was in 1207 when archbishop refused to allow collection of a tax and was driven into exile in france he died there five years later early life henry ii with thomas becket from a 13th century illuminated manuscript thumb left 300px geoffrey was probably born in about 1152 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 6 york archbishops before his father henry later henry ii of england married eleanor of aquitaine warren henry ii p 78 note 1 and was likely named after his paternal grandfather geoffrey of anjou although he is often given surname plantagenet in modern histories that name was not in use during his lifetime given wilson and curteis royal bastards pp 103 104 date of his birth is determined by statements of gerald of wales that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173 and by fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191 his mother s identity is unclear medieval chronicler walter map claimed she was a whore named ykenai and that he was not actually henry s son this is only contemporary source that gives her name and as map was hostile to geoffrey information must be judged carefully instead ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight another possibility for geoffrey s mother is rosamund clifford but most of evidence for this is circumstantial it is assumed that geoffrey was eldest of henry s children legitimate or illegitimate geoffrey was brought up with henry s legitimate children there is no evidence that henry tried to deny geoffrey s paternity although walter map said that henry s acknowledgment was done improperly and with little discretion quoted in jones generation gap albion p 28 geoffrey had a brother named peter who appears to have been his maternal half brother given wilson and curteis royal bastards p 118 as peter is generally considered unlikely to have been henry s son given wilson and curteis royal bastards p 179 geoffrey was archdeacon of lincoln in diocese of lincoln by september 1171 and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop elect in 1175 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 3 lincoln archdeacons of lincoln he also held a prebend an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter mcgurk dictionary p 32 in diocese of london but there is little evidence that he executed duties of either office there are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in northampton and that he taught in paris during early 1170s he also acted as a papal judge delegate at that time pope alexander iii initially refused to confirm geoffrey s selection as bishop of lincoln in about may 1173 prompting geoffrey to travel to rome in october 1174 to secure confirmation of this office he was confirmed in office of bishop by july 1175 but he was not ordained at that time greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 3 lincoln bishops of lincoln as he was under canonical age for holding a bishopric morey bartholomew of exeter p 37 geoffrey s youth was one of alexander s objections to geoffrey s election and pope only confirmed office under duress another potential problem was geoffrey s illegitimacy which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office but that was dealt with by granting of a papal dispensation cheney roger of worcester p 215 in 1173 and early 1174 geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern england in support of his father s attempts to subdue scots who were supporting rebellion by geoffrey s legitimate half brothers against their father campaign resulted in capture of william lion king of scots at battle of alnwick and also helped to compel hugh du puiset bishop of durham to pledge fealty to henry ii lovatt geoffrey oxford dictionary of national biography during campaign geoffrey captured several castles held by roger mowbray a supporter of scottish king scammell hugh du puiset pp 38 39 it was after this campaign that henry said of geoffrey my other sons are real bastards this is only one who s proved himself legitimate quoted in lovatt geoffrey oxford dictionary of national biography after geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by pope alexander in 1175 bishop elect made a ceremonial visit to lincoln on 1 august 1175 he subsequently went to study at tours where he probably befriended peter of blois a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on st wilfrid to geoffrey bishop elect made several gifts to cathedral at lincoln including two bells for bell tower while geoffrey was bishop elect at lincoln it appears that adam bishop of st asaph carried out episcopal duties in diocese of lincoln as geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions richardson schools of northampton english historical review p 599 nevertheless he managed to recover some lands of diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items although he aided finances of his diocese with these recoveries in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father in 1181 pope lucius iii became concerned that geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated and demanded that bishop elect s position be either through consecration as bishop or through resignation chancellor geoffrey formally resigned see of lincoln on 6 january 1182 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 255 at marlborough in england rather than be ordained as pope lucius iii had ordered henry had named him chancellor of england in 1181 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 84 after geoffrey indicated he was going to resign bishopric in february 1181 although geoffrey resigned episcopal office he continued to hold benefices in plurality which was normally contrary to canon law hamilton religion in medieval west p 39 these offices included treasurer of york from 1182 archdeaconry of rouen from 1183 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 6 york treasurers of york and probably archdeaconry of east riding greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 6 york prebends of york henry also gave him two continental castles one in anjou and one in touraine along with lands in england and normandy worth 1000 marks a year although geoffrey held office of chancellor he appears in only few documents mainly between 1182 and 1185 after 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187 and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father s domains peter of blois wrote that several monarchs considered geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in italy or holy land and that he was actually offered throne of jerusalem by heraclius patriarch of jerusalem wahlgren peter of blois english historical review p 1212 it is possible that geoffrey s non appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father s domains in pursuit of these ambitions during geoffrey s term of office as chancellor walter de coutances served as his seal keeper need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to likelihood that geoffrey s time as chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father william longchamp fulfilled same assistant role for archdeaconry at rouen spear personnel p 216 following declaration of war on henry by prince richard and king philip ii of france in 1187 geoffrey was given command of a quarter of english royal army he and his father were driven from le mans henry s birthplace in 1189 geoffrey did not attend subsequent conference at which henry submitted to philip immediately before henry s death unwilling to witness his father s humiliation but he did help nurse him during his final days henry made a bedside wish that geoffrey be made either archbishop of york or bishop of winchester and geoffrey used his father s seal to make appointments to york after henry s death geoffrey then escorted henry s body to fontevrault abbey for burial he was only one of henry ii s sons present at his death lyon constitutional and legal history pp 233 236 archbishop first difficulties richard named geoffrey archbishop of york on 20 july 1189 turner richard lionheart and english episcopal elections albion p 4 within days of taking throne formal election took place on 10 august what happened with vacant archbishopric of york after richard took throne and why as well as exact chronology of events is complicated by contradictory nature of main contemporary accounts gerald of wales states that geoffrey was reluctant to accept york but another chronicler benedict of peterborough relates that geoffrey quickly took control of archiepiscopal estates however election occurred geoffrey s consecration did not take place until much later and soon after his election he either resigned or was stripped of his office of chancellor a further complication was that cathedral chapter had earlier elected dean of york hubert walter as archbishop richard probably gave york to geoffrey in hope of forcing him to become a full priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for throne warren king john p king john pp 35 36 richard also required geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside england for three years during time richard expected to be out of country on crusade king subsequently released geoffrey from oath initial swearing of which was apparently another of richard s efforts to keep geoffrey s possible ambitions towards english throne in check turner and heiser reign of richard lionheart pp 89 90 but cathedral chapter at york disputed geoffrey s appointment claiming that because dean of york hubert walter and some others of chapter had not been present election was invalid walter s election to york was supported by richard s mother eleanor of aquitaine whom a chronicler claimed hated geoffrey as product of one of her husband s affairs richard consequently retained his control over estates of archbishopric and did not confirm election until a council held at pipewell on 16 september at that council richard also appointed three men to offices within diocese of york he made henry marshal dean burchard du puiset a relative of hugh du puiset became treasurer and roger of london abbot of selby abbey geoffrey objected to these appointments and as a result his estates were confiscated by king until he submitted and became a priest historians ralph turner and richard heiser speculate that richard s strategy in making these appointments was to keep geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese and thus unable to challenge for english throne two historians also suggest that richard may have been making an example of geoffrey in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives geoffrey s ordination as a priest took place at southwell on 23 september 1189 in a ceremony performed by john bishop of whithorn geoffrey then went to york but until his election was ratified by pope he refused to allow burchard to take up his office this stance was supported by most of york cathedral chapter geoffrey then was sent by richard to escort william lion from scotland to canterbury it was at canterbury that papal assent to geoffrey s election was secured in december when giovanni d anagni papal legate not only confirmed election but rejected various appeals made by cathedral chapter against geoffrey but king forced geoffrey to allow royal appointments and pay a fine of ps2000 before his lands were restored although geoffrey was allowed some time to make full payment in early 1190 geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in cathedral and excommunicated henry marshal and burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service richard who was in normandy preparing to go on third crusade ordered geoffrey to king s presence in normandy although hugh du puiset who was justiciar was hampering geoffrey s attempts to collect revenue for earlier fine richard insisted on immediate full payment when geoffrey was unable to pay richard re confiscated his lands increased amount of fine and demanded a promise that geoffrey would not visit england for three years dispute was settled once more when pope stepped in and ratified geoffrey s election thus enabling a reconciliation between king and archbishop at tours in june geoffrey s estates were returned to him in july after paying 800 marks of his fine consecration and more difficulties thumb left dover

tours after papacy agreed to allow consecration this permission was secured by intervention of king and his mother eleanor of aquitaine turner and heiser see presumed motivation behind eleanor and richard s support as part of an effort to secure a counter weight to power exercised in england by chancellor william longchamp about whom complaints had reached richard in sicily turner and heiser reign of richard lionheart p 123 geoffrey received his pallium symbol of an archbishop s authority at his consecration in september 1191 after consecration he attempted to go to york but was met at dover by agents of longchamp and even though he took refuge in priory of st martin in dover was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in dover castle warren king john p 42 longchamp claimed that geoffrey had not sworn fealty to richard but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival another complication was that english bishops had appealed to papacy because geoffrey had not been consecrated by archbishop of canterbury and longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of other bishops in ordering geoffrey s arrest but actions of longchamp s agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against chancellor s arrest of geoffrey even though longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents turner and heiser reign of richard lionheart pp 126 128 one cause of outrage was obvious parallel with murder of thomas becket who had been dragged from an altar and martyred gillingham richard i p 228 archbishop was released and took part in a council held at loddon bridge between reading and windsor longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from chancellorship powell and wallis house of lords pp 98 99 and hugh of lincoln bishop of lincoln excommunicated those who had dragged geoffrey from sanctuary geoffrey was then enthroned at york on 1 november 1191 while still embroiled in his conflict with longchamp geoffrey began feuding with hugh du puiset probably over geoffrey s authority in puiset s diocese of durham one of those subject to york dispute dragged on for years with many appeals to rome and king york had been vacant for several years and puiset had grown used to having authority in northern archdiocese scammell hugh du puiset p 172 after geoffrey s consecration he summoned puiset to a provincial synod in late september 1191 at which bishop was charged with various irregularities puiset appealed to rome and refused to attend synod and was excommunicated in december by geoffrey an attempt in march 1192 by queen eleanor and hubert walter to settle issue came to nothing when geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from puiset who in turn demanded an admission from geoffrey that excommunication had been unjust further appeals to rome led to an eventual settlement in october 1192 when bishop finally acknowledged geoffrey s authority over durham scammell hugh du puiset pp 178 181 geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in diocese of canterbury thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to canterbury in rank in pursuit of this rivalry between york and canterbury geoffrey was first archbishop of york to style himself primate of england in opposition to canterbury title of primate of all england cheney hubert walter pp 52 53 he also attempted to subordinate clementhorpe priory to godstow abbey which provoked an appeal from prioress alice of clementhorpe to papacy probably owing to pope celestine iii s dislike of geoffrey hubert walter was given a papal legateship that included geoffrey s province something that had not been usual in preceding years and which presented geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with ecclesiastical hierarchy robinson papacy p 173 but geoffrey was on friendly terms with prince john historian g v scammell has suggested that geoffrey s consecration allowed john to feel that geoffrey was no longer a rival for throne thus paving way for good relations between two half brothers scammell hugh du puiset p 55 geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by henry marshal burchard du puiset and roger of london they objected to his having given a large part of york s treasury toward richard s ransom and to some of his appointments in church of york charges of simony extortion and neglect of his duties were lodged against geoffrey who in return excommunicated ringleaders more than once and locked canons out of church geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to office of dean of york his first choice his half brother peter was opposed by cathedral chapter geoffrey s second choice simon of apulia chancellor of york refused to give up office when geoffrey decided to award it to a third man philip of poitou simon was supported by cathedral chapter who elected him to office despite geoffrey s opposition an appeal was made to papacy by geoffrey while simon travelled to king richard in germany king refused to allow appeal and tried to summon geoffrey to germany to resolve issue geoffrey was unable to leave york because of disturbances within cathedral clergy and simon managed to secure papal confirmation as dean of york quarrels with john hubert walter and richard when prince john rebelled in 1193 geoffrey and hugh du puiset put aside their feud to quash uprising geoffrey strengthened doncaster s defences and went to aid of puiset who was besieging tickhill castle in 1194 geoffrey went into debt to crown for sum of 3000 marks to buy office of sheriff of yorkshire for himself gillingham richard i p 270 later that year geoffrey began to quarrel with hubert walter over primacy of england which canterbury claimed and york disputed walter s decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in diocese of york in march 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over york and all of england geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in diocese of canterbury following month king richard did not reprimand geoffrey for this act of provocation and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates before richard left england in may 1194 he appointed walter as justiciar that summer walter began an investigation into geoffrey s actions which led to geoffrey s estates being confiscated once again geoffrey appealed to king who was then in maine richard over ruled walter restored geoffrey s estates and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and promise of 1000 more to follow in january 1195 geoffrey was ordered to appear in rome to answer various charges under threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 june further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed including an instance of cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a in protest geoffrey protested to king after richard forbade geoffrey s projected journey to rome and in retaliation king confiscated geoffrey s estates once more this left geoffrey vulnerable when walter held a legatine council at york in june 1195 geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at rome until 1 november but was still unable to attend which led pope celestine to order that geoffrey s suspension should be performed by hugh of lincoln hugh protested and as a result celestine himself suspended geoffrey on 23 december 1195 finally forcing geoffrey to answer charges against him he travelled to rome in 1196 where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by pope geoffrey quarrelled with richard in 1196 in normandy while archbishop was attempting to return to england richard forbade him from administering york lyon constitutional and legal history pp 305 306 and geoffrey returned to rome until 1198 an attempt at reconciliation with richard came to nothing after geoffrey refused to approve king s appointments in diocese of york without some guarantees that they would be approved by papacy ultimately pope innocent iii on 28 april 1199 ordered that geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to king innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in york would require papal approval under john after john succeeded richard in 1199 he decided to restore geoffrey to archiepiscopal estates but continued to receive income until archbishop returned from rome gillingham historians without hindsight king john p 13 some of geoffrey s opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices and for a short time peace reigned in york but perceived arrogance of geoffrey s officials offended cathedral chapter at york and this further conflict was not resolved until march 1200 for most of remainder of 1199 geoffrey was frequently with king and two appear to have been on good terms a state of affairs that continued throughout first half of 1200 in october 1200 geoffrey refused to allow collection of carucage a tax on land on his property and his lands were confiscated in retaliation he then excommunicated new sheriff of yorkshire james of who had ravaged geoffrey s lands in revenge in november 1200 geoffrey and john were reconciled at hugh of lincoln s funeral which allowed geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates but archbishop s continued refusal to allow collection of carucage led to truce falling apart in january 1201 john made peace with his half brother joliffe angevin kingship pp 114 115 but it did not last as geoffrey continued to refuse to allow tax to be collected john then renewed demand for payment for office of sheriff due from richard s reign which forced geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace which occurred in may 1201 but it was short lived disputes over appointments in diocese of york broke out but with support of pope innocent geoffrey was able to secure appointment of a few of his own candidates geoffrey also quarrelled with some of monasteries in his diocese with usual claims and counterclaims going to papacy for judgement among religious houses geoffrey had disagreements with were guisborough priory meaux abbey and fountains abbey most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices but quarrel with meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house geoffrey submitted to john in 1206 and his lands were returned to him but in 1207 geoffrey led clergy of england in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile warren king john p 149 geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect tax in his archdiocese but king confiscated geoffrey s estates in retaliation mitchell taxation in

although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by conflicts in which he engaged geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese creating office of chancellor he also inspired loyalty from some of his household members many of whom witnessed his charters and although he made enemies of several of suffragan bishops clergy and religious houses in his diocese he also secured friendship and support of other clergy including pope innocent iii and hugh of lincoln although walter map declared that geoffrey was full of faults and devoid of character he remained loyal

holt stated that geoffrey was through his career a perpetual source of danger quarrelling now with de puiset now with yorkshire sheriffs ever ready to attack judicial and fiscal superiority of crown holt northerners p 204 geoffrey s ambitions may have included becoming king of england which may account for some of harshness that his two legitimate half brothers displayed towards him his military abilities displayed in rebellion of 1173 1174 as well his custody of castles near tours would have also fed into richard s disquiet over geoffrey s possible intentions turner and heiser reign of
