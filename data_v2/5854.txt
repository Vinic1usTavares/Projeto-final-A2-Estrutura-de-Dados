meteorological agency jma first identified system however strong wind shear caused all deep convection to become displaced to south of center at 1800 utc wind shear began to decrease and cyclone developed a well defined circulation based on this jtwc upgraded system into tropical storm hal early next day jma classified hal as a severe tropical storm around this time philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration also monitored storm and assigned it with local name kuring convection soon developed along northern semicircle of system and thus hal began to

china however both jtwc and its primary tropical cyclone forecast model predicted hal to move northward and re curve northeast around this time storm passed about north of luzon late on june 21 jma estimated that hal attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of passing near taiwan storm gradually weakened at 1800 utc on june 22 jma lowered intensity of hal to according to jma typhoon leveled off in intensity for roughly 30 hours before weakening resumed on morning of june 24 jma downgraded hal to a severe tropical storm five hours later hal moved ashore
