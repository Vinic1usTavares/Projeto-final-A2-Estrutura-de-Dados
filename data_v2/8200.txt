vocalist anthony kiedis wrote lyrics to express feelings of loneliness and despondency and to reflect on narcotics and their impact on his life kiedis was driving home from rehearsals when blood sugar sex magik was in pre production and said he sang lyrics to himself kiedis initially did not feel that under bridge would fit into chili peppers repertoire and was reluctant to show it to his bandmates until producer rick rubin implored him to do so rest of band was receptive to lyrics and wrote music song became a critical and commercial success peaking at number two on billboard hot 100 behind

rolling stone said that song unexpectedly drop kicked band into top 10 while philip booth of tampa tribune commented that it was a pretty undulating and by now omnipresent single booth philip august 21 1992 will sock it to ya tampa tribune its success led in part to departure of guitarist john frusciante who preferred band to remain underground song has become an inspiration to other artists and remains a seminal component of alternative rock movement of early and mid 1990s origins and recording during production of red hot chili peppers 1991 album blood sugar sex magik producer rick rubin regularly visited singer anthony kiedis to review kiedis new material kiedis sloman 2004 pp 266 268 he found a poem titled under bridge while flipping through kiedis notebook and instantly took an interest in poignant lyrics rubin suggested that kiedis show it to rest of band i thought it was beautiful i said we ve got to do this kiedis sloman 2004 pp 265 266 kiedis was reluctant as he felt poem was too emotional and did not fit chili peppers style kiedis sloman 2004 p 267 after singing poem to guitarist john frusciante and drummer chad smith kiedis recalls that they got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding beat and guitar chords to match it frusciante chose chords he played in introduction to balance out depressing nature of lyrics saying my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so i thought if lyrics are really sad like that i should write some chords that are happier making of under bridge red hot chili peppers greatest hits for several days frusciante and kiedis worked on song and it became one of few tracks written and completed prior to band moving into mansion where they recorded album after song was recorded rubin felt grand and epic outro would benefit from a large group of singers frusciante invited his mother gail and her friends all of whom sang in a choir to perform apter 2004 p 226 lyrics and meaning kiedis wrote much of song s lyrics during a period when he felt distraught and emotionally drained he had maintained sobriety for roughly three years and felt that this had distanced him from his bandmates while group worked on blood sugar sex magik frusciante and flea often smoked marijuana together ignoring kiedis who felt that frusciante was no longer in his world driving home after rehearsal in april 1991 kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend ione skye loneliness that i was feeling triggered memories of my time with ione and how i d had this beautiful angel of a girl who was willing to give me all of her love and instead of embracing that i was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting under a bridge kiedis feelings of alienation from his bandmates led him to feel that city of los angeles was his only companion i felt an unspoken bond between me and my city i d spent so much time wandering through streets of l a and hiking through hollywood hills that i sensed there was a nonhuman entity maybe spirit of hills and city who had me in her sights and was looking after me lines sometimes i feel like my only friend is city i live in city of angels lonely as i am together we cry show a direct link to kiedis isolation and sense of susceptibility despite these emotions kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs telling rolling stone that no matter how sad or lonely i got things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when i was using drugs all time there was no comparison optimistic ideology gave birth to chorus of song i don t ever want to feel like i did that day take me to place i love place meaning his bandmates friends and family red hot chili peppers funky monks warner bros records may 1992 one of most notable verses in song discusses harsh effects of drugs their role in destroying many of kiedis relationships and their impact on his happiness apter 2004 pp 223 225 based on one of kiedis experiences verse of under bridge illustrates his efforts to enter gang territory under a bridge to purchase drugs kiedis pretended that a sister of one of gang members was his fiancee to be permitted inside although he successfully acquired drugs kiedis considers this moment to be one of worst of his life as it demonstrated level to which he was willing to sink in order to feed his addiction for over 20 years kiedis refused to acknowledge location of bridge though he noted that it is in downtown los angeles using clues provided by kiedis in his autobiography scar tissue writer mark haskell smith concluded that bridge that inspired song was located in city s macarthur park this however contradicts kiedis own assertion that bridge was underneath a freeway red hot chili peppers funky monks warner bros records may 1992 other possible cited locations have included belmont tunnel about half a mile from macarthur park and more recently overpass where interstate highway

of his career singing rapidly due to his limited ability to reach high notes john frusciante february 8 2001 at paradiso song begins with frusciante playing a moderately slow intro that guitarist said drew heavily on 1967 jimi hendrix song little wing as kiedis begins to sing guitar playing becomes more rapid until it reaches an e major seventh chord that halts song silence is broken by drummer chad smith s closed hi hat and cross stick struck at a moderately fast tempo frusciante borrowed e major seventh chord technique from british guitarist marc bolan of glam rock band t rex who initially

verse and subsequent chorus when bass finally enters after next verse an e major seven chord again marks a break before start of chorus second chorus transitions into a different verse where smith begins to play drums and kiedis sings take me all way yeah yeah e yeah oh no no after kiedis cues one time a choir whose presence was added to make ending sound more epic sings under bridge downtown

he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in verses kiedis 2004 pp 284 293 therefore song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer after being released as a single in march 1992 song would be included in virtually all concerts frusciante however began to resent song s popularity and would play convoluted purposefully throwing kiedis off an example of this was during a televised performance on highly rated program saturday night live on february 22 1992 kiedis said that it felt like i was getting stabbed in back and hung out to dry in front of all of america while frusciante was off in a corner in shadow playing some dissonant out of tune experiment guitarist used a distortion pedal for ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into microphone when providing backup vocals neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances apter 2004 p 243 nevertheless sales of blood sugar sex magik skyrocketed following show at times kiedis has also resented singing song especially during instances when he felt distanced from song s lyrics red hot chili peppers itunes exclusive interview itunes originals november 2007 in past few years however kiedis has experienced a revival in interest although there have been times when i was over under bridge i ve rediscovered it and now i feel close to it and it still has power and life and purpose as a song frusciante believed that flexibility of under bridge has contributed to its success a lot of time that is one of ingredients of a hit you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things but you do go through cycles flea believes that reason under bridge had a recent revival in relevancy was due to frusciante s return to band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992 flea believed that it was vital to have four members who wrote track together apter 2004 pp 342 349 under bridge was played at 1999 woodstock festival which red hot chili peppers headlined they were final
