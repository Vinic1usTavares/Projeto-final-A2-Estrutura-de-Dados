ninth feature film produced by company it follows a solitary trash compactor robot on a future uninhabitable deserted earth left to clean up garbage however he is visited by a probe sent by starship axiom a robot called eve with whom he falls in love and pursues across galaxy after directing finding nemo stanton felt pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space wall e has minimal dialogue in its early sequences many of characters do not have voices but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by burtt film criticizes consumerism corporatism nostalgia waste management human environmental impact and concerns obesity and global catastrophic risk it is also pixar s first animated film with

by arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator or eve sent to scan planet for plant life wall e is smitten by sleek otherworldly robot but she goes into standby when he shows her his most recent find a living seedling probe returns to collect eve and plant and with wall e clinging on returns to its mothership axiom in centuries since axiom left earth its passengers have degenerated into helpless due to laziness and microgravity their every whim catered to by machines captain mccrea used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant auto flies ship is taken aback by a positive probe response but learns that placing plant in ship s holo detector will trigger a hyperjump back to earth so humanity can begin recolonization plant proves to be missing from eve s storage compartment though and she blames wall e for its disappearance with plant missing eve is deemed faulty and taken to diagnostics wall e proceeds to free her along with other faulty robots causing them to be designated rogue frustrated eve tries to send wall e home on an escape pod but they are interrupted when auto s first mate go 4 arrives and stows stolen plant in a pod set to self destruct wall e saves plant from being lost for good and he and eve reconcile celebrating with a dance in space around axiom eve brings plant back to mccrea who watches eve s recordings of earth and concludes that they have to go back however auto refuses revealing his own secret no return directive a113 issued after bnl inaccurately concluded in 2110 that planet could not be saved when mccrea this directive auto mutinies electrocuting wall e and shutting eve down and throwing them both down garbage chute before confining captain to his quarters eve having been rebooted by a mouse droid helps wall e bring plant to ship s holo detector auto crushes wall e in his attempt to stop return protocol but mccrea deactivates him while ship starts hyperjump arriving back on earth eve repairs wall e but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone heartbroken eve gives wall e a farewell kiss which sparks his memory and restores his original personality wall e and eve reunite as humans and robots of axiom take their first steps on earth during credits humans and robots are shown learning to farm fish and build turning ravaged planet into a paradise cast ben burtt as wall e waste allocation load lifter earth class title character wall e a robot who has achieved sentience and is only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on earth he is a small mobile compactor box with all terrain treads three fingered shovel hands binocular eyes and retractable solar cells for power although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up garbage all while accompanied by his cockroach friend named hal and music playing from his on board recorder he is distracted by his curiosity collecting trinkets of interest from amongst garbage he stores and displays these treasures such as a birdcage full of rubber ducks a rubik s cube disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden trophy at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds he ignores items valued by humans throwing away a diamond ring but keeping ring box he neatly organizes his finds at home he has created where he watches a video cassette of hello dolly via an ipod viewed through a large fresnel lens mimicking dance sequences burtt is also credited for voice of m o microbe a tiny obsessively clean maintenance with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep axiom clean elissa knight as eve extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator which wall e pronounces eva a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on earth and verify habitability she has a glossy white egg shaped body and blue led eyes she moves using antigravity technology and is equipped with scanners specimen storage and a quasar ion cannon in her arm which she is quick to use jeff garlin as captain b mccrea commanding officer of axiom he is merely a figurehead with ship s autopilot handling all true command functions he is credited simply as captain and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all ship s captains fred willard as shelby forthright ceo of buy n large corporation and only major live action character shown only in videos recorded around time of axioms initial launch in early 22nd century constantly optimistic forthright proposed plan to evacuate earth s population to space then clean up planet so they could return within five years however upon discovering that earth had become too toxic to support life bnl corporation soon abandoned cleanup and recolonization issued to all of any axioms directive to prevent anyone to return to earth and subsequently dissolved forthright is first and so far only live action character with a speaking role in any pixar film john ratzenberger and kathy najimy as john and mary respectively john and mary both live on axiom and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings for instance not noticing that ship features a giant swimming pool however they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with wall e eventually meeting face to face for first time sigourney weaver as voice of axioms computer stanton joked about role with weaver saying you realize you get to be mother now dvd scene 16 captain on deck audio commentary by director andrew stanton 52 01 52 09 referring to name of ship s computer in film alien which also starred weaver macintalk text to speech program for apple macintosh computers was used for voice of auto rogue artificial intelligence autopilot built into ship unlike other robots in film auto is not influenced by wall e but instead follows directive a113 which is to prevent axiom and humans from returning to earth because of toxicity and it works to prevent anyone from deviating from it production writing andrew stanton conceived wall e during a lunch with fellow writers john lasseter pete docter and joe ranft in 1994 toy story was near completion and writers brainstormed ideas for their next projects a bug s life monsters inc and finding nemo at this lunch stanton asked what if mankind had to leave earth and somebody forgot to turn off last robot having struggled for many years with making characters in toy story appealing stanton found his simple robinson crusoe esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong stanton made wall e a waste collector as idea was instantly understandable and because it was a low status menial job that made him sympathetic stanton also liked imagery of stacked cubes of garbage he did not find idea dark because having a planet covered in garbage was for him a childish imagining of disaster stanton and pete docter developed film under title of trash planet for two months in 1995 but they did not know how to develop story and docter chose to direct monsters inc instead hauser p 11 stanton came up with idea of wall e finding a plant because his life as sole inhabitant on a deserted world reminded stanton of a plant growing among pavements before they turned their attention to other projects stanton and lasseter thought about having wall e fall in love as it was necessary progression away from loneliness stanton started writing wall e again in 2002 while completing finding nemo stanton formatted his script in a manner reminiscent of dan o bannon s alien o bannon wrote his script in a manner stanton found reminded him of haiku where visual descriptions were done in continuous lines of a few words stanton wrote his robot dialogue conventionally but placed them in brackets in late 2003 stanton and a few others created a story reel of first twenty minutes of film lasseter and steve jobs were impressed and officially began development though jobs stated he did not like title originally spelled w a l e title animation test 2008 dvd walt disney studios home entertainment while first act of wall e fell out of sky for stanton he had originally wanted aliens to plant eve to explore earth and rest of film was different when wall e comes to axiom he incites a spartacus style rebellion by robots against remnants of human race which were cruel alien gels completely devolved gelatinous boneless legless see through green creatures that resemble jell o james hicks a physiologist mentioned to stanton concept of atrophy and effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period therefore this was inspiration of humans degenerating into alien gels deleted scenes with introductions by andrew stanton 2008 dvd walt disney studios home entertainment and their ancestry would have been revealed in a planet of apes style ending gels also spoke a made up gibberish language but stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from storyline captain s log evolution of humans 2008 dvd featurette walt disney studios home entertainment gels had a royal family who host a dance in a castle on a lake in back of ship and axiom curled up into a ball when returning to earth in this incarnation of story stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging and conceived humanity as big babies stanton developed metaphorical theme of humans learning to stand again and grow ing up dvd scene 16 captain on deck audio commentary by director andrew stanton 48 56 50 37 wanting wall e and eve s relationship to inspire humanity because he felt few films explore how utopian societies come to exist process of depicting descendants of humanity as way they appear in movie was slow stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on gels so audience could recognize them eventually fingers legs clothes and other characteristics were added until they arrived at concept of being fetus like to allow audience to see themselves in characters in a later version of film auto comes to docking bay to retrieve eve s plant film would have its first cutaway to captain but stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from wall e s point of view as an homage to get smart auto takes plant and goes into bowels of ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of buy n large s scheme to clean up earth falling apart through years stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why plant is taken from eve captain appears to be unintelligent but stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged otherwise he would have not been sympathetic one example of how unintelligent captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside down only to fix it before he challenges auto in finished film he merely wears it casually atop his head tightening it when he really takes command of axiom originally eve would have been electrocuted by auto and then be quickly saved from ejection at hands of wall a robots by wall e he would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from earth stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening as he wanted to show eve replacing her directive of bringing plant to captain with repairing wall e and it made wall e even more heroic if he held holo detector open despite being badly hurt stanton also moved moment where wall e reveals his plant which he had snatched from self destructing escape pod from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape as it made eve happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around ship stanton felt half audience at screening believed humans would be unable to cope with living on earth and would have died out after film s end jim capobianco director of ratatouille short film your friend rat created an end credits animation that continued story and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history to clarify an optimistic tone design wall e was most complex pixar production since monsters inc because of world and history that had to be conveyed whereas most pixar films have up to 75 000 storyboards wall e required 125 000 production designer ralph eggleston wanted lighting of first act on earth to be romantic and that of second act on axiom to be cold and sterile during third act romantic lighting is slowly introduced into axiom environment pixar studied chernobyl and city of sofia to create ruined world art director anthony was from bulgaria and recalled sofia used to have problems storing its garbage hauser p 39 hauser p 71 eggleston bleached out whites on earth to make wall e feel vulnerable overexposed light makes location look more vast because of cubes making up towers of garbage had to be large otherwise they would have lost shape in turn this helped save rendering time dull tans of earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when eve arrives when wall e shows eve all his collected items all lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere like a christmas tree eggleston tried to avoid colors yellow and green so wall e who was made yellow to emulate a tractor would not blend into deserted earth and to make plant more prominent thumb left alt wall e holding a bra wall e finds a bra roger deakins and dennis muren were consulted on realistic lighting including backgrounds that are less focused than foregrounds stanton also wanted lighting to look realistic and evoke science fiction films of his youth he thought that pixar captured physics of being underwater with finding nemo and so for wall e he wanted to push that for air while rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films he realized that pixar s other movies had lacked look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion lens flare and racking focus producer jim morris invited roger deakins and dennis muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere muren spent several months with pixar while deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks stanton said muren s experience came from integrating computer animation into live action settings while deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting 1970s panavision cameras were used to help animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments first lighting test included building a three dimensional replica of wall e filming it with a 70 mm camera and then trying to replicate that in computer stanton cited shallow lens work of gus van sant s films as an influence as it created intimacy in each close up stanton chose angles for virtual cameras that a live action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set stanton wanted axioms interior to resemble shanghai and dubai eggleston studied 1960s nasa paintings and original concept art for tomorrowland for axiom to reflect that era s sense of optimism stanton remarked we are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here at pixar in that we all miss tomorrowland that was promised us from heyday of disneyland and wanted a jet pack feel pixar also studied disney cruise line and visited las vegas which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting eggleston based his axiom designs on futuristic architecture of santiago calatrava eggleston divided inside of ship into three sections rear s economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to red blue and white of bnl logo coach class with living shopping spaces has s shapes as people are always looking for what s around corner stanton intended to have many colorful signs but he realized this would overwhelm audience and went with eggleston s original idea of a small number of larger signs premier class is a large zen like spa with colors limited to turquoise cream and tan and leads on to captain s warm carpeted and wooded quarters and sleek dark bridge in keeping with artificial axiom camera movements were modeled after those of steadicam use of live action was a stepping stone for pixar as stanton was planning to make john carter of mars his next project storyboarder derek thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make rest of film look even more realistic eggleston added that if historical humans had been animated and slightly audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was stanton cast fred willard as historical buy n large ceo because h e s most friendly and insincere car salesman i could think of ceo says stay course which stanton used because he thought it was funny industrial light magic did visual effects for these shots animation wall e went undeveloped during 1990s partly because stanton and pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature length film with a main character that behaved like luxo jr or r2 d2 stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema human s with metal skin like tin man or machine s with function like luxo and r2 he found latter idea powerful because it allowed audience to project personalities onto characters as they do with babies and pets you re compelled you almost can t stop yourself from finishing sentence oh i think it likes me i think it s hungry i think it wants to go for a walk he added we wanted audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life animators visited recycling stations to study machinery and also met robot designers visited nasa s jet propulsion laboratory to study robots watched a recording of a mars rover and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from san francisco police department simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human stanton wanted wall e to be a box and eve to be like an egg wall e and eve 2008 dvd walt disney studios home entertainment wall e s eyes were inspired by a pair of binoculars stanton was given when watching oakland athletics play against boston red sox he missed entire inning because he was distracted by them director was reminded of buster keaton and decided robot would not need a nose or mouth stanton added a zoom lens to make wall e more sympathetic ralph eggleston noted this feature gave animators more to work with and gave robot a childlike quality pixar s studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body his tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels animators wanted him to have elbows but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body his arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving animation director angus maclane suggested they attach his arms to a track on sides of his body to move them around based on printers his father designed this arm design contributed to creating character s posture so if they wanted him to be nervous they would lower them stanton wanted eve to be at higher end of technology and asked ipod designer jonathan ive to inspect her design he was very impressed her eyes are modelled on lite brite toys but pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar her limited design meant animators had to treat her like a drawing relying on posing her body to express emotion they also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature auto was a conscious homage to hal 9000 from 2001 a space odyssey and usage of also sprach zarathustra for showdown between captain mccrea and auto furthers that manner in which he hangs from a wall or ceiling gives him a threatening feel like a spider robo everything 2008 dvd featurette walt disney studios home entertainment originally auto was designed entirely differently resembling eve but masculine and authoritative steward robots were also more aggressive patrol bots majority of robot cast were formed with build a bot program where different heads arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations humans were modelled on sea lions due to their bodies as well as babies filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for film s humans hauser p 132 to animate their robots film s story crew and animation crew watched a keaton and a charlie chaplin film every day for almost a year and occasionally a harold lloyd picture afterwards filmmakers knew all emotions could be conveyed silently stanton cited keaton s great stone face as giving them perseverance in animating a character with an unchanging expression as he rewatched these stanton felt that filmmakers since advent of sound relied on dialogue too much to convey exposition filmmakers dubbed cockroach wall e keeps as a pet hal in reference to silent film producer hal roach as well as being an additional reference to hal 9000 they also watched 2001 a space odyssey black stallion and never cry wolf films that had sound but were not reliant on dialogue stanton acknowledged silent running as an influence because its silent robots were a forerunner to likes of r2 d2 and that hopeless romantic woody allen also inspired wall e sound producer jim morris recommended ben burtt as sound designer for wall e because stanton kept using r2 d2 as benchmark for robots burtt had completed star wars episode iii revenge of sith and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots but found wall e and its substitution of voices with sound fresh and exciting he recorded 2500 sounds for film which was twice average number for a star wars film and a record in his career burtt began work in 2005 and experimented with filtering his voice for two years burtt described robot voices as like a toddler universal language of intonation oh hm huh you know during production burtt had opportunity to look at items used by jimmy macdonald disney s in house sound designer for many of their classic films burtt used many of macdonald s items on wall e because burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post production animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas which burtt found an unusual experience animation sound design building worlds from sound up featurette 2008 dvd featurette walt disney studios home entertainment he worked in sync with animators returning their animation after adding sounds to give them more ideas burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character but if he could not find one that worked he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters before he and stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot burtt saw a hand cranked electrical generator while watching island in sky and bought an identical unpacked device from 1950 on ebay to use for wall e moving around burtt also used an automobile self starter for when wall e goes fast and sound of cars being wrecked at a demolition derby provided for wall e s compressing trash in his body macintosh computer chime was used to signify when wall e has fully recharged his battery for eve burtt wanted her humming to have a musical quality burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices so pixar employee elissa knight was asked to provide her voice for burtt to electronically modify stanton deemed sound effect good enough to properly cast her in role burtt recorded a flying radio controlled jet plane for eve s flying and for her plasma cannon burtt hit a slinky hung from a ladder with a timpani stick he described it as a cousin to blaster noise from star wars macintalk was used because stanton wanted auto to be epitome of a robot cold zeros ones calculating and soulless and stephen hawking s kind of voice i thought was perfect additional sounds for character were meant to give him a clockwork feel to show he is always thinking and calculating burtt had visited niagara falls in 1987 and used his recordings from his trip for sounds of wind list of a shot deconstructing pixar process 2008 dvd featurette walt disney studios home entertainment he ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record sandstorm though for scene where wall e runs from falling shopping carts burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart they crashed it around parking lot and then let it tumble down a hill to create hal wall e s pet cockroach s skittering he recorded clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs music thomas newman with stanton on wall e since two got along well on nemo which gave newman annie award for best music in an animated feature he began writing score in 2005 in hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with finished film but newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when stanton and reardon were writing script eve s theme was arranged for first time in october 2007 her theme when played as she first flies around earth originally used more orchestral elements and newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine newman said stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted music to sound and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult stanton wanted whole score to be orchestral but newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard axiom and used electronics too thumb left alt wall e watching a clip from hello dolly a live action clip of song it only takes a moment from hello dolly which inspires wall e to hold hands with eve stanton originally wanted to juxtapose opening shots of space with 1930s french swing music but he saw triplets of belleville 2003 and did not want to appear as if he were copying it stanton then thought about song put on your sunday clothes from hello dolly since he had portrayed sidekick barnaby tucker in a 1980 high school production stanton found that song was about two naive young men looking for love which was similar to wall e s own hope for companionship jim reardon suggested wall e find film on video and stanton included it only takes a moment and clip of actors holding hands because he wanted a visual way to show how wall e understands love and conveys it to eve hello dolly composer jerry herman allowed songs to be used without knowing what for when he saw film he found its incorporation into story genius coincidentally newman s uncle lionel worked on hello dolly newman travelled to london to compose end credits song down to earth with peter gabriel who was one of stanton s favorite musicians afterwards newman rescored some of film to include song s composition so it would not sound intrusive when played louis armstrong s rendition of la vie en rose was used for a montage where wall e does not get eve s attention on earth script also specified using bing crosby s stardust for when two robots dance around axiom but newman asked if he could score scene himself a similar switch occurred for sequence in which wall e attempts to wake eve up through various means originally montage would play with instrumental version of raindrops keep fallin on my head but newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for sequence andrew stanton s blu ray and dvd audio commentary 2008 walt disney home entertainment themes film is recognized as social criticism katherine ellison asserts that americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle less than a third of it according to a recent columbia university study landfills were filling up so quickly that predictions were made that uk could run out of landfill space by year 2017 environment waste and nostalgia in dvd commentary stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism his answer was it was not it was a way to answer question of how would earth get to state where one robot would be left to continue cleanup by itself nevertheless some critics have noted an incongruity between perceived pro environmental and anti consumerist messaging of film and environmental impacts in production and merchandising of film wall e 2008 and ecological footprint of animation production in wall e from environmental adaption to sentimental nostalgia robin murray and joseph heumann explain important theme of nostalgia in this film nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts left behind that wall e collects and cherishes for example zippo lighters hubcaps and plastic these modern items that we use out of necessity are made sentimental through lens of bleak future of earth nostalgia is also expressed through musical score as film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled earth while playing put on your sunday clothes reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history this film also expresses nostalgia through longing of nature and natural world as it is sight and feeling of soil and plant brought back to space ship by eve that make captain decide it is time for humans to move back to earth wall e expresses nostalgia also by reflecting on romantic themes of older disney and silent films stanton describes theme of film as irrational love defeats life s programming i realized point i was trying to push with these two programmed robots was desire for them to try and figure out what point of living was it took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built i realized that that s a perfect metaphor for real life we all fall into our habits our routines and our ruts consciously or unconsciously to avoid living to avoid having to do messy part to avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with person next to us that s why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another i thought that s a perfect amplification of whole point of movie i wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that technology stanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on environmental aspect of humanity s complacency in film because that disconnection is going to be cause indirectly of anything that happens in life that s bad for humanity or planet stanton said that by taking away effort to work robots also take away humanity s need to put effort into relationships christian journalist rod dreher saw technology as complicated villain of film humans artificial lifestyle on axiom has separated them from nature making them slaves of both technology and their own base appetites and have lost what makes them human dreher contrasted hardworking dirt covered wall e with sleek clean robots on ship however it is humans and not robots who make themselves redundant humans on ship and on earth have overused robots and ultra modern technology during end credits humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew earth wall e is not a luddite film he said it doesn t demonize technology it only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature that it must be subordinate to human flourishing and help move that along religion thumb upright axiom and eve have been compared to legend of noah s ark and dove that noah sets forth from ark stanton who is a christian named eve after biblical figure because wall e s loneliness reminded him of adam before god created his wife dreher noted eve s biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story eve uses plant to tell humanity to return to earth and move away from false god of bnl and lazy lifestyle it offers dreher also noted this departure from classical christian viewpoints where adam is cursed to labor in that wall e argues hard work is what makes humans human dreher emphasized false god parallels to bnl in a scene where a robot teaches infants b is for buy n large your very best friend which he compared to modern corporations such as mcdonald s creating brand loyalty in children megan basham of world magazine felt film criticizes pursuit of leisure whereas wall e in his stewardship learns to truly appreciate god s creation during writing a pixar employee noted to jim reardon that eve was reminiscent of dove with olive branch from story of noah s ark and story was reworked with eve finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage hauser p 83 wall e himself has been compared to prometheus sisyphus and butades in an essay discussing wall e as representative of artistic strive of pixar itself compared wall e to butades in a scene where robot expresses his love for eve by making a sculpture of her from spare parts ancient greek tradition associates birth of art with a corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover s shadow traces it on wall before he departed for war myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for creator than muse in same way stanton and his pixar team have told us a deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through prism of all types of relationships release continuing a pixar tradition wall e was paired with a short film for its theatrical release presto film was dedicated to justin wright 1981 2008 a pixar animator who had worked on ratatouille and died of a heart attack before wall es release walt disney imagineering wdi built animatronic wall es to promote picture which made appearances at disneyland resort franklin institute miami science museum seattle center and tokyo international film festival due to safety concerns 318 kg robots were always strictly controlled and wdi always needed to know exactly what they were required to interact with for this reason they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at theme parks in case a wall e trod on a child s foot those who wanted to take a photograph with character had to make do with a cardboard cutout film was denied a theatrical release in people s republic of china in 2016 jim morris noted that studio has no plans for a sequel as they consider wall e a finished story with no need for continuation merchandise small quantities of merchandise were sold for wall e as cars items were still popular and many manufacturers were more interested in speed racer which was a successful line despite film s failure at box office thinkway which created wall e toys had previously made toy story dolls when other toy producers had not shown an interest among thinkway s items were a wall e that danced when connected to a music player a toy that could be taken apart and reassembled and a groundbreaking remote control toy of him and eve that had motion sensors that allowed them to interact with players there were even plushies ultimate wall e figures were not in

mccarthy of variety called film pixar s ninth consecutive wonder saying it was imaginative yet straightforward he said it pushed boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones and that main difference between film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter declared that wall e surpassed achievements of pixar s previous eight features and probably their most original film to date he said it had heart soul spirit and romance of best silent films honeycutt said film s definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger wall e s romantic leanings he praised burtt s sound design saying if there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand this is it roger ebert of chicago sun times named wall e an enthralling animated film a visual wonderment and a decent science fiction story and said scarcity of dialogue would allow it to cross language barriers in a manner appropriate to global theme and noted it would appeal to adults and children he praised animation describing color palette as bright and cheerful and a little bit realistic and that pixar managed to generate a curious regard for wall e comparing his rusty and hard working and plucky design favorably to more obvious attempts at creating lovable lead characters he said wall e was concerned with ideas rather than spectacle saying it would trigger stimulating little thoughts for younger viewers he named it as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008 and argued it was best science fiction movie in years film was interpreted as tackling a topical ecologically minded agenda though mccarthy said it did so with a lightness of touch that granted viewer ability to accept or ignore message kyle smith of new york post wrote that by depicting future humans as a flabby mass of idiots who are literally too fat to walk wall e was darker and more cynical than any major disney feature film he could recall he compared humans to patrons of disney s parks and resorts adding i m also not sure i ve ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers maura judkis of u s news world report questioned whether this depiction of frighteningly obese humans would resonate with children and make them prefer to play outside rather than in front of computer to avoid a similar fate interpretation led to criticism of film by conservative commentators such as glenn beck and contributors to national review online including shannen w coffin and jonah goldberg although he admitted it was a fascinating and occasionally brilliant production a few notable critics have argued that film is vastly overrated claiming it failed to live up to such blinding high wattage enthusiasm and that there were chasms of boredom watching it in particular second and third acts spiraled into expected other labels included preachy and too long child reviews sent into cbbc were mixed some citing boredom and an inadequate storyline patrick j ford of american conservative said wall es conservative critics missed lessons in film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism he argued that mass consumerism in film was not shown to be a product of big business but of too close a tie between big business and big government government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed and this lack of variety led to earth s downfall responding to coffin s claim that film points out evils of mankind ford argued only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as farm family unit and wholesome entertainment were in end held aloft by human characters he concluded by steering conservative families away from wall e these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice director terry gilliam praised film as a stunning bit of work scenes on what was left of planet earth are just so beautiful one of great silent movies and most stunning artwork it says more about ecology and society than any live action film all people on their floating around brilliant stuff their social comment was so smart and right on button time out s 50 greatest animated films part 2 time out london archaeologists have commented on themes of human evolution that film explores ben marwick has written how character of wall e resembles an archaeologist with his methodical collection and classification of quotidian human artefacts he is shown facing a dilemma of classifying a spork as either a fork or spoon and his nostalgic interest in human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of 1969 film hello dolly marwick notes that film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism captain of spaceship struggles with autopilot to gain control of vessel and invention of agriculture as part of watershed moments in story of film according to marwick one prominent message of film appears to be that envelopment by technology that humans in wall e experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution scholars such as ian tattersall and steve jones have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology such as medicine may have caused human evolution to slow or stop accolades wall e won academy award for best animated feature and was nominated for best original screenplay best original score best original song sound
