gimmick in 2017 shortly after departure of matt and jeff from tna was made public matt s wife reby went on a social media tirade in which she repeatedly slammed tna company s new management and way in which contract negotiations between company and hardy family were conducted a few weeks following this bad blood between two sides intensified so much so that new management of tna now renamed impact wrestling anthem sports entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to hardys new promotion ring of honor roh in which anthem essentially ordered roh as well as any broadcasting company airing roh s 15th anniversary pay per view show on which hardys were to participate in a match to not in any way speak of indicate or acknowledge existence of broken matt and brother nero characters and instead to refer to hardys as simply matt hardy and jeff hardy issue with this is that while hardys were in tna they had full creative control over broken gimmick with them even filming their own segments to air on tna programming in some circumstances thus making hardy family in their belief owners of broken gimmick it is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding final outcome on who owns broken gimmick anthem or hardy family until then status of broken gimmick remains undecided despite this matt continues to use broken gimmick through his social media accounts but neither him or jeff use broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for roh or on independent circuit presumably until results of expected legal proceedings have been
