saguaro national park is an american national park in pima county southeastern arizona park consists of two separate areas tucson mountain district tmd about west of city of tucson and rincon mountain district rmd about east of city that preserve sonoran desert landscapes fauna and flora including giant saguaro cactus volcanic rocks on surface of tucson mountain district differ greatly from surface rocks of rincon mountain district over past 30 million years crustal stretching displaced rocks from beneath tucson mountains of tucson mountain district to form rincon mountains of rincon mountain district uplifted domed and eroded rincon mountains are significantly higher and wetter than tucson mountains rincons as one of madrean sky islands between southern rocky mountains and sierra madre oriental in mexico support high biodiversity and are home to many plants and animals that do not live in tucson mountain district earlier residents of and visitors to lands in and around park before its creation included hohokam sobaipuri tohono o odham apaches spanish explorers missionaries miners homesteaders and ranchers in 1933 president herbert hoover using power of antiquities act established original park saguaro national monument in rincon mountains in 1961 president john f kennedy added tucson mountain district to monument and renamed original tract rincon mountain district congress combined tucson mountain district and rincon mountain district to form national park in 1994 popular activities in park include hiking on its of trails and sightseeing along paved roads near its two visitor centers both districts allow bicycling and horseback riding on selected roads and trails rincon mountain district offers limited wilderness camping but there is no overnight camping in tucson mountain district names park gets its name from saguaro gigantea a large cactus that is native to sonoran desert and that does not grow naturally elsewhere rincon as in rincon mountains rincon creek and rincon valley is spanish for corner and refers to shape of mountain range and its footprint name tucson derives from papago words son meaning dark spring or brown spring tank or tanque refers to a small artificial pool behind a dam that traps runoff in an existing natural depression madrean derives from madre in sierra madre mother mountains geography park consists of two separate parcels tucson mountain district tmd to west of tucson arizona and rincon mountain district rmd to east each parcel comes within about of center of city their total combined area in 2016 was tucson mountain district covers about while much larger rincon mountain district accounts for balance of about calculated by subtracting tucson mountain district approximation from total acreage about of park including large fractions of both districts is designated wilderness map at this site when zoomed out sufficiently outlines wilderness areas in both districts interstate 10 major highway nearest to park passes through tucson tucson mountain park abuts south side of tucson mountain district and to its west lies valley rincon mountain wilderness a separate protected area of about in coronado national forest abuts rincon mountain district on east and southeast while rincon valley lies immediately south of western part of rincon mountain district both districts conserve tracts of sonoran desert including ranges of significant hills tucson mountains in west and rincon mountains in east elevations in tucson mountain district range from summit of wasson peak elevations within rincon mountain district vary from at summit of mica mountain saguaro national park lies within watershed of north flowing santa cruz river which is generally dry rincon creek in southern part of rincon mountain district free flowing for at least part of year has largest riparian zone in park creek is a tributary of wash which crosses tucson from southeast to northwest to meet tanque verde wash two washes form river another dry wash an east west tributary of santa cruz river washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods smaller riparian zones are found near springs and in rincon mountain district largest of springs is at manning camp high in rincons climate according to koppen climate classification system saguaro national park has a hot semi arid climate bsh according to united states department of agriculture plant hardiness zone at red hills visitor center is 9b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of and 9a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of at rincon mountain visitor center brief violent summer rains are sometimes accompanied by lightning dust storms and flash floods some moisture at highest elevations in rincons falls as snow in winter snowmelt adds to limited water available at lower elevations later in year studies of effects of climate change on park show that its annual mean temperature rose about from 1900 to 2010 geology thumb alt cacti and other desert plants surround a rock formation with horizontal banding catalina gneiss most common rock type in rincons is exposed at javelina rocks along cactus forest loop drive in rincon mountain district saguaro national park s oldest rocks pinal schist pre date formation of contemporary basin and range province of which park is a part by about 1 7 billion years schist is exposed in rincon mountain district along a dry wash off cactus forest loop drive other ancient rocks 1 4 billion year old altered granites form much of tanque verde ridge in rincon mountain district much later about 600 million years ago shallow seas covered region around present day tucson over time that led to deposition of sedimentary rocks limestones sandstones and shales limestone which occurs in park in several places was mined here in late 19th century to make mortar future park land had six lime kilns two in tucson mountain district and four in rincon mountain district three all in rincon mountain district can be visited today two along cactus forest trail and one along ruiz trail about 80 million years ago tectonic plate movements induced a period of mountain building laramide orogeny which lasted until about 50 million years ago in western north america explosive volcanic eruptions formed tucson mountains about 70 million years ago and roof of volcano at their center collapsed to form a caldera across caldera was eventually filled by debris flows intrusion of a granitic pluton and lava flows some as recent as 30 to 15 million years ago volcanic rocks exposed in and near tucson mountain district are remnants of these events examples include large breccia exposed at grants pass and a granitic remnant of magma chamber which is visible from sus picnic area in tucson mountain district not all of molten granite reached surface of tucson mountains some cooled and crystallized far below tucson basin and nearby mountains including tucson mountains to west santa catalinas to north and rincons to east are part of basin and range province extending from northern mexico to southern oregon in united states province of relatively recent geologic origin formed when plate movements stretched and thinned earth s crust in this part of western north america until crust pulled apart along faults catalina fault a low angle detachment fault began to form about 30 million years ago about below surface of tucson mountains rocks under fault lower plate rocks were eventually displaced east northeast relative to rocks above fault then uplifted domed and eroded to form santa catalina and rincon mountains visible today although volcanic rocks seen on surface of tucson mountain district are not found in rincon mountain district crystallized granite catalina gneiss from beneath tucson mountains was eventually exposed on rincon mountain district s surface most common rock type in rincon mountains this banded gneiss is visible in rincon mountain district at sites such as javelina rocks along cactus forest loop drive history early thumb alt engravings of animals and people adorn vertical face of a rock formation hohokam petroglyphs in tucson mountain district earliest known residents of land in and around what later became saguaro national park were hohokam who lived there in villages between 200 and 1450 a d petroglyphs and bits of broken pottery are among hohokam artifacts found in park hohokam hunted deer and other animals gathered cholla buds prickly pears palo verde pods and saguaro fruit and grew corn beans and squash subsequent indigenous cultures sobaipuri of tucson basin and tohono o odham to west may be descendants of hohokam though evidence is inconclusive spanish explorers first entered arizona in 1539 40 non native settlement of region near park did not occur until 1692 with founding of san xavier mission along santa cruz river which flowed through tucson in 1775 spaniards built presidio san agustin del tucson a military fort in what was then part of new spain in part to protect against raids by apaches lands that eventually would become saguaro national park remained relatively free of development until mid 19th century after arizona had become part of united states after passage of homestead act of 1862 arrival of railroad in 1880 and end of apache wars in 1886 homesteaders and ranchers established themselves in tucson and rincon mountains and miners sought silver copper and other valuable ores and minerals mining in park continued intermittently through 1942 while ranching on private in holdings within park continued until mid 1970s defunct loma verde mine which is still visible in rincon mountain district produced a small amount of copper and gold between 1897 and 1907 mining of igneous rock at 149 sites in tucson mountain district sometimes produced ores of modest value in late 19th and early 20th centuries most successful copper king mine later renamed mile wide mine yielded 34 000 tons of copper gold lead zinc and molybdenum ores mostly during war years of 1917 1918 and 1941 it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable ranchers grazed thousands of cattle on public land that would later become part of park and homesteaders farmed and ranched at base of rincons filing homestead applications from 1890s through 1930 remains of former freeman homestead established in 1929 lie along a nature trail in rincon mountain district homestead is on arizona state register of historic places manning cabin built in 1905 as a summer retreat for levi manning a wealthy businessman and one term mayor of tucson is part of infrastructure at manning camp near mica mountain modified and restored after falling into disrepair it was added to national register of historic places in 1975 cultural resources in park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures after 1920 saguaro national monument in 1935 thumb alt hundreds of saguaro cacti and many other desert plants grow on a flat plain at base of an apparently barren mountain saguaro national monument now rincon mountain district in 1935 in 1920 members of natural history society of university of arizona expressed interest in establishing a protected area for saguaro a cactus species familiar to watchers of silent movie westerns in 1928 homer l a plant scientist and university s president joined efforts to create a saguaro sanctuary but issues related to funding and management delayed creation of a park in 1933 frank harris hitchcock publisher of tucson citizen and a former united states postmaster general who was influential in republican party persuaded u s president herbert hoover to create saguaro national monument hoover used his power under antiquities act of 1906 to create monument by proclamation on march 1 1933 later that year president franklin d roosevelt transferred management of monument east of tucson in rincon mountains to national park service between 1936 and 1939 during roosevelt administration civilian conservation corps ccc built monument s cactus forest loop drive and related infrastructure monument s visitor center opened in 1950s in 1961 president john f kennedy encouraged by stewart udall an arizonan who was then secretary of interior added of cactus lands in tucson mountains to monument this western district of monument was carved from tucson mountain park managed by pima county in 1920s tucson game protective association had persuaded department of interior to withdraw about in tucson mountains from and mining and to set it aside as a park and game refuge land leased by county in this set aside became tucson mountain recreation area in 1932 between 1933 and 1941 ccc workers built structures at eight picnic areas in county park portion of set aside five of which later became part of tucson mountain district of national monument their other projects involved road and trail building landscaping erosion control and enhancing water supplies for wildlife kennedy s 1961 proclamation created tucson mountain district from northern part of county park and renamed original monument lands east of tucson rincon mountain district expansions in 1976 and 1994 brought total tucson mountain district area to in 1994 congress elevated combined tucson mountain district and rincon

plants 25 of non vascular plants and 197 species of fungi in saguaro national park saguaros which flourish in both districts of park grow at an exceptionally slow rate first arm of a saguaro typically appears when cactus is between 50 and 70 years old though it may be closer to 100 years in places where precipitation is very low saguaros may live as long as 200 years and are considered mature at about age 125 a mature saguaro may grow up to tall and weigh up to when fully hydrated total number of saguaros in park is estimated at 1 8 million and 24 other species of cactus are abundant most common of these are fishhook barrel staghorn cholla hedgehog engelman s prickly pear teddybear cholla and jumping cholla invasive plants include fountain grass tamarisk malta starthistle and many others but by far most severe threat to native ecosystem is buffelgrass this drought tolerant plant native to parts of africa and asia was imported to united states in 1930s and planted near tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion first detected in park in 1989 it has dispersed widely in both districts competing with other plants for sustenance buffelgrass fills empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard noxious weed considered impossible to completely eliminate is managed in some areas of park and in tucson residential zones by hand pulling and during periods of wet weather application of glyphosate based herbicides thumb a view of saguaro national park s natural landscape animals thumb alt a dark brown

met with stiff public resistance sky islands rincons and nearby santa catalinas but not shorter tucson mountains are among about 40 mountain ranges known as madrean sky islands that are of special interest to biologists these ranges resembling a series of stepping stones between southern end of rocky mountains specifically mogollon rim of colorado plateau in united states and sierra madre occidental in mexico are continental islands separated from one another by seas of lower elevation valleys that impede but do not completely block species migration from one sky island to another ecologist peter lists several characteristics that make madrean complex unique among earth s 20 or so sky island complexes among these are its north south orientation across eight degrees of latitude spanning zones from temperate to subtropical highly varied nature of its geologic origin and of its soils moderate to high relief of its terrain and its safe distance from mass extinctions related to northern glaciers of most recent ice age influenced by these and other conditions madrean sky islands support unusual biodiversity file is accessed by clicking on view pdf recreation park is generally
