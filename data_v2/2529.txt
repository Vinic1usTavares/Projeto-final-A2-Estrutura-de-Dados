osteochondritis dissecans ocd or od is a joint disorder in which cracks form in articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone ocd usually causes pain and swelling of affected joint which catches and locks during movement physical examination typically reveals an effusion tenderness and a crackling sound with joint movement ocd is caused by blood deprivation in subchondral bone this loss of blood flow causes subchondral bone to die in a process called avascular necrosis bone is then reabsorbed by body leaving articular cartilage it supported prone to damage result is fragmentation dissection of both cartilage and bone and free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within joint space causing pain and further damage ocd can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases however disease can be confirmed by x rays computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri scans non surgical treatment is rarely an option as ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited as a result even moderate cases require some form of surgery when possible non operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non weight bearing and immobilization are used surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs stem cell transplantation and joint replacement after surgery rehabilitation is usually a two stage process of immobilization and physical therapy most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion during immobilization period isometric exercises such as straight leg raises are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing cartilage of affected joint once immobilization period has ended physical therapy involves continuous passive motion cpm and or low impact activities such as walking or swimming ocd occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100 000 in general population each year although rare it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents see introduction and discussion sections on incidence because their bones are still growing adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from ocd recovery in adolescents can be attributed to bone s ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling while ocd may affect any joint knee tends to be most commonly affected and constitutes 75 of all cases franz konig coined term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887 describing it as an inflammation of bone cartilage interface many other conditions were once confused with ocd when attempting to describe how disease affected joint including osteochondral fracture osteonecrosis accessory ossification center osteochondrosis and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia some authors have used terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for ocd signs and symptoms in osteochondritis dissecans fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint leading to pain and inflammation these fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice ocd is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within cartilage layer itself giving rise to secondary inflammation ocd most commonly affects knee although it can affect other joints such as ankle or elbow people with ocd report activity related pain that develops gradually individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain swelling catching locking popping noises and buckling giving way primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in range of movement symptoms typically present within initial weeks of stage i however onset of stage ii occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis disease progresses rapidly beyond stage ii as ocd lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments non specific symptoms caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains can delay a definitive diagnosis physical examination typically reveals fluid in joint tenderness and crepitus tenderness may initially spread but often reverts to a well defined focal point as lesion progresses just as ocd shares symptoms with common maladies acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in affected joint but is usually associated with a fatty although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with ocd patient may walk with involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on lateral aspect of medial condyle of femur causes despite much research causes remain unclear but include repetitive physical trauma ischemia restriction of blood flow hereditary and endocrine factors avascular necrosis loss of blood flow rapid growth deficiencies and imbalances in ratio of calcium to phosphorus and problems of bone formation although name osteochondritis implies inflammation lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non inflammatory cause it is thought that repetitive microtrauma which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to subchondral bone may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth trauma rather than avascular necrosis is thought to cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles in adults trauma is thought to be main or perhaps sole cause and may be endogenous exogenous or both incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care this reinforces theory that ocd may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma high impact sports such as gymnastics soccer basketball lacrosse football tennis squash baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of ocd in stressed joints knees ankles and elbows recent case reports suggest that some people may be genetically predisposed to ocd families with ocd may have mutations in gene studies in horses have implicated specific genetic defects pathophysiology thumb tunnel or notch view x ray of right knee from a patient with osteochondritis dissecans cystic changes and irregular border are indicated by arrows on medial side compared to lateral side osteochondritis dissecans differs from wear and tear degenerative arthritis which is primarily an articular surface problem instead ocd is a problem of bone underlying cartilage which may secondarily affect articular cartilage left untreated ocd can lead to development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns ocd occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially or fully separates from end of bone often because of a loss of blood supply osteonecrosis and of trabecular bone matrix loose piece may stay in place or slide around making joint stiff and unstable ocd in humans most commonly affects knees ankles and elbow but can affect any joint in skeletally immature individuals blood supply to epiphyseal bone is good supporting both osteogenesis and with disruption of epiphyseal plate vessels varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur resulting in a cessation of growth to both and chondrocytes in turn this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently ocd four minor stages of ocd have been identified after trauma these include revascularization and formation of granulation scar tissue absorption of necrotic fragments osteoid deposition and remodeling of new bone with delay in revascularization stage an ocd lesion develops a lesion can lead to articular surface irregularities which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration diagnosis to diagnose osteochondritis dissecans an x ray ct scan or mri scan can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone formation of loose fragments or both occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is used to assess degree of loosening within joint physical examination physical examination often begins with examination of patient s gait in ocd of knee people may walk with involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on lateral aspect of medial condyle of femur next examining physician may check for weakness of quadriceps this examination may reveal fluid in joint tenderness and crepitus wilson test is also useful in locating ocd lesions of femoral condyle test is performed by slowly extending knee from 90 degrees maintaining internal rotation pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of ocd physical examination of a patient with ankle ocd often returns symptoms of joint effusion crepitus and diffuse or localized tenderness examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain swelling and times with limited range of motion some with loose body lesions may report catching locking or both possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at knee in a physical examination as a result alignment and rotation of all major joints in affected extremity is common as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning affected joint including laxity diagnostic imaging x rays show of ossification front in juveniles in older people lesion typically appears as an area of bone with a line between osteochondral defect and visibility of lesion depends on its location and on amount of knee flexion used harding described lateral x ray as a method to identify site of an ocd lesion magnetic resonance imaging mri is useful for staging ocd lesions evaluating integrity of joint surface and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from ocd by showing bone and cartilage edema in area of irregularity mri provides information regarding features of articular cartilage and bone under cartilage including edema fractures fluid interfaces articular surface integrity and fragment displacement a low t1 and high t2 signal at fragment interface is seen in active lesions this indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures while mri and arthroscopy have a close correlation x ray films tend to be less inductive of similar mri results computed tomography ct scans and technetium 99m bone scans are also sometimes used to monitor progress of treatment unlike plain radiographs x rays ct scans and mri scans can show exact location and extent of lesion technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and amount of osseous uptake both of these seem to be closely correlated to potential for healing in fragment classification ocd is classified by progression of disease in stages there are two main staging classifications used one is determined by mri diagnostic imaging while other is determined arthroscopically however both stagings represent pathological conditions associated with ocd s natural progression while arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard anderson mri staging is main form of staging used in this article stages i and ii are stable lesions stages iii and iv describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of cartilage has allowed synovial fluid between fragment and bone mri staging of osteochondritis dissecans stage evaluation findings i stable articular cartilage thickening ii stable articular cartilage is breached low signal behind fragment indicates fibrous attachment iii unstable articular cartilage is breached high signal behind fragment indicates loss of attachment iv unstable formation of loose bodies cheng arthroscopic staging of osteochondritis dissecans paper presented at annual meeting of academy of orthopaedic surgeons grade findings a articular cartilage is smooth and intact but may be soft or b articular cartilage has a rough surface c articular cartilage has or fissures d articular cartilage with a flap or exposed bone e loose osteochondral fragment f displaced osteochondral fragment treatment treatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing immobilization anti inflammatory medication drilling of subchondral bone microfracture removal or reattachment of loose bodies and transfer system oats procedures primary goals of treatment are enhance healing potential of subchondral bone fix unstable fragments while maintaining joint and replace damaged bone and cartilage with implanted tissues or cells that can grow cartilage articular cartilage s capacity for repair is limited partial thickness defects in articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously and injuries of articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of articular surface as a result surgery is often required in even moderate cases where osteochondral fragment has not detached from bone anderson stage ii iii non surgical candidates for non operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small intact lesion and absence of loose bodies non operative management may include activity modification protected weight bearing partial or non weight bearing and immobilization goal of non operative intervention is to promote healing in subchondral bone and prevent potential collapse subsequent fracture and crater formation once candidates for treatment have been screened treatment proceeds according to lesion s location for example those with ocd of knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from involved area however they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated x rays are usually taken three months after start of non operative therapy if they reveal that lesion has healed a gradual return to activities is instituted those demonstrating healing by increased in subchondral region or those whose lesions are unchanged are candidates to repeat above described three month protocol until healing is noted surgery thumb arthroscopic image of oats surgery on medial femoral condyle of knee choice of surgical versus non surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial consequently type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age severity of lesion and personal bias of treating surgeon entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments a variety of surgical options exist for treatment of persistently symptomatic intact partially detached and completely detached ocd lesions post surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in concentration histological and immunohistochemical appearance as a result surgery is often avoided if non operative treatment is viable intact lesions if non surgical measures are unsuccessful drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of subchondral bone arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade from front approach from joint space through articular cartilage or by using a retrograde from behind approach through bone outside of joint to avoid penetration of articular cartilage this has proven successful with positive results at one year follow up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with juvenile form of ocd and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people follow up of five years who had failed prior conservative programs hinged lesions pins and screws can be used to secure flap sometimes referred to as hinged lesions bone pegs metallic pins and screws and other screws may be used to secure these types of lesions full thickness lesions three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling abrasion and in 1946 magnusson established use of stem cells from bone marrow with first surgical debridement of an ocd lesion these cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage while small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months results for large lesions tend to diminish over time this can be attributed to decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of fibrocartilage in attempts to address weaker structure of reparative fibrocartilage new techniques have been designed to fill defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage one such technique is autologous implantation aci which is useful for large isolated femoral defects in younger people in this surgery chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from intercondylar notch of articular surface chondrocytes are grown and injected into defect under a periosteal patch aci surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling pain and locking in clinical follow up examinations however some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated cells such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells as opposed to chondrocytes these too have demonstrated ability to regenerate both cartilage and underlying subchondral bone similar to oats arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost effective long lasting results for stage iv lesions a bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of non weight bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief repair damaged tissue and restore function unstable lesions some methods of fixation for unstable lesions include compression screws and herbert screws or pins made of stainless steel or materials that can be absorbed by body if loose bodies are found they are removed although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis aci is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people rehabilitation continuous passive motion cpm has been used to improve healing of articular surface during postoperative period for people with full thickness lesions it has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small 3 mm in diameter lesions in rabbits similarly rodrigo and steadman reported that cpm for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans a rehabilitation program often involves protection of compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion post operative analgesics namely a mix of opioids and nsaids are usually required to control pain inflammation and swelling straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during post operative or immobilization period a six to eight week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once immobilization period has ended incorporating range of motion stretching progressive strengthening and functional or sport specific training during this time patients are advised to avoid running and jumping but are permitted to perform low impact activities such as walking or swimming if patients return to activity before cartilage has become firm they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping prognosis prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include age of patient affected joint stage of lesion and most importantly state of growth plate it follows that two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity juvenile form of disease occurs in open growth plates usually affecting children between ages of 5 and 15 years adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50 although it is unclear whether these adults developed disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children prognosis is good for stable lesions stage i and ii in juveniles with open growth plates treated conservatively typically without surgery 50 of cases will heal recovery in juveniles can be attributed to bone s ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes stem cells which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue as a result open growth plates allow for more of stem cells necessary for repair in affected joint unstable large full thickness lesions stage iii and iv or lesions of any stage found in skeletally mature are more likely to fail non operative treatment these lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases epidemiology ocd is a relatively rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100 000 persons per year w et al found ocd to be cause of articular cartilage defects in 2 of cases in a study of 25 124 knee although rare ocd is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents juvenile form of disease occurs in children with open growth plates usually between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females with a ratio between 2 1 and 3 1 however ocd has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports adult form which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old while ocd may affect any joint knee specifically medial femoral condyle in 75 85 of knee cases tends to be most commonly affected and constitutes 75 of all cases elbow specifically capitulum of humerus is second most affected joint with 6 of cases talar dome of ankle represents 4 of cases less frequent locations include patella vertebrae femoral head and of scapula history condition was initially described by alexander monro primus in 1738 cited in in 1870 james paget described disease process for first time but it was not until 1887 that franz konig published a paper on cause of loose bodies in joint in his paper konig concluded that trauma had to be very severe to break off parts of joint surface less severe trauma might bone to cause an area of necrosis which might then separate in some cases absence of notable trauma made it likely that there existed some spontaneous cause of separation konig named disease osteochondritis dissecans describing it as a subchondral inflammatory process of knee resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from femoral condyle in 1922 described this process in ankle joint on review of all literature describing fractures of talus berndt and harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of talus term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints including knee hip elbow and joints notable cases michael russell american tennis player kristina canadian artistic gymnast jonathan vilma american football linebacker veterinary aspects thumb pathological specimen from a sow arrow points to a fracture in lateral of humerus and eosin staining bar 200 mm ocd also is found in animals and is of particular concern in horses as there may be a hereditary component in some horse breeds feeding for forced growth and selective breeding for increased size are also factors ocd has also been studied in other animals mainly dogs especially german shepherd where it is a common primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium large breeds in animals ocd is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and ossification osteochondritis itself signifies disturbance of usual growth process of cartilage and ocd is term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose according to columbia animal hospital frequency of affected animals is dogs humans pigs horses cattle chickens and turkeys and in dogs most commonly affected breeds include german shepherd golden and labrador retriever rottweiler great dane bernese mountain dog and saint bernard although any joint may be affected those commonly affected by ocd in dog are shoulder often bilaterally elbow knee and tarsus problem develops in although often and there may be pain or stiffness discomfort on extension or other compensating characteristics diagnosis generally depends on x rays arthroscopy or mri scans while cases of ocd of stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously others are exhibited in acute lameness surgery is recommended once animal has been deemed lame osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as animal may only exhibit an unusual gait consequently ocd may be masked by or misdiagnosed as other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia references external links radiology mr and ct of ocd category category dog diseases category horse diseases category inflammations category rare diseases
