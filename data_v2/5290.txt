dole gudbrandsdal or dole is a draft and harness type horse from norway dole trotter is alternately considered a subtype of dole gudbrandsdal and a separate breed it is also considered a part of coldblood trotter type dole gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse known for its pulling power and agility while dole trotter is a smaller faster horse used for harness racing two types are commonly interbred both types are strictly critiqued before entry into studbook which has over time resulted in an improvement in breed type dole is originally from gudbrandsdal valley and is probably descended in part from friesian horse over time breed has had thoroughbred arabian and other blood added in especially during creation of dole trotter in 19th century first studbook was created in 1941 and current breed association was formed in 1947 although originally used mainly as a pack horse today heavier dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes dole gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding breed characteristics dole horses generally stand at hands high weigh and are usually bay brown or black with gray palomino chestnut and dun occurring less frequently white markings may occur on head and legs especially on trotter type head is heavy with a straight profile neck rather short and muscular withers moderately pronounced and broad chest wide and deep and shoulder strong muscular and sloping back is long and croup broad muscular and slightly sloping legs are short but sturdy and well muscled with broad solid joints and tough hooves at one point in breed s history it was prone to weak legs and low fertility but these problems have since been corrected dole horses closely resemble british fell and dales ponies which developed from same ancestral stock swinney and langrish p pp 280 281 when presented for grading and studbook inspection heavy type dole gudbrandsdals are tested for pulling power and trotting in lighter type x rays showing knee and lower legs to be free of defects must be presented and stallions must have satisfactory results on track before they may be used for breeding however three year old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation breeding and trotting ability are considered acceptable trotting type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft type hendricks pp 155 156 these strict and organized standards have improved quality of dole breed over past few decades although dole horse is one of smallest draft breeds it shows great pulling power and is also hardy and agile they are especially known for their excellent as is shown by lighter sub type of breed during late 20th century interbreeding between two types became quite common due to this breed became much more uniform in type with fewer differences between trotter and draft sections breed history dole is thought to have originated in gudbrandsdal an inland valley in county of oppland it is likely that dole is in part a descendant of friesian as two breeds are similar in conformation and frisian people were known traders in area between 400 and 800 ad there was also equine movement between western norway and northern england during 9th century through mid 11th century this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced strong resemblance between dole friesian fell pony and dale pony breeds two stallions named odin and mazarin had a large influence on development of dole breed odin son of partisan was a stallion of thoroughbred some sources say norfolk entry 99 breeding imported to norway in 1834 odin was said to cost at time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in norway marshall p 28 all dole trotter horses today contain odin bloodlines mazarin was an arabian imported to norway in 1934 in 1849 another influential stallion was foaled named balder 4 he was a grandson of odin and is considered foundation stallion of heavier dole type a stallion named 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of heavier dole type for draft uses in 19th century harness racing began to rise in popularity in norway and breeders looked to create a horse suitable for that sport dole trotter a smaller lighter faster variation of draft type dole gudbrandsdal was then developed infusions of thoroughbred blood as well as that of various trotting and heavy draft breeds was used to create this new type dole trotter was especially influenced between 1840 and 1860 by two other stallions and dovre an arabian latter is foundation stallion of dole trotter type two types are commonly interbred especially since 1960 in 1872 dole gudbrandsdal was split into two types a class for heavier agriculture and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses in 1875 norwegian trotting association was formed by enthusiasts of second type in 1902 first dole gudbrandsdal stud book was published containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892 in 1903 norwegian trotting association split their registration between purebred norwegian trotters and trotting crosses at same time standards for entry were tightened and first inspection committee was created in 1965 norwegian or dole trotter studbook was taken over by norwegian trotting association as part of new coldblood trotter program approved by norwegian ministry for agriculture dole trotter studbook is still coordinated with original dole gudbrandsdal registry and horses have to meet many of same standards dole trotter is alternately considered a subtype of dole gudbrandsdal and a separate breed interest in dole gudbrandsdal continued through world war ii and horses were used heavily during norway s occupation by germany breed numbers and interest diminished after war as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals however a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers in 1947 national association was formed to promote and preserve breed as of 2002 there are approximately 4 000 registered dole gudbrandsdals with around 175 new foals registered annually uses when originally developed dole gudbrandsdals were used as pack horses on overland trade routes across norway main one of which connected oslo with north sea and ran through gudbrandsdal valley dole gudbrandsdal is used mainly for heavy draft and agricultural work as well as timber hauling while lighter dole trotter is used mainly for harness racing dole gudbrandsdal was an influential breed in formation of north swedish horse and two breeds are very similar in conformation when dole and north swedish breeds are crossed they produce a lighter weight horse with more forward gaits that is often used for harness racing edwards p 282 dole gudbrandsdal has also been crossed with swedish warmbloods to produce riding type horses and it has been theorized that dole thoroughbred crosses may produce nice hunter horses notes references external links national association of norwegian
