published in 1965 idea for such an award funded by sales of anthologies collecting winning works was proposed by sfwa secretary treasurer lloyd jr in 1965 idea was based on edgar awards presented by mystery writers of america and hosting a ceremony to present them at was prompted by edgar and hugo awards initial ceremony consisted of four literary awards for novels novellas novelettes and short stories which have been presented every year since a script award was also presented from 1974 to 1978 under names best dramatic presentation and best dramatic writing and again from 2000 through 2009 as best script but after 2009 it was again removed and replaced by sfwa with ray bradbury award in 2018 a new game writing category was added for writing in video and tabletop games prior to 2009 nebula awards employed a rolling eligibility system each work was eligible to qualify for ballot for one year following its date of publication as a consequence of rolling eligibility there was possibility for works to be nominated in calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in calendar year after that works were added to a preliminary list for year if they had ten or more nominations which were then voted on to create final ballot in 1970 option was added for voters to select no award if they felt that no nominated work was worthy of winning this happened in 1971 in short story category and in 1977 in script category beginning in 1980 eligibility year for nominations was set to calendar year rather than december november as initially conceived and sfwa organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work authors were also allowed to use mass market paperback publication of their books as beginning of their nomination period rather than initial hardback publication as a consequence of combination of this rule and rolling eligibility 2007 awards despite nominally being for works published in 2006 instead were all given to works initially published in 2005 beginning with 2010 awards rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with current rules categories best novel 1966 present stories of 40 000 words or more best

of most important of american science fiction awards and science fiction and fantasy equivalent of emmy awards along with hugo award nebula award is also considered one of premier awards in science fiction with laura miller of salon terming it science fiction s most prestigious award and justine larbalestier in battle of sexes in science fiction 2002 referring to it and hugo award as best known and most prestigious of science fiction awards brian aldiss in his book trillion year spree history of science fiction claimed that nebula award provided more literary judgment while hugo was a barometer of reader popularity rather than artistic merit though he did note that winners of two awards often overlapped david langford and peter nicholls stated in encyclopedia of science fiction 2012 that two awards were often given to same works and noted that some critics felt that nebula selection reflected political as much as literary ability as it did not seem to focus as much on literary talent over popularity as expected several people within publishing industry have said that winning or being nominated for a nebula award has effects on author s career and sales of that work spider robinson in 1992 as quoted in science fiction culture 2000 said that publishers pay careful attention to who wins a nebula award literary agent richard curtis said in his 1996 mastering business of writing that having term nebula award on cover even as a nominee was a powerful inducement to science fiction fans to buy a novel and gahan wilson in first world fantasy awards 1977 claimed that noting that a book had won nebula award on cover demonstrably increased sales for that novel there have been several anthologies collecting nebula winning short fiction series nebula
