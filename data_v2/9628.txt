penman published first in series of medieval mystery novels penman s first mystery queen s man was a finalist for an edgar award for best first mystery from mystery writers of america penman explains her reasons for turning to mystery genre after writing only historical novels by time i d finished researching and writing when christ and his saints slept i was in danger of burning out for first time in nearly two decades my boundless enthusiasm for middle ages had begun to flag so i decided i needed a change of pace and since i am a long time mystery fan it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write once that idea took root it was probably inevitable that i d choose to write about eleanor of aquitaine surely one of history s most memorable women author interview reading group guides 2009 retrieved 2009 15 06 set in 12th century penman presents young justin de quincy as a medieval sleuth in first book he is elevated to status of queen s man by eleanor of aquitaine queen s man and cruel as grave depict period after king henry ii s death as eleanor about age 70 rules angevin empire with one son richard in captivity and another son john hovering at edge

penman continues to show conflict between mother and sons and weaves in de quincy s conflicts as well in addition to edgar award penman is winner of 2001 career achievement award for historical mysteries from romantic times welsh princes trilogy here be dragons 1985 is first of penman s trilogy of novels about medieval princes of gwynedd of novel penman states i think dragons is so popular because it was virgin territory for most readers saga of plantagenets was much better known but not many people were familiar with medieval wales or its princes and then too story of llewelyn great and joanna king john s illegitimate daughter is a remarkable one which struck an emotional chord with many readers in falls shadow 1988 penman chronicles family relationships of king henry iii and his brother in law simon de montfort falls shadow is a bridge novel as penman uses simon de montfort rebellion to lead her to conclusion of trilogy in reckoning as penman explains after i d finished here be dragons i knew i wanted to continue story at first i d planned to write one book in which simon de montfort would share top billing with llewelyn fawr s grandson llewelyn ap gruffydd who later wed simon s daughter i soon realized though that this was too much to tackle in one book that simon and llewelyn each deserved his own novel so i decided to devote falls shadow to simon and reckoning to llewelyn penman s characterization of simon de montfort is that of a man increasingly disillusioned by his sovereign who rebels in 1263 becomes regent to henry iii and attempts to re establish rights granted under magna carta simon de montfort iv earl of leicester simon de montfort society 2008 retrieved 2009 06 08 in addition to story of simon de montfort and his wife eleanor countess of pembroke and sister to king henry iii novel presents characters such as welsh ruler llywelyn fawr and london s of her research for falls shadow penman explains i did a great deal of on site research visiting castles and battlefields that figured in falls shadow visiting reading room at british library national library of wales in aberystwyth and local reference libraries here at home i made use of university of pennsylvania library in philadelphia which has an excellent medieval selection but it really helped to see scenes for myself at lewes we actually walked along same path that simon de montfort and his men would have followed it was breathtaking to stand on downs gazing out upon same view that he would have seen reckoning 1991 chronicles reign of england s king henry iii in penman s final volume of series that began with here be dragons conflict between welsh prince llewelyn ap gruffydd who is grandson of llewelyn great of here be dragons and england s king henry iii is one subplot additionally penman chronicles life and character of ellen daughter of simon de montfort and niece to henry iii her betrothal to llewelyn negotiated prior to de montfort s death and conflict between ellen and her cousin edward soon to become king edward who opposes betrothal plantagenet series plantagenet series focuses on angevin king henry ii and his wife eleanor of aquitaine beginning with sinking of white ship marriage of empress maude and geoffrey of anjou and henry s birth and childhood in when christ and his saints slept of henry and eleanor penman explains henry ii and eleanor of aquitaine were larger than life legends in their own lifetimes he was one of greatest of medieval kings and she was only woman to wear crowns of both england and france they loved and fought and schemed on a stage that stretched from scots border to mediterranean sea their children were branded by contemporaries as devil s brood but they founded a dynasty that was to rule england for three hundred years my first novel in their trilogy when christ and his saints slept traces beginning of their tempestuous union time and chance continues their story at high noon from greenwoods of wales to a bloodied floor at canterbury cathedral theirs was an amazing story and i very much enjoyed being along for ride when christ and his saints slept introduces genesis of plantagenet dynasty as queen maude fights to secure her claim to english throne in 15 years she spent writing three novels and four mysteries set during period of henry ii and eleanor of aquitaine penman claims she found no villains instead she focused on human characteristics she believes henry ii was a brilliant king but a bad father of eleanor of aquitaine she claims she was a law unto herself and penman was intrigued by role of a medieval queen time and chance 2002 a new york times bestseller continues story of eleanor of aquitaine and her husband and focuses on rift between henry ii and thomas becket time and chance spans a 15 year period from 1156 to 1171 as henry ii became estranged from his wife although eleanor and henry have eight children during thirteen years and from his close friend and advisor

by henry penman places characters against a tightly woven tapestry of medieval life personal conflict and dramatic characters devil s brood was supposed to be final volume in penman s plantagenet series but angevins were not ready to go quietly into that good night lionheart 2011 is about children of henry ii and eleanor of aquitaine book focuses on richard lionheart s crusades in holy land and on what happened to eleanor when she was finally released after spending sixteen years in a confinement that was ordered and enforced by her husband a king s ransom is about second half of richard s life during and following his imprisonment ransom and life afterward writing characteristics penman s approach to her novels is to present meticulously researched medieval life and history as everyday life and to present nobility as fallible set against a backdrop of political tension power struggles war and hardship main characters confront personal drama such as conflict in love conflict between family members conflict with god and conflict in friendship as well as conflicted loyalties between family self king and country a library journal review praises penman s attention to detail in which she combines an in depth knowledge of medieval europe with vivid storytelling re creating complex events and emotional drama of 12th 15th centuries when i first visited dolwyddelan i had to park my car off road ask at farmhouse if i could see castle and then trudge up hill dodging sheep i am also very fond of today s swallow falls which looks much as it did in llewelyn and joanna s time
