despite this race was held in 2008 but race was dropped from formula one calendar for 2009 french grand prix would not return to formula one world championship calendar until 2018 at previous race in canada hamilton had crashed into raikkonen in pit lane when raikkonen braked to stop in front of red light at end of pit lane williams driver nico rosberg then collided into back of hamilton hamilton

position they could start no better than 11th after penalty was given mclaren s ceo martin whitmarsh said that he thought penalty was severe citing a similar incident at monaco where raikkonen had crashed into back of force india s adrian sutil there no penalty had been given however rosberg said that penalties from canada were deserved when hamilton was asked whether penalty would force him to change his approach hamilton said that it doesn t really it s a race i m here to win and so i approach it same it s going to be harder he added coming from back but i don t have any doubts or any worries i think we re going to have a very strong package this weekend and i think car will be as good if not better than it was in last race with that pace as long as we stay out of trouble we should be able to score some good points renault driver nelson piquet jr who was in his first year in formula one and had scored no points prior to this race said that he thought that track suited him and car much better than previous races bmw sauber had taken their first victory at previous race but team principal mario theissen said that a second win was unlikely at magny cours in technical developments bmw sauber ferrari mclaren and toyota all revised their front wings bmw brought both their new wing as well as version they had used for previous race to magny cours but decided to use revised wing as it offered better levels of downforce ferrari s wing changes aimed at improving performance of car s nose hole nose hole which had been introduced at spanish grand prix aimed at creating greater levels of downforce by channelling airflow williams changed their front sidepod winglets at previous race red bull modified their rb4 s bridge wing to prevent it from flexing to comply with latest rule clarifications for magny cours team revised central section of this element with aim of generating greater downforce levels practice and qualifying thumb right robert kubica

race conditions on grid were dry before race although sky was overcast weather forecasts predicted rain near end of race most of frontrunners began race on harder compound tyre rain that had fallen earlier that morning had removed some of rubber on track meaning that graining when small grains of rubber come off a tyre was likely to be a problem out of two tyre types harder would better cope with this raikkonen made a good start retaining his first position massa behind him maintained his second place alonso who started third was passed by both trulli and kubica but re passed kubica at hairpin turn exit glock also made a good start taking sixth after passing webber going into first corner button touched bourdais resulting in damage to honda s front wing hamilton who started 13th

13 hamilton was given a drive through penalty for cutting corner of turn seven on lap one and gaining an advantage he took penalty immediately and re emerged in 13th position over next few laps

his teammate further back alonso who had been running fourth made first scheduled pit stop resuming 12th button was lapped by several drivers due to damage his car had sustained in his first corner

then in fourth pitted over next two laps both raikkonen and massa pitted by lap 30 raikkonen had opened his lead to 6 6 seconds over massa while trulli was over half a minute behind him in third just before half distance raikkonen s pace became slower and massa behind him caught up passing his teammate on lap 39 after race raikkonen explained that his lack of pace was due to his car s right exhaust pipe breaking causing engine to lose power further back kovalainen who was running seventh passed webber to take sixth by lap 46 massa had a 10 second lead over his teammate on same lap kubica pitted from fourth starting next round of pit stops trulli pitted from third on lap 50 and raikkonen and kovalainen two laps later massa pitted on lap 54 and emerged 13 4 seconds ahead of raikkonen trulli kept his third position but kovalainen who made up several places through pit stops to move to fourth was closing behind him on lap 55 light rain started to fall although it would continue to rain lightly for next few laps it was never heavy enough to be a problem to drivers by lap 58 kovalainen was right behind trulli a few laps later exhaust pipe which had broken earlier on raikkonen s car came off completely but raikkonen continued to race with similar lap times kovalainen meanwhile continued to try to find a way past trulli one lap before end of race kovalainen attempted to pass trulli but ran wide as trulli defended his position massa crossed line to win race with raikkonen nearly eighteen seconds behind trulli retained third and took his first podium since 2005 spanish

since 2006 australian grand prix massa was delighted with his race victory saying a great race a fantastic result win came my way because kimi had a problem with his car and at pace he was running it would have been hard for me to beat him on track i would have been happy with second place but of course win makes me even happier after race raikkonen said trulli said today was a great race hard and tough we had a good pace even if we had to battle with some cars that were quicker than us i had to fight really hard but that is what people should expect both from myself and from toyota hamilton commented on his drive through penalty my drive through penalty was an extremely close call i felt i d got past vettel fairly and was ahead going into corner but i was on outside and couldn t turn in in case we both crashed then i lost back end and drove over kerb thumb left nelson piquet jr took his first ever points in formula one in his eighth race after bmw sauber s victory at previous race their director mario theissen said that over entire weekend here our package did not work perfectly while driver heidfeld said that it was a disappointing result alonso said that he felt disappointed after his poor start to race red bull s director christian horner said that their problems lay in bad starts their drivers had made button who retired during race commented on his collision i got a good start and was alongside bourdais i thought he was going to turn in at turn one and close door so i pulled in behind him and then unfortunately hit him in rear as everything slowed down for corner i could feel that there was something broken at front of car as there was an air coming in from front but car was driveable and i was staying with back of pack so i continued we replaced nose but had been pulled off and car had become undriveable so i had to retire piquet scored his first points in formula one in race having failed to score up to that point he said that he was happy and hoped that team could continue like this for rest of season thumb right heikki kovalainen took fourth for mclaren after race massa moved into lead of drivers championship on 48 points taking championship lead
