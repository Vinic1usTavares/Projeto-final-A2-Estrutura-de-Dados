with one in downtown cincinnati and all locations in kentucky due to unprofitability j c penney had previously conducted market research which determined need for more shopping mall based stores in

centers bought mall in may 2006 after losing j c penney tri county mall and surrounding retail developments continued to suffer a decline in tenancy one factor was great recession which impacted a large number of retailers that had locations in or nearby mall among these were borders books music value city compusa and circuit city all of which went out of business entirely also population growth had shifted northerly from mall since 1990s resulting in newer retail developments which drew away tenants and shoppers from older developments these factors also impacted northgate and forest fair malls creating a surplus of retail space in area another factor cited by analysts in mall s decline was a curfew enacted in 2010 requiring patrons under age of 18 to be escorted out of mall by 4 pm on fridays and saturdays in july 2013 mall was purchased by singhaiyi group a real estate company based in singapore dillard s downgraded its store to an outlet store in 2013 and then closed it in
