sunda strait campaign of january 1794 was a series of manoeuvres and naval actions fought between warships and privateers of french republic and a squadron of vessels sent by british east india company to protect trade in region later augmented by dutch warships campaign developed as french forces based on ile de france reacted more quickly than british forces in indian ocean to expansion of french revolutionary wars on 1 february 1793 french privateers rapidly spread along british trade routes in far east becoming concentrated around narrow sunda strait between islands of java and sumatra in dutch east indies these ships were soon joined by french navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in region royal navy forces in indian ocean were deployed elsewhere and so east india company private enterprise that ruled much of british india in 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol strait and drive off raiders arrival of this british force on 2 january 1794 was initially a success squadron over running and capturing two large and well armed privateers on 22 january not long after french vessels had been beaten off during an attack on british trading post at bencoolen on 24 january an action against a larger french squadron was fought in strait itself but ended inconclusively and squadrons divided british receiving dutch frigate amazone as reinforcements french subsequently turned southwards out of strait and attacked bencoolen again on 9 february capturing an east indiaman in harbour before returning to ile de france with their prize background on 1 february 1793 french republic declared war on great britain and dutch republic extending already existing french revolutionary wars it took several months for news of outbreak of war to reach british india messages arriving at calcutta from consul george baldwin at alexandria on 11 june james p 119 royal navy commander in region commodore william cornwallis immediately set about demanding surrender of french trading posts in india most fell within a few days but major port of pondicherry refused and was besieged from 1 august siege lasted a month before french commander capitulated under bombardment from british land and naval forces with french presence eliminated from india cornwallis was ordered to return to europe leaving minimal naval forces in indian ocean indian ocean formed a vital part of britain s trade links with wider british empire india was controlled by east india company a commercial organisation that maintained its own army and navy in indian waters and owned a fleet of large merchant ships known as east indiamen these vessels ranged in size between 400 and 1500 tons burthen bm carried up to 30 cannons and were capable in certain conditions of fighting warships although a frigate was usually more than a match for an individual east indiaman clowes vol 5 p 337 these ships sailed on an annual route from china east indies or india carrying trade goods such as spices tea or silk to britain there goods were sold and replaced with general cargo including military equipment and troops for journey back to indian ocean gardiner victory of seapower p 101 one of most vital parts of indian trade route was through sunda strait between islands of sumatra and java in dutch east indies through which most of china and east indies trade passed on its journey to indian ocean french ships both navy warships and commercially owned privateers operated along indian trade routes from their base at isolated island of ile de france and recognised strategic importance of sunda straits as soon as news of war arrived at ile de france french ships spread out into indian ocean in search of british and dutch merchant shipping gathering in significant numbers off sunda straits on 27 september 1793 french cruisers achieved their first major victory when three privateers mounting more than 20 guns each attacked east indiaman under captain james horncastle off or or anger point in sunda strait although horncastle resisted privateers outgunned him and eventually forced him to strike james p 196 with royal navy unable to provide forces to protect trade in east indies east india company authorities in india decided to form a squadron from their own ships to patrol region two east indiamen and and country ship were diverted from their regular route for service accompanied by brig nautilus or possibly viper and under overall command of commodore charles mitchell captain of william pitt campaign on 2 january 1794 this force passed singapore and entered malacca strait sailing eastwards in search of french raiders as british squadron travelled along northern coast of sumatra two french privateers attacked east india company s trading post at bencoolen on southern coast privateers were 30 gun vengeur under captain corosin and 26 gun under captain jallineaux and on 17 january they approached mouth of rat island basin close to bencoolen where 32 gun east indiaman lay at anchor pigot under captain george ballantyne had a crew of 102 men but was completely unprepared for action brenton p 219 at 08 15 vengeur opened fire at maintaining battle for an hour and 45 minutes before hauling off so that resolu could continue combat ballantyne defended his vessel intelligently positioning pigot so that french could only approach one at a time through narrow mouth of bay this allowed him to drive off each ship in turn privateers falling back together at 10 20 with damaged rigging pigot too had suffered with one man killed and sufficient damage to rigging to require several weeks of repairs after immediate repairs had been completed corosin abandoned bencoolen and retreated to sunda strait in search of weaker targets clowes vol 4 p 483 early on 22 january mitchell s squadron reinforced by east indiaman stopped a merchant ship for inspection and as ship was searched two new sails appeared to southwest near shown rock in zuften islands suspicious of identity of new arrivals mitchell sent britannia and nonsuch in pursuit and ships turned away as east indiamen closed with fleeing ships they were identified as vengeur and resolu british vessels soon outran french and french opened fire to which larger british vessels responded captain thomas cheap of britannia engaged vengeur while captain john canning of nonsuch attacked resolu at 10 45 and were soon supported by william pitt and houghton overwhelming numbers and size of british squadron soon convinced corosin and jallineaux that further resistance was pointless and 45 minutes after first shots were fired both surrendered corosin died in aftermath of battle after losing a leg and another 11 french sailors were killed and 25 wounded while british losses were one killed and two wounded on britannia james p 197 french records report that resolu has sustained heavy casualties demerliac 1804 p 309 british then manned both raiders with crews from east indiaman squadron battle of sunda strait on morning of 24 january most of mitchell s squadron lay at anchor off island of pulau panjang in bantam bay on northwestern tip of java with nonsuch and new prizes remaining in zuften islands about distant james p 198 at 06 00 sails were sighted in northern part of sunda strait passing small island of dwars in de weg that were rapidly identified as three frigates and a brig these were in fact french naval squadron from ile de france consisting of frigates prudente and cybele brig vulcain and captured princess royal now renamed duguay trouin under overall command of captain jean marie renaud canning attempted to communicate with strange vessels but by 13 00 it was obvious from their lack of response that these were enemy ships and greatly outnumbered canning made all sail northeast with his prizes to avoid destruction during evening heavy rain squalls reduced visibility and prevented any decisive movement by either side but on 25 january french squadron had rounded st nicholas point at northwestern tip of java and was in full pursuit of canning s ships which had been joined by houghton resolu in particular was struggling to escape advancing enemy but mitchell had realised danger and was sailing to intercept french at 06 30 houghton nonsuch and vengeur joined with remainder of mitchell s force and two hours later renaud s ships met british line resolu just managing to reach safety in shelter of large east indiamen despite being hit repeatedly in latter stages of chase for an hour two squadrons continued a general exchange of fire at long range before mitchell turned william pitt houghton and nonsuch towards french at 09 30 latter two both managing to hit cybele with destructive broadsides firing continued for another 18 minutes as renaud withdrew eventually anchoring off island of pulau baby neither commander was keen to continue action mitchell fearing that his undermanned ships would not be able to properly engage better armed french vessels casualties among french squadron are not known but only loss on british ships was on nonsuch which had a man killed in combat with cybele james p 199 final operations in need of reinforcement and resupply mitchell drew his squadron back to batavia and was there joined by 36 gun dutch frigate amazone under captain and an armed merchant ship mitchell s ships then cruised sunda strait for another two weeks without discovering any enemy vessels before concluding operation on 8 february and returning to indian ocean via bencoolen cheap died of an illness in june brenton p 220 but mitchell survived and on his return to britain in 1796 was knighted by king george iii and presented with ps8 000 equivalent of ps as of as reward and compensation for his diversion to straits dutch meanwhile retained their warships for a raid on where two french corvettes were sheltering both were captured without a fight and sent back to france as cartels carrying french prisoners alternatively reported in august 1794 on her return to england that dutch at batavia had purchased french prizes vengeur and resolve and would send them in july to mauritius as cartels with french prisoners french squadron under renaud had used retreat of mitchell s force to also withdraw into indian ocean via bencoolen reaching british trading post on 9 february there pigot was still undergoing repairs and was taken by surprise and captured as merchant ship was manoeuvred out of bay renaud demanded surrender of small fort marlborough nearby and was informed that fort was well armed and that arrival of mitchell s squadron was expected at any moment unwilling to continue engagement with mitchell renaud withdrew immediately without assaulting fort aftermath french squadron subsequently returned to ile de france where in action of 22 october 1794 they drew away two british warships that blockaded island gardiner fleet battle and blockade p 73 sunda strait and surrounding waters remained an important strategic location throughout war although subsequent organisation of east indiamen into convoys and return of a royal navy presence in region assisted in limiting losses to french privateers and smaller warships gardiner fleet battle and blockade p 60 on more than one occasion convoys of east indiamen successfully discouraged large squadrons from attempting attacks on valuable merchant craft with their size and power miller p 154 orders of battle east india company ship type commander
