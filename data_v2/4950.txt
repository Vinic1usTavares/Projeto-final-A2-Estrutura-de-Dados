cowpea vigna unguiculata is an annual herbaceous legume from genus vigna due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall it is an important crop in semiarid regions across africa and asia it requires very few inputs as plant s root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well suited to intercropping with other crops whole plant is used as forage for animals with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name four subspecies of cowpeas are recognised of which three are cultivated a high level of morphological diversity is found within species with large variations in size shape and structure of plant cowpeas can be erect semierect trailing or climbing crop is mainly grown for its seeds which are high in protein although leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed cultivated cowpeas are known by common names black eyed pea southern pea yardlong bean catjang and crowder pea they were domesticated in africa and are one of oldest crops to be farmed a second domestication event probably occurred in asia before they spread into europe and americas seeds are usually cooked and made into stews and curries or ground into flour or paste most cowpeas are grown on african continent particularly in nigeria and niger which account for 66 of world production a 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis insect infestation is a major constraint to production of cowpea sometimes causing over 90 loss in yield legume pod borer maruca vitrata is main preharvest pest of cowpea and cowpea weevil callosobruchus maculatus main postharvest pest taxonomy and etymology alt a group of brown kidney shaped peas a black spot is visible on some of them thumb black eyed peas a common name for a cowpea cultivar are named due to presence of a distinctive black spot on their hilum vigna unguiculata is a member of vigna peas and beans genus unguiculata is latin for with a small claw which reflects small stalks on flower petals all cultivated cowpeas are found within universally accepted v unguiculata subspecies unguiculata classification which is then commonly divided into four cultivar groups unguiculata biflora sesquipedalis and textilis some well known common names for cultivated cowpeas include black eye pea southern pea yardlong bean catjang and crowder pea classification of wild relatives within v unguiculata is more complicated with over 20 different names having been used and between 3 and 10 subgroups described original subgroups of and tenuis appear to be common in all taxonomic treatments while variations pubescens and protractor were raised to subspecies level by a 1993 this appears to be one of latest taxonomical classifications first written reference of word cowpea appeared in 1798 in united states name was most likely acquired due to their use as a fodder crop for cows black eyed pea a common name used for unguiculata cultivar group describes presence of a distinctive black spot at hilum of seed black eyed peas were first introduced to southern states in united states and some early varieties had peas squashed closely together in their pods leading to other common names of southern pea and crowder pea sesquipedalis in latin means foot and a half long and this subspecies which arrived in united states via asia is characterised by unusually long pods leading to common names of yardlong bean asparagus bean and chinese long bean common names of vigna unguiculata unguiculata cultivar name unguiculata crowder pea southern pea black eyed pea biflora catjang sow pea sesquipedalis yardlong bean asparagus bean chinese long bean textilis description a large morphological diversity is found within crop and growth conditions and grower preferences for each variety vary from region to region however as plant is primarily self pollinating its genetic diversity within varieties is relatively low cowpeas can either be short and bushy as short as or act like a vine by climbing supports or trailing along ground to a height of taproot can penetrate to a depth of after eight weeks size and shape of leaves vary greatly making this an important feature for classifying and distinguishing cowpea varieties another distinguishing feature of cowpeas is long peduncles which hold flowers and seed pods one peduncle can support four or more seed pods flower colour varies through different shades of purple pink yellow and white and blue seeds and seed pods from wild cowpeas are very small while cultivated varieties can have pods between long a pod can contain six to 13 seeds that are usually kidney shaped although seeds become more spherical more restricted they are within pod their texture and colour are very diverse they can have a smooth or rough coat and be speckled mottled or blotchy colours include white cream green red brown and black or various combinations history alt map of african continent with green highlights around lower western peninsular thumb cowpea was believed to have originated in west africa compared to most other important crops little is known about domestication dispersal and cultivation history of cowpea although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation centre of diversity of cultivated cowpea is west africa leading an early consensus that this is likely centre of origin and place of early domestication new research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in east africa and currently both theories carry equal weight while date of cultivation began may be uncertain it is still considered one of oldest domesticated crops remains of charred cowpeas from rock shelters in central ghana have been dated to second millennium bce in 2300 bc cowpea is believed to have made its way into southeast asia where secondary domestication events may have occurred from there they traveled north to mediterranean where they were used by greeks and romans first written references to cowpea were in 300 bc and they probably reached central and north america during slave trade through 17th to early 19th centuries cultivation left thumb a cowpea plant with some pods ready for harvest cowpeas thrive in poor dry conditions growing well in soils up to 85 sand this makes them a particularly important crop in arid semidesert regions where not many other crops will grow as well as an important source of food for humans in poor arid regions crop can also be used as feed for livestock its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole crop cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum millet maize cassava or cotton alt thumb seeds from wild type cowpea are much smaller than cultivated varieties thumb from nepal optimum temperature for cowpea growth is making it only available as a summer crop for most of world it grows best in regions with an annual rainfall between ideal soils are sandy and it has better tolerance for infertile and acid soil than most other crops generally for erect varieties and for climbing and trailing varieties seeds can be harvested after about 100 days or whole plant used as forage after about 120 days leaves can be picked from 4 weeks after planting these characteristics along with its low fertilisation requirements make cowpea an ideal crop for resource poor farmers living in sahel region of west africa early maturing varieties of crop can thrive in semiarid climate where rainfall is often less than timing of planting is crucial as plant must mature during seasonal rains crop is mostly intercropped with pearl millet and plants are selected that provide both food and fodder value instead of more specialised varieties storage of seeds can be problematic in africa due to potential infestation by postharvest pests traditional methods of protecting stored grain include using insecticidal properties of neem extracts mixing grain with ash or sand using vegetable oils combining ash and oil into a soap solution or treating cowpea pods with smoke or heat more modern methods include storage in airtight containers using gamma irradiation or heating or freezing seeds temperatures of kill weevil larvae leading to a recent push to develop cheap forms of solar heating that can be used to treat stored grain one of more recent developments is use a cheap reusable double bagging system called pics that cowpea weevils pests and diseases thumb larva from maruca vitrata commonly called maruca pod borer is one of most damaging insect pests to cowpea plant insects are a major factor in low yields of african cowpea crops and they affect each tissue component and developmental stage of plant in bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90 loss in yield legume pod borer maruca vitrata is main preharvest pest of cowpea other important pests include pod sucking bugs thrips and postharvest cowpea weevil callosobruchus maculatus m vitrata causes most damage to growing cowpea due to their large host range and cosmopolitan distribution it causes damage to flower buds flowers and pods of plant with infestations resulting in a 20 88 loss of yield while insect can cause damage through all growth stages most of damage occurs during flowering biological control has had limited success so most preventive methods rely on use of genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express cry protein from bacillus thuringiensis which is toxic to lepidopteran species including maruca left thumb cowpea weevil callosobruchus maculatus infests stored cowpea seeds resulting in major postharvest losses severe c maculatus infestations can affect 100 of stored peas and cause up to 60 loss within a few months weevil generally enters cowpea pod through holes before harvest and lays eggs on dry seed larvae burrow their way into seed feeding on endosperm weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within seed an individual can lay 20 40 eggs and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks most common methods of protection involve use of insecticides main pesticides used being synthetic and organophosphates cowpea is susceptible to nematode fungal bacterial and virus diseases which can result in substantial loss in yield common diseases include root rot wilt powdery mildew root knot rust and leaf spot plant is susceptible to mosaic viruses which cause a green mosaic pattern to appear in leaves cowpea mosaic virus cpmv discovered in 1959 has become a useful research tool cpmv is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems one of plant s defenses against some insect attacks is cowpea trypsin inhibitor cpti cpti is only gene obtained outside of b thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop besides biotic stresses cowpea also faces various challenges in different parts of world such as drought heat and cold drought lowers growth rate and development ultimately reducing yield although cowpea is considered more drought tolerant than most other crops drought at stage in cowpea can reduce yield potential by 360 kg ha crop wild relatives are prominent source of genetic material which can be tapped to improve biotic abiotic tolerance in crops international institute of tropical agriculture iita nigeria and institut de i environment ae de recherches are working on cowpea crop wild relatives to tap genetic diversity and transfer that into cultivars to make them more tolerant to different stresses and adaptive to climate change culinary use thumb hoppin john also known as carolina peas and rice is a common meal in rural southern united states that is often served with fresh greens and is especially popular on new years day cowpeas are grown mostly for their edible beans although leaves green seeds and pods can also be consumed meaning cowpea can be used as a food source before dried peas are harvested like other legumes cowpeas are cooked to make them edible usually by boiling cowpeas can be prepared in stews soups and casseroles but most common way to eat them is in curries they can also be processed into a paste or flour chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sauteed stir fried or deep fried a common snack in africa is koki or moyin moyin where cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves they also use cowpea paste as a supplement in infant formula when weaning babies off milk slaves brought to america and west indies cooked cowpeas much same way as they did in africa although many people in american south considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption a popular dish was hoppin john which contained black eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now hoppin john is seen as a traditional southern dish ritually served on new year s day nutrition and health cowpea seeds provide a rich source of proteins and calories as well as minerals and vitamins this complements mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop a seed can consist of 25 protein and has very low fat content cowpea starch is digested more slowly than starch from cereals which is more beneficial to human health grain is a rich source of folic acid an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies cowpea has often been referred to as poor man s meat due to high levels of protein found in seeds and leaves however it does contain some antinutritional elements notable acid and protease inhibitors which reduce nutritional value of crop although little research has been conducted on nutritional value of leaves and immature pods what is available suggests that leaves have a similar nutritional value to black nightshade and sweet potato leaves while green pods have less antinutritional factors than dried seeds production and consumption most cowpeas are grown on african continent particularly in nigeria and niger which account for 66 of world cowpea production 24 01 2015 fao 2012 faostat gateway sahel region also contains other major producers such as burkina faso ghana senegal and mali niger is main exporter of cowpeas and nigeria main importer exact figures for cowpea production are hard to come up with as it is not a major export crop estimating world cowpea production is rather difficult as it is usually grown in a mixture with other crops but according to a 1997 estimate cowpeas are cultivated on and have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes while they play a key role in subsistence farming and livestock fodder cowpea is also seen as a major cash crop by central and west african farmers with an estimated 200 million people consuming cowpea on a daily basis according to food and agriculture organization of united nations as of 2012 average cowpea yield in western africa was an estimated which is still 50 below estimated potential production yield in some tradition cropping methods yield can be as low as outside africa major production areas are asia central america and south america brazil is world s second leading producer of cowpea seed accounting for 17 of annual cowpea production although most is consumed within country references external links cowpea research at international institute of tropical agriculture iita network for genetic improvement of cowpea for all consensus document on
