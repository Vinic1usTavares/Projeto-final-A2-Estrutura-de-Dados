trait du nord previously also known as ardennais du nord or ardennais de type nord is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred in area of hainaut in western belgium and in northeastern france originally considered a subtype of ardennes it was recognized as an individual breed with opening of a studbook in 1903 developed in fertile flemish grasslands it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work by 1855 horses bred near hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other flemish draft breeds trait du nord was used extensively in mining from late 19th century through 1920 with lesser use continuing through 1960s trait du nord continued to be used extensively for agriculture through world war ii but after war this usage and breed population declined significantly as farming became increasingly mechanized during mid 20th century breed was in demand for production of horse meat and due to this was bred to be larger and heavier in early 1970s market for horse meat began to decline and trait du nord like many european draft breeds was in danger of extinction it was not until 1990s that breed experienced a slight revival through an increased interest in recreational riding and driving trait du nord is large with stallions weighing upwards of and is bred for traction ability and pulling power breed is found in many solid colors although bay and roan are most common and is known to be gentle and easy to handle two slightly different types of trait du nord are found a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work breed is considered to be endangered by french government with fewer than 100 new foal births a year national breed registry in france is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding due to low number of breeding stallions and is at risk of extinction naming and registration according to french national stud current official name of breed is trait du nord name has changed several times during its history in mid 19th century it is mentioned as large horse of hainaut moll et al p 531 but before 1903 it was not considered a separate breed and was often thought to be same as ardennes mavre p 44 beginning in 1913 it was known as trait ardennes north and from et al pp 122 123 to 1965 was known as northern ardennes draft name of trait du nord became commonly used around 1961 until august 5 1903 trait du nord s studbook was merged with that of ardennes with former being considered a subtype of latter and called northern type ardennes studbook was under responsibility of combined group studbook of northern workhorses in 1913 name of trait du nord was used for first time and french mares began to be registered as their own breed although belgian horses continued to be used for breeding with resulting progeny able to be registered as trait du nords in 1919 northern type was separated from ardennes although remained tied and horse was given name northern ardennes a centralized breeding union for northern ardennes was created in 1945 in france union of trait du nord horse breeders is national breed association recognized by ministry of agriculture and fisheries its mission is to promote breed and assist in its recovery as well as creating and executing a policy of genetic improvement through selective breeding association works with french national stud and center for genetic resources to develop breeding programs and represents trait du nord on french breed committees it also organizes and contributes to contests and events that help to promote and develop breed breed characteristics thumb right upright head of a mare in early 1930s breed reached peak of its physical structure mavre p 38 it was then described as a born laborer built for traction and with a conformation that allowed it to move huge weights over short distances mavre p 42 although some breeds of draft horses have declined in weight in modern times trait du nord has remained relatively large average size in breed is for mares and for stallions weighing for mares and for stallions foals of 30 months who are candidates to become registered must be at least bay and roan are most frequent colors seen in breed chestnut including liver chestnut although this color is quite rare is also allowed as are black brown and gray although latter is extremely rare in france national stud regulates physical standards of trait du nord and eight other french breeds eligibility criteria have changed several times since opening of studbook in 1913 and now describe ideal trait du nord as large well built short and powerful with a large frame and well developed muscles energetic with easygoing and beautiful gaits members of breed are described by breed association as courageous and observant as well as gentle and easy to handle head is generally small in proportion to mass of horse and often snub with a flat profile neither concave nor convex neck is of medium length and strong often slightly arched withers are prominent and shoulder long and slightly oblique back is short and straight and body compact solid and very muscular chest is deep with a broad muscular breast croup is wide and powerfully muscled hooves are hard and strong there are two main types of trait du nord one is a heavier type bred for pulling heavy loads while other is a lighter type bred for slightly faster work generally at trot auxois ardennes brabant and some dutch draft breeds may be admitted to trait du nord studbook after being inspected and approved by a review panel registered horses are marked with a stylized n brand on left side of neck signifying conformity to breed standard history ancestors of breed lived in northern river valleys of sambre and scheldt near valenciennes although it is a popular myth that many french draft breeds including trait du nord are descendants of prehistoric horses found at solutre this is not true two or possibly three subspecies of now extinct equines have been found at solutre but there is no evidence that they migrated to area that later produced trait du nord like dutch and belgian draft breeds such as brabant origin of trait du nord is found in large fertile flemish grasslands that cover southern portion of netherlands northern france and all of belgium hainaut region is true birthplace of breed in france belgian draft breeds ardennes and trait du nord share same ancestry and trait du nord has a history that is very similar to ardennes due to influence of latter breed on former ardennes belgian dutch heavy draft trait du nord and auxois are all considered to come from same group of breeds due to their heritage physical characteristics and selection for draft work until relatively recently breeds were not differentiated and were frequently crossbred thumb left a boulonnais horse used to add elegance to trait du nord in late 19th century region of flanders is particularly conducive to agriculture and in 19th century draining of swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes as there were no existing horses in area that were suitable for plowing farmers found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use from 1850s on farmers selected horses that eventually became trait du nord farmers combined large belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with ardennes and dutch breeds for size weight and strength result was a muscular powerful and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement trait du nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport trait du nord proved a successful breed for farmers that developed it and quickly spread throughout netherlands belgium and northern france it was given different names depending on country and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from netherlands brabants and ardennes breed associations began to organize in late 19th century and at this point blood from boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to breed trait du nord gradually began to differ from ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits and breed became popular in north and east of france in 1855 even before breed had been differentiated from ardennes veterinarians described heavy horses bred near hainaut as superior to flemish breeds journal des du midi p 558 20th century during world war i trait du nord horses were among those confiscated by germans from belgium and france for use in war in 1919 these horses were returned to their homeland allowing reconstruction of breed dal secco p 32 during world war ii armed forces used all stocks of fuel and draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in france mavre p 66 after war farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment decline in breeding of trait du nord became noticeable in early 1950s and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely by early 1970s breeding had slowed so much that trait du nord along with other french draft breeds was in danger of extinction mavre p 31 as horses were replaced by tractors production of horse meat became main viable market for trait du nord and other french breeds as horses were sought for meat larger heavier animals became more in demand and these horses lost much of their power and pulling ability a french decree on august 24 1976 published in official journal encouraged farmers to select biggest heaviest stallions for breeding french national stud backed this decree and encouraged breeding of foals that would fatten rapidly to be butchered at age of eighteen months between mid 20th century and 1980s average weight of trait du nord increased from between to over mavre p 150 since early 1970s use of trait du nord for meat has declined contributing to a further reduction in breeding in early 1990s recreational riding experienced a revival and consumption of horse meat continued to decrease on march 11 1994 trait du nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses members of breed are occasionally exported from france with some going to italy belgium and germany mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons a few are sent to sicily and guadeloupe but this is quite rare uses thumb right large horse of hainaut circa 1861 trait du nord was originally used mainly for agriculture and mining they also towed barges on waterways although this use ended quickly with increased use of engine at beginning of 20th century peak use of breed for agriculture was quite short running from 1880 to around 1960 ending due to increased use of mechanized equipment but it allowed significant progress in agriculture in northern france mavre p 43 stamina and energy of breed allows them to perform well in heavy and compact soils in region of nord pas de calais and recover quickly after exercise nature of soils in hainaut required a horse weighing more than for effective plowing since 1950s trait du nord has been preferred breed for farmers who practiced intensive cropping of cereals and beets in northern great plains of france pulling power of trait du nord made it popular for use during industrial revolution of late 19th century in heavy industry including mining in mines steam engines and internal combustion engines could not be used due to possibility of a gas explosion first horses were used in mines in 1821 and trait du nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in mines and operating pulleys used to lift coal to surface dumont and p 14 breeders worked to adapt breed to mining requirements and breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads good horses were able to pull usually around twelve cars worth along a railway as early as 1920 usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use and in 1969 last horse was removed from mines 1990s and today today breed is used mainly for meat and logging forested areas inaccessible to machinery since mid 1990s colts not intended for breeding recreational riding or harness work are heavily fed and sent out to slaughter before age of eighteen months fillies are generally used for breeding breed association and its breeders are trying to secure future of trait du nord by finding new markets especially in areas of recreational riding agricultural work recreational and competitive driving breed is involved in several reenactments and folk villages which attract good crowds breed is promoted for its use in logging in forests and fragile areas with professional foresters using them to preserve value and biodiversity of forested areas revival of team driving has prompted farmers who use trait du nord to attend competitions and improve quality of their horses qualities of breed make it a popular horse for leaders in areas of recreational and competition team driving and breed has advantage of being able to be immediately returned to work even after a period of inactivity for several months when being driven a traditional flemish collar is generally used horses are trained to be driven with only one rein leaving driver s hands free for other work when shown in hand trait du nord horses are often presented in groups generally between four and eight to a string each year trait du nord is honored at an agricultural show and horse show in paris in 1995 breed won international workhorse trophy at paris show and in 2010 a trait du nord took first place prize for weight pulling at show trait du nord teams participate in route du poisson a relay race commemorating route that teams took to bring fresh fish from boulogne to paris until 19th century race takes place every two or three years and is biggest equine relay race in europe breed preservation thumb a horse under saddle at a show in 2009 trait du nord is an endangered breed haras de compiegne compiegne stud a national stud in france had a major influence in saving breed until it was closed in october 2009 national breed registry for trait du nord is supported by other local initiatives however breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented and media attention on trait du nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms but even number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle which are more lucrative although breed associations and french national stud are making efforts to protect breed very low numbers persist and these organizations consider breed very close to extinction it is one of most threatened french horse breeds production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work one author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that steady decline in breed numbers is proof that breed is slowly disappearing beginning in 2011 trait du nord association is working with north pas de calais regional council and other groups to increase number of births by 20 percent by december 2014 and double number by 2020 main breeding areas are located around former compiegne stud and include departments of nord pas de calais oise aisne and somme a few are found in central region of normandy and paris area this breed is found mainly in france and is rarely exported abroad or only very sporadically with related belgian and dutch breeds a survey of mares in 2008 gave 121 mares in region of north pas de calais 46 in picardy 6 in normandy and one to three mares in other regions despite efforts to revive interest in breed numbers steadily declined in years before 1988 bongianni p 93 in 1995 there were 33 stallions in service in 1996 this number remained same and by 1998 it had declined to 30 in 2004 there were 111 breeders and 119 trait du nord foals were registered by 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered a number which is exposing breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding to combat this danger farmers are cross breeding trait du nord with approved belgian and dutch horses number of farmers breeding trait du nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002 then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008 after birth rates remained relatively steady in 1990s they began to drop in 2000s declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007 notes references external links category horse breeds category horse breeds originating in france
