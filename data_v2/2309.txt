day trip from salt lake city to st george utah with her two younger sons evan o neil and william wood as guests of brigham young in view of thomas kane s work in defending latter day saints in utah she was initially uninterested in going but changed her mind when she thought change in weather could improve her husband s poor health kane hoped that issues with polygamy would be solved if congress legitimized current polygamous marriages but prohibited subsequent marriages she used her time in utah to converse with mormon women and understand their opinions on polygamy she was shocked to discover that they staunchly defended polygamy and appeared to be content in their plural marriages kane s book twelve mormon homes visited in succession on a journey through utah to arizona consisted of her letters home and her personal travel journal this specific travel account described her time traveling through salt lake city to st george each of twelve homes she visited was a stop for food and lodging on way in writing her objective was to inform rather than to persuade this was neither an unusual approach nor a new topic as at time many writers wrote mormon travel accounts similar to hers according to eric a eliason travel accounts had become their own style of literature due to interest and recording of point of view of subject matter kane followed this approach in writing her travel account interviewing mormons and recording their opinions while attempting to remain detached from subject matter in contrast to most of mormon travel accounts written at time her writing focused on rural utah rather than urban locales covering more than one visited settlement she also added accounts of mormon pioneering and their relationships with native americans during her time in utah kane had opportunity to attend some mormon church meetings while many other travelers were not impressed with mormon meetings she admitted to liking their informality and simplicity she was particularly impressed by a sermon given by william c staines recording her children s fondness but regretted not taking notes from it having spent a good deal of time with mormons in salt lake city she befriended mormon women better understanding issues of polygamy women s rights and general hardships that mormon people faced she appreciated goodness of people despite not sharing their beliefs her husband encouraged her to publish her personal journals and letters to family in order to help lobby against poland act kane used fictitious names to protect saints anonymity twelve mormon homes visited in succession on a journey through utah to arizona was published in new york by her father in 1874 experiencing growing sympathy for mormons particularly women kane hoped book would lessen persecution of latter day saints while her book failed to attain mainstream success it was received well by many and mentioned in some newspaper articles a gentile account of life in utah s dixie kane s time in southern utah desert in st george was turning point of her feelings towards mormons although she enjoyed her time in salt lake city she still harbored some negative feelings towards them after associating with more women she began to see polygamy in a light different than that portrayed by other writers she observed women s increased independence in comparison to eastern ideas of harems as mormon women often contributed to running finances businesses and households while their husbands were away she observed relationships between members of a polygamous family observing that marriage worked quite well some women were in love with their husbands and some women were not even though it was difficult sometimes they believed there was a greater reward in heaven awaiting those who made sacrifices on earth kane revealed that she admired saints in st george more than those in salt lake city because she respected their economic sacrifices at end of trip in utah her family was invited by brigham young to stay with his family at lion house she wrote that her opinion had changed of mormons and that she was willing to stay and eat salt with them by end of her book kane revealed she had become a friend of mormons just like her husband and she also involved herself in lobbying efforts to defend mormons she wrote to senator simon cameron urging congress to end persecution of saints since it only fueled fire of their faith as they were willing to die for what they believed in poland act did pass but it was a milder bill than initially proposed perhaps due in part to contributions of elizabeth and thomas kane a gentile account of life in utah s dixie was not published until 1995 social and philosophical beliefs religious beliefs kane s deeply religious upbringing influenced faith she maintained throughout her life she attended church regularly read bible prayed frequently and even wrote prayers in her journals she tried to live her life by god s will and stated that her religion brought her peace and happiness she was confirmed in presbyterian church when she was fifteen after her first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage she began to fear for her own mortality she also had deep rooted fears because her own mother died in childbirth and she cited god as source of her comfort evident of her religious beliefs she believed that miscarriage was a punishment from god for secretly not wanting child and being ungrateful for pregnancy her husband s lack of interest in organized religion caused heartache for elizabeth feeling that she had to live her religion alone conflict arose when thomas did not want their firstborn to be baptized he pleased her for a time by announcing to her that he was a christian before leaving on an extended trip to utah in 1858 it gave her comfort while he was away but she was devastated when he returned a few months later his change of heart towards mormons strengthened her disdain for them by end of her trip to utah she reconciled with herself realizing that although her husband did not espouse christianity he was a christian by his works her encounters with mormons made her question and consider her own faith and made her wonder if her practice of religion was adequate compared to saints views on women kane was interested in role that women played in society as one of first women to attend medical school at women s medical college of pennsylvania she proved to be a pioneer in cause of higher education for women she was said to have associated with prominent women s rights advocate lucretia mott to whom her husband introduced her when she was newly married she criticized society for reprimanding women for holding respectable jobs and as a result driving them to less respectable positions she foresaw a time when women would have a more equal role to play in society she and her husband were both very interested in cause of women s rights and he encouraged her to become a political activist for women her father william wood also contributed to her early interest in higher education he was a member of new york city board of education and worked to open normal school for females in 1870 thomas kane was supportive in promoting her education often arguing that these pursuits were more important than her responsibilities at home developing her writing skills she wrote a theory on women in her personal diary in her theory she saw polygamy as a sexual double standard that held women to a higher level of chastity than men in general she criticized sexualization of women in society drawing on her medical background she claimed that sex leads to pregnancy which leads to many health complications and often death for a woman after repeated and pregnancies she argued that it was morally wrong for men to expect an excessive amount of childbearing from their wives comparing those wives to saintly martyrs she was a supporter of voluntary motherhood but she didn t necessarily agree with use of contraception in her opinion women should have right to refuse sexual advances from their husbands in order to control their own bodies and pregnancies she advocated for more female doctors who would better be able to care for female body as well as sex education for young women before marriage she created specific guidelines by which sexually transmitted infections could be dramatically reduced this included castrating infected males and exiling prostitutes as well as granting divorces for males and females but forbidding remarriage she believed more emphasis should be put on women s education rather than marriage and that marriage should be achieved when one is grown and mature kane also believed in educating boys and girls together rather than separately and thought both should be allowed to pursue outside occupations she strongly supported women s suffrage views on mormons throughout her life kane s views on mormons were constantly shifting and at many times ambivalent in her book twelve mormon homes visited in succession on a journey through utah to arizona title on second page was pandemonium or arcadia which kane metaphorically compared mormon community to pandemonium city of lucifer and arcadia rural greek paradise she revealed that mormon state was neither pandemonium nor arcadia but rather a mixture of both kane was content with presbyterianism and disliked several latter day saint doctrines she was offended by mormon claim to religious authority she objected to polygamy because she believed it subjugated women another reason she claimed to have disliked mormons was that she felt they drained her husband of his time and resources and prevented him from being interested in her own religion in many respects she merely tolerated mormons because she loved her husband and wanted to support him even if she failed to share his interest unsurprisingly she did not believe that mormons were christian as this was a popular opinion at time evident in her travel account twelve mormons kane was impressed by high morals of mormon people citing their humility cleanliness and hospitality later her views towards mormons softened as she realized that they held her husband in as high esteem as she did she particularly grew to like william c staines even though he treated her kindly she still harbored significant animosity towards brigham young because he was leader of mormons and an advocate for polygamy she liked mormon prayers and hymns she felt mormon prayers were more specific than protestant ones and she welcomed how whole congregation sang hymns in earnest she was also impressed by tolerance that latter day saints had for native americans she witnessed utah achieve statehood and manifesto end plural marriage however her condemnations of mormons became their most severe upon hearing that a writer was going to publish a book that claimed thomas kane was secretly a mormon she defended her husband claiming that he was too intelligent to have believed stories in book of mormon and doctrine and covenants she attributed his interest in mormons solely to pity and gratitude while she always admired faith of saints after death of her husband she largely ended associations with her former mormon friends proving that was her husband s project not her own kane respected saints and admired their faith and some of their religious practices however she never really was a friend of mormons in way that her husband was personal life marriage thumb elizabeth wood as a teenager this was likely taken around 1850 before she married thomas l kane elizabeth wood first met thomas kane her future husband in 1840 when she was four years old and he was eighteen he was on a trip to england at time he quickly built a relationship with her father william wood which only improved after death of her mother harriet elizabeth s first memorable encounter with thomas was at six years old when he was twenty according to a family story he gave her a french doll while visiting her family which sparked her lifelong admiration having lost her mother at a young age she found comfort in her studies and occasional visit from her cousin thomas who at age of twelve she decided she would marry elizabeth was victim of difficult family situation as her father was always working and she disliked her stepmother as a result she grew into a quiet awkward teenager this was in stark contrast to her love interest thomas who grew up in loud and outspoken kane family during one visit to kane family in pennsylvania she pretended to fall asleep while thomas played piano and sang in next room citing that she knew she had fallen in love with him after that moment having taken a liking to elizabeth he began visiting wood s residence frequently after admitting their mutual attraction they were engaged on january 25 1852 as she was so young her father was hesitant in granting permission but he eventually agreed on condition that they wait until after her seventeenth birthday they were married on april 21 1853 three weeks before she turned seventeen a fact that thomas never explained elizabeth was lovingly called bessie by her husband whom she called tom they were both intelligent and idealistic and they were united by their love for each other and their charity for less fortunate nevertheless they had vastly different personal philosophies and temperaments thomas was a compulsive decision maker known for taking risks and he was suspicious of religious and social constructs he sought to improve world through dramatic action by heroically supporting underdog elizabeth on other hand was religious with a love of home and family desiring physical and emotional security she was also interested in social reform but she felt that change was best accomplished through quiet humble christian service her early marriage could be best understood by comparing elizabeth to an infatuated schoolgirl and thomas to her mentor or father figure she was very young and thomas intended to mold her into wife and women she had potential to be she idolized thomas and was overly concerned with what her husband was thinking and feeling about her her feelings were hurt easily and her reactions often dramatic largely due to significant age and maturity gap between them elizabeth was also concerned with amount of money thomas was spending on his charities rather than starting his family his willingness to leave his family and responsibilities to help mormons caused much tension in their marriage he made great sacrifices which forced her to make sacrifices as well for a cause she did not understand these conflicts between thomas and elizabeth allowed her to become more independent and outspoken than she was at beginning of their marriage she began to feel more comfortable and secure in marriage after birth of first two of her four children harriet amelia and elisha kent although thomas strove for gender equality in society ironically he tended to dominate elizabeth in interests of his work for example he pressured her to apply for medical school for which he served as a trustee to promote higher education of women even though they considered themselves to be equal companions in marriage and elizabeth had her own interests outside of marriage thomas was always main focus of elizabeth s life it was a unique marriage for times on one hand thomas wanted elizabeth to be his intellectual equal and sought to mentor her to become a socially and politically prominent woman rather than just a wife on other hand there was a touch of irony and condescension in thomas mentorship because he was often an overbearing husband who pushed elizabeth into doing things because he felt that he knew best children couple had four children harriet amelia in 1855 elisha kent kane in 1856 evan o neil kane in 1861 and william kane in 1862 after thomas death william took name thomas l kane jr three of their children became physicians while elisha kane graduated from engineering program at princeton university evan o neil kane a prominent surgeon had an impressive
