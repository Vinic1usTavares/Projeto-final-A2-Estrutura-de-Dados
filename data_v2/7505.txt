thumb 300px hubble deep field hubble deep field hdf is an image of a small region in constellation ursa major constructed from a series of observations by hubble space telescope it covers an area about 2 6 arcminutes on a side about one 24 millionth of whole sky which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 metres image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with space telescope s wide field and planetary camera 2 over ten consecutive days between december 18 and 28 1995 field is so small that only a few foreground stars in milky way lie within it thus almost all of 3 000 objects in image are galaxies some of which are among youngest and most distant known by revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies hdf has become a landmark image in study of early universe three years after hdf observations were taken a region in south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named hubble deep field south similarities between two regions strengthened belief that universe is uniform over large scales and that earth occupies a typical region in universe cosmological principle a wider but shallower survey was also made as part of great observatories origins deep survey in 2004 a deeper image known as hubble ultra deep field hudf was constructed from a few months of light exposure hudf image was at time most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths and it remained so until hubble extreme deep field xdf was released in 2012 conception thumb 300px left dramatic improvement in hubble s imaging capabilities after corrective optics were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant galaxies one of key aims of astronomers who designed hubble space telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from ground positioned above atmosphere hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing limited ground based telescopes when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible 10 m ground based telescopes may become competitive although telescope s mirror suffered from spherical aberration when telescope was launched in 1990 it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable because light takes billions of years to reach earth from very distant galaxies we see them as they were billions of years ago thus extending scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve ferguson et al 1999 p 84 after spherical aberration was corrected during space shuttle mission sts 61 in 1993 trauger et al 1994 improved imaging capabilities of telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies medium deep survey mds used wide field and planetary camera 2 wfpc2 to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations at same time other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground based observation all of these studies revealed substantial differences between properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago abraham et al 1996 up to 10 of hst s observation time is designated as director s discretionary dd time and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae once hubble s corrective optics were shown to be performing well robert williams then director of space telescope science institute decided to devote a substantial fraction of his dd time during 1995 to study of distant galaxies a special institute advisory committee recommended that wfpc2 be used to image a typical patch of sky at a high galactic latitude using several optical filters a working group was set up to develop and implement project williams et al 1996 target selection thumb 300px hdf is at centre of this image of one degree of sky moon as seen from earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image field selected for observations needed to fulfill several criteria it had to be at a high galactic latitude because dust and obscuring matter in plane of milky way s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light such as foreground stars and infrared ultraviolet and x ray emissions to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of objects in deep field and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared cirrus diffuse wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas h i regions these criteria restricted field of potential target areas it was decided that target should be in hubble s continuous viewing zones areas of sky which are not occulted by earth or moon during hubble s orbit working group decided to concentrate on northern cvz so that northern hemisphere telescopes such as keck telescopes kitt peak national observatory telescopes and very large array vla could conduct follow up observations twenty fields satisfying these criteria were initially identified from which three optimal candidate fields were selected all within constellation of ursa major radio snapshot observations with vla ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source and final decision between other two was made on basis of availability of guide stars near field hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which telescope s fine guidance sensors can lock during an exposure but given importance of hdf observations working group required a second set of back up guide stars field that was eventually selected is located at a right ascension of and a declination of it is approximately 2 6 arcminutes in width ferguson 2000a or 1 12 width of moon area is approximately 1 24 000 000 of total area of sky observations thumb left hdf was in hubble s northern continuous viewing zone as shown by this diagram thumb diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of hdf and 2004 hubble ultra deep field once a field had been selected an observing strategy had to be developed an important decision was to determine which filters observations would use wfpc2 is equipped with forty eight filters including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest and broadband filters useful for study of colours of stars and galaxies choice of filters to be used for hdf depended on throughput of each filter total proportion of light that it allows through and spectral coverage available filters with overlapping as little as possible were desirable in end four broadband filters were chosen centred at wavelengths of 300 nm near ultraviolet 450 nm blue light 606 nm red light and 814 nm near infrared because quantum efficiency of hubble s detectors at 300 nm wavelength is quite low noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to ccd noise rather than sky background thus these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed efficiency of observations in other between december 18 and 28 1995 during which time hubble orbited earth about 150 times 342 images of target area in chosen filters were taken total exposure times at each wavelength were 42 7 hours 300 nm 33 5 hours 450 nm 30 3 hours 606 nm and 34 3 hours 814 nm divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike ccd detectors a further 10 hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow up observations by other instruments data processing thumb 300px a section of hdf about 14 arcseconds across in each of four wavelengths used to construct final version 300 nm top left 450 nm top right 606 nm bottom left and 814 nm bottom right production of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after other and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not other trails of space debris and artificial satellites were present in original images and were carefully removed scattered light from earth was evident in about a quarter of data frames creating a visible x pattern on images this was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light aligning it with an unaffected image and subtracting unaffected image from affected one resulting image was smoothed and could then be subtracted from bright frame this procedure removed almost all of scattered light from affected images once 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic ray hits and corrected for scattered light they had to be combined scientists involved in hdf observations pioneered a technique called drizzling in which pointing of telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures each pixel on wfpc2 ccd chips recorded an area of sky 0 09 arcseconds across but by changing direction in which telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures resulting images were combined using sophisticated image processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value hdf images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0 arcseconds data processing yielded four monochrome images at 300 nm 450 nm 606 nm and 814 nm one at each wavelength one image was designated as red 814 nm second as green 606 nm and third as blue 450 nm and three images were combined to give a colour image because wavelengths at which images were taken do not correspond to wavelengths of red green and blue light colours in final image only give an approximate representation of actual colours of galaxies in image choice of filters for hdf and majority of hubble images was primarily designed to maximize scientific utility of observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what human eye would actually perceive ferguson et al 1999 p 88 contents final images were released at a meeting of american astronomical society in january 1996 and revealed a plethora of distant faint galaxies about 3 000 distinct galaxies could be identified in images ferguson et al 2000b with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible although some galaxies in field are only a few pixels across in all hdf is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars by far majority of objects in field are distant galaxies there are about fifty blue point like objects in hdf many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies which together form chains and arcs these are likely to be regions of intense star formation others may be distant quasars astronomers initially ruled out possibility that some of point like objects are white dwarfs because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at time however more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age lending support to idea that hdf might contain white dwarfs hansen 1998 scientific results thumb left details from hdf illustrate wide variety of galaxy shapes sizes and colours found in distant universe thumb deep field image taken by alma and hubble hdf data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 associated scientific paper for image had received over 900 citations one of most fundamental findings was discovery of large numbers of galaxies with high redshift values as universe expands more distant objects recede from earth faster in what is called hubble flow light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by cosmological redshift while quasars with high redshifts were known very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before hdf images were produced hdf however contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light years due to redshift most distant objects in hdf lyman break galaxies are not actually visible in hubble images they can only be detected in images of hdf taken at longer wavelengths by ground based telescopes ferguson et al 1999 p 105 hdf galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than local universe galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in young universe as it was much smaller than today it is believed that giant elliptical galaxies form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate variation in rate of star formation over lifetime of universe while estimates of redshifts of hdf galaxies are somewhat crude astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8 10 billion years ago and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then connolly et al 1997 another important result from hdf was very small number of foreground stars present for years astronomers had been puzzling over nature of dark matter mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 85 of all matter in universe by mass trimble 1987 one theory was that dark matter might consist of massive astrophysical compact halo objects faint but massive objects such as red dwarfs and planets in outer regions of galaxies alcock et al 1992 hdf showed however that there were not significant numbers of red dwarfs in outer parts of our galaxy flynn et al 1996 followup thumb hdf imaged by spitzer space telescope top segment shows foreground objects in field bottom shows background with foreground objects removed very high redshift objects lyman break galaxies cannot be seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of hdf instead observations with infrared space observatory iso indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in optical images attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation rowan robinson et al 1997 infrared observations have also been made with spitzer space telescope submillimeter observations of field have been made with scuba on james clerk maxwell telescope initially detecting 5 sources although with very low resolution observations have also been made with subaru telescope in hawaii x ray observations by chandra x ray observatory revealed six sources in hdf which were found to correspond to three elliptical galaxies one spiral galaxy one active galactic nucleus and one extremely red object thought to be a distant galaxy containing a large amount of dust absorbing its blue light emissions et al 2000 ground based radio images taken using vla revealed seven radio sources in hdf all of which correspond to galaxies visible in optical images kellerman et al 1998 field has also been surveyed with synthesis radio telescope and merlin array of radio telescopes at 1 4 ghz garratt et al 2000 combination of vla and merlin maps made at wavelengths of 3 5 and 20 cm have located 16 radio sources in hdf n field with many more in flanking fields radio images of some individual sources in field have been made with european vlbi network at 1 6 ghz with a higher resolution than hubble maps garrett et al 2001 subsequent hst observations an hdf counterpart in southern celestial hemisphere was created in 1998 hdf south williams et al 2000 created using a similar observing strategy hdf s was very similar in appearance to original hdf et al 2000 this supports cosmological principle that at its largest scale universe is homogeneous hdf s survey used space telescope imaging spectrograph stis and near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer nicmos instruments installed on hst in 1997 hubble deep field has since been re observed several times using wfpc2 as well as by nicmos and stis instruments several supernova events were detected by comparing first and second epoch observations of hdf n a wider survey but less sensitive was carried out as part of great observatories origins deep survey a section of this was then observed for longer to create hubble ultra deep field which was most sensitive optical deep field image for et al 2006 until hubble extreme deep field was completed in 2012 images from extreme deep field or xdf were released on september 26 2012 to a number of media agencies images released in xdf show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in
