was sent north to quell a rebellion instigated by discontented earl of warwick even though he escaped disastrous battle of edgecote he was lynched by a mob at bridgwater on 17 august 1469 considered

cadet branch of earls of stafford and later dukes of buckingham humphrey s grandfather was another humphrey stafford called sir humphrey of silver hand d 1442 his heir was a another humphrey died

already dead by this time having fallen victim to jack cade s rebellion on 18 june 1450 william s uncle and humphrey s great uncle was john stafford archbishop of canterbury 1443 1452 inheritance of

after 21 june married isabel daughter of sir john barre of herefordshire service to house of york thumb a map of west countrythe area of stafford s dominance in late 1450s stafford might have been in service of his distant relative john stafford earl of wiltshire son of humphrey stafford duke of buckingham his association with james touchet baron of wiltshire s so if so this represented a short episode of loyalty to house of lancaster over house of york in ongoing civil war in 1460 two were sent to guines to relieve english garrison there bad weather forced them into harbour of calais which was held by yorkist leader richard neville earl of warwick here they were both recruited for yorkist cause stafford took part in battle of mortimer s cross where yorkist forces under edward earl of march won a major victory on 2 february 1461 after battle of towton on 29 march that year stafford was knighted by edward who had by now been pronounced king edward iv after deposition of henry vi later that same year on 26 july he received a summons to parliament for first time as lord stafford of southwick over course of following years king granted him numerous lands and offices in 1461 he was appointed steward of duchy of cornwall and constable of bristol and in 1462 he received greater part of devon estates of thomas courtenay earl of devon who had been captured at towton and executed in 1464 he was made keeper of dartmoor and in 1467 he was granted more of courtenay manors stafford repaid king s generosity by serving him faithfully as a local commissioner in a part of country that had up until that point been fiercely lancastrian throughout 1460s he presided at quarter sessions and other courts all over west country his activities were not limited to legal commissions in 1461 2 he performed military service against scots and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with brittany in 1469 he was admitted to royal council and served on commission that convicted henry courtenay thomas courtenay s brother for treason according to chronicler john warkworth henry s downfall was due to machinations of stafford who was rewarded with further land and earldom of devon on 17 may 1469 however king himself took great interest in trial against courtenay and it is more reasonable to see decision as a result of edward s need for a loyal agent in region ross 1997 p 123 death and aftermath stafford s quick rise did not go unnoticed among established aristocracy in 1468 discontented warwick named earl of devon as a courtier with undue influence on king edward warwick and devon were later reconciled but next year warwick repeated his accusations once more hicks 1998 pp 265 271 in an act of rebellion by proxy warwick instigated an insurrection in yorkshire led by a robin of redesdale at same time with george duke of clarence king edward s an invasion of country from warwick s stronghold of calais devon together with william herbert earl of pembroke was ordered to gather troops to quell rebellion thumb upright left warwick s rebellion ended with his death in battle of barnet in 1471 here depicted in a late 15th century manuscript illustration hicks 1998 p 310 royal army under devon and pembroke intercepted northern their way south to meet up with warwick and banbury in oxfordshire it is not clear what happened after this according to warkworth devon and pembroke quarrelled over billeting arrangements and devon took off with majority of archers next day on 26 july 1469 pembroke met rebels at battle of edgecote but without artillery support he was thoroughly defeated when devon finally arrived he was either unable to engage his troops or too late to make a difference ross 1997 p 131 french chronicler jean de waurin however gives a different account according to waurin devon left field of battle once he heard news that clarence was arriving with reinforcements in either case pembroke was captured and executed on warwick s order devon managed to escape but was later captured by a mob at bridgwater in somerset and executed on 17 august humphrey stafford had been earl of devon for exactly three months at time of his death he and isabel had no children so when he died his title became extinct it was restored next year for john courtenay brother of thomas last courtenay earl of devon stafford was buried in glastonbury abbey and a dispute over his lands followed between his cousins stafford was considered over ambitious and unscrupulous by many contemporaries this can be seen both by warkworth implicating him in downfall of henry courtenay and warwick targeting him as one of king edward s evil councillors this thread has also been picked up by modern historians charles ross calls him a greedy and ambitious man ross 1997 p 78 at same time his skills as an administrator can hardly be doubted as evidenced by king edward s heavy reliance on him he could also show a more human and sympathetic side michael hicks describes his activity from 1467 onwards in adding codicils to his will to right wrongs that he was conscious of committing last of these he added as he faced his own execution notes a he was listed as ten years or more at his father s death on 18 june 1450 b while it is possible that this humphrey had a prosthetic hand made of or plated in silver it is more likely that he earned this moniker from a reputed generosity div c robin of redesdale was an alias rebellion was actually led by warwick s northern retainers hicks 1998 pp 270 1 275 references external links pedigree of stafford family com category
