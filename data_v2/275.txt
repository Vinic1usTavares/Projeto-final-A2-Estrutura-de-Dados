sas previously statistical analysis system is a statistical software suite developed by sas institute for advanced analytics multivariate analysis business intelligence criminal investigation sas empowers crime fighters to crack complex cases data management and predictive analytics sas was developed at north carolina state university from 1966 until 1976 when sas institute was incorporated sas was further developed in 1980s and 1990s with addition of new statistical procedures additional components and introduction of jmp a point and click interface was added in version 9 in 2004 a social media analytics product was added in 2010 technical overview and terminology sas is a software suite that can mine alter manage and retrieve data from a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it sas provides a graphical point and click user interface for non technical users and more advanced options through sas language sas programs have data steps which retrieve and manipulate data and proc steps which analyze data each step consists of a series of statements data step has executable statements that result in software taking an action and declarative statements that provide instructions to read a data set or alter data s appearance data step has two phases compilation and execution in compilation phase declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified afterwards execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially data sets are organized into tables with rows called observations and columns called variables additionally each piece of data has a descriptor and a value proc step consists of proc statements that call upon named procedures procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics analyses and graphics there are more than 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work proc statements can also display results sort data or perform other operations sas macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks sas data can be published in html pdf excel and other formats using output delivery system which was first introduced in 2007 sas enterprise guide is sas s point and click interface it generates code to manipulate data or perform analysis automatically and does not require sas programming experience to use sas software suite has more than 200 components some of sas components include history origins development of sas began in 1966 after north carolina state university re hired anthony barr to program his analysis of variance and regression software so that it would run on ibm system 360 computers project was funded by national institutes of health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields barr was joined by student james goodnight who developed software s statistical routines and two became project leaders in 1968 barr and goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines barr goodnight et al 1979 front matter attribution of development of various parts of system to barr goodnight and sall in 1972 after issuing first release of sas project lost its funding according to goodnight this was because nih only wanted to fund projects with medical applications goodnight continued teaching at university for a salary of 1 and access to mainframe computers for use with project until it was funded by university statisticians of southern experiment stations following year john sall joined project in 1973 and contributed to software s time series and matrix algebra another early participant caroll g perkins contributed to sas early programming w service and jane t helwig created sas first documentation first versions of sas were named after year in which they were released in 1971 sas 71 was published as a limited release it was used only on ibm mainframes and had main elements of sas programming such as data step and most common procedures in proc step following year a full version was released as sas 72 which introduced merge statement and added features for handling missing data or combining data sets in 1976 barr goodnight sall and helwig removed project from north carolina state and incorporated it into sas institute inc development sas was re designed in sas 76 with an open architecture that allowed for compilers and procedures input and statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by ibm mainframes generating reports was also added through put and file statements ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was format procedure which allowed developers to customize appearance of data in 1979 sas 79 added support for cms operating system and introduced datasets procedure three years later sas 82 introduced an early macro language and append procedure sas version 4 had limited features but made sas more accessible version 5 introduced a complete macro language array subscripts and a full screen interactive user interface called display manager in 1985 sas was rewritten in c programming language this allowed for sas architecture that allows software to run on unix ms dos and windows it was previously written in pl i fortran and assembly language in 1980s and 1990s sas released a number of components to complement base sas sas graph which produces graphics was released in 1980 as well as sas ets component which supports econometric and time series analysis a component intended for pharmaceutical users sas ph clinical was released in 1990s food and drug administration standardized on sas ph clinical for new drug applications in 2002 vertical products like sas financial management and sas human capital management then called cfo vision and hr vision respectively were also introduced jmp was developed by sas co founder john sall and a team of developers to take advantage of graphical user interface introduced in 1984 apple macintosh and shipped for first time in 1989 updated versions of jmp were released continuously after 2002 with most recent release being from 2016 sas version 6 was used throughout 1990s and was available on a wider range of operating systems including macintosh os 2 silicon graphics and sas introduced new features through dot releases from 6 06 to 6 09 a user interface based on windows paradigm was introduced and support for sql was added version 7 introduced output delivery system ods and an improved text editor ods was improved upon in successive releases for example more output options were added in version 8 number of operating systems that were supported was reduced to unix windows and z os and linux was added sas version 8 and sas enterprise miner were released in 1999 recent history in 2002 text miner software was introduced text miner analyzes text data like emails for patterns in business intelligence applications in 2004 sas version 9 0 was released which was dubbed project mercury and was designed to make sas accessible to a broader range of business users version 9 0 added custom user interfaces based on user s role and established point and click user interface of sas enterprise guide as software s primary graphical user interface gui customer relationship management crm features were improved in 2004 with sas interaction management in 2008 sas announced project unity designed to integrate data quality data integration and master data management sas institute inc v world programming ltd was a lawsuit with developers of a competing implementation world programming system alleging that they had infringed sas s copyright in part by implementing same functionality this case was referred from united kingdom s high court of justice to european court of justice on 11 august 2010 in may 2012 european court of justice ruled in favor of world programming finding that functionality of a computer program and programming language cannot be protected by copyright a free version was introduced for students in 2010 sas social media analytics a tool for social media monitoring engagement and sentiment analysis was also released that year sas rapid predictive modeler rpm which creates basic analytical models using microsoft excel was introduced that same year jmp 9 in 2010 added a new interface for using r programming language from jmp and an add in for excel following year a high performance computing appliance was made available in a partnership with and emc in 2011 company

comparing statistical packages from sas and its competitors stata and spss alan c acock wrote that sas programs provide extraordinary range of data analysis and data management tasks but were difficult to use and learn spss and stata meanwhile were both easier to learn with better documentation but had less capable analytic abilities though these could be expanded with paid in spss or free in stata add ons acock concluded that sas was best for power users while occasional users would benefit most from spss and stata a comparison by university of california los angeles gave similar results competitors such as revolution analytics and alpine data labs advertise their products as considerably cheaper than sas in a 2011 comparison doug of informationweek found that start up fees for three are similar though he admitted that starting fees were not necessarily best basis for comparison sas business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees adoption according to idc sas is largest market share holder in advanced analytics with 35 4 percent of market as of 2013 it is fifth largest market share holder for business intelligence bi software with a 6 9 share and largest independent vendor it competes in bi market against conglomerates such as sap ibm spss modeler oracle hyperion and microsoft power bi sas has been named in gartner leader s quadrant for data integration tool and for business intelligence and analytical platforms a study published in 2011 in bmc health services research found that sas was used in 42 6 percent of data analyses in health service research based on a sample of 1 139 articles drawn from three journals see also comparison of numerical analysis
