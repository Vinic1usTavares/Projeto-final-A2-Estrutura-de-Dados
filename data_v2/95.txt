recommendation of senator smoot in november 1927 president calvin coolidge appointed lafount to federal radio commission frc a new federal body created by radio act of 1927 to regulate radio use in united states and first such separate agency commission had gotten off to a slow start earlier that year due to problems with vacancies lafount was slotted for fifth zone of new entity to replace original commissioner john f dillon who had died shortly after taking that position news of appointment came as a surprise to other members of commission since lafount had little presence in radio industry upon arriving in washington d c for his new position lafount wanted to thank president personally told by an appointment secretary that he would need a new morning suit lafount spent 175 to get one after lafount went to white house and gave a brief speech of thanks president coolidge in response said only in case of doubt read law good day sir lafount began traveling and working for

rocky mountain and pacific states as well as territories of hawaii and alaska he traveled frequently as part of visiting all kinds of radio stations in his large territory at one point during 1927 1928 he took an trip in zone where he interviewed over 700 people including over 100 listeners representing over 100 radio stations at another time during 1930 he climbed to high elevations in southern colorado to hear reception that ranchers sheepherders and rangers received some smaller radio stations had unsponsored time available and he proposed creation of citizen based advisory boards to create programming for benefit of community interests for such stations overall however he felt that too many small stations with weak signals were blocking reception of larger stations and came to conclusion that number of stations should be reduced and signals of larger stations strengthened over time commissioners activities became less bound to their particular geographies accordingly lafount became responsible for coordinating frc activities with other government agencies and entities lafount was in public eye new york times ran 140 stories that mentioned him during his stint on frc during his first months on commission lafount was an informal member of allocating committee that led to frc s 1928 reallocation of commercial broadcast radio spectrum under general order 40 lafount subsequently supported action which enabled growth of advertiser based broadcasting but was criticized by some as a giveaway of a public resource in form of clear channel frequencies to large business and media interests by 1931 lafount was referring to general order 40 as structure or very foundation upon which broadcasting has been built and upon which success or failure of every branch of radio industry must depend lafount believed that radio could help bring about a sense of national unity which he favored and that common sources of entertainment were among those characteristics that constitute d bonds for making our people homogenous however he believed that radio programming should be based upon what listeners in mass wanted to hear and not upon what some central authority such as bbc in english model thought they would be best off hearing overall lafount was quite satisfied with work of frc writing in 1931 that experts everywhere agreed that u s broadcasting system is as perfect as it could be made question of educational value of radio was a constant issue and by 1931 lafount was strongly in camp of those who believed that educational programming was on increase he said that there were adequate frequencies and hours for such content and defended frc s role in this regard but he stressed that radio was fundamentally an instrument of commerce and that frc should take no action that might imperil that in an oft quoted 1931 statement lafount said commercialism is at heart of broadcasting industry in united states what has education contributed to radio not one thing what has commercialism contributed everything lifeblood of industry however extent to which broadcast radio was dominated by advertising and by commercial interests became a hot topic with members of public requesting that congress step in and take action lafount often warned commercial broadcasters that they faced a dismal future unless they mended their ways in this regard in a 1932 speech before a st louis meeting of national association of broadcasters he said that was indeed a problem and that radio broadcasters were selling their birthright for a mess of pottage after witnessing early mechanical television in action commissioner lafount said that frc was doing all it could to help develop still infant technology in terms of regulatory issues he wrote in 1931 that i believe that television is destined to become greatest force in world i think it will have more influence over lives of individuals than any other single force this remark has been quoted in several books about history of television he at same time proposed censorship of television in order that objectionable images not be seen and amount of advertising not be excessive lafount became acting chairman of commission during latter part of 1932 believing that radio broadcasting system in u s was typically american and suits our democratic temperament as no other system i have yet encountered would he urged broadcasters to air political programming and advertising during 1932 u s presidential election he thus became influential in development of federal regulations specifying that candidates and parties receive equal airtime although a republican lafount told broadcasters that they should supply free airtime and publicity to subsequent roosevelt administration s programs created under national industrial recovery act in an effort to help nation recover from great depression he refuted republican accusations in 1933 that roosevelt administration was trying to censor radio broadcasts subsequent radio industry career second marriage lafount stayed on frc until its replacement by federal communications commission fcc in 1934 but was not appointed to that body frc role had enabled lafount to know not just many government figures but also people running growing broadcasting industry upon leaving frc he became head of broadcasting interests of bulova watch

in spring 1944 by late 1945 fcc was threatening to not renew station s license three co owners said they had not consciously violated any regulations because they thought fcc notification was only necessary if a single person gained more than half control of a station commission claimed that deception and false reports had continued throughout 1937 to 1943 period in april 1947 fcc denied
