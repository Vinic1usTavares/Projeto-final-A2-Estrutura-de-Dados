middle eastern studies 18 1 pp 109 10 research prawer was part of a cadre of historians including claude cahen and jean richard who freed crusader studies from old conception of crusader society as an exemplar of pure unchanging feudalism that spontaneously emerged from conquest this view which originated with feudal jurists in thirteenth century was held to by modern historians since early thirties through work of prawer particularly his two papers from fifties and his colleagues crusader society began to be seen as dynamic with nobility gradually putting checks on monarchy combined efforts of these historians led to a surge of new research into crusader society prawer s research extended to a wide variety of other aspects of crusader states among topics he addressed were land development projects and urban settlement agriculture italian quarters of port cities types of landed property and legal issues in des bourgeois one of prawer s best known works is histoire du royaume latin de jerusalem which won him prix gustave schlumberger of academie des inscriptions et belles lettres two volume work presents crusader states as a working immigrant society and shows importance of immigration and labor shortages another book by prawer latin kingdom of jerusalem european colonialism in middle ages which was intended for a larger audience was more controversial in it he portrays crusaders as a society of frankish immigrants living in complete political and social segregation from local muslim and syro christian population and terms this phenomenon apartheid to prawer it is settlers refusal to assimilate and their reconstruction of a european type society on foreign soil as well as persistence of indigenous institutions without any interference that mark crusader settlement as colonialist his thesis is that economy society and institutions of latin states are best understood in light of their colonial status brundage james a january 1975 review of crusader s kingdom european colonialism in middle ages speculum 50 1 145 7 1980 book crusader institutions collected a number of his earlier publications and expanded upon them with revisions and new chapters book continues his treatment of kingdom of jerusalem as a european colonial product but focuses attention on five topical areas while throughout employing tools of textual criticism and commentary on sources especially prominent is his coverage of status and administrative role of burgesses which had not received such attention before patterson robert b october 1981 review of crusader institutions american historical review 86 4 p 822 in his last years he published a book on a topic of especial interest to him history of jews in latin kingdom of jerusalem which examined tightly knit isolated jewish communities of levant jewish philosophical feuds they engaged in and their dreams of restoring israel comparison of zionism to crusades an analogy has frequently been drawn between european crusades of middle ages and modern day zionist movement this view which has been espoused by arab media and political leaders has also been discussed in israeli academia prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy and claimed that a major difference was that jews settled land and worked it whereas crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by natives ronnie ellenblum a lecturer at hebrew university identifies a subliminal objective in prawer s work to draw a distinction between two he s always writing about crusaders manpower shortage and about their not settling land he claims that their presence here was principally urban consisting of nobility and merchants this is why they lost in end implications are obvious if we bring enough immigrants and if we settle land we are bound to succeed ellenblum himself has shown that crusader settlement in holy land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of crusader farms but he also notes that if joshua prawer were alive today he would no doubt deny any linkage between his zionist political beliefs and model of segregation that he developed ziad j who considers zionism heir albeit illegitimate of crusader movement goes further and writes that prawer recognized extent of similarity in individual and social experience of crusaders and zionists rather than studying comparison and denying its validity he chose to study crusader s experience as if it were a historical model which could be completely analyzed and dissected in order to benefit from its experience and avoid its mistakes to zionist author yoram hazony however it is exactly because of prawer s readiness to draw analogy that he considers him a of zionism and a progenitor of post zionist thought

analogy writes that subject has now become a litmus test for clarifying one s views on zionism with post zionists freely making analogy and sympathizers with zionist viewpoint rejecting it selected
