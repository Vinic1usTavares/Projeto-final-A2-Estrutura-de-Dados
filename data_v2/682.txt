ralph waldo christie 30 august 1893 19 december 1987 was an admiral in united states navy who played a pivotal role in development of torpedo technologies during world war ii he commanded submarine operations out of australian ports of brisbane and fremantle a 1915 graduate of united states naval academy christie served on a variety of warships beginning with battleship in 1915 he was trained in torpedo design and implementation and became one of first members of submarine school at new london in 1923 christie graduated from massachusetts institute of technology with a master s degree in mechanical engineering specializing in torpedoes during 1920s he was involved with project g 53 a highly secret program to develop a magnetic influence exploder for torpedoes result of this was development of mark 6 exploder and mark 14 torpedo christie also developed a design for an oxygen torpedo designated project g 49 or navol after united states entered world war ii christie was posted to brisbane and commanded submarine operations during solomon islands campaign he then returned to u s as inspector of ordnance at newport torpedo station in january 1943 christie returned to australia as commander of submarine operations in fremantle despite growing evidence of problems with mark 6 exploder and mark 14 torpedo he remained convinced of their effectiveness during 1944 he accompanied war patrols on submarines and in november 1944 christie was relieved of command of submarine operations at fremantle by vice admiral thomas c kinkaid and returned to united states where he commanded puget sound navy yard he retired from navy in august 1949 with rank of vice admiral early career ralph w christie was born in somerville massachusetts on 30 august 1893 he graduated from united states naval academy in 1915 and served on a variety of warships beginning with battleship aboard cruiser in 1916 he was trained in torpedo design and implementation christie was one of first students of submarine school at new london he went on to command submarines in 1918 in 1920 in 1923 and in 1924 christie served as commander submarines at cavite from 1925 to 1926 in 1923 he graduated from massachusetts institute of technology with a master s degree in mechanical engineering specializing in torpedoes development of mark 6 magnetic exploder in 1922 as christie was completing his graduate studies bureau of ordnance initiated project g 53 a highly secret program to develop a magnetic influence exploder for torpedoes in summer of 1926 christie became intimately involved in project and was substantially involved in technical development of weapon system by 1926 exploder was far enough advanced to permit its first test on 8 may obsolete submarine was used as a target and destroyed with an influence torpedo despite this early success influence exploder which would become mark 6 needed significant refinement christie urged navy department to allocate a target ship for extensive field tests of torpedo and exploder chief of naval operations authorized use of obsolete destroyer but placed so many restrictions on its use newport was forced to decline offer as a result neither mark 6 exploder nor mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test and their shortcomings would not become apparent until outbreak of hostilities it would be twenty months before problems were corrected over christie s objections development of oxygen torpedo during 1920s and 1930s christie carried out experimental work on an oxygen torpedo with ordnance laboratory in alexandria virginia designated project g 49 or navol this torpedo used hydrogen peroxide instead of compressed air christie s design had experimental torpedo propel a warhead at to a maximum range of navol design was subsequently designated mark 16 for submarines and mark 17 for surface ships hydrogen peroxide system was test fitted to a mark 14 torpedo in mid 1930s where christie s design propelled a warhead to a range of at despite promise of design many operational officers were opposed to use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship ultimately mark 16 went into limited production while work on mark 17 was suspended in 1941 but resumed in 1944 admiral ernest king favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on oxygen system was downgraded as such u s navy made no combat use of oxygen torpedo design during second world war by may 1938 christie was head of torpedo section at buord and involved in providing torpedoes to fleet he would take command of newport torpedo station in 1943 shortly before death of admiral robert english on 21 january 1943 other pre war assignments in 1939 christie was given command of submarine division 15 consisting of all six salmon class submarines by 1941 germany and united kingdom were engaged in battle of atlantic although united states was neutral president franklin d roosevelt ordered u s atlantic fleet to enforce neutrality patrol to assist uk bound convoys as part of secret agreements with britain united states agreed to provide former with submarines under royal navy control should america enter conflict admiral richard s edwards commander submarines atlantic fleet selected now captain christie as tactical commander for proposed submarine force in british waters christie wanted new tambor class submarines to be assigned to atlantic fleet but was overruled by admiral harold r stark who selected older s and barracuda classes instead as war seemed increasingly likely toward end of 1941 christie placed his boats on full war footing world war two service brisbane at outbreak of pacific war remnants of united states asiatic fleet fled to australia on orders from washington s boats from philippines were organized into a fighting force at brisbane and admiral ernest king ordered s boats from atlantic fleet to supplement force in australia christie went along arriving in april 1942 just in time for battle of coral sea during solomon islands campaign he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which while being key points for shipping also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti submarine craft in step with then current u s navy submarine doctrine he made capital ships prime targets rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping thumb right upright a mark 14 torpedo almost as soon as war began submarine captains indicated there were problems with mark 14 torpedo and influence feature of mark 6 exploder torpedoes would fail to explode or explode prematurely despite these reports christie was not fully aware of impact of situation because his s boats used older mark 10 torpedo with a contact only pistol christie acknowledged mark 14s were running deeper than set but attributed failures to poor maintenance and errors on part of captain and crew he was convinced mark 6 was satisfactory and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it in november 1942 christie was ordered to return to newport as inspector of ordnance at torpedo station newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture and bureau of ordnance wanted to advance development of mark 18 electric torpedo christie resisted leaving his command at brisbane but was considered of more use to resolve torpedo issue he was replaced by captain james fife for his service at brisbane christie was awarded legion of merit christie was promoted to rear admiral as part of his move back to newport in january 1943 however rear admiral robert english commander submarines u s pacific fleet was killed in a plane crash christie hoped to get position but job went to rear admiral charles a lockwood commander of submarine operations in fremantle and bureau of personnel selected christie to take over lockwood s old command christie lobbied vice admiral arthur chips carpender douglas macarthur s commander allied naval forces to allow him to replace fife as commander of larger submarine force at brisbane carpender refused and christie went on to fremantle nevertheless christie continued to try for some time to take brisbane force under his control by middle of 1943 lockwood had received enough reports from submarine officers to convince him mark 6 was significantly flawed on 24 june 1943 he formally ordered all submarines operating out of pearl harbor to deactivate magnetic influence feature however christie was still committed to exploder and ordered fremantle boats to continue using influence feature submarines operating between two commands were required to either enable or disable it depending on which command area they were in this difference of opinion strained relations between two admirals in november 1943 carpender was replaced by vice admiral thomas c kinkaid who ordered final deactivation of mark 6 in all combat commands christie abided by order commencing on 20 january 1944 but was still convinced mark 6 had potential he had commanders chester nimitz jr and james mccallum continue technical studies of mark 6 and to develop improvements but these revised exploders were just as unreliable as earlier versions fremantle it was common for christie to greet a returning submarine at pier and to award decorations to crew on spot this bypassed naval award boards and annoyed kinkaid and lockwood possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by ultra reading of coded japanese radio traffic and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach complicating matter was fact macarthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel like christie he took it upon himself to authorize decorations rather than to go through standard review procedures these events compelled kinkaid to forbid christie to give pierside awards and to keep christie from recommending award of army medals to navy personnel these events would ultimately contribute to christie s dismissal as commander of submarines in fremantle thumb right 400px at pearl harbor in 2006 in early 1944 christie decided he wanted to make a war patrol and selected to ride with walt griffith in admiral joined boat on 29 january 1944 and during patrol conducted standard duties such as standing watch he departed after an active 29 day patrol in june 1944 christie decided he wanted to make a second patrol and selected however that boat was having engine troubles so christie decided to go in commanded by samuel d dealey dealey had just finished up harder s epic fifth war patrol in which he was credited with sinking five japanese destroyers reduced post war to three destroyers despite fact crew was exhausted dealey agreed to extend his fifth patrol and take christie on board when harder returned to port on 3 july 1944 christie was concerned about its commander dealey was one of leading submarine skippers but having completed five war patrols he was showing signs of strain admiral believed dealey should step down from command of harder but dealey felt he should make one more patrol before leaving boat after christie s return from his second combat patrol admiral chester nimitz recommended he and lockwood meet in brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations during visit lockwood and christie discussed technical issues as well as establishment of advanced bases in and saipan however meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between two men they had already clashed over mark 6 exploder and mark 14 torpedo and some of lockwood s staff believed christie s ride in harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt after meeting with lockwood christie met with macarthur and related events of dealey s fifth war patrol to general macarthur then decided to award dealey a distinguished service cross and christie silver star additionally at this meeting christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to griffith had apparently been blocked by kinkaid despite kinkaid s order regarding army decorations macarthur insisted on granting medals to two men although christie did not request decorations he was put on spot and felt compelled to report entire affair to kinkaid in end general awarded medals displeasing kinkaid on 5 august dealey took harder out for a sixth patrol his former executive officer frank c tiny lynch believed dealey was mentally exhausted christie also had reservations but dealey seemed to recuperate while harder was being refitted in port admiral therefore allowed dealey to retain command on 24 august harder was sunk with all hands off bay dealey s loss was a great shock to christie and event worsened his relationship with kinkaid christie recommended dealey for medal of honor for fifth patrol and supposed sinking of five japanese destroyers kinkaid turned down recommendation on grounds dealey had already received distinguished service cross for same patrol christie was angered by this and sent dispatches to admiral edwards macarthur and kinkaid himself radio dispatch to kinkaid was sent in a low grade code that was easily decipherable it criticized kinkaid and urged him to reconsider message was so blunt and public it was viewed as bordering on insubordination in october and november 1944 christie received intelligence regarding german plans to operate a wolfpack of u boats in australian waters he directed allied forces to detect and eliminate threat resulting in dutch submarine zwaardvisch swordfish sinking u 168 on 6 october near surabaya and s sinking of u 537 on 10 november near northern end of lombok strait another u boat disappeared en route while a fourth u 862 evaded searchers to slip around south coast of australia and sink a liberty ship south of sydney in late december in november 1944 kinkaid relieved christie of command of submarine operations at fremantle and assigned position to fife commencing 30 december although no specific reason was given christie was convinced it was because he pushed kinkaid too hard for dealey s medal of honor and for his process of awarding decorations in general however christie s losses which included dealey and kinkaid s nephew lieutenant commander manning kimmel in in july 1944 may have also influenced kinkaid s decision christie returned to united states and went on to command puget sound navy yard now that he was no longer under kinkaid s command christie renewed his push to get dealey awarded medal of honor this time by getting endorsement for decoration from macarthur general agreed and dealey was posthumously awarded medal post war career after war christie attempted to get command of operations for atlantic submarines but that job went to james fife instead however christie was given command of naval forces in philippines he retired from navy on 1 august 1949 with tombstone promotion to rank of vice admiral he sold life insurance and dabbled in other ventures for some time in his final years he lived on west coast of united states and in hawaii christie died in honolulu hawaii on 19 december 1987 at age of 94 his wife joined him at national memorial cemetery of pacific following her death on 31 may 2002 his papers are in library of congress
