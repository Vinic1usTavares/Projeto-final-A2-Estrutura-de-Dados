thought kirshner had riveting beauty that is unlike anyone else s and she was so deep and intense kirshner would often express her concern that she was not challenged enough or not making jennifer as deep enough as she could be chaiken said it was these qualities that made kirshner bravest and boldest of actors and branded her utterly fearless in her approach to jenny character development characterization throughout her duration on series jenny went on a journey from very first episode which portrayed her as a selfish egotist many observers have perceived her as a narcissist and even as a borderline sociopath this latter assessment was based early on around her recurrent lying and fact she seems to excuse her own cheating in first few seasons as a corollary of empowerment and as research for her book which features an experimentalist female character who is evidently herself kirshner has described jenny as mostly being duplicitous and confused jenny often acted utterly impulsive kirshner said it is very hard for people in series and viewers to like jenny because she is a very despicable character who lies cheats behaves and treats other people horribly for no reason and is extremely selfish self indulgent and so terribly truthful and she does not hesitate to hide any of it matthew gilbert of boston globe described jenny stating dreary confused introverted narcissist downcast secretive almost goth in her black moodiness she is epitome of an unhappy egotist she is so consumed with ups and downs of her own depression and self loathing she just doesn t have energy to look outward her misery is her mirror and she s forever gazing into it new york magazine describe jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be

scenes with other females she described them as more fun and easier and that she genuinely felt there was nothing to be ashamed of for her there was a comfort level that is beautiful kirshner had never appeared nude in previous roles but she requested to go nude as jenny in certain scenes to add to reality chaiken decided to keep audiences guessing about jenny s sexuality she stated that whilst sexuality can be fluid that jenny s sexuality definitely exists on edge of fluidity this was because she had planned to have jenny romantically involved mostly with females but with some males too sexual abuse one of jenny s storylines in season two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child events were portrayed in a series of flashbacks and dream sequences yet this left viewers confused about what actually happened to jenny during an interview with lgbt monthly magazine advocate chaiken commented about storyline well we all know it was an incident of sexual abuse i had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that one because memory of trauma is very strange who knows what happened to jenny jenny doesn t necessarily know herself chaiken also didn t want to portray jenny s ordeal in an explicit manner confirming this she said i am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker i think it is really hard to do it without somehow becoming complicit and exploitative and so as much as it s important to talk about it i wanted to be vague and not milk it chaiken has also admitted that use of dream sequences involving jenny were not a successful inclusion but claimed it was necessary to portray jenny coming to terms with her abuse heather hogan of afterellen criticized storyline because there was no conclusion to it also stating it was never explored enough leading everyone to think she was just a jerk transformation jenny was negatively received amongst tv critics and viewers from very first episode after she cheated on her boyfriend tim with another woman for no clear reason despite tim being portrayed as a decent and trusting partner with no hint of control or abuse while there was no hint whatsoever of prior lesbian or bisexual experiences on jenny s part this prompted chaiken to implement a series of changes to jenny to help make her more likable chaiken defended jenny stating i m well aware of response to jenny i love character and i love that people are passionate about her i know there are a lot of people who just can t stand her and that s why it s so important to have that character in mix kirshner defended jenny stating jenny s a very controversial character i think great thing about her is fact that she s so flawed during season two jenny is seen coming out getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with shane mccutcheon katherine afterellen com stated that jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of bad stuff that happened before out of her life jenny s transition continued into season three chaiken stated we find jenny coming together i predict this that jenny will be more likable and accessible to audience than she has ever been she s recovering in 2009 chaiken was still confused over jenny s bad reception of why it might be she said people read into character that she was a manipulator self absorbed and a trouble maker who puts other people in service of her own neurotic agenda i think people react so strongly because jenny is just a mess in way that so many people are of her character s changes after season five kirshner stated i think she ll continue to be just like a tumbleweed and a car crash and i m happy for that i don t want it to be wrapped up she ll never be normal and that s just way it is responding to criticism jenny has received kirshner states well i agree with what s said about character for most part but again it s my job so i mean it s a fun character death in december 2008 it was announced that show s creators had decided to kill character off it was confirmed that jenny would still appear throughout season in a flashback format first episode of final season starts with jenny s death however final series focuses on events leading up to her death chaiken revealed that each episode would focus and tease with another motive she described how it would play out stating there s one character at beginning of each show who comes forward with motive of moment this would be my reason for killing jenny storyline was described as a sub plot which would define final season but not overpower it however when final episode aired there was no reveal to who killed jenny showtime released a mini series titled interrogation tapes online via official website each video featured a
