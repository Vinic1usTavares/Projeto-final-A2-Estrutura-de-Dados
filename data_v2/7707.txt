guy he went on to say too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave and his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed pleasures of harbor christgau continued epitomizes decadence that has infected pop since sgt pepper gaudy musical settings inspire nostalgia for three chord strum with an ironic sense of humor ochs included christgau s webbed hand

unhappy that his work was not receiving critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for schumacher p 166 still ochs would joke on back cover of greatest hits that there were 50 phil ochs fans 50 fans can t be wrong a sarcastic reference to an elvis presley album that bragged of 50 million elvis fans schumacher p 226 none of ochs s songs became hits although outside of a small circle of friends received a good deal of airplay it reached 119 on billboard s national hot prospect listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics which sarcastically suggested

over and white boots marching in a yellow land other topical songs of this period include outside of a small circle of friends inspired by murder of kitty genovese who was stabbed to death outside of

schumacher pp 110 160 214 215 223 224 a lifelong movie fan ochs worked narratives of justice and rebellion that he had seen in films into his music describing some of his songs as cinematic for example in spoken introduction to ringing of revolution on phil ochs in concert he was disappointed and bitter when his onetime hero john wayne embraced vietnam war with what ochs saw as blind patriotism of wayne s 1968 film green berets h ere we have john wayne who was a major artistic and psychological figure on american scene who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity a certain sense of honor about what soldier was doing even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to indians even as there was a feeling of what it meant to be a man what it meant to have some sense of duty now today we have same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that without seeing movie i m sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot view of soldiery just by definition of how whole country has deteriorated and i think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old wayne movie like say she wore a yellow ribbon with green berets because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to america in general quoted in schumacher p 178 ochs was involved in creation of youth international party known as yippies along with jerry rubin abbie hoffman stew albert and paul krassner eliot 1989 p 140 at same time ochs actively supported eugene mccarthy s more mainstream bid for 1968 democratic nomination for president a position at odds with more radical yippie point of view schumacher p 182 184 despite their disagreements yippies used several ochs songs in their media in particular anti war i ain t marching anymore for example see this yippie produced documentary still ochs helped plan yippies festival of life which was to take place at 1968 democratic national convention along with demonstrations by other anti war groups including national mobilization committee to end war in vietnam brend pp 106 107 despite warnings that there might be trouble

for retirement events of 1968 assassinations of martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy police riot in chicago and election of richard nixon left ochs feeling disillusioned and depressed schumacher pp 201 204 cover of his 1969 album rehearsals for retirement eerily portrays a tombstone with words phil ochs american born el paso texas 1940 died chicago illinois p 211 at trial of chicago seven in december 1969 ochs testified for defense his testimony included his recitation of lyrics to his song i ain t marching anymore on his way out of courthouse ochs sang song for press corps to ochs s amusement his singing was broadcast that evening by walter cronkite on cbs evening news eliot 1989 pp 175 188 1970 after riot in chicago and subsequent trial ochs changed direction again events of 1968 convinced him that average american was not listening to topical songs or responding to yippie tactics ochs thought that by playing sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to american public schumacher pp 222 223 ochs turned to his musical roots in country music and early rock and roll schumacher p 224 he decided he needed to be part elvis presley and part
