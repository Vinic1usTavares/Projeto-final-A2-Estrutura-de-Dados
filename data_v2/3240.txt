willow s spirit aiding her ritual employs four tarot like cards manus meaning hands or strength represents buffy sophus meaning teacher or wise represents giles animus meaning courage or heart

performance he then meets buffy giles and spike in a playground spike unaffected by daylight tells him that giles is going to teach him to be a watcher as buffy plays in a sandbox xander then finds

of apocalypse now scene between a captive captain benjamin willard and colonel walter kurtz with principal snyder as kurtz throughout sequence xander finds himself in his basement again and again chased by an unseen pursuer who is revealed as first slayer when she tears his heart out giles dream begins with giles swinging a watch in front of buffy they are in giles apartment which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed she laughs and giles dream cuts to a family scene with buffy and his girlfriend olivia at a fairground quicker than others to understand that something is wrong he confronts spike who is posing for a photo shoot in his crypt in bronze he meets anya failing as a stand up comic and willow and xander with a bloody chest wound who warn him of their attacker he breaks into song giving suggestions on how to deal with what hunts them but when sound system breaks down he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault he begins to realize his pursuer is

walks away from first slayer first slayer vanishes and everybody wakes up after they wake up four of them then discuss significance of having tapped into power of first slayer and buffy privately recalls tara s words from her dream as she looks into her bedroom production and writing previous seasons of buffy vampire slayer had ended with an action episode which tied up all threads of season s main plot line but series creator joss whedon wanted to end season four differently penultimate episode primeval had concluded initiative storyline but whedon felt season s overall story arc had not been as cohesive as it could have been and therefore chose to create an episode to act as a grace note to season an episode which would comment on each of four main characters and what they had just been through while talking about writing of episode whedon said it had been like writing poetry a process he found liberating and strange like earlier hush an episode with almost no dialogue he viewed episode as an exercise in form and writing and what it means to write episode has no real structure which was a departure for whedon as everything he had written before was constructed before even starting script yet despite its fragmented style episode unfolds coherently in four discrete acts each act comprising one character s dream filming techniques whedon used a variety of cinematographic techniques to achieve dreamlike quality of restless he used tracking shots with a steadicam to follow characters from place to place creating a flow in way of real dreams where there are no logical connections between places and things in giles dream he walks from a carnival grounds into spike s crypt then through a corridor and straight into bronze three locations not related to one another whedon was able to do this by simply having actor anthony stewart head walk through sets as they were built this effortlessly created a sense of dreamlike dislocation another example of this occurs when in xander s dream he walks from front of moving ice cream van towards back crawls up and over some boxes through a window and drops into his basement in theater scene during willow s dream a frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field allowing both foreground and background to be in focus at same time while in xander s dream as he moves from room to room in buffy s house to university dorm rooms whedon used a 17 mm lens to give a sense of motion as camera passes by walls whedon also used unusual framing for shots often leaving much of frame empty with a character being placed near bottom or off to side scenes in spike s crypt part of giles dream were shot in black and white to emphasize that spike is seen as an old 30s movie villain thumb 250px alt a woman with blonde hair sitting in a playground intensely looking at something an example of overexposure in an exterior shot in this scene whedon also let shots last longer than usual before cutting outdoor scene in which xander sees buffy in sandbox was intentionally overexposed intensifying foreground and blowing out background making sky look white flash frames were also used in shot of buffy in desert whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode this cinematic technique allowed images to take on meaning highly stylized lighting is used throughout xander s dream in university hallway scene is lit with green and orange gels while almost shot for shot re creation of apocalypse now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow background to fall out to black whedon cites limey as an inspiration for unnaturally colored university sequence and had scene from apocalypse now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence when xander is driving ice cream truck with anya backgrounds outside car intentionally look fake to give a sense of stillness where there should be motion whedon originally wanted to use rear screen projection for driving scene but had to utilize greenscreen instead as rear screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages some special effects shots came about by accident in his commentary whedon explains that when buffy smeared mud all over her face it looked as though she was giving herself a facial he therefore dissolved shot into a negative image creating intense colors that made shot more interesting dynamic editing contributed to surrealistic nature of episode abrupt cuts from close up to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow motion are used in buffy s dream several sequences become slow motion partway through them then revert to normal speed as they continue xander s dream features mismatches between sound and image characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard additionally silence is used frequently to both reflect characters disorientation and to unsettle audience whedon cited films by steven soderbergh as his main inspirations for odd editing especially limey and underneath he also listed orson welles version of trial and stanley kubrick s eyes wide shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions cast besides main cast episode features several appearances by returning and currently recurring characters mostly within dream sequences seth green who left series earlier in season makes a brief appearance as oz in willow s dream armin shimerman whose character principal snyder was killed off in season three finale appears as kurtz in apocalypse now scene amber benson appears as tara in dream sequences as both willow s girlfriend and a spirit guide to buffy whedon commented on her appearances in buffy s dream idea that tara would be her spirit guide made sense because she didn t have that particular relationship with tara and tara has a kind of good wiccan mystical energy george hertzberg appears as adam although in human form rather than in demon cyborg makeup he had appeared in throughout season mercedes mcnab appears as harmony kendall is present during willow s dream as both an ordinary classmate and an inept vampire appears as olivia in giles s dream heavily pregnant and pushing a baby stroller kristine sutherland appears as joyce summers buffy s mother whedon enjoyed that she got to play just completely sexy in xander s dream because when you play mom on a show you re sort of relegated to so it was nice to see that side of her it was during filming of this episode that michelle trachtenberg who would go on to play buffy s sister dawn in season five first visited set sarah michelle gellar had worked with her previously and suggested to joss whedon that she read for part of dawn music in giles dream actor anthony stewart head sings exposition song this was third time he sang during season song was written by joss whedon arranged by composer christophe beck and performed by four star mary beck appears in scene playing piano while members of four star mary play other instruments from seasons two to four of series four star mary were real band behind character oz s fictional band dingoes ate my baby analysis thumb 200px alt a man with brown hair in a dark red shirt talking into a microphone writer and director joss whedon provided an in depth analysis of dreams in his audio commentary for episode each dream acts as a character study exploring fears and future of dreamer willow xander and giles are stalked by a shadowy figure then killed within their dreams way in which each is killed is directly related to role they had assumed when melding with buffy in previous episode that role is indicated by tarot like card used to symbolize character s essence willow s card had been spiritus representing her magical powers she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her xander s card had been animus representing his heart he is killed by having his heart ripped out giles had been represented by card sophus a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher he is killed by being scalped buffy s card manus was representative of her physical strength in her dream stalker is revealed as primitive first slayer who confronts her aggressively two fight but first slayer is defeated when buffy realizes a key difference between them first slayer was alone and isolated while buffy is unique among slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying factors which make her greatest slayer ever in willow s dream she struggles to find her place in school theater production of death of a salesman while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed prepared and ready to go on stage her confusion represents her lack of self confidence her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in world unlike those around her who are competent and know what is going on she wears ordinary clothes but others repeatedly comment on excellence of her costume a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into but rather what she was when younger nerdy and awkward this fear is confirmed when buffy strips off her shirt and jeans revealing same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of series four years earlier before her demon fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence willow stands anxiously at front of class trying to read a paper while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and oz whispers into tara s ear until she is attacked by first slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body whedon stated that maze of red curtains on stage in willow s dream are not a direct homage to twin peaks as some have posited but rather represent safety and comfort of being with her girlfriend tara and are a sexual metaphor as well main theme of xander s dream is his sense of failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life his fear that he is stuck is reiterated throughout his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents home no matter where his dream takes him he ends up back in basement as only one of scoobies not in college he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations a fear which is realized when he goes to university a place he already feels excluded from and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him aware that he is being chased and is in danger he asks giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer nor what anya says to him as they are both inexplicably speaking french he exclaims i don t understand during his dream both buffy and willow tell him i m way ahead of you and giles tells him others have gone on ahead underscoring his fear that this is really case giles dream presents a choice either to remain a father figure and watcher to buffy or to begin his own life represented by presence of his girlfriend olivia who pushes an empty baby stroller during this part of his dream buffy is dressed as a child with pigtails and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance later olivia is seen weeping while baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned signifying elements of his unfulfilled life such as marriage and children later in bronze he is explaining reason they are all being stalked and attacked performing his job as watcher but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician something he s been exploring privately throughout season major theme of buffy s dream is her fear of personal cost of her life as a slayer isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure this theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in frame most notably wide shot of her in vast and empty desert another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend riley whom she finds plotting world domination with adam in his original human form she fears what riley could turn into as a result of his alliance with military she also fears destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship and destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as slayer she is shown putting mud on her face mimicking mud mask of primal first slayer by end of her encounter in desert with first slayer buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great slayer and once she experiences this revelation efforts of first slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical dream finally ends in a mundane way as buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life all of many elements in dream sequences have meaning with exception of cheese man whedon explains cheese man meaningless why because i needed something in show that was meaningless because there is always something in dream that doesn t make any sense at all in this case it was cheese man he confounds everybody because of that and people ascribe him meaning this to me means that we re being successful because this means they re not worried about everything else which means they sort of did understand most other things foreshadowing buffy s dream includes several references to past and future episodes in a dream sequence in season three finale faith says little miss muffet counting down from 7 3 0 foreshadowing dawn s arrival two years later in season five two year interval is very rough though it is expressed as 730 days only 441 days passed between first broadcast of this dream scene at end of season 3 and that of dawn s introduction at beginning of season 5 this number appears as 7 30 on a clock in buffy s dream in restless buffy says it s so late tara replies oh that clock s completely wrong a year has now passed making previous number of days to her arrival incorrect when buffy leaves room tara tells her be back before dawn character dawn appears in next episode tara s words to buffy you think you know what s to come what you are you haven t even begun are repeated by dracula to buffy in following episode buffy vs dracula in xander s dream giles and spike swing together on a swing set with spike wearing a tweed jacket giles comments spike s like a son to me in tabula rasa season six when characters lose their memories spike wears same tweed jacket and
