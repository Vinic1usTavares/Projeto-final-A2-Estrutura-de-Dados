mamucium also known as mancunium is a former roman fort in castlefield area of manchester in north west england castra which was founded c ad 79 within roman province of britannia was garrisoned by a cohort of roman auxiliaries near two major roman roads running through area several sizeable civilian settlements or vicus containing soldiers families merchants and industry developed outside fort area is a protected scheduled ancient monument retrieved on 29 december 2007 ruins were left undisturbed until manchester expanded rapidly during industrial revolution in late 18th century most of fort was levelled to make way for new developments such as construction of rochdale canal and great northern railway site is now part of castlefield urban heritage park that includes renovated warehouses a section of fort s wall along with its gatehouse granaries and other ancillary buildings from vicus have been reconstructed and are open to public etymology mamucium is generally thought to represent a latinisation of an original brittonic name either from breast in reference to a breast like hill hylton 2003 p 6 or from mamma mother in reference to a local river goddess both meanings are preserved in modern celtic languages mam meaning breast in irish and mother in welsh antiquaries journal issn 0003 2004 vol 84 pp 353 357 neuter suffix ium is used in latin placenames particularly those representing common brittonic ion a genitive suffix denoting place or city of welsh name for manchester is and presumably derives from original brittonic form location romans built fort on a naturally defensible sandstone bluff that overlooked a nearby crossing over river medlock gregory 2007 p 1 area became an important junction for at least two major military roads through this part of country one highway ran east to west between legionary fortresses of deva victrix chester and eboracum york other ran north to bremetennacum ribchester gregory 2007 pp 1 2 in addition mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to coccium wigan gregory 2007 p 2 fort was one of a chain of fortifications along eboracum to deva victrix road with castleshaw roman fort lying to east walker 1999 p 15 and northwich to west stamps on tegulae indicate that mamucium had administrative links not only with castleshaw but also with nearest fort 12 miles slack and ebchester all

evidence that a prehistoric settlement occupied site before arrival of romans however stone age activity has been recorded in area two mesolithic flints and a flint flake as well as a neolithic scraper have been discovered a shard of late bronze age pottery has also been found in situ gregory 2007 p 181 although area was in territory of celtic tribe brigantes it may have been under control of setantii a sub tribe of brigantes when romans took control from ancient britons kidd 1996 p 12 roman construction of mamucium started around 2007 p 3 during campaigns of general julius agricola against brigantes after a treaty failed mason 2001 pp 41 42 excavations show fort had three main phases of construction first 79 second around 160 and third in 200 first phase of fort was built from turf and timber mamucium s dimensions indicate it was to be garrisoned by a cohort about 500 infantry these troops were not roman citizens but foreign auxiliaries who had joined roman army retrieved on 20 july 2008 by late 1st and early 2nd centuries a civilian settlement called a vicus had grown up around fort gregory 2007 pp 22 156 around 90 fort s ramparts were strengthened this might be because mamucium and roman fort at slack which neighboured castleshaw superseded fort at castleshaw in 120s nevell and redhead 2005 p 59 mamucium was demolished some time around 140 although first vicus grew rapidly in early 2nd century gregory 2007 p 183 it was abandoned some time between 120 and 160 broadly coinciding with demolition of fort before it was re inhabited when fort was rebuilt

register of roads throughout roman empire shotter 2004 p 40 this and inscriptions on and repairs to buildings indicate that mamucium was still in use in first half of 3rd century shotter 2004 p 153 vicus may have been abandoned by mid 3rd century this is supported by excavated remains of some buildings that were demolished and materials robbed for use elsewhere evidence from coins indicates that although civilian settlement associated with fort had declined by mid 3rd century a small garrison may have remained at mamucium into late 3rd century and early 4th century a temple to mithras is possibly associated with civilian settlement in modern hulme an altar dedicated to fortune preserver was found probably dating to early 3rd century in 2008 an altar dating from late 1st century was
