chrono cross was designed primarily by scenarist and director masato kato who had help from other designers who also worked on chrono trigger including art director yasuyuki honne and composer yasunori mitsuda nobuteru yuki designed characters of game story of chrono cross focuses on a teenage boy named serge and a theme of parallel worlds faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child serge endeavors to discover truth of two worlds divergence flashy thief kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around tropical archipelago el nido struggling to uncover his past and find mysterious frozen flame serge is chiefly challenged by lynx a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him upon its release in japan in 1999 and north america in 2000 chrono cross received critical acclaim earning a perfect 10 0 score from gamespot game shipped over copies worldwide leading to a greatest hits re release and continued life in japan as part of ultimate hits series chrono cross was later re released for playstation network in japan in july 2011 and in north america four months later gameplay chrono cross features standard role playing video game gameplay with some differences players advance game by controlling protagonist serge through game s world primarily by foot and boat navigation between areas is conducted via an overworld map much like chrono trigger s depicting landscape from a scaled down overhead view around island world are villages outdoor areas and dungeons through which player moves in three dimensions locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services solve puzzles and challenges or encounter enemies like chrono trigger game features no random encounters enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush party touching monster switches perspectives to a battle screen in which players can physically attack use elements defend or run away from enemy battles are turn based allowing player unlimited time to select an action from available menu for both playable characters and computer controlled enemies each attack reduces their number of hit points a numerically based life bar which can be restored through some elements when a playable character loses all hit points he or she faints if all player s characters fall in battle game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter except for specific storyline related battles that allow player to lose chrono cross s developers aimed to break new ground in genre and game features several innovations for example players can run away from all conflicts including boss fights and final battle battle and elements left thumb in battle players can attack use elements defend or run away alt two characters in foreground in battle poise menu with attack element defend run away boxes with health statistics for characters serge kid and mel stone floor gold robotic enemy facing characters element system of chrono cross handles all magic consumable items and character specific abilities elements unleash magic effects upon enemy or party and must be equipped for use much like materia of 1997 s final fantasy vii elements can be purchased from shops or found in treasure chests littered throughout areas once acquired they are allocated to a grid whose size and shape are unique to each character they are ranked according to eight tiers certain high level elements can only be assigned on equivalent tiers in a character s grid as game progresses grid expands allowing more elements to be equipped and higher tiers to be accessed elements are divided into six paired oppositional types or colors each with a natural effect red fire magma opposes blue water ice green wind flora opposes yellow earth lightning and white light cosmos opposes black darkness gravity each character and enemy has an innate color enhancing power of using same color elements while also making them weak against elements of opposite color chrono cross also features a field effect which keeps track of element color used in upper corner of battle screen if field is purely one color characters are able to unleash a powerful summon element at cost of one player s stars field will also enhance power of elements of colors present while weakening elements of opposite colors characters also innately learn some special techniques techs that are unique to each character but otherwise act like elements like chrono trigger characters can combine certain techs to make more powerful double or triple techs consumable elements may be used to restore hit points or heal status ailments after battle another innovative aspect of chrono cross is its stamina bar at beginning of a battle each character has seven points of stamina when a character attacks or uses an element stamina is decreased proportionally to potency of attack stamina slowly recovers when character defends or when other characters perform actions in battle characters with stamina below one point must wait to take action use of an element reduces user s stamina bar by seven stamina points this often means that user s stamina gauge falls into negative and character must wait longer than usual to recover with each battle players can enhance statistics such as strength and defense however no system of experience points exists after four or five upgrades statistics remain static until players defeat a boss this adds a star to a running count shown on status screen which allows for another few rounds of statistical increases players can equip characters with weapons armor helmets and accessories for use in battle for example power seal upgrades attack power items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps often in treasure chests unlike elements weapons and armor cannot merely be purchased with money instead player must obtain base materials such as copper bronze or bone for a blacksmith to forge for a fee items can later be disassembled into their original components at no cost right thumb players navigate game s tropical setting by boat alt home world an archipelago featuring fishing settlements a city and a volcanic mountain range surrounding a stone fort parallel dimensions existence of two major parallel dimensions like time periods in chrono trigger plays a significant role in game players must go back and forth between worlds to recruit party members obtain items and advance plot much of population of either world have counterparts in other some party members can even visit their other versions player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another for instance cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in other world this system assists presentation of certain themes including questioning of importance of one s past decisions and humanity s role in destroying environment rounding out notable facets of chrono cross s gameplay are new game option and multiple endings as in chrono trigger players who have completed game may choose to start game over using data from previous session character levels learned techniques equipment and items gathered copy over while acquired money and some story related items are discarded on a new game players can access twelve endings scenes viewed depend on players progress in game before final battle which can be fought at any time in a new game file plot characters chrono cross features a diverse cast of 45 party members each character is outfitted with an innate element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over time if taken to world opposite their own characters react to their counterparts if available many characters tie in to crucial plot events since it is impossible to obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough players must replay game to witness everything through use of new game feature players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file serge game s protagonist is a 17 year old boy with blue hair who lives in fishing village of arni one day he slips into an alternate world in which he drowned ten years before determined to find truth behind incident he follows a predestined course that leads him to save world he is assisted by kid a feisty skilled thief who seeks mythical frozen flame portrayed as willful and tomboyish due to her rough thieving past she helps serge sneak into viper manor in order to obtain frozen flame kid vows to find and defeat lynx an anthropomorphic panther who burned down her adopted mother s orphanage lynx a cruel agent of supercomputer fate is bent on finding serge and using his body as part of a greater plan involving frozen flame lynx travels with harle a mysterious playful girl dressed like a harlequin harle was sent by dragon god to shadow lynx and one day steal frozen flame from chronopolis a task she painfully fulfills despite being smitten with serge to accomplish this goal harle helps lynx manipulate acacia dragoons powerful militia governing islands of el nido as dragoons maintain order they contend with fargo a former dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader general viper though with serge initially acacia dragoons whose ranks include fierce warriors karsh marcy and glenn later assist him when militaristic nation of porre invades archipelago invasion brings norris and to islands a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier respectively as they too seek frozen flame story game begins with serge located in el nido a tropical archipelago inhabited by ancient natives mainland colonists and beings called demi humans serge slips into an alternate dimension in which he drowned on beach ten years prior and meets thief kid as his adventure proceeds from here serge is able to recruit a multitude of allies to his cause while assisting kid in a heist viper manor to steal frozen flame he learns that ten years before present universe split into two dimensions one in which serge lived and one in which he perished through kid s astral amulet charm serge travels between dimensions at fort use of a artifact called dragon tear lynx switches bodies with serge unaware of switch kid confides in lynx who stabs her as real serge helplessly watches lynx boasts of his victory and banishes serge to a strange realm called temporal vortex he takes kid under his wing brainwashing her to believe real serge in lynx s body is her enemy serge escapes with help from harle although his new body turns him into a stranger in his own world with all allies he had gained up to that point abandoning him due to his new appearance discovering that his new body prevents him from traveling across dimensions he sets out to regain his former body and learn more of universal split that occurred ten years earlier gaining a new band of allies along way he travels to a forbidden lagoon known as dead sea a wasteland frozen in time dotted with futuristic ruins at center he locates a man named miguel and presumably home world s frozen flame charged with guarding dead sea by an entity named fate miguel and three visions of crono marle and lucca from chrono trigger explain that serge s existence dooms home world s future to destruction at hands of lavos to prevent serge from obtaining frozen flame fate destroys dead sea able to return to another world serge allies with acacia dragoons against porre and locates that dimension s dragon tear allowing him to return to his human form he then enters sea of eden another world s physical equivalent of dead sea finding a temporal research facility from distant future called chronopolis lynx and kid are inside serge defeats lynx and supercomputer fate allowing six dragons of el nido to steal frozen flame and retire to terra tower a massive structure raised from sea floor kid falls into a coma and harle bids party goodbye to fly with dragons serge regroups his party and tends to kid who remains comatose continuing his adventure he obtains and cleanses corrupted masamune sword from chrono trigger he then uses dragon relics and shards of dragon tears to create mythic element chrono cross spiritual power of masamune later allows him to lift kid from her coma at terra tower prophet of time revealed to be belthasar from chrono trigger visits him with visions of crono marle and lucca serge learns that time research facility chronopolis created el nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to past introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused planet to pull in a counterbalance from a different dimension this was a city of dragonians parallel universe descendants of chrono trigger s institutions warred and chronopolis subjugated dragonians humans captured their chief creation dragon god an entity capable of controlling nature chronopolis divided this entity into six pieces and created an elements system fate then terraformed an archipelago erased memories of most chronopolis s staff and sent them to inhabit and populate its new paradise thousands of years later a panther demon attacked a three year old serge his father took him to find assistance at but serge s boat blew off course due to a raging magnetic storm caused by schala schala princess of kingdom of zeal had long ago accidentally fallen to a place known as darkness beyond time and began merging with lavos chief antagonist of chrono trigger schala s storm nullified chronopolis s defenses and allowed serge to contact frozen flame approaching it healed serge but corrupted his father a circuit in chronopolis then designated serge arbiter simultaneously preventing fate from using frozen flame by extension dragons were aware of this situation creating a seventh dragon under storm s cover named harle who manipulated lynx to steal frozen flame for dragons after serge returned home fate sent lynx to kill serge hoping that it would release arbiter lock ten years after serge drowned thief kid presumably on belthasar s orders went back in time to save serge and split dimensions fate locked out of frozen flame again knew that serge would one day cross to another world and prepared to apprehend him lynx switched bodies with serge to dupe biological check of chronopolis on frozen flame belthasar then reveals that these events were part of a plan he had orchestrated named project kid serge continues to top of terra tower and defeats dragon god continuing to beach where split in dimensions had occurred serge finds apparitions of crono marle and lucca once more they reveal that belthasar s plan was to empower serge to free schala from melding with lavos lest they evolve into time devourer a creature capable of destroying spacetime lucca explains that kid is schala s clone sent to modern age to take part in project kid serge uses a time egg given to him by belthasar to enter darkness beyond time and vanquish time devourer separating schala from lavos and restores dimensions to one thankful schala muses on evolution and struggle of life and returns serge to his home noting that he will forget entire adventure she then seemingly records experience in her diary noting she will always be searching for serge in this life and beyond signing entry as schala kid zeal implying that she and kid have merged and became whole again a wedding photo of kid and an obscured male sits on diary s desk scenes then depict a real life kid searching for someone in a modern city intending to make players entertain possibility that their own kid is searching for them ambiguous ending leaves events of characters lives following game up to interpretation relation to radical dreamers chrono cross employs story arcs characters and themes from radical dreamers a satellaview side story to chrono trigger released in japan radical dreamers is an illustrated text adventure which was created to wrap up an unresolved plot line of chrono trigger though it borrows from radical dreamers in its exposition chrono cross is not a remake of radical dreamers but a larger effort to fulfill that game s purpose plots of games are irreconcilable to resolve continuity issues and acknowledge radical dreamers developers of chrono cross suggested game happened in a parallel dimension a notable difference between two games is that magus present in radical dreamers as gil is absent from chrono cross director masato kato originally planned for magus to appear in disguise as guile but scrapped idea due to plot difficulties in ds version of chrono trigger kato teases possibility of an amnesiac magus development square began planning chrono cross immediately after release of xenogears in 1998 which itself was originally conceived as a sequel to snes game chrono trigger s scenario director masato kato had brainstormed ideas for a sequel as early as 1996 following release of radical dreamers square s managers selected a team appointed hiromichi tanaka producer and asked kato to direct and develop a new chrono game in spirit of radical dreamers kato thought dreamers was released in a half finished state and wanted to continue story of character kid kato and tanaka decided to produce an indirect sequel they acknowledged that square would soon re release chrono trigger as part of final fantasy chronicles which would give players a chance to catch up on story of trigger before playing cross kato thought that using a different setting and cast for chrono cross would allow players unfamiliar with chrono trigger to play cross without becoming confused chrono cross team decided against integrating heavy use of time travel into game as they thought it would be rehashing and cranking up volume of last game masato kato cited belief there s no use in making something similar to before and noted we re not so weak nor cheap as to try to make something exactly same as trigger accordingly chrono cross is not chrono trigger 2 it doesn t simply follow on from trigger but is another different chrono that interlaces with trigger kato and tanaka further explained their intentions after game s release right thumb hiromichi tanaka producer alt a japanese man with left parted hair a brown leather jacket and a blue shirt full production began on chrono cross in mid 1998 chrono cross team reached 80 members at its peak with additional personnel of 10 20 cut scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers team felt pressure to live up to work of chrono trigger s dream team development group which included famous japanese manga artist akira toriyama kato and tanaka hired nobuteru yuki for character design and yasuyuki honne for art direction and concept art event team originally envisioned a short game and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during character creation process originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character kato described character creation process take pierre for example we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like tata from trigger we also said things like we need at least one powerful mom no way we re gonna go without a twisted brat and so on so forth as production continued length of cross increased leading event team to reduce number of characters to 45 and scrap most of alternate endings developers humorously named character pip in japanese which means packed as a pun on their attempts to pack as much content into game as possible to avoid burden of writing unique accented dialogue for several characters team member kiyoshi yoshii coded a system that produces accents by modifying basic text for certain characters art director nobuteru yuuki initially wanted characters to appear in a more chibi format with diminutive proportions game world s fusion of high technology and ethnic tribal atmospheres proved challenging at first he later recalled striving to harmonize time period s level of technology especially as reflected in characters garb chrono cross team devised an original battle system using a stamina bar and elements kato planned system around allowing players to avoid repetitive gameplay also known as grinding to gain combat experience hiromichi tanaka likened elements system to card games hoping players would feel a sense of complete control in battle team programmed each battle motion manually instead of performing motion capture developers strove to include tongue in cheek humor in battle system s techniques and animations to distance game from final fantasy franchise masato kato planned for game s setting to feature a small archipelago for fear that players would become confused traveling in large areas with respect to parallel worlds he hoped el nido would still impart a sense of grand scale and development team pushed hardware limitations in creating game s world to create field maps team modeled locations in 3d then chose best angle for 2d rendering programmers of chrono cross did not use any existing square programs or routines to code game instead writing new proprietary systems other innovations included variable frame rate code for fast forward and slow motion gameplay awarded as a bonus for completing game and a cd read swap system to allow quick data retrieval masato kato directed and wrote main story leaving sub plots and minor character events to other staff event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on plot due to complexity of parallel worlds concept masato kato confirmed that cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds as well as fate of schala which he was previously unable to expound upon in chrono trigger concerning ending sequences showing kid searching for someone in a modern city he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives and that this realization would not stop with game he later added paraphrasing one novelist s favorite words what s important is not message or theme but how it is portrayed as a game even in cross it was intentionally made so that most important question was left unanswered kato described finished story as ole boy meets girl type of story with sometimes shocking twists kato rode his motorcycle to relieve stress of game s release schedule he continued refining event data during final stages of development while rest of team undertook debugging and quality control work square advertised game by releasing a short demo of first chapter with purchases of legend of mana north american version of cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release richard honeywood translated working with kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in english he also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult japanese jokes to streamline translation for all 45 playable characters honeywood created his own version of accent generator which needed to be more robust than simple

music chrono cross was scored by freelance video game music composer yasunori mitsuda who previously worked on chrono trigger director masato kato personally commissioned mitsuda s involvement citing a need for chrono sound kato envisioned a southeast asian feel mixed with foreign tastes and tones of countries such as greece mitsuda centered his work around old world cultural influences including mediterranean celtic and percussive african music mitsuda cited visual inspiration for songs all of my subjects are taken from scenery i love artwork to complement theme of parallel worlds he gave another and home respectively dark and bright moods and hoped players would feel emotions of burning soul lonely world and unforgettable memories mitsuda and kato planned music samples and sound

cross broke convention by featuring more characters fewer double and triple techs fewer instances of time travel and few appearances of trigger characters and locations producer hiromichi tanaka and director masato kato were aware of changes in development specifically intending to provide an experience different from chrono trigger kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before game s release wondering what chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever really got through to them he continued cross is undoubtedly highest quality chrono that we can create right now i won t say best chrono but if you can t accept that then i m sorry to say this but i guess your chrono and my chrono have taken totally different paths but i would like to say thank you for falling in love with trigger so much tanaka added of course fans of original are very important but what innovation can come about when you re bound to past i believe that gameplay should evolve with hardware
