promoted on 16 june 1942 and ordered to southwest pacific he flew there with kenneth walker a bomber expert who had also recently been promoted to brigadier general arriving in australia on 11 july 1942 whitehead was shocked by confusion and lack of organization he found next day he reported to general douglas macarthur at ghq swpa in melbourne two men would get along well macarthur later praised whitehead for his masterful generalship brilliant judgement and inexhaustible energy at this time stocks of air force in swpa were low at recent battle of milne bay a japanese invasion force had managed to sail past all but a few raaf p 40 kittyhawk and lockheed hudson aircraft suffering only limited damage opinion at macarthur s general headquarters ghq was that failure of air in this situation is deplorable it will encourage enemy to attempt further landings with assurance of impunity unable to provide macarthur with what he most needed more and better aircraft and crews to man them arnold decided to replace brett with major general george c kenney arnold hoped that kenney and two newly minted brigadier generals could make best use of what was available major general george kenney arrived in theater on 28 july kenney knew whitehead well having served with him at issoudun air corps tactical school and ghq air force and had also served with walker at air corps tactical school i had known them both for over twenty years kenney later wrote they had brains leadership loyalty and liked to work if brett had had them about three months earlier his luck might have been a lot better kenney assumed command of allied air forces on 4 august three days later he instituted a sweeping reorganization of allied air forces australian components were assigned to raaf command under air vice marshal william bostock while american components were consolidated into reformed fifth air force under kenney s personal command on paper organization followed orthodox pattern consisting of v fighter command under brigadier general paul wurtsmith v bomber command under walker and an air services command under major general rush b lincoln but kenney realized that he would have to maintain his headquarters near macarthur s ghq which moved to brisbane on 20 july while fighting was thousands of miles away in new guinea with fifth air force s principal forward bases around port moresby moreover walker s headquarters was in townsville as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through port moresby accordingly kenney appointed whitehead as deputy fifth air force commander and commander of advanced echelon advon in port moresby thumb left major general whitehead new guinea 1943 in his first months in new guinea whitehead concentrated on building up infrastructure there he obtained additional engineer units and construction equipment new airfields were developed along with roads housing taxiways and revetments to protect his aircraft from frequent japanese air raids he also attempted to build up morale and leadership of his units these months coincided with kokoda track campaign for a time despite efforts of his airmen and ground troops japanese advanced steadily on port moresby but they ultimately turned back short of it for his part in papuan campaign whitehead was awarded distinguished service cross australian government made him an honorary commander of order of british empire building up allied air power required ingenuity improvisation and innovation skip bombing was a new tactic adopted by fifth air force that enabled its bombers to attack ships at low level parachute fragmentation bomb gave light bombers increased accuracy for close air support missions although b 25 mitchell was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight major paul pappy gunn had additional guns installed in nose of aircraft to enable it to perform in a low level strafing role whitehead consistently gave his full support to such innovations at battle of bismarck sea in march 1943 whitehead was rewarded with an important victory over japanese battle caused japanese to abandon all further attempts to bring supplies and reinforcements in to lae by direct sea route from rabaul whitehead was promoted to major general on 15 march 1943 whitehead s attitude earned him high marks with allied land commanders lieutenant general sir iven mackay commander of new guinea force reported on 4 february 1943 that i have found brigadier general whitehead of usaaf extremely cooperative in fact there is no question of asking for help he takes initiative as allied offensive gained steam whitehead s main task was to shift his aircraft forward advancing bomb line incrementally towards japan when p 38 lightning arrived in theater in late 1942 whitehead at last received a fighter that could match japanese a6m zero to speed up allied advance fifth air force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended range of its aircraft thus increasing distance of each allied advance which was dependent on range of whitehead s aircraft whitehead assumed command of fifth air force in june 1944 although he remained subordinate to kenney in battle of leyte macarthur attempted to move forward beyond range of land based aircraft a long battle of attrition then began on ground and in air as fifth air force struggled to gain upper hand with inadequate numbers of aircraft that could be based on leyte gradually whitehead gained upper hand he was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 june 1945 post war whitehead continued in command of fifth air force participating in occupation of japan he succeeded kenney as commander of far east air forces in december 1945 he commanded it until march 1949 when he returned to united states to command continental air command whitehead was instrumental in splitting this organization into tactical air command and air defense command commanding latter from january 1951 he was seen by some in air force hierarchy as too attached to kenney and macarthur too political too outspoken and too tactically focused to be vice chief of staff of united states air force whitehead was dismayed by appointment of hoyt vandenberg rather than kenney as chief of staff of united states air force in 1948 and lost his mentor when new chief relieved kenney as commander of strategic air command in october 1948 whitehead was also disappointed at not receiving a fourth star these feelings combined with ill health caused him to retire on 31 july 1951 in retirement whitehead testified before united states senate s preparedness subcommittee on state of nation s air defenses he pleaded for fastest possible creation of an air force with an atomic strike force ready to take off on retaliatory raids within a few hours of an attack on united states enough transports to service strike force at overseas bases fighters to escort bombers on their missions and at least 30 wings of all weather jet fighters to intercept enemy bombers he urged that until this was achieved army and navy should be cut back to token appropriations whitehead pointed out that united states mainland was defended against atomic attack by fewer than 100 all weather fighters which could not have destroyed more than 10 to 15 percent of a force attacking in daylight at night or during instrument meteorological conditions interceptors would have shot down less than 5 percent he argued that a well executed surprise atomic air attack would likely succeed he died of emphysema in newton kansas on 12 october 1964 and was buried in arlington cemetery his son ennis whitehead jr later became a major general in u s army in late 1970s and in march 2003 his grandson ennis whitehead
