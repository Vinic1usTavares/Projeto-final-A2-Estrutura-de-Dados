tropical storm alpha was twenty third named storm of record breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season since twenty one names from predetermined a w list were all used alpha was first tropical storm ever to be given a name from greek alphabet on october 20 tropical depression twenty five formed from a tropical wave near windward islands it became a tropical storm on october 23 and reached its peak intensity but weakened again before making landfall in dominican republic that afternoon crossing island of hispaniola it weakened to a tropical depression and persisted until october 24 when it dissipated its remnant low was absorbed by hurricane wilma s large circulation alpha dumped torrential rain on island of hispaniola making it eighth wettest storm to impact poverty stricken haiti it caused 26 deaths 17 of them in haiti and all of them caused by floods and rain related landslides roads were blocked for weeks and hundreds of houses were destroyed meteorological history alpha s origins were from a tropical wave that developed near windward islands on october 20 satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with tropical wave formed near barbados and moved west northwest with increasing convective activity in an area of light wind shear convection increased and doppler weather radar data from puerto rico detected a well defined cyclonic circulation on october 22 area of low pressure organized into tropical depression twenty five southeast of hispaniola shortly thereafter satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed and associated convection had started banding later that same day depression had organized enough to be upgraded to tropical storm alpha this was first time national hurricane center had to use a greek name for an atlantic hurricane thumb hurricane wilma left and tropical depression 25 right on october 22 when alpha came within doppler weather radar range of puerto rico radar suggested that an eyewall like feature had developed alpha was tracking along southwest edge of a subtropical ridge with nearby hurricane wilma s large circulation alpha was experiencing strong southerly flow from wilma alpha with its small circulation was then faced with mountainous terrain of hispaniola which led forecasters to believe alpha was soon to dissipate shortly after alpha reached its peak intensity on october 23 its wind decreased while convection remained in bands low level circulation was disrupted by land this left center ill defined and difficult to locate late on october 23 alpha made landfall in hispaniola quickly decreasing in intensity as it did so after making landfall storm weakened leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status because of weakening and strong southerly flow from nearby hurricane wilma it was hard to determine whether a low level circulation was present however satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to north of hispaniola it was downgraded to a tropical depression early next day now re emerging over open waters storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that system was weakening on october 24 low level center had completely dissolved and only a small area of convective activity persisted thus system had dissipated and was a remnant low pressure system when national hurricane center issued their last advisories of alpha shortly thereafter remnant low was absorbed into circulation of hurricane wilma on october 25 preparations on october 22 national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning for island of hispaniola and a tropical storm watch for turks and caicos islands and southeastern bahamas tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning in dominican republic authorities ordered evacuation of at least 30 000 people living in areas where flooding was possible on october 22 and 23 haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for county in anticipation of tropical storm alpha s rainfall haiti was already experiencing flooding from hurricane wilma s passage between october 8 and 19 so threat of more rainfall was particularly dire country s centre national de issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides local government of sud est ordered evacuation of its capital city jacmel national government mobilized personnel and resources of direction of civil protection secretariat permanent de des et des desastres and national police to pre arranged emergency operation centres impact nhc s thumb left tropical storm alpha a few hours after landfall in dominican republic on october 24 although storm s circulation technically made landfall near barahona in dominican republic bulk of its impact occurred in country s poorer neighbor haiti when alpha arrived on hispaniola it brought between 4 inches 101 mm and 7 9 in 201 mm of rain which triggered floods and landslides road between port au prince and sud was closed at grand ouest in coastal city of near port au prince bridges were closed to cars but not to pedestrians surging rivers east of marigot and west of jacmel closed roads in that region and main road between jeremie and les cayes was also closed elsewhere in country landslides temporarily blocked several other major roads gonave island which had been suffering a brutal drought was stricken by floods which overwhelmed and washed away pipes of water draining system in nan bare damages in haiti were mostly confined to ouest sud est and grand anse departments in haiti 17 people died two drowned when a river overflowed in grande anse and two more died after being electrocuted during flooding one in port au prince suburb of carrefour and other in southern town of jacmel rest of deaths were results of landslides and flooding in various areas in country across country 243 houses were destroyed and 191 more were damaged nine people were killed in dominican republic two fishermen went missing at sea during storm and others were swept away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in and puerto plata otherwise damage in dominican republic was minimal haitian government did not request international assistance although united nations stabilization mission in haiti united nations development programme undp and haitian red cross which were already working in haiti took on some supporting roles in response to local flooding jacmel regional branch of red cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets 11 boxes of high energy biscuits and 10 boxes of body soap naming and records since all twenty one predetermined hurricane names were exhausted after hurricane wilma greek alphabet was used and storm was designated alpha once it reached tropical storm status name alpha had been used before in atlantic for a subtropical storm but 2005 was first season to have a tropical storm alpha at time it was thought that alpha was twenty second storm of season and so was storm which broke 1933 season s record for most storms in a single season however post season analysis revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on october 4 which made alpha twenty third storm of season alpha was first tropical storm to be assigned a greek alphabet name after list of hurricane names was exhausted see also list of tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricanes list of 2005 atlantic hurricane
