1990 atlantic hurricane season was most active atlantic hurricane season since 1969 it officially began on june 1 1990 and lasted until november 30 1990 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin one tropical depression did form before season officially started however though very active season featured relatively weak systems most of which stayed at sea 1990 season was unusual in that no tropical cyclone of at least tropical storm strength made landfall in united states although tropical storm marco weakened to a depression just before landfall 1962 was last season prior to this one when no storm of at least tropical storm strength made landfall in us there have been a total of 6 such seasons in which no storms have made landfall in united states at at least tropical storm strength these were 1853 1862 1864 1922 1962 and 1990 seasons two of season s hurricanes were notable hurricane diana killed an estimated 139 in mexican states of veracruz and hidalgo property damage estimates are unavailable but damage was widespread hurricane klaus brought flooding to martinique and caused torrential rainfall across southeastern united states after combining with tropical storm marco and a frontal boundary as a result of effects from diana and klaus both names were retired following season season summary pre season forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 1990 20 5 high activity28158record low activity10 tie 0actual activity 14 8 1 forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as dr william m gray and his associates at colorado state university csu a normal season as defined by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has eleven named storms of which six reach hurricane strength and two major hurricanes in april 1990 it was forecast that six storms would reach hurricane status and there would be three additional storms from previous year which would indicate 14 named storms forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status in early june 1990 csu released their predictions of tropical cyclonic activity within atlantic basin during 1990 season forecast from csu called for 11 named storms seven of which to intensify into a hurricane and three would strengthen further into a major hurricane seasonal summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 but activity in 1990 began five days earlier with formation of tropical depression one on may 25 it was an above average season in which 16 tropical depressions formed fourteen depressions attained tropical storm status and eight of these attained hurricane status there was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status category 3 on saffir simpson hurricane scale which was slightly below 1950 2005 average of two per season one hurricane and five tropical storms made landfall during season and caused 168 deaths and 152 million 1990 us usd in damage last storm of season hurricane nana dissipated on october 21 over a month before official end of season on november 30 activity in first two months of season were limited in tropical cyclogenesis with second tropical depression of season not developing until july 22 following that season was very active and there was a quick succession of tropical cyclone development from late july to mid august atlantic briefly remained dormant and activity resumed on august 24 with development of tropical depression eight hurricane gustav although august was a very active month there were only two named storms in september both of which became hurricanes activity in october was high then average with five tropical cyclones to either form or exist in month following an active october no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in final month of season which is november season s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 96 which is categorized as being near normal since it is slightly below mean value of 103 x ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones are excluded from total figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase systems tropical depression one tropical depression one formed on may 25 from a weak low pressure area to west of jamaica which had been producing scattered showers over island during preceding days depression moved across cuba shortly after forming although convection was located to east of its poorly defined center as it headed toward florida it was absorbed by an approaching cold front depression did not cause significant damage in florida depression was forecast to ease drought conditions that persisted for about two years while crossing cuba depression dropped heavy rainfall and predictions stated that precipitation amounts could reach as high as 10 in 254 mm but greatest amount measured was at 6 in 152 4 mm east of havana heavy rainfall also occurred across much of south florida peaking at 6 20 in 157 5 mm at royal palm ranger station in everglades national park while depression was affecting south florida national weather service issued urban flood statements warning of flooded streets in mainly low lying areas especially in dade and broward counties standing water on many florida expressways caused automobile accidents especially in dade county where 28 accidents were reported tropical storm arthur second tropical depression of season developed on july 22 from a tropical wave nearly midway between lesser antilles and cape verde depression slowly intensified and was eventually upgraded to tropical storm arthur two days later on july 25 tropical storm arthur crossed windward islands chain and it was noted that storm made landfall on tobago emerging into caribbean sea arthur reached nearly attained hurricane status on july 25 thereafter wind shear began increasing over arthur and a weakening trend began after peak intensity as arthur headed further into caribbean sea it significantly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression on july 27 later that day air force reconnaissance and satellite imagery did not show a low level circulation indicating that arthur had degenerated into open tropical wave 130 mi 209 2 km southeast of kingston jamaica shortly after arthur became a tropical storm on july 24 a tropical storm warning was issued for trinidad tobago and grenada six hours later it was extended to grenadines about 24 hours later all of tropical storm warnings were discontinued as arthur headed further into caribbean sea a tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for hispaniola and puerto rico on july 26 all of tropical storm watches and warnings were discontinued after arthur weakened to a tropical depression after arthur made landfall on tobago several landslides occurred and a major bridge had collapsed electrical and water services were significantly disrupted damage was also reported on grenada where two bridges were damaged electricity and telephone service was disrupted and crops were affected as well in addition arthur caused damage to four hotels and hundreds of houses wind gusts on island of grenada reportedly reached 55 mph 85 km h as arthur passed south of puerto rico there were reports of strong winds and heavy rainfall heavy rainfall was also reported on south coast of haiti as arthur approached country hurricane bertha a tropical wave emerged off coast of africa and after interacting with a cold front and an area of low pressure developed into a subtropical depression on july 24 offshore of north carolina near cape hatteras subtropical depression slowly acquired tropical characteristics and was reclassified as tropical depression three on july 27 on following day national hurricane center upgraded depression to tropical storm bertha it drifted northeast and became a hurricane 500 mi 804 7 km west southwest of bermuda on july 29 as bertha continued parallel to east coast of united states it had experienced strong wind shear and was downgraded back to a tropical storm later on july 29 however by july 30 air force reconnaissance flights reported at hurricane force winds and bertha had re intensified into a hurricane at that time after becoming a hurricane again bertha continued northeastward but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over nova scotia on august 2 nine deaths were attributed to bertha including six crew members of greek freighter corazon who perished off canadian coast after their ship broke up another fatality was caused when one person fell off ship patricia star and into atlantic other two deaths were from two people drowning in north florida damage to crops and a suspension bridge were reported from nova scotia and prince edward island this damage totaled to 4 427 million 1990 cad 3 912 million 1990 usd usd tropical storm cesar while bertha was approaching atlantic canada a tropical wave emerged into an atlantic from west coast of africa and quickly developed into tropical depression four 336 mi 540 7 km south of cape verde depression headed northwestward due to weakness of a subtropical ridge and slowly intensified while depression was well west of cape verde it intensified into tropical storm cesar on august 2 cesar continued on generally northwestward path and no significant change in intensity occurred as it peaked at 50 mph 85 km h shortly after becoming a tropical storm later in its duration wind shear significantly increased causing low level circulation to be removed from deep convection on august 6 and cesar weakened back to a tropical depression as a result as it was weakening to a tropical depression cesar became nearly stationary and turned abruptly eastward on following day cesar dissipated almost 1 151 mi 1 852 3 km east southeast of bermuda tropical storm edouard a frontal wave formed near azores in early august when thunderstorm activity grew near its center it was deemed a subtropical depression on august 2 just east of azores associated with an upper level cold low it intensified into a subtropical storm on august 3 although water temperatures were cooler than what is usually required for tropical cyclogenesis it tracking westward and passed near graciosa before weakening back to a depression on august 4 depression executed a small cyclonic loop developing deep and organized convection near circulation late on august 6 it transitioned into tropical depression six depression moved northeastward toward azores intensifying into tropical storm edouard on august 8 shortly thereafter it reached peak winds of and subsequently it moved past northern azores on august 10 edouard weakened again to depression status and became extratropical on following day remnants of edouard dissipated on august 13 a few hundred miles west of portugal much of western azores reported winds of at 35 mph 55 km h island of horta reported winds gusts from 35 to 65 mph 55 to 100 km h lajes air force base on terceira island reported a maximum wind gust of also a tower on island of terceira reported sustained winds at 50 mph 80 km h while a gusts as high as were recorded hurricane diana a tropical wave uneventfully crossed atlantic ocean and entered caribbean sea either late july or early august 1990 as system entered southwest caribbean it began to further develop and became tropical depression five on august 4 depression headed northwestward and intensified enough to be upgraded to tropical storm diana on august 5 after becoming a tropical storm diana continued to quickly intensify and maximum sustained winds were 65 mph 105 km h before landfall occurred in felipe carrillo puerto quintana roo on yucatan peninsula diana weakened somewhat over yucatan peninsula but was still a tropical storm when it entered gulf of mexico while over gulf of mexico diana again rapidly intensified and became a hurricane on august 7 later that day diana further strengthened into a category 2 hurricane and peaked with winds of 100 mph 155 km h only two hours diana made landfall near tampico tamaulipas mexico at same intensity after moving ashore diana rapidly weakened and had deteriorated to a tropical storm only four hours after landfall by august 8 diana weakened back to a tropical depression near mexico city diana briefly entered eastern pacific basin on august but was not re classified and it rapidly dissipated at south end of gulf of california in preparations for diana there were several tropical storm watches and warning issued along yucatan peninsula and several areas along gulf coast of mexico hurricane watches and warnings were also put into effect while crossing yucatan peninsula diana produced near tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall but not damage or fatalities however mainland of mexico fared much worse where torrential rainfall caused mudslides in states of hidalgo and veracruz as a result of heavy rainfall many houses were destroyed and approximately 3 500 became homeless diana also produced high winds across mexico which toppled tree and fell electricity poles leaving many without telephone service and block several roads in addition remnants of diana brought rainfall to southwestern united states contemporary reports indicated that 139 people had been killed with an additional 25 000 people being injured damage as a result of diana was estimated at 90 7 million 1990 usd usd tropical storm fran on august 11 a tropical wave developed into seventh tropical depression of season while situated several hundred miles southwest of cape verde depression moved rapidly westwards and intensified to just under tropical storm status on august 12 however later that day depression began to lose its low level circulation while deep convection was diminishing as a result depression became too weak to classify for dvorak technique and system had degenerated back into a tropical wave early on august 13 after weakening back to a tropical wave system quickly re organized and re developed into a tropical depression twelve hours later later that day depression further intensified and was upgraded to tropical storm fran no significant change in intensity occurred after fran became a tropical storm and maximum sustained winds never exceeded 40 mph 65 km h by next day fran made landfall on trinidad at same intensity while on trinidad fran significantly interacted with south american mainland and quickly dissipated on august 15 after fran became a tropical storm on august 13 a tropical storm warning was issued for trinidad tobago and grenada simultaneously a tropical storm watch came into effect for barbados and saint vincent and grenadines as fran was passing through windward islands tropical storm watch was discontinued only two hours before fran dissipated tropical storm warning was discontinued for trinidad tobago and grenada as a result of fran only heavy rains were reported on windward islands light rainfall was reported on trinidad peaking at in addition wind gusts were reported up to 29 mph 46 km h hurricane gustav a tropical depression developed from a tropical wave approximately 1 000 mi 1 609 3 km east of barbados on august 24 after forming depression moved westward and on next day intensified into a tropical storm on following day after becoming a tropical storm gustav continued to intensify as it headed west northwestward intensification into a hurricane occurred on august 26 as storm began slowly curving northward under influence of a trough after reaching category 2 intensity gustav was affected by wind shear and weakened but eventually re intensified hurricane ultimately peaked as a category 3 hurricane on august 31 and was also most intense tropical cyclone of season in addition to being only major hurricane in atlantic that year around time of attaining peak intensity gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby tropical storm hortense after attaining peak intensity on august 31 gustav weakened back at nearly same rate as it had intensified and deteriorated to a tropical storm on september 2 by september 3 gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 230 mi 370 km south of iceland gustav initially appeared as a significant threat to lesser antilles which was devastated by hurricane hugo about a year prior as a result several hurricane watches and warnings were issued on august 27 but all were discontinued later that day as gustav turned northward only effects reported on lesser antilles were large swells light winds and light rains following passage of gustav no damage or fatalities were reported tropical storm hortense ninth tropical depression of season developed from a tropical wave 700 mi 1 126 5 km west southwest of cape verde on august 25 depression headed west northwestward while slowly intensifying and establishing better defined upper level outflow by august 26 depression intensified enough to be upgraded to tropical storm hortense after becoming a tropical storm hortense was steered nearly due north under influence on an upper level low hortense later headed generally northwestward after upper level low degenerated into a trough and moved eastward although intensification was somewhat slow hortense managed to peak as a 65 mph 100 km h tropical storm on august 28 on august 29 nearby hurricane gustav was rapidly intensifying and began to significantly affect hortense with increasing vertical wind shear hortense weakened with storm degenerating into a tropical depression on august 30 further weakening occurred and hortense dissipated on august 31 circa east southeast of bermuda hurricane isidore a vigorous tropical wave exited west coast of africa on september 3 it quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well defined circulation which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on september 4 at time it was situated hundreds of miles south of cape verde at a very southerly latitude of 7 2degn making it southernmost forming tropical cyclone on record in north atlantic basin initial intensification was slow as system moved northwestward a movement caused by a large mid level trough over central atlantic on september 5 nhc upgraded depression to tropical storm isidore subsequently it intensified at a faster rate becoming a hurricane on september 6 following day satellite estimates from dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100 mph 165 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar hpa 28 88 inhg after peaking isidore entered a region of stronger upper level winds and quickly weakened by september 8 it had deteriorated into a tropical storm although re intensification occurred after shear decreased an eye feature redeveloped in center of convection and isidore re intensified into a hurricane on september 9 it ultimately reached a secondary peak intensity of 90 mph 150 km h isidore s motion slowed briefly becoming stationary although it remained a hurricane for several days cooler waters imparted weakening to a tropical storm on september 16 and next day it became extratropical to east of newfoundland there were a few ships that came in contact with hurricane isidore one of which reported hurricane force wind gusts storm never approached land during its duration and no damage or casualties were reported tropical depression eleven on september 18 tropical depression eleven formed midway between africa and lesser antilles from a tropical wave ship and reconnaissance aircraft observations reported that depression almost reached tropical storm strength however it was torn apart by strong upper level winds until it dissipated on september 27 system never affected land hurricane josephine a tropical wave exited coast of africa on september 16 with copious convection it tracked westward developing into tropical depression twelve on september 21 while located a few hundred miles west of cape verde without intensifying further depression turned northward due to a weakness caused by deepening of a 200 mbar cut off low near iberian peninsula under influence of a building high pressure area depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift it into tropical storm josephine on september 24 although increased wind shear from a trough weakened storm back to a tropical depression on september 26 it remained weak for several days gradually turning to north due to a weak trough over northwestern atlantic on october 1 another high pressure area halted its northward movement causing josephine to turn to east that day it re intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop an approaching trough caused josephine to accelerate north northeastward and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on october 5 after existing nearly two weeks hurricane josephine intensified slightly more on october 5 attained its peak intensity later that day with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar hpa 28 94 inhg a large mid latitude storm began developing on october 5 and hurricane josephine accelerated around east periphery on system josephine weakened back to a tropical storm early on october 6 while moving to north of mid latitude system after tracking near mid latitude cyclone tropical storm josephine transitioned into an extratropical storm on october 6 before being absorbed by it mid latitude cyclone later developed into hurricane lili hurricane klaus a tropical wave developed into tropical depression thirteen on october 3 115 mi 185 km h east of dominica depression rapidly intensified into a tropical storm and was classified as tropical storm klaus only six hours later because klaus was in an area of weak steering current it was drifting west northwestward on october 5 klaus briefly intensified into a hurricane and passed only 12 mi 19 km east of barbuda later that day by following day klaus had weakened back into a tropical storm after weakening to a tropical storm klaus began to accelerate while turning westward klaus became significantly affected by wind shear as it weakened to a tropical depression to north of puerto rico on october 8 later that day deep convection began to re developed near low level circulation of klaus and it had re intensified into a tropical storm as klaus tracked northwestward near bahamas on october 9 it was absorbed by an area of low pressure which would eventually develop into tropical storm marco since klaus passed very close to leeward islands tropical storm watches and warnings were issued as well as hurricane watches and warning starting on october 4 in addition tropical storm watches and warnings were also issued for british and united states virgin islands and bahamas after several watches and warnings were issued all were discontinued by october 9 around time when klaus was absorbed by area of low pressure in martinique flooding caused seven fatalities and displaced 1 500 other people heavy rainfall also occurred on other leeward islands with estimates as high as 15 in 381 mm of precipitation however no effects were reported in bahamas remnants brought large waves and heavy rainfall to southeastern united states which caused four deaths when a dam burst in south carolina in total klaus caused 11 fatalities but only 1 million 1990 usd usd in damage hurricane lili a cold core low which affected latter stages of josephine developed at surface and became a subtropical storm on october 6 about 875 mi 1 408 1 km southeast of cape race newfoundland subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward nearly intensifying into a hurricane on october 11 subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics simultaneously now tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane and was re classified as hurricane lili after becoming a hurricane lili headed rapidly west southwestward and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h after passing 140 mi 230 km south of bermuda later that day lili began to curve slowly northward thereby avoiding landfall in united states while about 200 mi 321 9 km east southeast of cape hatteras lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity weakening to a tropical storm lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward atlantic canada however lili transitioned into an extratropical storm on october 14 just offshore of nova scotia post tropical cyclone made landfall on newfoundland soon afterwards lili posed a threat to bermuda and a hurricane warning as storm approached but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported as lili continued westward it had also posed a significant threat to east coast of united states since some of computer models did not predict a northward curve as a result several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from little river inlet south carolina to cape henlopen delaware however lili later curved northward and only caused minor coastal erosion in north carolina and rainfall in pennsylvania lili began impacting atlantic canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone and storm reportedly caused strong winds in nova scotia and newfoundland no damage total or fatalities were reported tropical storm marco as klaus was dissipating a new cold low developed over cuba and developed down to surface as a tropical depression on october 9 depression emerged straits of florida and quickly intensified into a tropical storm on october 10 after becoming a tropical storm marco steadily intensified and eventually peaked with winds of 65 mph 100 km h marco headed towards florida and remained just offshore of western coast and nearly made landfall near st petersburg florida on october 12 however marco continued to interact with land and weakened to a tropical depression before actually making landfall near cedar key florida with winds of 35 mph 55 km h it rapidly weakened over land and dissipated in georgia later that day although it had dissipated marco added to heavy rainfall already brought to southeastern states by remnants hurricane klaus although only a depression at final landfall this was officially counted as a tropical storm hit on united states as much of circulation was on land before landfall in area of st petersburg florida in preparations for marco a tropical storm warning was issued for nearly entire gulf and atlantic coast of florida in florida marco caused flooding damage to houses and roads in addition to producing tropical storm force winds across state however marco is more notable for impact from remnants especially in georgia and south carolina where rainfall from storm peaked at 19 89 in 505 mm near louisville georgia in combination with remnants of hurricane klaus marco caused heavy rainfall in south carolina causing a dam to burst leading to three fatalities several more fatalities were caused by remnants of marco and klaus and system caused 12 deaths it also caused 57 million 1990 usd usd in damage most of it from damage or destruction of residences in georgia hurricane nana on october 7 a vigorous tropical wave emerged off coast of africa near cape verde and despite semi favorable conditions wave did not develop initially due to embedded westerlies which caused wave to remain disorganized despite having deep convection six days later wave had reached lesser antilles and split northern portion of wave then developed into tropical depression sixteen on october 16 depression rapidly intensified to a tropical storm and then a hurricane next day receiving name nana development increased slightly and system reached its peak intensity of 85 mph 140 km h that same day nana dissipated while heading southward on october 21 nana initially posed a threat to bermuda and as a result a hurricane watch was issued late on october 18 however after nana weakened to a tropical storm on october 20 hurricane watch was downgraded to a tropical storm watch furthermore nana began to curve southeastward away from bermuda and later on october 20 tropical storm watch was discontinued only known effect from nana on bermuda was 0 33 in 8 4 mm of rain nana was a very small hurricane circulation probably being only 30 40 mi 50 60 km wide nana was first storm to receive n name since naming began in atlantic basin in 1950 storm names following names were used for named storms that formed in north atlantic in 1990 names not retired from this list were used again in 1996 season this is same list used for 1984 season storms were named marco and nana for first time in 1990 names that were not assigned are marked in arthur bertha cesar diana edouard fran gustav hortense isidore josephine klaus lili marco nana retirement world meteorological organization retired two names in spring of 1991 diana and klaus they were replaced in 1996 season
