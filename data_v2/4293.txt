nsw plc is oldest continuously running presbyterian church school in its state college is a founding member of association of heads of independent girls schools and is affiliated with association of heads of independent schools of australia junior school heads association of australia and australian boarding schools association plc is one of two sydney schools in round square organisation notable alumnae include first qualified female architect in australia and other pioneering women in education law and medicine history foundation in 1883 general assembly of presbyterian church of nsw formed a special committee to investigate a proposal to establish boarding schools for girls and for boys to provide presbyterian alternatives to proliferating number of roman catholic secondary schools in colony minister at richmond rev james cameron stated presbyterians should take prompt action because popish party seeing want that was felt throughout colony in regard to higher education has stepped in to supply that want and if protestants did not look to matter roman catholics would take advantage of them general assembly was also inspired to establish a school particularly a ladies college by less worthy motives other protestant denominations in nsw had recently established their own ladies colleges and neighbouring colony of victoria had maintained a presbyterian ladies college since 1875 and so it was felt that nsw presbyterians should also have one at 1884 assembly committee announced that while a boys school was not needed secondary education options available to girls were not satisfactory and they recommended that a ladies college similar to presbyterian ladies college melbourne be established as soon as possible a ladies college committee was formed and by july 1887 they had leased a property in ashfield for principal they unanimously selected dr john marden a science master from methodist ladies college mlc in melbourne because of his high academic standing his experience and success in teaching and his high christian character marden was a strong believer in equal opportunity in education and has been described as an early feminist he rejected idea that plc was to be merely a finishing school for daughters of wealthy and was once quoted as saying i am out of sympathy with cry that education is unnecessary for girls and that all they require is a few accomplishments women have also to live their life in most cases a harder one than men have this notion of accomplishments being sufficient for girls is surely a remnant of those barbarous days when women were looked on as plaything of men presbyterian ladies college was finally opened by marden and lady superintendent m mccormick on 30 january 1888 with 39 girls it was modelled on great english public schools and was first school to be established by presbyterian church of new south wales together with committee marden was responsible for organising curriculum and hiring appropriate staff during opening ceremony governor invited his wife countess of jersey margaret child villiers to speak she made what sydney morning herald described as a capital impromptu speech countess speech was widely reported throughout australia and elsewhere around world as at time it was quite unusual for a woman to speak in public plc s jersey day an annual event in which ex students return to college on sunday closest to 10 march is named in honour of countess growth in early years at croydon girls tended to be enrolled at an older age typically over fourteen it was apparent that despite marden s insistence many parents viewed college as a finishing school as today it was not a requirement for students to be presbyterians and early school records indicate there were a number of roman catholic and jewish students by 1900 reputation of school had spread and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area including new caledonia fiji new zealand northern territory western australia queensland and south australia increase in enrolments also convinced council of need to set up a branch school on another site preferably on north shore in 1913 marden reported that many applications were being refused because of shortness of space assembly approved establishment of a branch at pymble and gave council of plc croydon ps5 000 to erect new buildings and lay out grounds presbyterian ladies college pymble was opened on 8 february 1916 with 48 day girls and 86 boarders marden became principal of both schools opening of pymble campus necessitated a change of name for croydon college from presbyterian ladies college sydney to presbyterian ladies college croydon marden retired at end of 1919 and a principal was appointed to each branch dr e neil mcqueen a prominent educational innovator who had previously been vice principal of two schools became second principal of plc croydon in 1918 school magazine aurora australis was first published on cover it bore a quotation from

novelist critic and historian flora left school to fill wartime positions in bureaucracy in 1942 new principal dr helen wilkie arrived to find falling enrolments staffing problems and food shortages due to effects of second world war word was soon received that australian military authorities wished to inspect school with a view to taking it over on 24 march 1942 it was requested that plc be occupied by royal australian air force raaf for purpose of establishing a top secret radar unit and military barracks known as no 1 rimu radio installation and maintenance unit in order to accommodate plc s students and classes council approached meriden school in strathfield meriden agreed to house boarders and singing domestic science and physical education classes plc also purchased lingwood a property in strathfield as a centre for school s remaining activities at end of 1942 meriden authorities indicated that they could no longer house plc boarders so lauriston strathfield on boulevarde and welbeck at 18 margaret street were rented for them in july 1944 council agreed to purchase lingwood at 16 margaret street to house a kindergarten feeder school for college or as a site for a permanent move a few months later council decided that future of plc lay in strathfield croydon campus was offered to military for ps36 500 and plans were made to purchase welbeck and lauriston to form new plc council s preference for strathfield as a permanent location for school was not shared by most of school community and after an intervention by education trust of nsw general assembly it was decided that plc would reopen once again at croydon in first term 1946 military agreed to pay for extensive renovations that were required with final cheque handed over by government on 21 march 1949 lauriston and welbeck were disposed of in 1946 but lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school council negotiated with margaret thompson owner and principal of branxton a private school in strathfield about moving her school to lingwood property where it would retain name branxton and come under control of plc council evidence of plc s wartime occupation remain with tunnels
