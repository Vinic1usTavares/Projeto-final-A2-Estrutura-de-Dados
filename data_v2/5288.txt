hurricane bob was first atlantic tropical cyclone to be officially designated using a masculine name after discontinuation of joint army navy phonetic alphabet names bob brought moderate damage to portions of united states gulf coast and areas farther inland in july 1979 storm was first hurricane in gulf of mexico to form in month of july since 1959 and was fifth tropical cyclone to form during annual hurricane season though origin of bob can be traced back to a tropical wave near western coast of africa in late june bob formed from a tropical depression in southwestern gulf of mexico on july 9 tracking in a general northward direction favorable conditions allowed for quick strengthening less than a day after formation system reached tropical storm intensity followed by hurricane intensity on july 11 shortly after strengthening into a hurricane bob reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 mbar hpa 29 12 inhg at same intensity bob made landfall west of grand isle louisiana and rapidly weakened after moving inland however resulting tropical depression persisted for several days as it paralleled mississippi and ohio rivers on july 16 system emerged into western atlantic where it was subsequently absorbed by a nearby low pressure area widespread offshore and coastal evacuations took place along united states gulf coast in preparation for hurricane bob effects from hurricane on united states were mostly marginal and typical of a minimal hurricane cyclone produced a moderate storm surge damaging some coastal installments and causing coastal inundation strong winds were also associated with bob s landfall though no stations observed winds of hurricane force winds downed trees and blew out windows in addition to causing widespread power outages heavy rainfall was also reported in some locations peaking at in louisiana further inland torrential rains led to flooding in indiana resulting in more considerable damage as opposed to coast bob also spawned eight tornadoes with two causing significant damage overall bob was responsible for one death and 20 million in damage meteorological history origin of hurricane bob can be traced to a tropical wave that was first located near cape verde towards end of june disturbance tracked westward with minimal signs of development and reached northwestern caribbean sea on july 6 following day tropical system tracked across yucatan peninsula following day and upon emerging into gulf of mexico cluster of storms began to develop a weak circulation center this enabled for more rapid tropical cyclogenesis and at 1200 utc on july 9 disturbance was analyzed to have organized into a tropical depression third of such in atlantic that year depression strengthened rather quickly and on morning of july 10 a united states air force reconnaissance flight indicated that tropical cyclone had strengthened to tropical storm intensity while situated south of louisiana due to storm s intensity system was consequentially named bob making it first atlantic tropical cyclone to receive a masculine name since 1952 at time flight measured a minimum barometric pressure of 998 mbar hpa 29 47 inhg upon reaching tropical storm intensity bob began to curve further northward as opposed to its prior northeasterly track due to presence of a strengthening upper level trough to storm s west trough greatly enhanced atmospheric conditions around bob allowing for tropical cyclone to intensify rapidly at 0000 utc on july 11 bob was estimated to have strengthened to hurricane intensity based on additional reconnaissance flight data this made bob first july hurricane in gulf of mexico since hurricane debra in 1959 though hurricane s maximum sustained winds would hold steady at for approximately ensuing twelve hours storm s barometric pressure would fluctuate before reaching a minimum of 981 mbar hpa 28 98 inhg at 1200 utc that day this would be bob s lowest documented barometric pressure at around same time hurricane made landfall west of grand isle louisiana after moving inland bob quickly weakened due to land interaction and was a mere tropical depression by july 12 however resulting depression would maintain its intensity for next several days on july 13 low pressure area drifted into southern ohio and afterwards curved eastward on july 16 bob s remnants moved into western atlantic where they were subsequently absorbed by another low pressure area preparations as bob moved towards u s gulf coast national weather service issued gale warnings for coastal regions extending from vermilion bay louisiana to biloxi mississippi at 1600 utc on july 10 these warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon bob s strengthening to such an intensity during storm s existence forecasts and predictions from national hurricane center were of greater accuracy than on average in addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches agency also advised small craft from port arthur texas to pensacola florida to remain in port in preparation for storm 8 000 offshore oil workers were evacuated despite typical evacuation procedure chevron corporation immediately evacuated their offshore oil staff rather than executing a three phase evacuation plan on land 2 500 residents and tourists on grand isle were also evacuated in total as many as 80 000 people evacuated from coastal areas leading up to bob s eventual landfall in new orleans 4 000 people checked into city s 19 evacuation centers mississippi river was temporarily closed to shipping by united states coast guard for eight hours before reopening after storm impact thumb 250px rainfall totals in united states effects in united states as a result of bob were typical of a minimal hurricane and were not of considerable nature at coast bob caused moderate storm surge resulting in coastal waters rising to as high as above normal rough seas sunk several boats and caused significant damage to piers a levee on grand isle was breached by surge resulting in some coastal inundation minor beach erosion occurred on coast of mississippi in mobile county alabama wave action damaged cars near shore and disrupted seafood operations in bayou la batre area strong winds were reported in association with storm but no station documented sustained winds within hurricane force highest wind observation was taken on an oil rig off coast of louisiana which clocked sustained winds at however strongest wind gust in association with hurricane was measured in bay st louis mississippi at in new orleans these strong winds damaged trees and power lines and also broke several windows in city s central business district in addition widespread power outages impacted 53 000 electricity customers in city s area similar incidents took place in houma louisiana in lafitte louisiana two men were blown off of roof of a marina and one of them was killed this would be only death associated with hurricane further east in florida trees and power lines were downed in niceville hurricane bob also produced a widespread area of rain that was heavy in localized areas rainfall associated with hurricane peaked at in louisiana where storm made landfall statewide rainfall totals peaked at in pascagoula mississippi and alabama respectively further inland remnants of bob dropped heavy rainfall in midwestern united states peaking at at a station in indiana university bloomington in addition to strong winds and heavy rain bob produced eight tornadoes across southern united states one of these tornadoes caused 27 500 in damage after striking areas of biloxi mississippi another tornado impacted areas near red level alabama destroying or damaging several buildings and uprooting trees overall hurricane bob caused approximately 20 million in damage however 15 million in damage resulted from flooding in indiana with rest of storm s monetary impacts
