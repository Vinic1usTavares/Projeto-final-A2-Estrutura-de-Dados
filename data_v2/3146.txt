a deeper plot than original gears of war and being highly polished reviewers noted that multiplayer experience did not resemble previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability ign noted that while first four acts of game were satisfying in final act last boss is a complete joke and ending feels just a tad too abrupt and that there were some bugs and lag in online multiplayer overall ign stated that gears of war 2 has its flaws when it comes to technical side of multiplayer and last act of campaign and voice acting might turn some off still none of that comes close to holding back gears of war 2 from its destiny being one of best games available on xbox 360 also even though new plot was praised critics such as official xbox magazine scrutinized game s middle acts saying that most of plot falls flat both ign and eurogamer among others positively mentioned new horde mode feature with eurogamer saying that horde is a weighty slab of fun that can turn almost any of them into a time sink and leaderboards are likely to be as compelling a reason to stick with gears of war 2 as leveling system has been for call of duty 4 modern warfare x play praised game for its polished
