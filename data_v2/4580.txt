adenanthos cuneatus also known as coastal jugflower flame bush bridle bush and sweat bush is a shrub of family proteaceae native to south coast of western australia french naturalist jacques labillardiere originally described it in 1805 within genus adenanthos it lies in section adenanthos and is most closely related to a stictus a cuneatus has hybridized with four other species of adenanthos growing to high and wide it is erect to prostrate in habit with wedge shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair single red flowers are insignificant and appear all year though especially in late spring reddish new growth occurs over summer it is sensitive to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback hence requiring a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in cultivation its natural habitat of sandy soils in heathland being an example its pollinators include bees honey possum silvereye and honeyeaters particularly western spinebill a cuneatus is grown in gardens in australia and western united states and a dwarf and prostrate form are commercially available description adenanthos cuneatus grows as an erect spreading or prostrate shrub to high and wide it has a woody base known as a lignotuber from which it can resprout after bushfire wedge shaped cuneate leaves are on short petioles and are long and wide with 3 to 5 and occasionally up to 7 rounded teeth or lobes at ends wrigley 1991 61 62 nelson 1995 331 new growth is red and slightly translucent it glows bright red against light especially when sun is low in sky new growth is mainly seen in summer and leaves in general are covered with fine silvery hair occurring throughout year but more often from august to november insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around long pollen is triangular in shape and measures in length averaging around species is similar in many ways to its close relative a stictus most obvious difference is in habit multi stemmed lignotuberous a cuneatus rarely grows over in height whereas a stictus is a taller single stemmed non lignotuberous shrub that commonly reaches in height leaves are similar but lobes at leaf apex are regular and crenate rounded in a cuneatus but irregular and dentate toothed in a stictus nelson 1978 389 also new growth does not have a red flush in a stictus and juvenile leaves of a stictus are usually much larger than adult leaves a difference not seen in a cuneatus flowers of two species are very similar differing only subtly in dimension colour and indumentum nelson 1975b 139 144 taxonomy discovery and naming although precise time and location of its discovery are unknown jacques labillardiere botanist to an expedition under bruni d entrecasteaux which anchored in esperance bay on south coast of western australia on 9 december 1792 most likely collected first known botanical specimen of adenanthos cuneatus on 16 december while searching area between observatory point and pink lake for zoologist claude riche who had gone ashore two days earlier and failed to return following an unsuccessful search following day several senior members of expedition were convinced that riche must have perished of thirst or at hands of australian aborigines and counselled d entrecasteaux to sail without him however labillardiere convinced d entrecasteaux to search for another day and was rewarded not only with recovery of riche but also with collection of several highly significant botanical specimens including first specimens of anigozanthos kangaroo paw and nuytsia floribunda west australian christmas tree and as aforementioned a cuneatus nelson 1975b 1 24 thirteen years passed before labillardiere published a formal description of a cuneatus and in meantime several further collections were made scottish botanist robert brown collected a specimen on 30 december 1801 during visit of hms investigator to king george sound and fourteen months later jean baptiste leschenault de la tour botanist to nicolas baudin s voyage of exploration nelson 332 and gardener s boy antoine collected more specimens therein official account of baudin s expedition contain notes from leschenault on vegetation labillardiere eventually published genus adenanthos along with a cuneatus and two other species in his 1805 novae hollandiae plantarum specimen he chose specific name cuneata in reference to leaves of this species which are cuneate triangular nelson 1975b 2 this name has feminine gender consistent with gender assigned by labillardiere to genus nelson 1978 320 he did not designate which of three published species was to serve as type species of adenanthos but irish botanist e charles nelson has since chosen a cuneatus as lectotype for genus since holotype of a cuneatus bears an annotation showing derivation of genus name and because labillardiere s description of it is most detailed of three and is referred to by other descriptions nelson 1978 318 320 synonymy in 1809 richard salisbury writing under joseph knight s name in controversial on cultivation of plants belonging to natural order of published name listing a cuneata as a synonym as no type specimen was given and no specimen annotated by knight could be found this was treated as a nomenclatural synonym of a cuneata and was therefore rejected on principle of priority nelson 1978 387 also synonymised with this species is adenanthos crenata published by carl ludwig willdenow s in kurt polycarp joachim sprengel s 1825 16th edition of systema willdenow published both a cuneata and a crenata giving them different descriptions but designating same type specimen for both thus a crenata was rejected under principle of priority and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of a cuneatus infrageneric placement in 1870 george bentham published first infrageneric arrangement of adenanthos in volume 5 of his landmark flora australiensis he divided genus into two sections placing a cuneata in a sect stenolaema because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above middle this arrangement still stands today though a sect stenolaema is now renamed to autonym a sect adenanthos a analysis of genus undertaken by nelson in 1975 yielded results in which a cuneatus was grouped with a stictus this pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included a forrestii a eyrei a cacomorphus a ileticos and several hybrid and unusual forms of a cuneatus nelson 1975b 1 123 124 nelson s analysis supported bentham s sections and so they were retained when nelson published a taxonomic revision of genus in 1978 he further subdivided a sect adenanthos into two subsections with a cuneata placed into a adenanthos for reasons including length of its perianth nelson 1978 320 321 but nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of adenanthos for flora of australia series of monographs by this time had issued a ruling that all genera ending in must be treated as having masculine gender thus specific epithet became cuneatus thumb right inflorescence thumb right red new growth of a cuneatus national park placement of a cuneatus in nelson s arrangement of adenanthos may be summarised as follows adenanthos a sect 4 species a sect adenanthos a a a apiculatus a linearis a pungens 2 subspecies a gracilipes a a dobsonii a glabrescens 2 subspecies a a cuneatus a stictus a ileticos a forrestii a eyrei a cacomorphus a a a a terminalis a sericeus 2 subspecies a x cunninghamii a oreophilus a 2 subspecies a meisneri a a a a hybrids adenanthos cuneatus apparently forms hybrids with other adenanthos species quite readily as four putative natural hybrids have been reported a x cunninghamii albany a hybrid between a cuneatus and a sericeus was first collected in 1827 and published as a cunninghamii in 1845 other than some dubious collections in 1830s and 1840s no further sightings are known to have been made until 1973 when nelson rediscovered it at time it was regarded as a distinct species but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002 in appearance it is very similar to a sericeus but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical a single plant discovered by nelson near israelite bay where both putative parents are found is regarded as a hybrid between a cuneatus and a dobsonii leaves are mostly triangular like those of a cuneatus but whereas a cuneatus leaves are mostly five lobed putative hybrid usually has three lobes with occasional leaf being entire like those of a dobsonii though a itself occasionally bears entire leaves leaves of putative hybrid lack thick indumentum of a cuneatus being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of a dobsonii flower colour is like that of a cuneatus but style lacks an indumentum like a dobsonii nelson 1978 391 two plants found near twilight cove are regarded as hybrids between a cuneatus and a forrestii only two adenanthos species to occur in area one was discovered by nelson in 1972 other by alex george in 1974 they are about 5 km apart and differ somewhat leaves are triangular and flat like those of a cuneatus but leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow and leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed nelson 1978 392 in his 1995 revision nelson refers to putative hybrids with a dobsonii and a apiculatus citing 1978 paper in which he published putative hybrids with a dobsonii and a forrestii it is unclear whether reference to a apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid common names this species has several common names some highly localised two names allude to its consumption by horses bridle bush a name used east of esperance refers to fact that horses favour it as fodder and sweat bush used around hopetoun derived from claim that horses break out in sweat after consuming young growth common name of flame bush derives from brilliant red new growth it is also known as coastal jugflower nelson also records use of names and native temp but ridicules them as obvious errors distribution and habitat thumb distribution of a cuneatus shown on a map of western australia s biogeographic regions alt a map of western australia with floristic regions delineated and an area in bottom marked in red most widely distributed adenanthos species of south coast nelson 1975b 299 a cuneatus is common and locally abundant between king george sound and israelite bay along coast and up to inland with isolated populations extending west to walpole and stirling range and as far east of israelite bay as twilight cove nelson 1978 388 this species is restricted to siliceous sandplain soils and will not grow in calcareous soils such as limestone plains of nullarbor or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth nelson 1975b 262 268 this restriction explains disjunctions east of israelite bay species occurs only in those few locations where existence of cliff top dunes of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat nelson 1975b 311 provided soil is siliceous and fairly dry a cuneatus tolerates a range of edaphic conditions it grows in both lateritic sand and sands of marine origin nelson 1975b 252 and it tolerates ph levels ranging from 3 8 to 6 6 nelson 1975b 254 consistent with these edaphic preferences a cuneatus is a frequent and characteristic member of kwongan heathlands commonly found on sandplains of southwest australia climate in its range is mediterranean with annual rainfall from nelson 1975b 261 ecology colletid bees of genus leioproctus visit adenanthos cuneatus flowers a 1978 field study conducted around albany found honey possum tarsipes rostratus occasionally visited adenanthos cuneatus while western spinebill much preferred species to other flowers a 1980 field study at cheyne beach showed that new holland honeyeater and white cheeked honeyeater pollinate it a 1985 86 field study in fitzgerald river national park found that nectar feeding honey possum occasionally eats it silvereye zosterops lateralis feeds on nectar from flowers and has also been observed taking dew drops from leaves early in morning adenanthos cuneatus is known to be susceptible to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback but reports on degree of susceptibility vary from low to high a study of banksia attenuata woodland southeast of perth across 16 years and following a wave of p cinnamomi infestation showed that a cuneatus populations were not significantly reduced in diseased areas phosphite used to combat dieback has some toxic effects in a cuneatus with some necrosis of leaf tips but shrub uptakes little of compound when compared with other shrubs specimens in coastal dune vegetation showed some sensitivity to fungus armillaria luteobubalina with between a quarter and a half of plants exposed succumbing to pathogen cultivation thumb right upright coral drift adenanthos cuneatus was taken to great britain in 1824 and has been grown in cultivation in australia and western united states its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature along with its ability to attract birds to garden it requires a well drained position to do well but will grow in full sun or semi shade and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils george lullfitz a western australian nurseryman recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs or in a rockery following cultivars exist a coral drift is a compact form in cultivation since at least 1990s it is tall and wide grey foliage has pinkish purple new growth a coral carpet is a prostrate form which peaks at around high and spreads to across new foliage is a pinkish purple a chance seedling from coral drift it was originally developed by george lullfitz of lullfitz nursery in wanneroo it became available to public in 2005 and has been registered successfully under plant breeders rights footnotes references external links cuneatus category
