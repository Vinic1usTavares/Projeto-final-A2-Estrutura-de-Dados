common tern sterna hirundo is a seabird in family laridae this bird has a circumpolar distribution its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of europe asia and north america it is strongly migratory wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions breeding adults have light grey upperparts white to very light grey underparts a black cap orange red legs and a narrow pointed bill depending on subspecies bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black there are a number of similar species including partly sympatric arctic tern which can be separated on plumage details leg and bill colour or vocalisations breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives common tern nests on any flat poorly vegetated surface close to water including beaches and islands and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available up to three eggs may be laid their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on open beach incubation is by both sexes and eggs hatch in around 21 22 days longer if colony is disturbed by predators downy chicks fledge in 22 28 days like most terns this species feeds by plunge diving for fish either in sea or in freshwater but molluscs crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of diet in some areas eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and american mink and large birds including gulls owls and herons common terns may be infected by lice parasitic worms and mites although blood parasites appear to be rare its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern although numbers in north america have declined sharply in recent decades despite international legislation protecting common tern in some areas populations are threatened by habitat loss pollution or disturbance of breeding colonies thumbnail twisted head taxonomy terns are small to medium sized seabirds closely related to gulls skimmers and skuas they are gull like in appearance but typically have a lighter build long pointed wings which give them a fast buoyant flight a deeply forked tail slender legs and webbed feet ort 1995 p 78 most species are grey above and white below and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in non breeding season snow perrin 1998 p 764 common tern s closest relatives appear to be antarctic tern followed by eurasian arctic and roseate terns genetic evidence suggests that common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives no fossils are known from north america and those claimed in europe are of uncertain age and species common tern was first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name sterna hirundo word stearn was used in old english and a similar word was used by frisians for tern library subscription required stearn appears in poem seafarer written around 1000 ad linnaeus adopted this word for genus name sterna latin for swallow is hirundo and refers here to tern s superficial likeness to that unrelated bird which has a similar light build and long forked tail hume 1993 pp 12 13 this resemblance also leads to informal name sea swallow retrieved 25 january 2012 recorded from at least seventeenth century scots names and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic derived from distinctive call due to difficulty in distinguishing two species all informal common names are shared with arctic tern cocker mabey 2005 pp 246 247 four subspecies of common tern are generally recognized although s h minussensis is sometimes considered to be an

breeding adults have pale grey upperparts very pale grey underparts a black cap orange red legs and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip or all black depending on subspecies hume 1993 pp 21 29 common tern s upperwings are pale grey but as summer wears on dark feather shafts of outer flight feathers become exposed and a grey wedge appears on wings rump and tail are white and on a standing bird long tail extends no further than folded wingtips unlike arctic and roseate terns in which tail protrudes beyond wings there are no significant differences between sexes in non breeding adults forehead and underparts become white bill is all black or black with a red base and legs are dark red or black upperwings have an obvious dark area at front edge of wing carpal bar terns that have not bred successfully may start moulting into non breeding adult plumage from june but late july is more typical with moult suspended during migration there is also some geographical variation californian birds often being in non breeding plumage during migration juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar crown and nape are brown and forehead is ginger wearing to white by autumn upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling and tail lacks adult s long outer feathers birds in their first post juvenile plumage which normally remain in their wintering areas resemble non breeding adult but have a duskier crown dark carpal bar and often very worn plumage by their second year most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead common tern is an agile flyer capable of rapid turns and swoops hovering and vertical take off when commuting with fish it flies close to surface in a strong head wind but above water in a following wind unless migrating normally it stays below and averages in absence of a tail wind its average flight speed during nocturnal migration flight is at a height of moult detail of primary feather 300px thumb juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first october head tail and body plumage is replaced first mostly by february then wing feathers primaries are replaced in stages innermost feathers moult first then replacement is suspended during southern winter birds of this age staying in their wintering areas and in autumn in may to june of second year a similar moult sequence starts with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north but not for those that stay in winter quarters a major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in next february to june between 40 90 of feathers being replaced old primary feathers wear away to reveal blackish barbs beneath moult pattern means that oldest feathers are those nearest middle of wing so as northern summer progresses a dark wedge appears on wing due to this feather ageing process terns are unusual in frequency in which they moult their primaries which are replaced at least twice occasionally three times in a year visible difference in feather age is accentuated in greater ultraviolet reflectance of new primaries and freshness of wing feathers is used by females in mate selection experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their fitness through quality of their wing feathers rarely a very early moult at nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure both onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of hormone prolactin similar species this arctic tern shows all red bill greyer underparts translucent flight feathers and narrow black border to wings which separate it from common tern thumb there are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to common tern a traditionally difficult species to separate is arctic tern and until key characteristics were clarified distant or flying birds of two species were often jointly recorded as terns although similar in size two terns differ in structure and flight common tern has a larger head thicker neck longer legs and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative and has a more powerful direct flight arctic tern has greyer underparts than common which make its white cheeks more obvious whereas rump of common tern can be greyish in non breeding plumage compared to white of its relative common tern develops a dark wedge on wings as breeding season progresses but wings of arctic stay white throughout northern summer all flight feathers of arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky only four innermost wing feathers of common tern share this property trailing edge of outer flight feathers is a thin black line in arctic tern but thicker and less defined in common bill of an adult common tern is orange red with a black tip except in black billed s h longipennis and its legs are bright red while both features are a darker red colour in arctic tern which also lacks black bill tip in breeding areas roseate

antarctic tern of southern oceans south american tern australasian white fronted tern and white cheeked tern of indian ocean identification may be aided by plumage differences due to opposite breeding seasons antarctic tern is more sturdy than common with a heavier bill in breeding condition its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe in non breeding plumages it lacks or has only an indistinct carpal bar and young birds show dark bars on tertials obvious on closed wing and in flight enticott tipling 2002 p 196 sinclair et al 2002 p 212 south american tern is larger

breeding plumage is paler below than common with white underwings white cheeked tern is smaller has uniform grey upperparts and in breeding is darker above with whiter cheeks grimmett et al 1999 pp 140 141 juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar aged birds of related species they show extensive ginger colouration to back and have a pale base to bill young arctic terns have a grey back and black bill and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped saddle et al 1990 pp 133 138 hybrids between common and roseate terns have been recorded particularly from us and intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall such birds may have more extensive black on bill but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on exact details of individual flight feathers voice common tern has a wide repertoire of calls which have a lower pitch than equivalent calls of arctic terns most distinctive sound is alarm kee yah stressed on first syllable in contrast to second syllable stress of arctic tern alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders although serious threats evoke a kyar given as a tern takes flight and quietens usually noisy colony while its residents assess danger a down slurred keeur is given when an adult is approaching nest while carrying a fish and is possibly used for individual recognition chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call another common call is a kip uttered during social contact other vocalizations include a when attacking intruders and a staccato kek kek kek from fighting males hume 1993 pp 68 75 parents and chicks can locate one another by call and siblings also recognise each other s vocalisations from about twelfth day from hatching which helps to keep brood together distribution and habitat thumb non breeding adult in australia most populations of common tern are strongly migratory wintering south of their temperate and subarctic northern hemisphere breeding ranges first summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters although a few return to breeding colonies some time after arrival of adults in north america common tern breeds along atlantic coast from labrador to north carolina and inland throughout much of canada east of rocky mountains in united states some breeding populations can also be found in states bordering great lakes and locally on gulf coast there are small only partially migratory colonies in caribbean these are in bahamas and cuba raffaele et al 2003 p 292 and off venezuela in los roques

over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives nesting from taiga of asia to tropical shores hume 1993 pp 30 37 and at altitudes up to in armenia and in asia it avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind and also icy waters so it does not breed as far north as arctic tern common tern breeds close to freshwater or sea on almost any open flat habitat including sand or shingle beaches firm dune areas salt marsh or most commonly islands flat grassland or heath or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment in mixed colonies common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than arctic terns but avoid even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns relevant factor here is different leg lengths of three species common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts and may even nest on flat factory roofs unusual nest sites include hay bales a stump above water and floating logs or vegetation there is a record of a common tern taking over a spotted sandpiper nest and laying its eggs with those of wader outside breeding season all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas and somewhere to land in addition to natural beaches and rocks boats buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night time roosts behaviour territory three eggs in a nest on great gull island thumb thumb a chick on

sea in best 1984 p 362 colonies inland tend to be smaller than on coast common terns often nest alongside other coastal species such as arctic roseate and sandwich terns black headed gulls and black skimmers especially in early part of breeding season for no known reason most or all of terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea this phenomenon is called a dread thumb this autumn juvenile in massachusetts has a white forehead having lost ginger colouration characteristic of younger birds on their return to breeding sites terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory and actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish terns defend only a small area with distances between nests sometimes being as little as although is more typical as with many birds same site is re used year after year with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons around 90 of experienced birds reuse their former territory so young birds must nest on periphery find a bereaved mate or move to another colony hume 1993 pp 86 90 a male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in spring and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late in which case pair may separate defence of territory is mainly by male who repels intruders of either sex he gives an alarm call opens his wings raises his tail and bows his head to show black cap if intruder persists male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until intruder submits by raising its head to expose throat aerial trespassers are simply attacked sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight despite aggression shown to adults wandering chicks are usually tolerated whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed nest is defended until chicks have fledged and all adults in colony will collectively repel potential predators breeding pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to or more calling all while before two birds descend together in zigzag glides if male is carrying a fish he may attract attention of other males too on ground male courts female by circling her with his tail and neck raised head pointing down and wings partially open if she responds they may both adopt a posture with head pointed skywards male may tease a female with fish not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently hume 1993 pp 91 99 once courtship is complete male makes a shallow depression in sand and female scratches in same place several trials may take place until pair settle on a site for actual nest eggs may be laid on bare sand gravel or soil but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available or nest may be rimmed with seaweed stones or shells saucer shaped scrape is typically deep and across but may extend to as much as wide including surrounding decorative material hume 1993 pp 100 111 breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass which encourage terns to nest in higher less vulnerable areas since many prefer mats to bare sand common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or arctic terns although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation lloyd et al 2010 p 207 bent 1921 p 252 thumb hovering and screaming to deter intruders on great gull island left thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried even if nest material is removed and sand smoothed over they will find a nest placed from its original site or even further if it is moved in several stages eggs are accepted if reshaped with plasticine or coloured yellow but not red or blue this ability to locate eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable wind blown and tidal environment peak time for egg production is early may with some birds particularly first time breeders laying later in month or in june clutch size is normally three eggs larger clutches probably result from two females laying in same nest egg size averages although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than first laid average egg weight is of which 5 is shell retrieved 9 february 2012 egg weight depends on how well fed female is as well as on its position in clutch eggs are cream buff or pale brown marked with streaks spots or blotches of black brown or grey which help to camouflage them incubation is by both sexes although more often by female and lasts 21 22 days extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at colony which cause adults to leave eggs unattended nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days on hot days incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to eggs thus affording eggs some cooling except when colony suffers disaster 90 of eggs hatch precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings and like eggs is similar to equivalent stage of arctic tern hume pearson 1993 pp 121 124 chicks fledge in 22 28 days usually 25 26 fledged juveniles are fed at nest for about five days and then accompany adults on fishing expeditions young birds may receive supplementary feeds from parents until end of breeding season and beyond common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in wintering grounds at least until adults move further south in about december hume 1993 pp 120 123 thumb left like many terns this species is very defensive of its nest and young and will harass humans dogs muskrats and most diurnal birds but unlike more aggressive arctic tern it rarely hits intruder usually swerving off at last moment adults can discriminate between individual humans attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks colonies can be wiped out by rats and adults desert colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present common terns usually breed once a year second clutches are possible if first is lost rarely a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from first clutch are still being fed first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age sometimes at three years average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in event of colony being flooded to over 2 5 in a good year in north america productivity was between 1 0 and 2 0 on islands but less than 1 0 at coastal and inland sites birds become more successful at raising chicks with age this continues throughout their breeding lives but biggest increase is in first five years maximum documented lifespan in wild is 23 years in north america and 33 years in europe retrieved 11 february 2012 retrieved 11 february 2012 but 12 years is a more typical lifespan food and

vertically fisher lockley 1989 pp 252 260 it may circle or hover before diving and then plunges directly into water whereas arctic tern favours a stepped hover technique beaman et al 1998 p 440 and roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height and submerges for longer common tern typically forages up to away from breeding colony sometimes as far as it will follow schools of fish and its west african migration route is affected by location of huge shoals of sardines off coast of ghana it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins waiting for their prey to be driven to sea s surface terns often feed in flocks especially if food is plentiful and fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one third higher than for individuals terns have red oil droplets in cone cells of retinas of their eyes this improves contrast and sharpens distance vision especially in hazy conditions sinclair 1985 pp 93 95 birds that have to see through an air water interface such as terns and gulls have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in cone oil drops than other avian species varela f j palacios a g goldsmith t m 1993 vision brain and behavior in birds in zeigler

larger prey than those with smaller broods stephens et al 2007 p 295 proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95 in some areas but invertebrate prey may form a significant part of diet elsewhere this may include worms leeches molluscs such as small squid and crustaceans prawns shrimp and mole crabs in freshwater areas large insects may be caught such as beetles cockchafers and moths adult insects may be caught in air and larvae picked from ground or from water surface prey is caught in bill and either swallowed head first or carried back to chicks occasionally two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously when adults take food back to nest they recognise their young by call rather than visual identification common tern may attempt to steal fish from arctic terns but might itself be harassed by kleptoparasitic skuas laughing gulls roseate terns or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest in one study two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods terns normally drink in flight usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater if both are available chicks do not drink before fledging reabsorbing water and like adults excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland 2009 p 317 fish bones and hard exoskeletons of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as pellets adults fly off nest to defecate and even small chicks walk a short distance from scrape to deposit their faeces adults attacking animals or humans will often defecate as they dive often successfully fouling

where it has been introduced hume 1993 pp 112 119 red fox can also be a local problem because common terns nest on islands most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals ruddy turnstone will take eggs from unattended nests and gulls may take chicks great horned owls and short eared owls will kill both adults and chicks and black crowned night herons will also eat small chicks retrieved 25 january 2012 subscription needed for full text merlins and peregrine falcons may attack flying terns as with other birds it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is

stable numbers in north america have fallen by more than 70 in last 40 years and there is an overall negative trend in global estimates for this species threats come from habitat loss through building pollution or vegetation growth or disturbance of breeding birds by humans vehicles boats or dogs local natural flooding may lead to nest losses and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls gulls also compete with terns for nest sites some birds are hunted in caribbean for commercial sale as food breeding success may be enhanced by use of floating nest rafts man made islands or other artificial nest sites and by preventing human disturbance overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear ground and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs resulted in enhanced levels of in male embryos which seemed to disappear prior to fledging with no effect on colony productivity but dde which results
