government provided them no weapons and no means of transportation harrison and klotter p 93 james taylor jr then serving as quartermaster general of state militia took out a 6 000 mortgage on his personal land to purchase boats to transport adair s men number of men with adair was later disputed sources variously give numbers between 700 and 1 500 harrison and klotter p 94 many did not have weapons and ones who did were primarily armed with their own civilian rifles niles weekly register february 4 1815 vol 7 p 361 it appears that steam boat enterprize and a keel boat passed louisville ky about 28th of december with arms and various stores for new orleans and we fear it is so that gen adair s men are without arms however jackson s fertile genius make them useful or perhaps partially supply them john thomas to whom adair was an adjunct fell ill just before battle commenced leaving adair responsible for all kentuckians present at battle gillig p 185 on january 7 1815 adair traveled to new orleans and requested that city s leaders lend him several stands of arms from city armory to arm his militiamen smith p 73 officials agreed under condition that removal of arms from armory be kept secret from citizenry weapons were placed in boxes and delivered to adair s camp on night of january 7 smith p 74 at adair s suggestion his men were placed in reserve and located centrally behind tennessee militiamen under william carroll from there they could quickly move to reinforce whichever portion of american line received heaviest attack from british apparently unaware of adair s request that evening jackson ordered 400 unarmed kentucky militiamen under colonel john davis to march to new orleans to obtain arms then reinforce 450 louisiana militiamen under david b morgan on west bank of mississippi river gillig p 182 when they arrived in new orleans they were told that city s arms had already been shipped to adair smith p 98 citizens collected what weapons they had mostly old muskets in various states of disrepair and gave them to davis men about 200 men were thus armed and reported to morgan as ordered just hours before start of battle of new orleans remainder of davis s men returned to main camp still without weapons as british approached on morning of january 8 it became evident that they would try to break american line through carroll s tennesseans and adair advanced his men to support them smith p 77 main american line held and repulsed british attack in total only six americans were killed and seven wounded gillig p 178 meanwhile davis kentuckians on west bank had upon their arrival in morgan s camp been sent to meet advance of a secondary british force outnumbered poorly armed and without benefit of breastworks or artillery support they were quickly outflanked and forced to retreat seeing retreat of kentuckians morgan s militiamen abandoned their breastworks adair would later claim they had never even fired a shot british quickly abandoned position they had just captured but jackson resented setback in an otherwise spectacular victory controversy with andrew jackson jackson s official report blamed kentuckians retreat for collapse of west bank defenses and many kentuckians felt it played down importance of adair s militiamen on east bank in preserving american line and securing victory smith p p 179 davis men insisted report was based on jackson s misunderstanding of facts and asked that adair request a court of inquiry which convened in february 1815 with major general carroll of tennessee presiding smith p p 184 court s report found that t he retreat of kentucky militia which considering their position deficiency of their arms and other causes may be excusable and that formation of troops on west bank was exceptional noting that 500 louisiana troops supported by three artillery pieces and protected by a strong breastwork were charged with defending a line that stretched only while davis s 170 kentuckians poorly armed and protected only by a small ditch were expected to defend a line over long smith pp 109 110 on february 10 1816 kentucky general assembly passed a resolution thanking adair for his service at battle of new orleans and for his defense of soldiers accused by jackson young p 126 thumb left upright alt a man with graying wavy hair wearing a high collared black military jacket with gold and buttons andrew jackson and adair engaged in a public dispute over conduct of kentucky militiamen at battle of new orleans jackson approved court s findings but they were not full refutation of jackson s report that many kentuckians including adair had wanted in a letter that was quickly made public adair formerly one of jackson s close friends insisted that jackson withdraw or modify his official report but jackson refused smith pp 111 112 this ended matter until june 1815 when h p helm secretary to john thomas forwarded to a frankfort newspaper remarks from general that had been annexed to official report remarks stated that general was now convinced that initial reports of cowardice by davis s men had been misrepresented and that their retreat had been not only excusable but absolutely justifiable remarks popularly believed to be from jackson in response to adair s letter were subsequently reprinted across kentucky general referenced was in fact general john thomas jackson had never seen them helm claimed he sent a subsequent correction to newspaper that published remarks but it was never printed jackson did not discover remarks until they were published again in january 1817 in response to a boston newspaper s criticism of kentucky militiamen gillig p 186 he wrote to kentucky reporter at that time denouncing remarks as a forgery reporter investigated and published an explanation of how thomas s remarks had been attributed to jackson they did not reprint jackson s letter because they felt his claim that remarks had been intentionally forged a charge which was now found to be false was too inflammatory editors promised that if their retraction did not satisfy jackson they would fully publish any of his additional remarks on subject in jackson s april 1817 response he implied that adair had intentionally misrepresented remarks and reasserted that they had been forged possibly by adair himself gillig pp 187 188 adair believed jackson s references to remarks as a forged dish dressed in true spanish style was a thinly veiled reference to adair s alleged participation in burr conspiracy gillig p 191 as ostensible proof that he was not predisposed against kentuckians jackson also implied that he had not reported additional dishonorable behavior by kentucky militiamen during battle gillig p 189 this letter thrust dispute into national spotlight and prompted adair to resume correspondence with him both to defend davis s men and refute jackson s charges of conspiracy gillig p 190 in his may 1817 response he reasserted his defense of kentucky militiamen at new orleans and dismissed many of jackson s allegations as unimportant and untrue gillig pp 191 192 he flatly denied existence of a conspiracy and chastised jackson for making charges without supporting evidence gillig p 192 responding to jackson s allusion to spain adair recalled that jackson had also been implicated with burr unable to provide tangible evidence of adair s alleged misdeeds jackson provided indirect evidence that a conspiracy was possible gillig pp 192 193 his response delayed by his treaty negotiations with cherokee was printed september 3 1817 and used complicated calculations based on spacing and distance to argue that adair had only half number of men he claimed to have commanded at battle of new orleans further he claimed that adair had ordered davis to new orleans to obtain weapons knowing that arms had already been taken by other brigades under adair s command gillig p 194 either adair had given a foolish order or he did not have as many men in his main force as he claimed he closed by promising that this would be his last statement on matter gillig p 195 adair s october 29 1817 response was delayed he said because he was awaiting documents from new orleans that never came in it he quoted from a letter to jackson s aide de camp cited by jackson himself in previous correspondence showing that jackson had been made aware of both existence and authorship of thomas s remarks in 1815 but declined opportunity to refute them gillig p 196 he also defended his account of number of troops under his command which he had consistently reported as being near 1 000 and asked why jackson had not challenged it until now finally he claimed that not only did he retrieve weapons from new orleans under jackson s orders but he rode jackson s horse to new orleans to effect transaction gillig p 197 tradition holds that this letter prompted either adair or jackson to challenge other to a duel but friends of both men averted conflict after assembling to watch no written evidence of event exists gillig p zachariah frederick smith gives a detailed account of this tradition that he claims was told to him by a descendant of adair s cousin see smith pp 113 114 tensions between two eventually eased and adair came to comfort jackson after his wife rachel s death in 1828 gillig p 201 adair also campaigned for jackson during his presidential campaigns in 1824 1828 and 1832 jackson s opponents compiled copies of his letters into campaign pamphlets to use against him in kentucky during these elections governor of kentucky thumb right upright alt a man with receding red curly hair wearing a white shirt and tie and black jacket joseph desha one of adair s opponents in gubernatorial election of 1820 adair s participation in war of 1812 and subsequent correspondence with jackson restored his reputation he continued to serve as adjutant general until 1817 when voters returned him to state house of representatives he was nominated for speaker of house during that term and although he was not elected he drew support from members of both parties largely because of his correspondence with jackson gillig p 180 in aftermath of panic of 1819 first major financial crisis in united states history primary political issue of day was debt relief doutrich p 15 federal government had created second bank of united states in 1817 and its strict credit policy hit kentucky s large debtor class hard sitting governor gabriel slaughter had lobbied for some measures favored by state s debtors particularly punitive taxes against branches of bank of united states in louisville and lexington doutrich p 14 second party system had not yet developed but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around debt relief issue doutrich p 23 first primarily composed of land speculators who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to financial crisis was dubbed relief party or faction and favored more legislation favorable to debtors opposed to them was anti relief party it was composed primarily of state s aristocracy many of whom were creditors to land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from government they claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong economic depression adair was clear leader of relief faction and his popularity had been enhanced thanks to his lengthy and public dispute with jackson in 1820 gubernatorial election he was elected as kentucky s chief executive over three fellow democratic republicans harrison and klotter p 110 adair garnered 20 493 votes u s senator william logan finished second with 19 497 fellow veteran joseph desha received 12 419 and colonel anthony butler mustered only 9 567 votes young p 127 proponents of debt relief measures also won majorities in both houses of general assembly debt relief kentucky historian lowell h harrison opined that most important measure implemented during adair s administration was creation of bank of commonwealth in 1820 bank made generous loans and liberally issued paper money although bank notes issued by bank of commonwealth quickly fell well below par creditors who refused to accept these devalued notes had to wait two years before seeking replevin to inspire confidence in devalued notes adair mandated that all officers of state receive their salaries in notes issued by bank of commonwealth stickles p 72 state s other bank bank of kentucky adhered to more conservative banking practices while this held value of its notes closer to par it also rendered loans less available which angered relief minded legislators consequently they revoked bank s charter in december 1822 adair oversaw abolition of practice of incarceration for debt and sanctioned rigorous anti gambling legislation kentucky governor john adair national governors association legislators also exempted from forced sale items then considered necessary for making a living a horse a plow a hoe and an ax kentucky court of appeals then state s court of last resort struck down law ordering a two year stay of replevin because it impaired obligation of contracts at about same time u s supreme court issued its decision in case of green v biddle holding that land claims granted by virginia in district of kentucky before kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by state of kentucky if two were in conflict stickles pp 44 45 adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to legislature warning against federal and judicial interference in will of people expressed through legislature stickles p 34 emboldened by adair s message relief partisans sought to remove three justices of state court of appeals as well as james clark a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling from bench judges were spared when their opponents failed to obtain two thirds majority required for removal other matters of adair s term adair urged legislators to create a public school system in response general assembly passed an act creating a state literary fund which received half of clear profits accrued by bank of commonwealth harrison and klotter p 149 fund was to be available proportionally to each of state s counties for establishment of a system of general education ellis p 16 in tumultuous economic environment however legislators routinely voted to borrow from literary fund to pay for other priorities chiefly

legislature in december 1822 was lauded by such luminaries as john adams thomas jefferson and james madison authored by committee member amos kendall it criticized idea of land grant academies then prevalent in state as unworkable outside affluent towns ellis p 17 it also concluded that literary fund alone was insufficient for funding a system of common schools report recommended that funds only be made available to counties that imposed a county tax for benefit of public school system legislators largely ignored report a decision kentucky historian thomas d clark called one of most egregious blunders in american educational history adair s endorsement of missouri compromise was instrumental in securing its passage by kentucky legislators he advocated prison reform and better treatment of insane he also oversaw enactment of a plan for internal improvements including improved navigation on ohio river later life barred from seeking immediate re election by state constitution adair retired to his farm in mercer county at expiration of his term as governor shortly after returning to private life he began to complain about low value of bank of commonwealth notes then worth about half par and petitioned legislature to remedy situation complaint of a former relief party governor over ill effects of pro relief legislation prompted wry celebration among members of anti relief faction adair made one final contribution to public when he was elected to u s house of representatives as a jackson democrat in 1831 during 22nd congress he served on committee on military affairs smith p 170 during his term he made only one speech and it was so inaudible that no one knew what position he was advocating house reporter speculated that it concerned mounting federal troops on horseback he did not run for re election in 1833 and left public life for good death and legacy he died at home in harrodsburg on may 19 1840 and was buried on grounds of his estate white hall in 1872
