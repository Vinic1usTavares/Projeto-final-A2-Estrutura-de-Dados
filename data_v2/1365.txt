which was first used sparingly with ford model n r and s was used extensively with model t company revealed plans for model t to its dealers on march 19 1908 during july 1908 a few months before model t s introduction a group of piquette avenue plant employees experimented with concept of using a moving assembly line to make cars where chassis would be moved to workers for components to be installed this effort was led by charles e sorensen assistant to peter e martin who was factory s superintendent sorensen believed that a moving assembly line would make car assembly faster simpler and easier experiments consisted of tying a rope to a model n chassis and pulling it across factory s third floor on skids until its axles and wheels were added chassis would then be rolled across floor in notches where specific components would be attached at least one model n was completed at piquette avenue plant using this process although henry ford encouraged these experiments he did not implement a formal moving assembly line at piquette avenue plant as all of his attention was focused on getting model t production started on time despite not having a moving assembly line piquette avenue plant aided by usage of interchangeable parts and other production improvements produced 101 completed cars in a single day on june 4 1908 an auto industry record at time first production model
