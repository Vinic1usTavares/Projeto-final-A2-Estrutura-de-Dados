historical activities at site named in 1827 by james stirling it was popular among public for its variety of recreational activities and its facilities such as tea rooms a bathing house and a tavern through a series of events point suffered a drop in patronage from late 19th century to world war ii at that time it was rehabilitated from a state of disrepair and an army camp was built on premises

part of whadjuk they knew area as dyoondalup meaning in noongar language place of long flowing white hair or place of white sand it was traditionally an area for women and children but also served as a meeting point when clan wanted to move to another part of river women at point walter would meet with men swimming across from mosman park to sandbar this function of sandbar for river crossings was a key feature of site mosman park also a place for women and children contained a rock believed to impregnate a woman within a few weeks of her touching it to cross river as a group they would cut down a tree and children would float across river on log with adults swimming alongside them aboriginals would often practise controlled burning at site keeping understory low and flushing out game during summer months site was a source of food and resources through its large variety of flora and fauna fishing was common and fishing traps were used extensively usage of local flora included making string from native wisteria and gum from marri corymbia calophylla early history during his survey along swan river of suitable spots for settlement james stirling named point walter after walter stirling walter s relationship to james is disputed with some sources claiming walter was james uncle with others claiming he was his brother in 1830 land was acquired by settlers lionel lukin and alfred waylen waylen developed land by building a villa in 1830 which later burnt down in 1831 his land was extended by to include part of his namesake suburb alfred cove settlers were involved in skirmishes with local beeliar people waylen s house was burnt down in 1833 and one of waylen s labourers was speared to death after another labourer killed an aboriginal for stealing potatoes this coupled with infertile soils saw these early settlers departing waylen left for a land grant on preston river before returning two years later to establish a more successful property during his time at point walter waylen constructed an inn known as halfway house due to its location between perth and fremantle in 1837 he cut a canal through sandbar reducing distance of a boat trip between perth and fremantle by about and charged a toll for its use in 1843 samuel and his family settled at point walter and took over running halfway house having emigrated to australia previous year caporns moved away from point walter in mid 1850s because canal was silted up site became popular after cutting of canal and was often used for crabbing camping swimming and picnicking only way to access point was by boat so a jetty was built point walter s popularity led to construction of two tea rooms and a timber bathing house to deal with ferries and yachting parties later a limestone road was built allowing access by horse drawn carriages sources differ but in either 1895 or 1907 state government purchased land declaring it a class a reserve and in 1912 melville roads board now melville city council was appointed to manage it reserve officially opened on 30 november 1914 thumb point walter foreshore decline canal at point walter continuously silted up and difficulty of upkeep led to caporns departing site after caporns had left area local authorities did not engage in upkeep and canal fell into further disrepair steamers on swan river stopped using sandbar s narrow and shallow canal instead travelling full distance around it by 1860s canal was unused a campaign by businessman george randell then controller of river traffic due to his ownership of a steamboat service attempted to reopen canal but due to cost of ps2 000 it was not completed lack of steamer traffic caused a drop in popularity for tea rooms and with drop in patronage from introduction of fremantle perth railway on 1 march 1881 point walter became a quiet backwater in january 1923 to secure funding for point walter memorial avenue a three day carnival was held at point walter by this time melville roads board was receiving ps100 a year for grounds maintenance which was proving inadequate to keep grounds in order a further decline in use was due to increased use of ocean beaches by public as a result control of site was passed to parks and gardens board in 1929 in 1914 a tramway was constructed between canning road and point walter which was not considered a success as it rarely ran at a profit outside summer months despite this line was not closed down until 1939 further troubles came from depression of 1930s during which another drop in recreational use was experienced world war ii further decreased patronage and point walter fell into a state of disrepair world war ii to modern day in 1941 melville army camp was constructed on land and was used for training soldiers for waterborne warfare in 1947 camp was converted to a migrant reception centre which was operated until 1969 by state government and from 1969 until closure in mid 1971 by commonwealth hostels during time migrant reception centre was open public opinion was that majority of migrants were communists a situation that culminated in a 1950 piece in west australian addressing issue and refuting perception state of disrepair continued until november 1952 when reserve was again put in hands of melville roads board which made several alterations to site including removal of all old buildings and addition of new changing rooms toilet facilities and a kiosk board also transported of clean sand to point walter beach to rectify erosion problems including exposure of many limestone boulders in point walter s shallows in 1972 there were hopes that a bridge would be constructed between point walter and point resolution but prohibitive costs and other problems meant that these hopes did not come to anything post 1972 facilities were used by department of education to house graylands teachers college in 1980 control of of land that had previously been used for army training purposes was handed over to department of sport and recreation dsr in 1986 dsr removed all remaining hostel buildings and spent a considerable sum developing sport and recreational facilities seen today official reopening occurring on 26 september 1986 facilities first patrons were members of yacht club costa italian syndicate that participated in fremantle hosted 1987 america s cup in 2005
