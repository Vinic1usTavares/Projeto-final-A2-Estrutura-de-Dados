lutheran liturgical calendar is a listing which details primary annual festivals and events that are celebrated by various lutheran churches calendars of evangelical lutheran church in america elca and evangelical lutheran church in canada are from 1978 lutheran book of worship and calendar of lutheran church missouri synod lcms and lutheran church canada use lutheran book of worship and 1982 lutheran worship elements unique to elca have been updated from lutheran book of worship to reflect changes resulting from publication of evangelical lutheran worship in 2006 elements of calendar unique to lcms have also been updated from lutheran worship and lutheran book of worship to reflect 2006 publication of lutheran service book basic element to calendar is sunday which is a festival of jesus resurrection however christian churches have historically observed other festivals which commemorate events in life of jesus or of significant individuals in history of church purpose of liturgical calendar is to guide commemorations as a part of daily worship of lutheran church there is some variation associated with observance of calendar as each lutheran church creates its own calendar and each congregation must choose independently how many individuals will be commemorated within a given year and how many festivals and lesser festivals they will publicly celebrate especially if they do not coincide with a sunday structure 650px thumb lutheran church year and temperate seasons of earth s northern hemisphere lutheran calendar operates on two different cycles temporal cycle and sanctoral cycle temporal cycle pivots on festivals of christmas and easter all sundays seasons and festivals are related to these festivals phillip pfatteicher festivals and commemorations p 11 because easter varies in date each year based on vernal equinox and phases of moon it is called a moveable feast see computus dates affected by placement of easter include ash wednesday and start of lent start of easter itself pentecost and holy trinity phillip pfatteicher lutheran book of worship manual on liturgy p 22 advent other pivotal season on calendar comes exactly four sundays before start of christmas if christmas falls on a sunday that day does not count or sunday closest to st andrew s day november 30 like other western church calendars first sunday of advent is also first day of liturgical year pfatteicher lutheran book of worship manual on liturgy p 22 sanctoral cycle is fixed daily commemorations of individuals and events not related to temporal cycle of sundays festivals and seasons pfatteicher festivals and commemorations p 11 it is sanctoral cycle which is sometimes thought of as being calendar of saints of a church beyond their place in temporal or sanctoral cycles events commemorated on lutheran liturgical calendar fall into one of three different categories depending upon their liturgical priority festivals lesser festivals and commemorations festivals festivals are nativity epiphany baptism of our lord transfiguration annunciation palm sunday easter ascension pentecost holy trinity all saints and christ king evangelical lutheran worship p 3 and lutheran service book p xi most of these festivals are tied to moveable feast of easter festivals take precedence over all other days including sundays have their own collects and eucharistic proper prefaces of festivals christmas is considered to be twelve days in length from december 25 until january 5 and easter is fifty days in length from easter sunday up to and inclusive of pentecost phillip pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 498 for easter sundays are considered to be another part of festival for ascension which falling on fortieth day of easter will always be on a thursday festival is sometimes transferred to seventh sunday of easter in addition to or in place of normal part of easter festival for that day evangelical lutheran worship p 23 there is another type of day which while not a festival is considered to be equal with a festival these days called days of special devotion are ash wednesday and all days of holy week especially good friday pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 498 these particular days like other festivals automatically take precedence over any event on calendar and sometimes even over other festivals a good example of this would be in 2005 when good friday and annunciation fell on same day march 25 annunciation was transferred to march 28 or second day of easter to make room for good friday philip pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 132 principle of church of sweden is that annunciation is celebrated on sunday between 21 27 march although should good friday or any other day of holy week or easter sunday or monday respectively fall on 25 march annunciation is moved to sunday before palm sunday for instance in 2003 annunciation was celebrated on 13 march 2008 when easter sunday was 23 march it was celebrated on 9th one unique feature of elca calendar is that it has given congregations options of two dates for transfiguration following most other western churches elca moved transfiguration from its august 6 date to last sunday after epiphany sunday immediately preceding ash wednesday as an option to traditional last sunday after epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of transfiguration within congregations however traditional date of august 6 was left on calendar congregations were given option of observing transfiguration on last sunday after epiphany and august 6 thus leaving open possibility that transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year philip pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 133 in sweden transfiguration day is celebrated on seventh sunday after trinity sunday which is eighth sunday after pentecost lesser festivals left thumb altar book editions of lutheran book of worship green and evangelical lutheran worship these are days which are associated with life of christ or apostles and deserve attention in their own right lesser festivals do not have priority over festivals and technically do not have precedence over ordinary sundays however lutheran book of worship does permit celebration of a lesser festival on sundays where normal color of day would be green that is seasons after epiphany or after pentecost or on sundays in christmas lutheran book of worship minister s desk edition 21 this is abrogated for patronal festivals that is day commemorating saint or event for which a congregation is named provided that they do not take place in lent advent or easter in which case they must also be transferred to next convenient weekday most lesser festivals have their own collects and a few such as all saints have their own proper commemorations commemorations are for individuals or events which have been noteworthy in life of church and in history of lutheranism in particular pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 22 these days do not take precedence over any other festival day and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank commemoration is generally transferred to next open weekday if a commemoration falls on a sunday where color of day is green collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before daily collect prayer of day or in place of it for example if september 13 fell on a sunday and there was a desire to commemorate st john chrysostom pastor would recite common of theologians and then prayer of day or common of theologians on its own person may also be mentioned by name in prayers of faithful in addition to recitation of applicable collect finally their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to day s lessons in some way in cases of conflict between commemorations for example november 11 with st martin of tours and soren kierkegaard there is no order of precedence and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration if any to highlight in some cases several individuals are listed together june 14 with st basil great st gregory theologian and st gregory of nyssa because of their close association with each other and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly not as a choice between one or other pfatteicher festivals and commemorations p 20 schedule of commemorations within elca has been specifically designed so that there is at least one person on calendar from each century so as to emphasize continuity of christian tradition pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 19 clearly some centuries have more commemorations than others largest number of persons commemorated being in first four centuries of christian history and immediately following reformation this leaves space from 5th to 15th centuries and 16th to 20th centuries rather sparse nevertheless it is an improvement over some calendars wherein only a very few persons all from patristic or reformation periods were commemorated phillip pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 22 c liturgical colors left thumb a lutheran pastor celebrating eucharist during easter season service books of lutheran churches designate specific colors for events which are listed on liturgical calendars and seasons which are a part of temporal cycle this color is sometimes known as color of day lutheran church generally follows color scheme which is used by other churches in western christianity since lutheranism has historically been linked with roman catholic church color of day dictates color of vestments for all ministers and color of paraments white is color designated for festivals of christ with gold sometimes offered as an alternative for first days of easter festivals for which white is color of day include christmas all twelve days epiphany baptism of our lord first sunday after epiphany transfiguration last sunday after epiphany and or august 6 easter all days except pentecost holy trinity christ king white is also used as color for anyone commemorated on calendar who was not martyred and is color appointed for funerals regardless of whatever color of day might otherwise be purple is commonly used for season of lent it is also optional for use during advent though blue is preferred color for this season because of its hopeful connotations rather than penitential character implied by purple and its association with lent red is used for commemorations of martyrs and is used on day of pentecost scarlet is also used for holy week though purple is also allowed black with purple as an alternative may be used on ash wednesday only day which does not have a color is good friday when all paraments are traditionally removed from church color for holy saturday is white or gold since it is day when great vigil of easter is celebrated though until vigil church would remain void of paraments historical development liturgical calendars began to be developed in christianity around fourth century with church calendar as it is known today coming into full development in period of medieval sacramentaries frank c senn christian worship p 188 while sunday had long been established in weekly calendar festivals such as easter and christmas were also a fixed part of calendar by this time ninth century also saw inclusion of numerous saints in calendar a practice already begun by second century even to point that normal sunday were taking place over those normally appointed for sunday senn christian worship p 162 163 188 lutheran calendar owes much to proliferation of commemorations of medieval calendars of western christianity reformation era all of reformers attempted to reduce number of individual commemorations and saint s days though this reduction was sometimes more drastic than others in case of lutheran churches most of saints days were removed with exception of some new testament personages though basic temporal cycle of calendar remained more or less intact pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 11 in some instances a celebration of reformation was added to october 31 first instance being church order prepared by johannes bugenhagen though other churches selected alternative dates including june 25 anniversary of presentation of augsburg confession senn christian worship p 344 commemoration of reformation quickly died out before thirty years war in germany content of liturgical calendar like content of liturgy itself was responsibility of territory in which church was found senn christian worship p 342 thus there was a different order for saxony one for prussia one for hesse and one for wittenberg among others despite their differences calendars and liturgies maintained significant similarities between each other as well as calendar of roman catholic church church year continued to begin with first sunday of advent which was still fixed based on traditional formula and many of festivals surrounding christmas st stephen st john holy innocents remained in place even if they were often ignored epiphany also continued to be celebrated as visit of magi though martin luther preferred to commemorate baptism of christ senn christian worship p 343 brandenburg and and gottingen retained lent and fasting days associated with season they also retained violet or black vestments for penitential season however popular devotions such as blessing of palms or imposition of ashes were suppressed in most church orders senn christian worship p 346 despite fact that a number of them had retained ash wednesday as start of lent good friday while kept with solemnity was often a celebration of holy communion thus less somber than contemporary roman catholic church and while easter had been a common day of communion in church before reformation reformers tried to prevent too many communions on this day and instead urged faithful to receive it on various sundays throughout year reformation also saw development of a new festival connected to easter where second sunday became popularly known as good shepherd sunday based on opening of psalm appointed for day misericordia domini or goodness of lord in addition corpus christi was commonly retained until about 1600 owing to its significant popularity in medieval period while many saints were removed from liturgical calendars by reformers some were nevertheless retained st ansgar was commemorated in halberstadt and with a special thanksgiving service on sunday after 3 february no doubt because of saint s historic connection to area senn christian worship p 345 same was true of elizabeth of thuringia in order and st george was also commemorated in nordlingen festivals of apostles and evangelists were also found on lutheran calendars of era but were not always observed if they fell on a day other than sunday some of marian festivals notably nativity of mary september 8 and her assumption august 15 were retained by luther whereas feasts of her conception and presentation in temple were suppressed because they were judged to have no scriptural or dogmatic interest in scandinavian countries right thumb martin luther commemorated on february lutheran worship minneapolis fortress press 2006 15 when lutheran reformation was brought to sweden from germany via denmark after election of gustav vasa in 1523 movement from start had its own distinct characteristics development of swedish liturgy was in part thanks to petri which is sometimes regarded as his most important work senn christian worship p 404 his swedish mass 1531 remained in use with only slight modifications until twentieth century swedish mass draws from a number of different sources though luther s formulae is apparent in regards to eucharistic christian worship p 407 this included revising calendar along similar lines as those in germany laurentius petri further revised swedish mass 1557 in large part swedish liturgy retained vestments altars and frontals gold and silver chalices and patens and many other popish customs senn christian worship p 415 following laurentius death in 1573 king john iii embarked on a separate though similar religious policy more conciliatory towards catholicism much of his work was in area of liturgy and his nova reinstated much of sanctoral cycle from old swedish mass reviving feasts of st mary magdalene st lawrence corpus christi and assumption and nativity of virgin mary senn christian worship p 419 many of john s reforms were controversial modern era majority of calendars between start of reformation and 20th century were quite minimal in their commemorations most included events such as annunciation or persons such as saint paul these days often went unobserved despite scrupulous attention to temporal cycle even further commemoration of some biblical persons of note including virgin mary were often omitted entirely pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 11 12 during 20th century especially at instigation of liturgical movement familiar saints began make a reemergence onto calendar along with newer names and events calendar in europe many of changes to calendar that had accompanied reformation remained in place during subsequent centuries in saxony in eighteenth century in addition to chief festivals of christmas easter and pentecost a number of festivals were also celebrated with vespers and holy communion including saint stephen saint john circumcision epiphany purification of mary annunciation ascension holy trinity nativity of saint john baptist visitation on july 2 and saint michael on september 29 senn christian worship p 500 when holy communion was celebrated a chasuble was used in color of day though especially at these colors were different from ones normally used today senn christian worship p 500 501 in twentieth century lutherans in europe came under influence of liturgical movement and many lutheran churches adopted new calendars and rubrics similar to roman calendar as revised by vatican ii senn christian worship p 657 658 swedish church also experienced a similar reform of its liturgy and calendar during this same period calendar in north america when lutherans came to north america they brought with them their disparate liturgical traditions pennsylvania composed first liturgy for north america including its calendar along somewhat minimal lines however since last quarter of nineteenth century calendar within north american lutheran churches has been expanding pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 20 in 1868 four chief festivals in church book were christmas new year s day epiphany and reformation day with easter and pentecost being considered a separate category because they invariably fell on sunday church book also included several minor festivals including festivals for all apostles and annunciation common service book 1918 also expanded calendar to help congregations determine which days took priority over others in cases of coincidence it added to calendar sundays of advent transfiguration last sunday after epiphany septuagesima sexagesima quinquagesima ash wednesday sundays in lent all days in holy week ascension and following sunday and holy trinity it also included all saints and saints mark and luke both of which were omitted from church book pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship p 20 21 service book and hymnal 1941 also moved transfiguration to august 6 and added holy innocents to calendar service book and hymnal p 278 previous north american calendar of elca was different from its european counterparts in that it does not give equal weight and sometimes gives no mention to persons who may be commemorated in scandinavian regions one example would be absence of st lucia on december 13 although she enjoys particular popularity in sweden but lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in north america with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days e g st bernard of clairvaux on august 19 in lcms and august 20 in elca or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not other e g martin luther king jr on january 15 for elca and c f w walther on may 7 for lcms with 2006 publication of evangelical lutheran worship elw as a replacement to lutheran book of worship lbw some of these deficiencies in elca calendar have been corrected within elca this far by faith and libro de liturgia y both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to ethnic communities they were intended to be used in african americans and latinos respectively elca worship resources official webpage wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod has a different somewhat minimized calendar when compared lcms and especially elca majority of wels congregations utilize service book and hymnal or christian worship a lutheran hymnal neither of which have extensive calendars of commemorations lcms prayerbook lutheran worship is available through official wels publisher northwestern publishing house which would provide congregations utilizing that prayerbook a larger calendar to select from unlike elca and lcms wels does not maintain an official sanctoral cycle but they do have congregational resources available for full temporal cycle on their website differences from other calendars lutheran calendar is most similar to calendar of episcopal church and thus to anglican calendar of saints though it also bears resemblance to roman calendar of saints because it commemorates many of same individuals however lutheran calendar differs from both in two very significant ways aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to lutheran tradition first lutheran calendar while commemorating many of same events or persons often does so on different days from either calendar st cyprian of carthage on september 16 for lutherans but september 13 in episcopal calendar of saints episcopal church of note cyprian is commemorated on september 16 in roman catholic calendar in other cases such as st valentine on february 14 individuals who have long standing within western christianity are not mentioned in lutheran calendar or are only mentioned in calendars of some lutheran churches cf calendar of saints lutheran where valentine is commemorated by lcms but is not commemorated by elca furthermore some lutheran calendars such as that of lcms still venerate individuals whose commemorations have been suppressed in other western churches finally lutheran calendar commemorates persons or events such as presentation of augsburg confession on june 25 which are not commemorated in any other christian calendar because of their specific importance to lutheran church in general like anglican counterpart lutheran calendar has taken on many of precedents established by post vatican ii reforms of liturgy in roman catholic church other significant difference is that lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts included on calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with church but are not typically thought of as saints in classical sense intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating outstanding among religious pfatteicher festivals and commemorations 18 calendar for elca is similar to many other western calendars in that it does not commemorate any persons from old testament calendars of orthodox churches have old testament individuals and lutheran church missouri synod has done same at one point there was a proposal to include a day on episcopal church calendar which was taken into consideration by inter lutheran commission on worship in developing lutheran book of worship for old testament saints following octave of all saints november 8 but this idea was ultimately rejected as saints in liturgical calendar left thumb scripture does not teach calling on saints or pleading for help from them for it sets before us christ alone as mediator atoning sacrifice high priest and intercessor a c article xxi augsburg confession article 21 of worship of saints trans kolb r wengert t and arand c minneapolis fortress press 2000 there is also no use of title saint for anyone other than biblical persons and even then title is used with a certain degree of exclusivity this is to prevent oddities of convention such as st nicolaus copernicus pfatteicher commentary on lutheran book of worship 22 as well as to underline lutheran emphasis on priesthood of all believers nevertheless individuals who typically have saint affixed to their given name are still referred to as such in common discourse so that francis of assisi would still be called st francis rather than just francis in new testament all christians are referred to as saints however use of saint as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in christianity by time of reformation use of saint was almost exclusively restrictive titular sense pfatteicher festivals and commemorations p 12 one of effects of reformation was to eliminate abuses of cult of saints and as a result it is a common misconception that lutherans do not have or rather do not venerate saints however confessional documents of lutheran church particularly augsburg confession accept both general and particular use of word saints robert kolb and james schaffer book of concord confessions of evangelical lutheran church augsburg confession article xxi in regards to titular sense augsburg confession commends that it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance so that our faith may be strengthened when we see what grace they received and how they were sustained in faith moreover their good works are to be an example for us each of us in his own calling robert kolb and james schaffer book of concord confessions of evangelical lutheran church augsburg confession article xxi article xxi of apology to augsburg confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to saints and acknowledgment that saints pray for church however augsburg confession opposes prayer to saints stating scripture does not teach calling on saints or pleading for help from them for it sets before us christ alone as mediator atoning
