clinical definition of madness title is a reference to folie a deux french for madness of two a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief and sometimes hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another episode s bug antagonist was actually a prosthetic suit worn by a stuntwoman suit was highly ridiculed behind scenes reportedly actor markinson upon seeing costume said this is what s driving me crazy director kim manners too thought costume was ridiculous and sardonically told people that episode would ruin his career gilligan attributed problems due to episodic work schedule he noted we re usually on such a short schedule that there has to be a weak link somewhere gilligan also stated that aspects of suit made it somewhat comical to fix perceived issues with monster production team gave filmed footage to visual effects editor laurie kallsen george who took footage with monster in it erased monster completely took monster to a different screen animated it and added speed blur these effects were time consuming and were only finished day episode aired hurwitz and meisler p 131 in finished episode monster is not clearly visible which allowed scariness of episode to be more real gilligan approved of kallsen george s work saying there s a long noble history to obscuring monster truth is your imagination can be much more effective than real life meisler p 267 locations initially producers wanted to set scenes set at gretchen starns house at a tract home to recall pastel community featured in movies like edward scissorhands 1990 and truman show 1998 gradnitzer and pittson p 179 however when production crew located a suitable tract home it was not nearly as spook y as they were hoping gradnitzer and pittson p 180 and so they ended up shooting most of these scenes in a turn of century house located in north vancouver british columbia special effect rigging was installed on house to allow bug creature to scale wall elaborate sequence in which insect creature crawls across a ceiling was made by erecting an upside down house set on a soundstage stuntwoman portraying bug then crawled across set and footage was flipped in post production scenes featuring an armored car smashing through wall of vinylright were also filmed on a specially constructed soundstage gradnitzer and pittson p 181 reception ratings folie a deux
