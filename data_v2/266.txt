james emory jim boyd july 18 1906 february 18 1998 was an american physicist mathematician and academic administrator he was director of georgia tech research institute from 1957 to 1961 president of west georgia college now university of west georgia from 1961 to 1971 and acting president of georgia institute of technology from 1971 to 1972 stevenson p 4 a graduate of university of georgia and duke university boyd began in academia as a professor of physics at west georgia college he then became a professor at georgia tech and a prominent researcher at engineering experiment station now known as georgia tech research institute at engineering experiment station boyd helped spur organization s mainstay federally funded electronics research and development along with fellow georgia tech researchers gerald rosselot and glen p robinson boyd was influential in founding of scientific atlanta where he was a board member for 25 years as director of engineering experiment station boyd focused on recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to organization including establishment of nuclear research at georgia tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and construction of frank h neely research reactor while he was third president of west georgia college boyd increased faculty degrees programs and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on campus boyd racially integrated campus in 1963 by a court order and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded campus to support increased and future enrollment hired away to serve as university system of georgia s vice chancellor for academic development in 1970 he was almost immediately reassigned to be georgia tech s interim president during his tenure at georgia tech from 1971 to 1972 boyd resolved difficult issues in attempted takeover of engineering experiment station by previous georgia tech president arthur g hansen and poor performance of and corresponding alumni calls to remove head football coach bud carson early career education boyd was born to emory fortson and rosa lee nee wright boyd on july 18 1906 in georgia a small town near eastern border of state of georgia stevenson p 5 he had two brothers john and ellis and a sister sophia in 1927 he received a bachelor of arts in mathematics from university of georgia where he was a member of phi beta kappa honor society in 1928 he received a master of arts in mathematics from duke university from 1928 to 1930 boyd was an instructor of physics at university of georgia he entered graduate school at yale university in 1930 and was a graduate assistant there from 1930 1931 and a loomis fellow from 1931 1933 he received his phd in physics from yale in 1933 with a thesis entitled scattering of x rays by cold worked and by annealed beryllium in his thesis boyd described effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered cold worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes experiment showed that beryllium crystals are rather imperfect that annealing caused no appreciable change in beryllium s lattice structure and that mass absorption coefficient of beryllium found in experiment was reasonably close to theoretical value calculated using compton s empirical formula boyd was appointed as head of mathematics and science department at west georgia college in 1933 in 1935 he joined faculty at georgia institute of technology as an assistant professor of physics boyd married elizabeth reynolds cobb daughter of betty reynolds cobb and hiram felix cobb on june 2 1934 james and elizabeth went on to have two children a daughter betty cobb boyd born august 26 1939 and a son james fortson boyd born october 9 1942 stevenson p 6 with world war ii under way boyd joined united states navy in 1942 serving as a lieutenant and later lieutenant commander in bureau of ordnance performing research on radar from 1945 to 1946 he was a commander in office of chief of naval operations where he worked on radar and electronics researcher and entrepreneur thumb main building of engineering experiment station pictured in 1951 alt a brick building with many windows with a brick street in front of it there is a large tree on right side of image in front of building there are two cars parked next to building one in center and one on left edge of image building s entrance has word research above it in 1946 boyd returned to georgia tech s physics department and its engineering experiment station where he worked as assistant project director under frank lawrence and after lawrence s departure as project director on an army air corps sponsored project studying microwave propagation as part of project he conducted long range line of sight experiments between georgia tech and mount oglethorpe in north georgia in 1947 boyd co authored a study entitled propagation studies of electromagnetic waves which resulted in a series of related research contracts including a large one obtained from navy bureau of ordnance on radar directed fire control mcmath p 260 boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948 around 1950 under authority of his rank of commander in u s navy reserve boyd created a u s navy research reserve unit at georgia tech that included officers from both georgia tech and atlanta metropolitan area in 1950s boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from georgia tech stevenson p 1 in 1950 boyd was named first head of newly created physics division of engineering experiment station now known as georgia tech research institute boyd recruited his former student glen p robinson to station stevenson p 2 in late 1951 robinson station director gerald rosselot and boyd helped start scientific associates now scientific atlanta part of cisco with 700 in seed money to produce and market antenna products that were developed at station as station s leadership did not think georgia tech should be involved in manufacturing business georgia tech vice president cherry emerson believed that ees employees affiliation with scientific atlanta constituted a conflict of interest and asked boyd rosselot and robinson to choose between two organizations boyd resigned from his post at scientific atlanta and remained with georgia tech but chose to retain his position on scientific atlanta s board of directors according to robinson dr boyd is really considered founder of scientific atlanta administrator experiment station director thumb neely research reactor which was built in part due to boyd s influence alt black and white photograph is of a large room that contains a lot of electronic equipment lower half of image contains a cylindrical white container that is a nuclear reactor there is a walkway at top of reactor which leads back to a control room where two men are sitting boyd was promoted to assistant director of research at engineering experiment station in 1954 he served as director of station from july 1 1957 until 1961 while at georgia tech boyd wrote an influential article about role of research centers at institutes of technology which argued that research should be integrated with education boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day to day research boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research he was influential enough to be able to override wishes of joseph howey director of school of physics on occasion for example boyd successfully hired physicist earl w mcdaniel in 1954 over howey s determined opposition stevenson p 3 under boyd s purview engineering experiment station was awarded many electronics related contracts to extent that an electronics division was created in 1959 it focused on radar and communications in 1955 georgia tech president blake r van leer appointed boyd to georgia tech s nuclear science committee committee recommended creation of a radioisotopes laboratory facility and construction of a large research reactor former was built and dedicated on january 7 1959 and could receive store and process radioactive materials frank h neely research reactor was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996 when fuel was removed because of safety concerns related to nearby 1996 summer olympics events although shut down was initially only intended to be temporary reactor was never restarted in 1961 boyd was succeeded in directorship by robert e who had previously been director of georgia tech s school of civil engineering west georgia college president boyd became third president of west georgia college in 1961 after william h row died of a heart attack boyd is most known for his peaceful racial integration of campus without waiting for a court order in 1963 by inviting a young black woman lillian williams to attend college she eventually earned two degrees in education and in 1985 received college s highest honor founder s award in may 1964 boyd invited robert f kennedy to dedication of campus chapel as kennedy chapel which was named after robert s brother u s president john f kennedy who had been assassinated in november 1963 during his visit robert kennedy promoted civil rights act of 1964 which was then under debate in united states senate boyd dramatically expanded college during his tenure both in terms of headcount and academic diversity enrolment grew from 1 089 students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5 503 students on his departure in 1971 in 1959 there were two degrees and five programs available in 1969 70 there were seven degrees and 45 programs there were 94 graduate students in 1961 first master s programs were offered in 1967 and by 1969 number of graduate students had risen to 741 in 1969 alone 80 new faculty members were hired a number larger than total number of faculty members a decade earlier several new buildings were constructed including nine dormitories and five academic buildings policy changes occurred as well in 1966 curfew for junior and senior women was abolished and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus in 1970 boyd was named university system of georgia s first vice chancellor for academic development effective once his successor emory graduate ward b was appointed in 1971 georgia tech president thumb james e boyd speaking at georgia tech alt a man wearing a suit and glasses standing at a podium outside in a little under a month after boyd had assumed vice chancellorship then georgia tech president arthur g hansen resigned chancellor george l simpson appointed boyd as acting president of georgia institute of technology a post he held from may 1971 to march 1972 mcmath p 400 engineering experiment station simpson s selection of boyd as interim president was influenced by boyd s previous experience as an academic administrator his experience as director of engineering experiment station and boyd s ongoing position on station s board of directors chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether engineering experiment station should be integrated into georgia tech s academic units to improve both entities competitiveness for federal money mcmath p 399 station had sizable and growing support from state of georgia and its industrial development council which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for georgia industry mcmath p 398 however due in part to efforts made by boyd and previous station director gerald rosselot station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from federal government in 1971 funding to both georgia tech s academic units and experiment station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science research and education funding after end of space race funding boom similar institutions such as battelle memorial institute stanford research institute and illinois institute of technology research institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts boyd s predecessor arthur g hansen s bold and controversial solution to both entities problems was to completely integrate station into georgia tech s academic units on paper this would dramatically increase georgia tech s stated research funding as all of it would be performed through academic units and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students another less publicized reason was that georgia tech would gain access to contract organization s reserve fund which was said to be over 1 million equivalent to million in mcmath p 399 thomas e stelson dean of college of engineering at georgia tech was named to reorganize station publicly stelson s task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization but administration clearly intended for georgia tech and engineering experiment station to be closely integrated maurice w long who was director of station at time viewed move as a violation of ees s charter as legislatively established by georgia general assembly in 1919 and asserted that georgia tech did not have authority to merge two institutions ees employees and business executives involved with station appealed to georgia board of regents and to governor of georgia and future united states president jimmy carter himself a georgia tech alumnus controversy received coverage in both technique and atlanta constitution this was climate into which boyd entered as interim institute president after hansen had announced on april 27 1971 that he would be departing georgia tech to become president of purdue university on july 1 of that year boyd stopped plan for absolute absorption of station but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed among these measures were increased resource sharing including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff latter was evidenced by increase in joint faculty appointments between ees and georgia tech move paid off and fiscal year 1970 1971 saw ees win new contracts and grants totaling a record 5 2 million equivalent to million in athletic association thumb right james e boyd speaking to media boyd had to deal with intense public pressure to fire then georgia tech yellow jackets football coach bud carson georgia tech alumni accustomed to success under football legends john heisman whose career wins losses draws statistics were william a alexander and bobby dodd made repeated calls for carson s dismissal complaints were based on a long list of infractions including mistreating and humiliating students and unsportsmanlike conduct but most important issue was his record last straw was his season in 1971 which included both a loss to georgia tech s longtime rival georgia bulldogs and to mississippi state bulldogs in 1971 peach bowl as institute president boyd chaired board of directors of georgia tech athletic association which had been suffering both in win percentage and in finances mcmath p 401 traditional sources of athletic association income primarily ticket sales had declined as a result of both yellow jackets poor record and relatively recent establishment of professional football in atlanta namely atlanta falcons bobby dodd then athletic director had warned for years that georgia tech s rising academic standards and its limited curriculum would affect athletic program mcmath p 402 at a meeting on january 8 1972 athletic association board led by boyd ignored a 42 page list of charges drafted by an alumnus but nevertheless voted to not renew carson s contract making him first georgia tech coach to be fired board also voted to not accept bobby dodd s resignation which had been offered at meeting carson went on to have a successful career particularly with pittsburgh steelers mcmath p 403 on january 21 1972 boyd announced that bill fulcher had been selected as new football head coach this would not change georgia tech athletic association s fortunes however after carson s departure on field and financial problems remained retirement and legacy joseph m pettit was selected as next president of georgia tech in march 1972 after which boyd returned to his position as vice chancellor for academic development for university system of georgia boyd retired from professional life in 1974 mcmath p 409 upon retirement he was named an honorary member of georgia tech s anak society in 1997 georgia board of regents approved naming and dedication of math and physics building at university of west georgia as james e boyd building two scholarships were created in his honor at university of west georgia one for top geology student and one for a graduate of bremen high school boyd died at age of 91 on february 18 1998 at his home in carrollton georgia funeral was on february 20 1998 at st margaret s episcopal church in carrollton georgia and he was
