ackland chris haywood as det sgt essie davis as det gilhooley john howard as len kirby themes writing in journal antipodes academics felicity holland and jane o sullivan credit film with exploring themes of australian masculinity mateship violence and sexuality film s portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply getting out of hand violence they say erupts from extreme rather than archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women film s critique of criminal masculinity undermines status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in australian history and cinema such as ned kelly and mick dundee authors believe that focus on masculinity leaves female victim largely out of film they consider near erasure of tracy to be a troubling aspect film instead focuses on portraying males as victims of their class masculinity and mateship director steven vidler said film was not about a rape rather it was about culture that allowed it to happen vidler defended choice to give rape victim a minor role stating it was important to show that this could have happened to anyone we didn t want to give away too much about victim so we could maintain that suspense producer david elfick said that film was about contemporary australia about kids who have all their life to enjoy then a deadly mixture of drugs alcohol sexual tension and desire add up to a tragedy production theatrical origins brian joyce director of newcastle s freewheels theatre in education approached playwright nick enright encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around 1989 rape and murder of leigh leigh in stockton a beach area of newcastle leigh s family objected to fictionalisation of her murder titled a property of clan 45 minute play premiered at freewheels theatre in 1992 and was performed at national institute of dramatic art in 1993 play was shown at various high schools in newcastle area and following its positive reception was shown nationally at high schools across country over a period of eighteen months in 1994 sydney theatre company commissioned enright to develop play into a feature length production resulting play was titled blackrock blackrock retained original four characters from a property of clan and added nine others it was considered a more fictionalised version of leigh s murder narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment film adaptation while revisions to play blackrock were still being finalised enright started working with first time director steven vidler to direct a film version which would also be titled blackrock by december 1995 vidler was working with enright as an unofficial script editor although they were having trouble finding financing for film vidler said he considered directing film blackrock after having watched and been moved by theatrical version saying play was absolutely what it was like for him growing up in western suburbs it s about keeping bonded with your mates nothing else matters it s about unbelievable lengths boys will go to keep those bonds solid leigh s mother robyn campaigned to have production of film halted but her attempts failed after film received government financial backing from new south wales film and television office blackrock was filmed over a period of two weeks with a cast and crew of about 70 a call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in newcastle area filming locations included stockton maroubra beach caves beach and house notable stockton landmarks seen in film include stockton ferry and stockton bridge thumb stockton ferry one of several locations in stockton used for filming alt rear of a ferry boat with jetty to its left boat has shortland and newcastle on back community of stockton opposed filming in area as memories of leigh s murder were still fresh and details of script were too close for comfort when filmmakers arrived in stockton in late august 1996 locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available local media treated them with hostility former newcastle deputy mayor and stockton resident frank rigby criticised film during production saying i would just love it to go away and so would everybody else brian joyce was also critical of decision to film in area saying filmmakers had to acknowledge choice they had made in doing so situation was exacerbated by filmmakers denial that film was specifically about leigh despite their choice of stockton for filming during production in september 1996 elfick told newcastle herald that he was getting a bit bored of people mentioning leigh s murder while acknowledging that comments were understandable elfick concluded unfortunately that event happens all over australia we wanted to take events of that murder and many other murders he was also quoted in sydney morning herald as saying movie is bigger than leigh leigh thing elfick hoped that people viewing film would see it as a positive way of looking at circumstances that led to leigh s death and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in future leigh s family were vehemently opposed to film saying that filmmakers were feasting on an unfortunate situation insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death and portraying her negatively while doing so one of leigh s aunts wrote to newcastle herald later that month saying david elfick doesn t seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from tragic and brutal assault rape and murder of a fourteen year old virgin not as he called it leigh leigh thing which happens all over australia enright said that while leigh s murder served as inspiration completed film is about way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another casting sandy george from australian screen online said that vidler s long career as an actor helped him draw terrific performances from film s young actors 17 year old laurence breuls was literally first person to audition for role of jared hundred of others auditioned though breuls remained favourite choice vidler chose simon lyndon who played role of jared in original stage production of blackrock for role of ricko stating that lyndon had looks charisma and complexity to play role rebecca smart who also portrayed cherie in original stage production was only person to reprise their role from play blackrock is often considered to be heath ledger s debut film but he had an uncredited minor role in 1991 film clowning around while ledger s role in blackrock is small it is credited with garnering him attention in australia leading to more prominent acting roles 15 year old bojana novakovic was given role of tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film rape scene vidler discussed role with her parents before filming commenced who despite initial reservations eventually gave permission for her to film scene novakovic said experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once shoot ended though recovered shortly afterwards concluding in a way i feel lucky to have had such a role at beginning of my career i don t think i ll ever be scared by an emotional scene again boys involved in scene showed up at her door following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a t shirt that said shit happens vidler said he found performance so powerful that when he first watched rushes of scene alone he burst into tears soundtrack soundtrack to film was released on 28 april 1997 on mercury records australia vidler said a lot of time was spend sifting through hundred of cds trying to find stuff that was not only appropriate for film but would also be appealing to audiences and hopefully you know would be released around same time as film which isn t as easy as it sounds jonathan lewis from allmusic gave album four and a half out of five stars concluding that it was a fine collection of songs that given diversity of artists featured is surprisingly cohesive as an album track listing way of all things by rebecca s empire teach me by cruel sea saturated by beasts of bourbon portable walt whitman by ben lee gonna make you by titanic days by sidewinder a day away by shihad bound for floor by local h ghost of love returned by clouds not coming home by sidewinder no need to argue by cranberries tailor s eye by

september 1997 version of film shown outside australia was around 100 minutes long upon reviewing this version australian classification board gave it an r rating stating rape scene was too harrowing and confronting for an ma15 rating vidler subsequently cut about 10 minutes of footage out of film so it could receive an ma15 rating and reach its target audience of 15 to 18 year olds blackrock opened in cinemas in australia on 1 may 1997 it grossed 1 136 983 at australian box office reception in anticipation of film s debut at sundance john brodie from variety said film could be thunder from down under way shine was last year having watched film at sundance david rooney from variety praised several of actors performances and said film should score with kids protagonists age but its soap opera style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance premiere also gave a negative review of film s debut commenting that audiences had been expecting to see another shine though left screening disappointed elfick acknowledged that initial screening of blackrock at sundance was less well received which he blamed on sound problems he stated that issue was rectified for second and third screenings which were much more successful diane carmen of denver post gave film a positive review of film which she said left audiences at sundance reeling with its intensity concluding it was almost guaranteed to find a distributor in u s though in event film never received american distribution having viewed film at boston film festival chris wright from phoenix concluded even with its slightly over top denouement blackrock is a believable touching teen drama it s also a gripping thriller r s murthi from malaysian newspaper new straits times gave film two out of five stars concluding it is an unflattering but somewhat forced look at wild side of teen life that at times seems dangerously tolerant of unrestrained teen behaviour associate professor donna lee brien of central queensland university said that when shown outside australia film lacks poignant and powerful narrative support of leigh s tragedy and was deemed by critics to be shallow and cliched australian novelist and critic robert drewe gave a positive review praising performance of breuls cinematography by martin mcgrath and director steven vidler s choice of such a controversial subject for a first film upon noting that filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from actual people involved in leigh leigh murder as possible drewe said film is asking a lot of australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories though he concluded that film should be compulsory viewing for all australian teenagers rob from sun herald noted that film belonged to a slew of australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave film 3 1 2 stars out of 4 stating if you went to see romper stomper metal skin idiot box or once were warriors this gritty punchy social drama ably fits into that class in her book who killed leigh leigh kerry carrington a criminologist and prominent researcher of leigh s murder had both criticism and praise for film she praised it for dispelling myth that sexual violence is confined to one social class for illustrating how boys model their sexual conduct on their fathers treatment of women and how culture of sex segregation in workplaces can carry over into public life of a town exacerbating sexist beliefs and behaviours she criticised film however for strong impression it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of underlying problem and for several differences between leigh s murder and film that she considered to be disrespectful to leigh s memory in particular film s hollywood ending donna lee brien stated that just as filmmakers attempted to distance themselves from leigh s murder city of newcastle attempted to distance itself from blackrock a 1999 feature in sydney morning herald discussing cinematic production in newcastle mentioned everything from mel gibson s 1977 debut film summer city to a short film festival that year but made no mention of blackrock brien theorised that some of condemnation film received may have been due to public frustration with legal system as film achieves justice for victim whereas no one was ever convicted of raping leigh brien cited film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime home media a region 1 dvd was released on 29 october 2002 containing original version of film a region 4 dvd was released on 19 november 2003 containing edited version special features included a four minute featurette cast and crew interviews a goof reel which included footage of a bonding trip made by simon lyndon laurence and cameron nugent to lennox head and film s original trailer and television advertisement according to andrew l urban from urban featurette was overburdened with clips from film but was otherwise of interest urban also praised seven minute interview with nick enright historical accuracy none of promotional material for film mentioned leigh and film was not marketed as being based on a true story film s credits state that it is a work of fiction and that resemblance to actual events or persons living or dead is entirely coincidental nevertheless numerous comparisons between film and leigh s murder were made just like play it was based on blackrock was often incorrectly considered by viewers to be a factual account of leigh s murder conflation between two subjects was high film was described by miriam davis on radio station fm 91 5 as being true story of murder of leigh warner at blackrock beach near newcastle donna lee brien stated that every review of both film and play it was based on at least mentioned leigh with some going into great detail on subject kerry carrington stated that film was very accurate in some aspects of murder yet very distant in others as if film was having a bet each way jared is an entirely fictional character though he has been interpreted as a metaphor for everyone who witnessed leigh being publicly assaulted yet did nothing in film tracy does not ask her parents for permission to attend party as she knows this would be denied whereas leigh obtained permission from her parents who were told party would be supervised tracy wears a short skirt tight fitting top and wedged heels to party while leigh wore ordinary shorts a jumper and sand shoes tracy s body is found that night by a girl leigh s body was found next day by a boy tracy s mother packs up her daughter s bedroom following day whereas leigh s mother left her room untouched for months in film police labour until every boy involved in rape and murder is punished whereas no one was convicted for raping leigh and police received criticism for alleged incompetence tracy s murderer was 22 years old well toned and committed suicide while leigh s was 18 years old and was jailed both murderers however were high school dropouts who were interested in mechanics were considered to have no emotional depth and were prone to violence party in film was considered to be an almost perfect re creation of party in stockton a surf club is hired for night with teenage attendees being entertained by a high school band party spills out into surrounding area where there are fights and teenagers are seen stumbling vomiting and unconscious tracy s funeral was also considered to be a direct re staging of leigh s service both leigh and tracy s friends placed red roses on her coffin and then plant a tree in her memory both leigh and tracy s mothers worked at a nursing home and both their fathers called for death penalty for her murderer parents are blamed for neglecting their children in both cases details that were considered to be undoubtedly taken from leigh s murder included filming location of stockton presence of song if i could turn back time featured at leigh s funeral appearing in original script though it did not appear in finished film and posters reading shame blackrock shame seen on telegraph poles following tracy s murder posters appeared around stockton following leigh s murder stating shame stockton shame dob gutless bastards in accolades blackrock received five nominations at 1997 aacta awards though
