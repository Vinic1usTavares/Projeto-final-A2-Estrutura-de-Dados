mountbatten pink also called plymouth pink is a naval camouflage colour resembling greyish mauve it was first used by lord mountbatten of british royal navy during world war ii after noticing a union castle line ship with a similar camouflage colour disappearing from sight he applied colour to his own ships believing colour would render his ships difficult to see during dawn and dusk while colour was met with anecdotal success it was judged by experts to be equivalent to neutral greys at best and would make ships with colour more obvious at worst history in 1940 while escorting a convoy lord mountbatten noted that one ship in group vanished from view much earlier than remainder ship a union castle liner was painted lavender mauve grey mountbatten thus became convinced of colour s effectiveness as a camouflage during dawn and dusk often dangerous times for ships and had all of destroyers of his flotilla painted with a similar pigment which he created by mixing a medium grey with a small amount of venetian red by early 1941 several other ships began using same camouflage though no formal testing was done to determine how well it worked a later refinement of basic mountbatten pink camouflage was use of a slightly lighter tone of same colour for upper structures of ship by end of 1942 however all vessels of destroyer size and larger had dispensed with mountbatten pink although it is believed that smaller vessels retained this colour until well into 1944 primary problem with mountbatten pink was that it stood out around midday when sky was no longer pink and traditional battleship grey was much less visible us navy had experimented with a similar shade of paint as well and at least one ship uss winslow received such a paint job kriegsmarine likewise experimented with a light pink shade royal navy prisoner interrogation report of crew rescued from s 147 a sunk in english channel in april 1944 states they believed boat s overall pink shade was effective usefulness one of anecdotal and possibly apocryphal tales told in support of mountbatten pink was story of cruiser hms kenya nicknamed pink lady at time due to her mountbatten pink paint which during operation archery covered a commando raid against installations on island off norwegian coast germans fired on kenya for several minutes with coastal guns but she sustained only minor damage from near misses this was attributed to her mountbatten pink camouflage blending in with pink marker dye germans were using in their shells preventing german spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and ship stories like this and personal experience of ships with colour disappearing from view made crews of ships with colour notable supporters camouflage experts have noted that colour may make ships more obvious as a result of purkinje effect these experts also often complained about uncontrolled mixing which could result in mixtures containing more red than intended such a mixture could be disastrous as ships with even slightest red tone attracted more attention than those with an equivalent tone of blue in almost every light level an admiralty handbook concluded that paint was neither more nor less effective in sea going camouflage than neutral greys of equivalent tone and further that if red content were high enough for particular characteristics of red to have any effect colour would generally hinder rather than aid concealment references category military camouflage
