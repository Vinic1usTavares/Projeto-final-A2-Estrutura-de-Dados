boletus edulis english penny bun cep porcino or porcini is a basidiomycete fungus and type species of genus boletus widely distributed in northern hemisphere across europe asia and north america it does not occur naturally in southern hemisphere although it has been introduced to southern africa australia new zealand and brazil several closely related european mushrooms formerly thought to be varieties or forms of b edulis have been shown using molecular phylogenetic analysis to be distinct species and others previously classed as separate species are conspecific with this species western north american species commonly known as california king bolete boletus edulis var grandedulis is a large darker coloured variant first formally identified in 2007 fungus grows in deciduous and coniferous forests and tree plantations forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping tree s underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue fungus produces spore bearing fruit bodies above ground in summer and autumn fruit body has a large brown cap which on occasion can reach in diameter and in weight like other boletes it has tubes extending downward from underside of cap rather than gills spores escape at maturity through tube openings or pores pore surface of b edulis fruit body is whitish when young but ages to a greenish yellow stout stipe or stem is white or yellowish in colour up to tall and thick and partially covered with a raised network pattern or reticulations prized as an ingredient in various foods b edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups pasta or risotto mushroom is low in fat and digestible carbohydrates and high in protein vitamins minerals and dietary fibre although it is sold commercially it is very difficult to cultivate available fresh in autumn in central southern and northern europe it is most often dried packaged and distributed worldwide it keeps its flavour after drying and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking b edulis is one of few fungi sold pickled taxonomy thumb right pierre bulliard first described b edulis in 1782 alt side view of head and upper body of a man wearing a dark jacket and white ruffled collar boletus edulis was first described in 1782 by french botanist pierre bulliard and still bears its original name starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as january 1 1821 to coincide with date of works of father of mycology swedish naturalist elias magnus fries which meant name required sanction by fries indicated in name by a colon to be considered valid as bulliard s work preceded this date it was thus written boletus edulis bull fr a 1987 revision of international code of botanical nomenclature set starting date at may 1 1753 date of publication of linnaeus work species plantarum hence name no longer requires ratification of fries authority early alternate names include boletus solidus by english naturalist james sowerby in 1809 this entire work is available in commons here but reference is to plate 419 with textual description on page 697 sowerby described same modern species as b edulis on plate 111 description on page 57 and gray s leccinum edule gray s transfer of species to leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with rules of botanical nomenclature and he apparently was unfamiliar with earlier works of fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species b edulis is type species of genus boletus in rolf singer s classification of agaricales mushrooms it is also type species of section boletus a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics a mild tasting white flesh that does not change colour when exposed to air a smooth to distinctly raised netted pattern over at least uppermost portion of stem a yellow brown or olive brown spore print white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton and cystidia that are not strongly coloured molecular analysis published in 1997 established that bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor and established boletales as an order separate from agaricales generic name is derived from latin term boletus mushroom which was borrowed in turn from ancient greek bolites terrestrial fungus ultimately this last word derives from bolos bolos lump clod and metaphorically mushroom bolites of galen like boletus of latin writers like martial seneca and petronius peter howell a commentary on book one of epigrams of martial

it is finely reticulate on upper portion but smooth or irregularly ridged on lower part under surface of cap is made of thin tubes site of spore production they are deep and whitish in colour when young but mature to a greenish yellow angular pores which do not stain when bruised are small roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre in youth pores are white and appear as if stuffed with cotton which are actually mycelia as they age they change colour to yellow and later to brown spore print is olive brown flesh of fruit body is white thick and firm when young but becomes somewhat spongy with age when bruised or cut it either does not change colour or turns a very light brown or light red fully mature specimens can weigh about a huge specimen collected on isle of skye scotland in 1995 bore a cap of with a stipe in height and wide and weighed a similarly sized specimen found in poland in 2013 made international news https www bbc co uk news world europe b edulis is considered one of safest wild mushrooms to pick for table as few poisonous species closely resemble it and those that do may be easily distinguished by careful examination most similar poisonous mushroom may be devil s bolete satanas which has a similar shape but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising it is often confused with very bitter and unpalatable tylopilus felleus but can be distinguished by reticulation on stalk in porcini it is a whitish net like pattern on a brownish stalk whereas it is a dark pattern on white in latter porcini have whitish pores while other has pink if in doubt tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste it can also resemble bolete like castaneus which is generally smaller and has a browner stem boletus an uncommon mushroom of northeastern north america is another recognized look alike known to cause severe gastrointestinal disorders spores are elliptical to spindle shaped with dimensions of 12 17 by 5 7 um basidia spore bearing cells are produced in a layer lining tubes and arrange themselves so their ends are facing center of tube this layer of cells is known technically as a hymenium basidia are thin walled mostly attached to four spores and measure 25 30 by 8 10 um another cell type present in hymenium is cystidia larger sterile cells that protrude beyond basidia into lumen of hymenium and act as air traps regulating humidity b edulis has pleurocystidia cystidia located on face of a pore that are thin walled roughly spindle shaped to ventricose and measure 30 45 by 7 10 um stuffed feature of hymenium is caused by cheilocystidia cells found on edges of pores hyphae of b edulis do not have clamp connections related species several similar brownish coloured species are sometimes considered subspecies or forms of this mushroom in europe in addition to b edulis or cepe de bordeaux most popular are tete de negre negro s head boletus aereus much rarer than b edulis is more highly regarded by gourmets and consequently more expensive usually smaller than b edulis it is also distinctively darker in colour it is especially suited to drying cepe des pins pine tree cep boletus pinophilus or boletus pinicola grows among pine trees rarer than b edulis it is less appreciated by gourmets than two other kinds of porcini but remains a mushroom rated above most others cepe d ete summer cep boletus reticulatus also less common and found earlier molecular phylogenetic analyses have proven these three are all distinctive and separate species other taxa formerly believed to be unique species or subspecies such as b b b b and b are now known to be part of a b edulis species complex with a wide morphological ecological and geographic range and that genetic variability in this complex is low similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify b edulis and other commercially important fungi three divergent lineages found in yunnan province in china that are commonly marketed and sold as b edulis and are actually more closely related to b aereus were described in 2013 as b b and b thumb left b rex veris alt a group of three mushrooms with reddish brown caps bright yellow porous undersides and thick white stipes they are growing on ground in soil covered with pine needles western north america has several species closely related to b edulis white king bolete boletus found in parts of colorado new mexico arizona and california and possibly elsewhere is named after its discoverer chuck barrows it is lighter in colour than b edulis having a cream coloured cap with pink tones often mycorrhizal with ponderosa pine it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall some find its flavour as good as if not better than b edulis california king bolete boletus edulis var grandedulis can reach massive proportions and is distinguished from b edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish cap colour appears to be affected by amount of light received during its development and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy to dark brown red brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light queen bolete boletus formerly considered a variety of b aereus is also a choice edible it is generally smaller than b edulis and unlike that species is typically found in mixed forests spring king bolete boletus rex veris formerly considered a variety of b edulis or b pinophilus is found throughout western north america in contrast to b edulis b rex veris tends to fruit in clusters and as its common name suggests appears in spring habitat and distribution thumb right upright in lithuania alt a mushroom with a brown smooth cap shape of a halved sphere atop a thick dirty white stipe mushroom is growing on a sloping patch of ground amongst moss twigs and other forest debris trees can be faintly seen in background fruit bodies of boletus edulis can grow singly or in small clusters of two or three specimens mushroom s habitat consists of areas dominated by pine pinus spp spruce picea spp hemlock tsuga spp and fir abies spp trees although other hosts include chestnut chinquapin beech spp spp and oak in california porcini have been collected in a variety of forests such as coastal forests dry interior oak forests and savannas and interior high elevation montane mixed forests to an altitude of in northwestern spain they are common in scrublands dominated by rock rose species cistus and boletus edulis has a cosmopolitan distribution concentrated in cool temperate to subtropical regions it is common in europe from northern scandinavia south to extremities of greece and italy and north america where its southern range extends as far south as mexico it is well known from borgotaro area of parma italy and has status there european distribution extends north to scandinavia and south to southern italy and morocco in china mushroom can be found from northeastern heilongjiang province to yunnan guizhou plateau and tibet it has been recorded growing under pinus and tsuga in national park in nepal as well as in indian forests of arunachal pradesh in west asia species has been reported from northwest forests of iran non native introductions boletus edulis grows in some areas where it is not believed to be indigenous it is often found underneath oak and silver birch in hagley park in central christchurch new zealand where it is likely to have been introduced probably on roots of container grown beech birch and oak in mid 19th century around time exotic trees began to be planted in christchurch area similarly it has been collected in adelaide hills region of australia in association with three species of introduced trees it has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in southern kwazulu natal midlands in south africa for more than 50 years and is believed to have been introduced with import of pine trees it also grows in pine plantations in neighboring zimbabwe ecology fruit body production italian folklore holds that porcini sprout up at time of new moon research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically factors that influence production of fruit bodies although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn june to november in uk their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature above average rainfall may result in rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes in what is known in some circles as a bolete year a 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat corroborating an earlier observation made in a zimbabwean study removal of litter layer on forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production but previous studies reported contradictory results a lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that maximal daily growth rate of cap about 21 mm or 0 8 in occurred when relative air humidity was greatest and fruit bodies ceased growing when air humidity dropped below 40 factors most likely to inhibit appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought inadequate air and soil humidity sudden decreases of night air temperatures and appearance of first frost plots facing north tend to produce more mushrooms compared to equivalent plots facing south mycorrhizal associations boletus edulis is mycorrhizal it is in a mutualistic relationship with roots of plants hosts in which fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from environment for fixed carbon from host other benefits for plant are evident in case of chinese chestnut formation of mycorrhizae with b edulis increases ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress and increases leaf succulence leaf area and water holding ability fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal nutrient absorbing root tips often inducing a high degree of branching in tips of host and penetrating into root tissue forming to some mycologists defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships a hartig net smith sally read david mycorrhizal symbiosis academic press 1996 ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with plant effectively expanding root system of host plant to furthest reaches of symbiont fungi compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout northern hemisphere according to one 1995 estimate there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera examples of mycorrhizal associates include chinese red pine mexican weeping pine scots pine norway spruce coast douglas fir mountain pine and virginia pine fungus has also been shown to associate with gum rockrose a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas such as burned forests these and other rockrose species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in forest regrowth cycle mushroom has been noted to often co occur with amanita muscaria or a rubescens although it is unclear whether this is due to a biological association between species or because of similarities in growing season habitat and ecological requirements an association has also been reported between b edulis and amanita excelsa on pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in new zealand suggesting that other fungi may influence life cycle of porcini a 2007 field study revealed little correlation between abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath mushroom study concluded that triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of fruit bodies were more complex heavy metal contamination boletus edulis is known to be able to tolerate and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals such as soil that might be found near metal smelters mushroom s resistance to heavy metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a an whose production is induced after exposure to metal phytochelatins are chelating agents capable of forming multiple bonds with metal in this state metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in mushroom tissue pests and predators fruit bodies of b edulis can be infected by parasitic mould like fungus hypomyces chrysospermus known as bolete eater which manifests itself as a white yellow or reddish brown cottony layer over surface of mushroom some reported cases of stomach ache following consumption of dried porcini have been attributed to presence of this mould on fruit bodies mushroom is also used as a food source by several species of mushroom flies as well as other insects and their larvae an unidentified species of virus was reported to have infected specimens found in netherlands and in italy fruit bodies affected by virus had relatively thick stems and small or no caps leading to name little cap disease boletus edulis is a food source for animals such as banana slug long haired grass mouse red squirrel and as noted in one isolated report fox sparrow culinary uses boletus edulis as species epithet edulis directly implies is an edible mushroom italian chef and restaurateur antonio carluccio has described it as representing wild mushroom par excellence and hails it as most rewarding of all fungi in kitchen for its taste and versatility considered a choice edible particularly in france germany poland and italy it was widely written about by roman writers pliny elder and martial although ranked below esteemed amanita caesarea wrote disgruntled martial when served suilli instead of term suilli was also thought to encompass related leccinum scabrum flavour has been described as nutty and slightly meaty with a smooth creamy texture and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough young small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets as large ones often harbour maggots insect larvae and become slimy soft and less tasty with age fruit bodies are collected by holding stipe near base and twisting gently cutting stipe with a knife may risk part left behind rotting and mycelium being destroyed peeling and washing are not recommended fruit bodies are highly perishable due largely to high water content around 90 high level of enzyme activity and presence of a flora of microorganisms caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites as several studies have shown that fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury cadmium caesium and polonium bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify origin of imported specimens and for long term monitoring of polluted areas thumb left a porcini mushroom and noodle soup served in a bread bowl at a polish restaurant porcini are sold fresh in markets in summer and autumn in central and southern europe and dried or canned at other times of year and distributed worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found they are eaten and enjoyed raw sauteed with butter ground into pasta in soups and in many other dishes in france they are used in recipes such as a la bordelaise cepe frits and cepe aux tomates porcini risotto is a traditional italian autumn dish carluccio p 166 porcini are a feature of many cuisines including provencal and viennese they are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in thailand porcini can also be frozen either raw or first cooked in butter colour aroma and taste of frozen porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer than four months blanching or soaking and blanching as a processing step before freezing can extend freezer life up to 12 months they are also one of

edulis is well suited to drying its flavour intensifies it is easily reconstituted and its resulting texture is pleasant carluccio p 96 reconstitution is done by soaking in hot but not boiling water for about twenty minutes water used is infused with mushroom aroma and it too can be used in subsequent cooking dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans some of this content is indigestible though digestibility is improved with cooking like other boletes porcini can be dried by being strung separately on twine and hung close to ceiling of a kitchen alternatively mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush washing is not recommended and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank carluccio p 97 another method is drying in an oven at for two to three hours then increasing temperature to until crisp or brittle once dry they are kept in an airtight jar importantly for commercial production porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour and they are a major ingredient of pasta sauce known as carter s sauce drying process is known to induce formation of various volatile substances that contribute to mushroom s aroma chemical analysis has shown that odour of dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds commercial harvest thumb right alt approximately two dozen brown capped white or light brown stemmed mushrooms of various sizes in a brown bowl porcini can vary considerably in size a 1998 estimate suggests total annual worldwide consumption of boletus edulis and closely related species b aereus b pinophilus and b reticulatus to be between 20 000 and 100 000 tons approximately 2 700 tonnes 3 000 tons were sold in france italy and germany in 1988 according to official figures true amount consumed far exceeds this as it does not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors they are widely exported and sold in dried form reaching countries where they do not occur naturally such as australia and new zealand autonomous community of castile and leon in spain produces 7 700 tonnes 8 500 tons annually in autumn price of porcini in northern hemisphere typically ranges between 20 and 80 per kilogram although in new york in 1997 scarcity of fruit bodies elevated wholesale price to more than 200 per kilogram in vicinity of borgotaro in province of parma of northern italy four species boletus edulis b aereus b and b pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed fungo di borgotaro here these mushrooms have been collected for centuries and exported commercially owing to globalization of mushroom trade most of porcini commercially available in italy or exported by italy no longer originate there porcini and other mushrooms are imported into italy from various locations especially china and eastern european countries these are then often re exported under italian porcini label in italy disconnect with local production has had an adverse effect on quality for example in 1990s some of dried porcino mushrooms exported to italy from china contained species of genus tylopilus which are rather similar in appearance and when dried are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from boletus tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste which is imparted to flavour of porcini with which they are mixed after fall of iron curtain and economic and political barriers that followed central and eastern european countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions such as albania bulgaria macedonia romania serbia and slovenia developed into exporters of porcini concentrating primarily on italian market exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for france germany and other western european markets where demand for them exists but collection on a commercial scale does not picking b edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like bulgaria especially for many roma communities and unemployed a lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of mushroom resource like many other strictly mycorrhizal fungi b edulis has to date eluded cultivation attempts results of some studies suggest that unknown components of soil microflora might be required for b edulis to establish a mycorrhizal relationship with host plant nutrition boletus edulis mushrooms are 9 carbohydrates 3 fat and 7 protein table fresh mushrooms consist of over 80 moisture although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content can be affected by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage carbohydrate component contains monosaccharides glucose mannitol and a a trehalose polysaccharide glycogen and water insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin which accounts for up to 80 90 of dry matter in mushroom cell walls chitin hemicellulose and like carbohydrates all indigestible by humans contribute to high proportion of insoluble fibre in b edulis total lipid or crude fat content makes up 3 of dry matter of mushroom proportion of fatty acids expressed as a of total fatty acids are palmitic acid 10 stearic acid 3 oleic acid 36 and acid 42 a comparative study of amino acid composition of eleven portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed boletus edulis to have highest total amino acid content b edulis mushrooms are rich in dietary minerals sodium iron calcium and magnesium with amounts varying according to mushroom component and to soil composition in geographic region of china where they were sampled they also have high content of b vitamins and tocopherols b edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium a trace mineral although bioavailability of mushroom derived selenium is low phytochemicals thumb phytochelatins give b edulis resistance to toxic heavy metals like cadmium alt skeletal formula depicting amino acids cysteine and glycine joined in a peptide bond with free and amino groups at either end of peptide chain parentheses around peptide bond indicate a variable number of amino acids are involved boletus edulis fruit bodies contain diverse phytochemicals including 500 mg of ergosterol per 100 g of dried mushroom aroma compounds giving b edulis mushrooms their characteristic fragrance include some 100 components such as esters and fatty acids fruit bodies contain numerous polyphenols especially a high content of acid and organic acids such as oxalic citric malic succinic and fumaric acids and
