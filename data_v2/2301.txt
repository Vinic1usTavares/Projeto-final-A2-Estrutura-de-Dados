by head of paramount television group mel harris he announced that creator of star trek gene roddenberry was to be executive producer and lead creation of new series nemecek 2003 p 1 it was second attempt at creating a new live action television series based on star trek for paramount production on previous attempt in 1977 called star trek phase ii became star trek motion picture when decision was made not to proceed with paramount network it had been slated to be flagship for and interest in a new movie was piqued after release of star wars paramount had pitched ideas to roddenberry earlier in 1986 as it was twentieth anniversary of original series but roddenberry turned them down and initially didn t want to do a new series he later said it was only when paramount people agreed with me and said a sequel was probably impossible anyway that my interest was piqued nemecek 2003 p 2 all four major networks turned down new star trek series as they were not willing to commit to a twenty six hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot as well as a promotional campaign for show team proceeded with project with backing of paramount roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on original series including robert h justman nemecek 2003 p 3 david gerrold and eddie milkis nemecek 2003 p 4 justman proposed three ideas to others on october 17 including families on board ship a concept which later became holodeck and both an android and a klingon character one idea discussed by production team was for deanna troi to have three breasts to which writer d c fontana objected fontana who had previously worked on a number of episodes of original series was tasked with writing script for pilot production team met in full for first time on february 18 1987 having received first draft of fontana s script a few days earlier nemecek 2003 p 7 original premise involved enterprise and uss starseeker approaching an alien lifeform captured by a race called annoi and turned into a weapon after annoi told starfleet ships to surrender starseeker opened fire and was destroyed while troi contacted alien and convinced it to crash on a nearby planet so that enterprise can help it to free itself along with rescuing other prisoners annoi were using as slaves on surface despite numerous changes taking place to plot before final version some of introductions for various characters made it through to final version nemecek 2003 p 24 plot involving q was added subsequently to episode in order to make it longer roddenberry was aiming for an hour long pilot but paramount wanted a two hour show and eventually won out other items were also added in order to lengthen episode including saucer separation sequence and appearance of admiral leonard mccoy casting thumb right upright english actress marina sirtis originally gained role of security chief macha hernandez roddenberry realized early on that a series with original crew from star trek was unlikely to be practical nor did he want to recast roles or have a retread crew a series of different characters in very similar roles to original series he explained i would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren t other possibilities to think about first casting call was sent out on december 10 1986 while some characters such as geordi la forge and beverly crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in initial casting call others have clear differences julien picard would lapse into a french accent when he became emotional and data was non caucasian macha hernandez was a latino security chief based on jenette goldstein s role in aliens while deanna troi was to appear foreign or more specifically of an icelandic or scandinavian nature leslie crusher was listed as a fifteen year old girl with a photographic memory nemecek 2003 p 13 although was quickly changed to a male teenager called wesley justman argued for a female teenager but roddenberry thought that there would be a greater number of storylines available if character was male nemecek 2003 p 14 patrick stewart was cast in role of jean luc picard after justman saw him perform at university of california los angeles nemecek 2003 p 17 roddenberry insisted that he wanted a french actor in role but justman arranged a meeting between stewart and production team to introduce actor and later berman supported casting fontana thought that american actor stephen macht would be better in role justman wanted stewart in show in some capacity and with roddenberry still opposing him as picard justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for data because roddenberry couldn t find an actor he preferred more for picard he relented and changed his concept of picard to better fit stewart nemecek 2003 p 18 although stewart was willing to put on an american accent to portray role of picard producers asked him to use his natural accent instead they also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked awful stewart was pleased to have received role saying that his children were impressed with new part and praised mythos of show saying great strength of star trek is its epic classic feel for an actor of my background it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television roddenberry s favorite for riker was jonathan frakes who went through seven auditions before claiming role despite being second choice of casting team he was hired after their first choice was unimpressive in his auditions levar burton had worked with justman on another pilot for a series called emergency room and was suggested to apply for role of la forge for us audiences he was most well known actor in cast due to his role in roots nemecek 2003 p 16 gates mcfadden and brent spiner gained parts of beverly crusher and data respectively through normal audition processes nemecek 2003 p 19 eric menyuk had also been considered for part of data and would later be cast as recurring character of traveller in three subsequent episodes reeves stevens 1998 p 50 justman later said that he was only one out of production team who preferred menyuk in role marina sirtis auditioned for role of macha hernandez while denise crosby auditioned for part of deanna troi they both gained parts with approval of berman and justman but roddenberry switched roles of actresses as he thought sirtis would be better suited for role of ship s counselor macha hernandez was re written to become tasha yar to better suit crosby role of worf required a black actor in order to make klingon make up easier to apply and was expected to be only a recurring character but following casting of michael dorn and his work in encounter at farpoint role was expanded wil wheaton was cast as wesley crusher despite what he perceived as an awful first callback nemecek 2003 p 20 thumb left upright deforest kelley who played leonard mccoy in original series reprised his role in a cameo in this episode appearance of deforest kelley as leonard mccoy was kept a secret with character only being referred to in scripts as admiral while roddenberry had wanted kelley to appear he thought that actor would turn him down two had lunch together and roddenberry suggested appearance with kelley agreeing not only to appear but also that he wouldn t take anything more than screen actor s guild base salary for part he later said i just wanted scale to let it be my way of saying thank you to gene for many good things he has done for me john de lancie deliberately missed his first audition for q as he was appearing as a lead in a play at time a second audition was arranged during lunchtime so that he could attend he later said that after he auditioned a big guy walked out put his hands on my shoulder and said you make my words sound better than they are i said well you must be writer and he said i m gene roddenberry i had absolutely no idea who that was colm meaney was cast in part of conn ensign on ship s battle bridge and after a further appearance in episode lonely among us his character was given name miles o brien in season two

picked up for a further thirteen episodes reeves stevens 1998 p 57 filming due to what was seen as a low budget for pilot and series in general existing sets and equipment from star trek movies were re used in new show milkis and justman were given task of reviewing standing sets from movies on paramount lot in order to see what they could use duo would later recall that one stage was so completely covered with cat feces due to number of cats living on lot that pair couldn t walk on set nemecek 2003 p 8 certain sets were re used including a re dress of enterprise bridge from star trek iii search for spock to act as enterprise battle bridge in new series nemecek 2003 p 9 main engineering set from star trek iii became new main engineering set albeit with a command console from star
