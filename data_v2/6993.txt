william etty 10 march 1787 13 november 1849 was an english artist best known for his history paintings containing nude figures he was first significant british painter of nudes and still lifes born in york he left school at age of 12 to become an apprentice printer in hull he completed his apprenticeship seven years later and moved to london where in 1807 he joined royal academy schools there he studied under thomas lawrence and trained by copying works by other artists etty earned respect at royal academy of arts for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones but had little commercial or critical success in his first few years in london etty s cleopatra s arrival in cilicia painted in 1821 featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes all but one of works he exhibited at royal academy in 1820s contained at least one nude figure and he acquired a reputation for indecency despite this he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed and in 1828 was elected a royal academician at time highest honour available to an artist although he was one of most respected artists in country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists in 1830s etty began to branch out into more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture and later became first english painter to paint significant still lifes he continued to paint both male and female nudes which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of press an extremely shy man etty rarely socialised and never married from 1824 until his death he lived with his niece betsy elizabeth etty even in london he retained a keen interest in his native york and was instrumental in establishment of town s first art school and campaign to preserve york city walls while he never formally converted from his methodist faith he was deeply attached to roman catholic church and was one of few non catholics to attend 1838 opening of augustus pugin s chapel for st mary s college oscott at that time england s most important roman catholic building etty was prolific and commercially successful throughout 1840s but quality of his work deteriorated throughout this period as his health progressively worsened he retired to york in 1848 he died in 1849 shortly after a major retrospective exhibition in immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion and imitators soon abandoned his style by end of 19th century value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices and outside his native york he remained little known throughout 20th century etty s inclusion in tate britain s landmark exposed victorian nude exhibition in 2001 02 high profile restoration of his sirens and ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at york art gallery in 2011 12 led to renewed interest in his work background left thumb upright sir watkin williams wynn and his mother frances joshua reynolds by early 19th century reynolds s style dominated british art alt well dressed man and an elderly woman in late 18th and early 19th centuries british painting was strongly influenced by joshua reynolds 1723 1792 first president of royal academy of arts ra reynolds believed purpose of art was to conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner not confined to mere matter of fact and that artists should emulate renaissance painters such as rubens paolo veronese and raphael and make their subjects close to perfection after reynolds s death his discourses on art which extolled notion of an artist s duty to paint idealised subjects remained britain s primary theoretical work on art royal academy dominated british art with annual royal academy summer exhibition most important event in calendar royal academy also controlled prestigious royal academy art schools which had an effective monopoly on training of new artists and which taught with a very narrow focus on approved techniques while painters such as j m w turner a strong supporter of royal academy were beginning to move away from influence of old masters to create uniquely british styles they adhered to principles established by reynolds in opinions then current at royal academy and among critics most prestigious form of painting was considered history painting in which an artwork illustrated a story it was thought that such works enabled british artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those european artists active at time as well as to old masters other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles as they did not give artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality nonetheless even most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting as portraits were generally commissioned by subjects or their families providing a guaranteed source of income to artist two of first three presidents of royal academy joshua reynolds and sir thomas lawrence had made their names as portrait painters owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings by early 19th century history painting in england was in serious decline childhood and apprenticeship 1787 1805 william etty was born in york on 10 march 1787 seventh child of matthew and esther etty nee calverley although matthew etty was a successful miller and baker he bore a large family and was never financially secure esther calverley s brother unexpectedly inherited title of squire of hayton in 1745 nine years before esther s birth but disowned her following her marriage to matthew whom he considered as beneath her station family were strict methodists and william was raised as such although he disliked spartan appearance of methodist chapel and liked to attend his anglican parish church or york minster when able he showed artistic promise from an early age drawing in chalk on wooden floor of his father s shop from age of four he attended local schools in york before being sent at age of 10 to mr hall s academy a boarding school in nearby pocklington which he left two years later on 8 october 1798 at age of 11 william was apprenticed as a printer to robert peck of hull publisher of hull packet while etty found work exhausting and unpleasant he continued to draw in his spare time and his job gave him opportunity to broaden his education by reading books it seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise for first time that it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting on 23 october 1805 etty s seven year indenture with peck expired an event greeted with great happiness as he intensely disliked job he remained in hull for a further three weeks as a journeyman printer he moved to london with a few pieces of chalk crayons in colours to stay with his older brother walter in lombard street walter worked for successful gold lace manufacturer bodley etty and bodley with whom their father s brother also named william was partner he arrived in london on 23 november 1805 with intention of gaining admission to royal academy schools training 1806 1821 left thumb sketches from elgin marbles by william etty aspiring students were expected to draw from classical sculptures as part of admission process alt pencil sketch of warriors on horseback applicants to royal academy schools were expected to pass stringent ability tests and on his arrival in london etty set about practicing drawing from prints and from nature aware that all successful applicants were expected to produce high quality drawings of classical sculptures he spent much time in a plaster cast shop kept by gianelli in that lane near to smithfield immortalised by dr johnson s visit to see ghost there which he described as my first academy etty obtained a letter of introduction from member of parliament richard sharp to painter john opie he visited opie with this letter and showed him a drawing he had done from a cast of cupid and psyche impressed opie recommended etty to henry fuseli who accepted him into royal academy schools as a probationer having satisfactorily completed drawings from casts of laocoon and torso of michelangelo etty was accepted as a full student on 15 january 1807 right upright thumb missionary boy 1805 06 is thought to be etty s oldest significant surviving painting alt dark skinned child in colourful clothing shortly after etty joined ra four major lectures on painting were delivered by john opie in february and march 1807 in them opie said that painting brings into view heroes sages and beauties of earliest periods inhabitants of most distant regions and fixes and perpetuates forms of present day it presents to us heroic deeds remarkable events and interesting examples of piety patriotism and humanity of all ages and according to nature of action depicted fills us with innocent pleasure excites our abhorrence of crimes moves us to piety or inspires us with elevated sentiments opie rejected reynolds s tradition of idealising subjects of paintings observing that he did not believe that flesh of heroes is less like flesh than that of other men opie advised his students to pay great attention to titian whose use of colour he considered unsurpassed advising students that colouring is sunshine of art that clothes poverty in smiles and doubles charms of beauty opie s opinions made a deep impression on young etty and he would hold these views throughout his career thomas lawrence by this time etty had developed a great admiration for portrait painter thomas lawrence and hoped to learn from him having arranged an introduction via henry fuseli etty s uncle william met with lawrence and paid him 100 guineas about ps in terms in return for his accepting younger william as a private pupil for a year under this arrangement etty did not receive formal tuition from lawrence instead lawrence set aside a room in his attic for etty to copy from his pictures and agreed to answer questions when he was in a position to do so etty found experience of copying lawrence s work extremely frustrating and in his own words was ready to run away but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy lawrence s work very closely although etty found his year with lawrence a frustrating experience his development of ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from old masters once he had completed his year with lawrence etty returned to royal academy drawing at life class and copying other paintings as well as undertaking commissions and doing occasional work for lawrence to earn money he was unsuccessful in all academy s competitions and every painting he submitted for summer exhibition was rejected in 1809 etty s uncle william with whom he had been staying died he was forced into an inconvenient transient lifestyle moving from lodging to lodging etty had been left a significant sum in his uncle s will and his brother walter now took over their uncle s position at bodley etty and bodley giving walter means to support younger william s work financially in 1811 etty s persistence paid off two of his paintings were accepted for telemachus rescues antiope from fury of wild boar exhibition at royal academy summer exhibition and sappho at british institution latter sold for respectable sum of 25 guineas about ps in terms although from now on etty had at least one work accepted for summer exhibition each year he had little commercial success and generated little interest over next few years by 1814 etty was becoming widely respected at ra for his use of colour and in particular his ability to produce realistic flesh tones france and italy right thumb upright male nude with staff 1814 16 although a commercial failure in 1810s etty was greatly respected at ra for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones alt nude man holding a long pole at time there were no public art galleries in england with permanent collections in 1816 in face of his continued lack of success etty decided to spend a year in italy to study artworks held in great italian collections he had made a brief visit to france in early 1815 but other than this had never been abroad 28 year old etty had fallen in love and fretted about difficulties a potential marriage would cause and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country in event woman rejected him and he set out for continent in early september 1816 etty landed in dieppe and made his way to paris via rouen although he admitted to finding france a beautiful country he was unhappy throughout his stay there suffering from severe homesickness shortly after his arrival in paris he wrote to his cousin martha bodley that i hope i shall like italy better than paris or i think i shall not feel resolution to stop a year if i don t i shall content myself with seeing what i think worth while and then return he travelled onwards via geneva but found switzerland frustrating although he had brought his own tea making equipment with him in remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea travelling through simplon pass to piedmont revived his spirits somewhat he found variety of colour in landscapes of northern italy fascinating and in late september arrived in florence left thumb upright miss mary arabella jay 1819 one of earliest paintings exhibited by etty at summer exhibition to survive etty s style at this time was still heavily influenced by lawrence alt woman carrying a basket of flowers despite grandeur of florence etty was severely depressed writing to his brother on 5 october that i feel so lonely it is impossible for me to be happy and complaining of vermin in bed dirt and filth which he considered such as no englishman can have any idea of who has not witnessed it his emotional state made it impossible for him to study and within a month of his arrival in italy he began journey back to england stopping in paris on 26 october 1816 there he enrolled in atelier of jean baptiste regnault but found atmosphere rowdy and studio too full of frenchmen and he left after a week while in paris he also attended academie des beaux arts and amassed a large quantity of prints from art shops of paris still homesick etty left paris returning to london in november notwithstanding his unhappiness etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels for first time his two paintings exhibited at 1817 summer exhibition bacchanalians a sketch and cupid and euphrosyne attracted a favourable review in press in this case from william paulet carey writing in literary gazette who considered bacchanalians a fine classical invention and cupid as showing splendid promise carey was later to take great pride in being first critic to recognise etty s potential and continued to champion him throughout his career in 1818 etty entered a copy of damiano s rape of ganymede at time thought to be by titian in one of royal academy s painting competitions easily most accomplished entry in competition etty was due to win until two of other contestants complained that he had technically breached ra rules by briefly removing painting from academy premises to work on it at home they further complained that etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for contest despite his still being a student etty was disqualified from competition but high quality of his work further raised his prestige within academy although his income was still low and he was surviving on gifts from his brother at some point by 1818 etty hired an assistant george henry franklin coral finder right thumb coral finder 1820 alt naked woman on a boat surrounded by naked children at 1820 summer exhibition etty exhibited two paintings drunken barnaby and coral finder venus and her youthful satellites arriving at isle of paphos drunken barnaby is a scene of a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on barmaid is shown as sturdily built plump and rosy cheeked a style in which etty continued to paint women throughout his career coral finder is strongly inspired by titian and depicts venus victrix lying nude in a golden boat surrounded by scantily clad attendants it was etty s first use of combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references for which he was to become famous coral finder was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer thomas tomkinson for ps30 about ps in terms sir francis freeling had admired coral finder at its exhibition and on learning that it had already been sold he commissioned etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale for a fee of 200 guineas about ps in terms etty had for some time been musing on possibility of a painting of cleopatra and took opportunity provided by freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on composition of coral finder recognition and travels 1821 1823 left thumb cleopatra s arrival in cilicia 1821 alt boat crammed full of naked people cleopatra s arrival in cilicia also known as triumph of cleopatra is based loosely on plutarch s life of antony and shakespeare s antony and cleopatra in which queen of egypt travels to tarsus in cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with roman general mark antony while superficially similar to coral finder cleopatra is more closely related to style of regnault with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition individual figures are out of proportion to each other and ship while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of painting as well as from regnault work borrows elements from titian rubens and classical sculpture when exhibited in 1821 cleopatra was generally extremely well received and considered among finest paintings of its kind and its success inspired etty to paint more works in a similar vein exhibition of cleopatra coupled with exhibition in january 1822 of a sketch from one of gray s odes youth on prow which also depicted nude figures on a boat drew criticism of etty for his treatment of female nudes times in early 1822 chided etty remarking that we take this opportunity of advising mr etty who got some reputation for painting cleopatra s galley not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only most vicious taste naked figures when painted with purity of raphael may be endured but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent and on mr etty s is mere dirty flesh unlike nude studies by other artists of period etty made no attempt to female nudes in cleopatra but instead painted them in realistic poses and realistic flesh tones possibly alarmed by criticism freeling persuaded etty to paint clothes onto some of figures in cleopatra although in 1829 he allowed etty to return figures to state in which he had originally painted them right upright thumb william etty self portrait 1823 success of cleopatra notwithstanding etty remained a student at ra and continued with a rigorous programme of study now in his mid 30s he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those european masters whose styles he most admired despite his unpleasant experiences last time he left england travels in europe recalling his homesickness and loneliness last time he had ventured abroad for his next foreign trip etty travelled in company of richard evans who had been a fellow student of thomas lawrence despite warnings that italy would be uncomfortably hot two men set out on 23 june 1822 with aim of reaching rome crossing to france by means of recently developed steamboat they arrived in paris on 26 june they stayed in paris for two weeks visiting versailles and city s public art galleries they also visited much reduced remaining exhibits of louvre louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern french painting at time at which etty felt a great dislike for quality of portraiture in france but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by permanent collections in particular rubens s marie de medici cycle elements of which he later reused in many of his own works travelling onwards through dijon and switzerland etty and evans passed over simplon pass and on to milan where they viewed leonardo s last supper and visited brera gallery after a sixteen day cabriolet ride through gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer two men reached florence where they stayed for two days visiting city s galleries on 10 august two men reached rome although etty was somewhat disappointed by rome comparing architecture of st peter s unfavourably with that of st paul s he was highly impressed with michelangelo s almost venetian use of colour in sistine chapel he also met with antonio canova to whom he had been recommended by lawrence shortly before canova s death rome was at time suffering badly from malaria and after two weeks etty decided to leave for naples evans had contracted malaria and decided to stay in rome and so etty travelled to naples alone and returned to rome in company of actor william macready who happened to be making same journey and with whom he remained a good friend for rest of his life on his return to rome etty toured city s museums making copies of various artworks particularly those of venetian artists such as titian and veronese whom he so admired venice left upright thumb bridge of sighs venice 1835 was painted from pencil sketches made by etty during his 1822 visit feeling unsettled etty left rome for venice intending to remain there for 10 days and then return to england evans preferred to remain in rome so etty travelled alone pausing briefly in florence and in ferrara where he stopped to kiss armchair of ludovico ariosto painter charles lock eastlake then resident in rome had provided etty with a letter of introduction to harry d orville british vice consul in venice d orville was so impressed with etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house rather than in lodgings etty had long considered venice his spiritual home and hope and idol of my professional life and had often wondered why given its artistic importance so few english travellers visited city he was not disappointed throughout remainder of his life he looked back on his visit to venice with great fondness writing shortly before his death that venezia cara venezia thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now although etty had only intended to stay for 10 days he was so taken with venice that he remained for over seven months he fell into a routine of copying paintings in venetian collections by day and attending life class of venetian academy of fine arts by night producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches he was extremely impressed with high quality of venetian academy instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with quality of etty s work in particular his flesh tones he acquired nickname of il diavolo owing to high speed at which he was able to paint and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right luminaries including gioachino rossini and ladislaus then patriarch of venice came to watch him paint so devoted was etty to his studies in venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823 writing to his brother that if one spent all time in painting originals one might as well nay better be at home members of venetian academy were so impressed by etty that he was elected an honorary academician right thumb etty s 1823 copy of titian s venus of urbino was considered among finest copies of that painting ever made etty was particularly pleased with this work and rejected all offers for it keeping it in his studio until his death alt reclining nude woman by 7 june 1823 etty felt that he had reached limits of what he could accomplish in venice and was considering returning home soon afterwards he left venice for florence with intention of creating a full size replica of titian s venus of urbino considered one of finest works of venetian school of painting although uffizi management were hostile to this proposal after 10 days of negotiations they allowed etty to create his copy his contemporaries considered it among finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy in late july etty began journey home pausing for a further two months in venice on 8 october 1823 etty left venice travelling via mantua and geneva to paris etty had intended to travel to england but instead remained in paris to resume copying works in paris galleries collecting prints and buying a lay figure and around 200 paintbrushes both of which french made to a higher standard than english manufacturers in early january 1824 etty returned to london success and controversy 1824 1835 as soon as he arrived home etty began to work on ensuring he had at least one picture ready for 1824 summer exhibition he decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820 that of story of pandora and in particular passage in hesiod in which seasons crown her with a wreath he had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on same theme and had already decided on arrangement of figures his first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half finished and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of key figures of pandora vulcan and venus pandora crowned by seasons is an unusual composition painted to resemble a bas relief in which different elements are emerging from a flat background figure of pandora stands in centre with vulcan to one side and venus and cupid to other each leaning away from her figures of vulcan and venus along with four figures representing seasons in upper corners of canvas create a diamond shape around pandora foot of vulcan rests upon picture frame a favourite device of rubens elements of picture s composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on same subject drawn by etty s fellow york artist john flaxman and engraved by william blake as with all etty s history paintings from this time on he worked by painting figures first and only filling in background once figures were complete although recognisably descended from earlier works such as coral finder pandora was a far more accomplished work than those etty exhibited prior to his travels although some critics were reluctant to accept etty s combination of realistic figures and an unrealistic setting etty s 1958 biographer dennis farr characterises critical reaction to pandora as grudging admiration not unmixed with philistinism his fellow artists were extremely impressed with it to extent that thomas lawrence bought painting at 1824 summer exhibition in wake of success of pandora etty moved to an apartment in buckingham street near strand where he was to reside for remainder of his working life shortly afterwards he applied to become an associate of royal academy for first time and on 1 november was duly elected beating william allan by 16 votes to seven times at this time still hostile to etty for his perceived indecency sneered that this cannot be as an honour conferred on mr etty if it were he has deserved and should have obtained it long ago same reviewer did concede that etty s copy of tintoretto s esther before was most important picture in room in their report on an exhibition held at british institution of significant copies of paintings betsy etty right upright thumb william etty self portrait 1825 this was painted when etty was trying to advertise himself as a young and successful artist and bears little resemblance to his real appearance in years following his return from italy etty had a very limited social life in a typical day he woke at 7 am painting from around 9 or 10 am until 4 pm after which he had a meal following meal he took a walk and attended life classes between 6 and 8 pm on returning home he drank two cups of tea and went to bed at midnight etty was considered extremely unattractive described by his 1855 biographer alexander gilchrist a great admirer as slovenly in attire short and awkward in body large head large hands large feet a face marked with small pox made still more noticeable by length of jaw and a quantity of sandy hair long and wild all conspired to make him one of oddest looking creatures in a young lady s eyes what she would call a sight one not redeemed to her by massive brow its revelation of energy and power sign manual of genius there legible one of his few close companions was his niece betsy elizabeth etty fifth daughter of his brother john betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than william and became his housekeeper in 1824 she remained in his service for rest of his life and as he grew older william increasingly came to depend on her suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did not hear from her she became his companion and acted as his assistant alongside his official assistant george franklin left thumb upright 1 2 betsy left charles centre and william right october 1844 alt middle aged woman and two elderly men while he appears to have been attracted to young women throughout his life and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in venice there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with betsy of any kind he recorded in his diary in 1830 that it is best i have not married because i have not noisy children and can have nice books and pictures etc he suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout although he was popular with fellow artists and students etty rarely socialised preferring to concentrate on his painting when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes he indignantly replied that it fills up a couple of hours in evening i should be at a loss how else to employ as she grew older betsy suffered from numerous illnesses exact natures of which are not recorded but which are known to have caused william great concern william began to fear that betsy would marry and leave his service in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him in 1843 his older brother charles a successful planter in java returned to england after over 30 years abroad william became deeply suspicious that betsy was becoming too close to charles a suspicion intensified when charles took her on a visit to holland and rhine charles returned to java in 1845 in around 1844 betsy struck up a close relationship with pen manufacturer and art collector joseph gillott one of william s regular customers who owned some of his pictures gillott was married with children and closeness of their relationship caused william concern in 1848 william retired to york leaving betsy alone in his london apartment although aware that betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to york and live with him in his retirement betsy did eventually join him in york and was present at his death combat spurred by reception of pandora in 1825 etty exhibited his most ambitious work to date combat woman pleading for vanquished this was a huge canvas 399 cm 13 ft 1 in across showing a woman pleading for life of a defeated soldier as another soldier prepares to kill him highly unusually for a history painting at time etty did not base combat on an incident from literature religion or history but instead painted a scene entirely from his own imagination based on an idea which had first occurred to him in 1821 he was later to describe this type of painting as that class of compositions called by romans visions not having their origin in history or poetry combat was extremely well received even by critics who had previously been hostile to etty in terms of composition and technique it was considered as equalling or even surpassing titian and veronese and one critic considered it one of finest and most masterly works that ever graced walls of royal academy while those critics who had previously dismissed etty for his supposed obscenity reconsidered their opinions in light of it combat continued to be one of etty s best regarded works and formed basis of a successful 1848 engraving by george thomas doo following success of combat etty painted a further four very large paintings one was on well worn theme of judgement of paris exhibited in 1826 and three were on theme of judith beheading holofernes first of which was exhibited in 1827 unlike other artists who had painted this subject etty s judith paintings did not show actual beheading as he hoped to avoid offensive and revolting butchery some have delighted and even revelled in first judith picture in particular was extremely well received critically royal academician left thumb world before flood 1828 was intended to illustrate john milton s paradise lost alt large number of semi naked people in february 1828 shortly before his 41st birthday etty soundly defeated john constable by 18 votes to five to become a full royal academician at time highest honour available to an artist by this time complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface all but one of 15 paintings etty exhibited at royal academy in 1820s had included at least one nude figure and etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity for 1828 summer exhibition etty exhibited three pictures world before flood venus evening star and guardian cherubs latter was a portrait of children of ellis agar 2nd earl of normanton and was only non nude painting exhibited by etty at ra in 1820s although similar to his earlier works they were technically more accomplished both world before flood and venus attracted positive reviews in press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums although purchase by marquess of stafford of world before flood a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes drew a pointed comment in gentleman s magazine that it will serve to accompany private titians of that nobleman

selling postcard alt nude male with his arms tied above his head as soon as 1828 summer exhibition was over etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece without which he could not become a royal academician this piece sleeping nymph and satyrs was presented to academy in october and in december 1828 etty became a royal academician life classes even after he had achieved status as a full royal academician etty regularly attended life classes fellow artist john constable sarcastically wrote that etty sets an excellent example to for regularity his contemporaries considered this at best peculiar and at worst extremely inappropriate complaining that for someone in his senior position to attend classes as a student was both unprofessional and unnecessary and that it damaged standing of position of academician there were complaints that he had far outlasted official student term of 10 years etty refused to give up attendance offering to resign rather than give up his studies and academy grudgingly allowed him to continue to attend classes he divided his time between ra s own life classes and those at nearby st martin s lane etty generally finished life studies during three evenings sittings on first evening he would sketch model in charcoal or chalk and then ink in outline on second he used oil paints to fill in figures on third he layered glaze and final coverings of paint he usually painted on millboard re using reverse for fresh paintings his female models were typically shop girls prostitutes actresses or poses models while his male models tended to be life guards recruited from nearby barracks who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique or occasionally men etty met in public bath houses hero and leander left thumb etty

composition although in place of woman begging for mercy is body of a dead soldier hero recycles pose of dead soldier from benaiah as dying hero as she lies on body of her dead lover unusually for etty hero is painted in intentionally neutral tones rather than his usual venetian colours and composition uses foreshortening of bodies to create a single diagonal across canvas for rest of his life etty considered hero to be finest of my fine pictures right thumb upright 9 andromeda etty often added elements from literature to his life studies to allow him to sell them as history paintings lady

died followed on 30 july by etty s mother etty was devastated by loss and was one of those considered to replace lawrence as president of royal academy although in event he did not stand for election possibly distracted by death of lawrence etty submitted only three paintings to summer exhibition that year one of these judith going forth was an addition to judith which had been commissioned previous year by that painting s new owners royal scottish academy candaules of etty s two original works exhibited at ra in 1830 storm inspired by psalm 22 attracted little interest and was dismissed

she goes to bed which was to prove one of most controversial works of etty s career candaules is based on a story from herodotus in which king candaules arranges for his servant gyges to spy on his wife nyssia undressing without her knowledge gyges is discovered and at nyssia s behest kills candaules marries nyssia and rules kingdom in his stead painting shows moment at which nyssia removes last of her clothes by positioning figures in such a way that none are looking out of picture and viewer is directly behind nyssia etty aimed for viewer to feel same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that gyges would have felt forced to spy on his master s naked wife against his will and without her knowledge left thumb candaules king of lydia shews his wife by stealth to gyges one of his ministers as she goes to bed 1830 alt woman removing her clothing while two naked men watch etty felt that work illustrated moral that women are not chattels and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights he made little effort to explain this to his audience and thus candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous inviting viewer to sympathise either with sexually immoral candaules murderous nyssia or voyeuristic gyges from moment it was unveiled candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images and there was near unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition piece remained controversial long after etty s death alexander gilchrist s overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of etty described it as almost only instance among etty s works of an undeniably disagreeable not to say objectionable subject while as late as 2011 sarah burnage of university of york wrote of candaules that it is perhaps hard to see painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by artist to shock and candaules was bought by wealthy collector robert vernon who was in process of building a major collection of british art and was to become one of etty s most important customers with three paintings for 1830 summer exhibition completed etty decided to pay another visit to paris etty travelled via brighton arriving in paris in early july 1830 he found atmosphere of city had become unpleasantly hedonistic writing to betsy that if i had a daughter she should not be educated here pleasure and amusement are idols france was in constitutional crisis in 1830 which reached a peak in late july as july revolution began and riots erupted across paris although moved by death and destruction taking place around him etty felt that purpose of his visit was to study paintings and continued to attend louvre to copy paintings as violence raged in surrounding streets on 31 july he decided to abandon trip abandoning his proposed onward journey to brussels and antwerp he collected five copies he had made in louvre and set off for london right upright 85 thumb james atkinson 1832 surgeon james atkinson was founder of yorkshire philosophical society of which etty was a member david wilkie thought this one of best portraits in england works etty painted following his return began to show a departure in style from his previous efforts while figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in studio or life classes from now on he began to work from memory and as a consequence his figures began to appear more idealised farr 1958 describes his figures from now on as less to a particular aspect of model than to a preconceived notion of what model ought to look like youth and pleasure and destroying angel left upright thumb youth on prow and pleasure at helm 1832 alt naked people on a boat naked people in water around boat and a flying naked child blowing on sails of boat in 1832 etty returned to theme of a sketch from one of gray s odes exhibited in 1822 to such disdain from press result was youth on prow and pleasure at helm which remains one of his best known works illustrating a passage from bard a poem by thomas gray youth and pleasure has been described as a poetic romance it shows a gilded boat being propelled by breath of a nude child on sails one nude figure representing pleasure languidly holds helm of boat a nude child blows bubbles which another nude on prow of ship representing youth reaches to catch naiads again nude swim around and clamber onto boat bard was about english destruction of welsh culture and subsequent decline of house of plantagenet and its replacement by welsh house of tudor and there was a general feeling among critics that etty had misunderstood point of metaphors used by gray etty claimed that his unusual interpretation of text was intended to create a general allegory of human life its empty vain pleasures if not founded on laws of him who is rock of ages and that painting served as a moral warning about pursuit of empty pleasure this explanation appears to have left critics unconvinced even those critics most favourable towards etty s technical accomplishments in creating picture found it hard to ascertain what painting was supposed to represent other critics were more openly hostile with morning chronicle condemning it as indulgence of what we once hoped a classical but which are now convinced is a lascivious mind purchased for a huge sum by robert vernon on its exhibition youth and pleasure remained controversial long after etty s death with farr s 1958 biography describing it as singularly inept right thumb destroying angel 1832 alt painting of an angel hovering over a crowd of angels and humans also exhibited at 1832 summer exhibition along with youth and pleasure was destroying angel and daemons of evil interrupting orgies of vicious and intemperate seen as a riposte by etty to his critics another of what etty deemed visions depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature mythology or history destroying angel shows an imaginary classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons human figures intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death each show their fear in a different way painted soon after his 1830 travels it is thought that heaped corpses and terrified crowds were directly inspired by events etty had witnessed in paris unlike youth and pleasure critical response to destroying angel was generally favourable even from those critics usually hostile to etty painting generated favourable comparisons to michelangelo and rubens and etty s early supporter william carey writing under name of ridolfi considered it to be evidence of etty s redeeming grace and spirit painting was explicitly seen as a renunciation by etty of his previous nude studies with fraser s magazine described it as a sermon to etty s admirers where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants their revels being broken in upon and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously like that little gentleman don juan by sundry grim looking brawny devils left thumb reredos of st edmund king and martyr painted by etty in 1833 london branch of etty family had links to church from 1770s onwards etty

unsolicited letters from wealthy old etonian lawyer thomas myers myers was a huge admirer of etty and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt etty ought to be painting so as to appeal to nobility he wrote regularly between july 1832 and may 1844 although eccentric and largely incoherent one of his suggestions was for etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of wives of aristocracy etty appears to have taken at least some of myers s suggestions seriously illness and recovery right thumb upright william etty in his studio john henry mole 1834 alt standing man looking

etty was then little known for portraits but had recently completed elizabeth potts a portrait of daughter of a family friend which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished he said at time that he hoped his portrait of williams wynn children would be one of my best in february 1834 etty became seriously ill and was incapacitated for four months unable to paint he exhibited only two already completed paintings in 1834 summer exhibition elizabeth potts and cardinal in june of that year he left london to convalesce renting a cottage in york weak and unable to concentrate etty painted very little and spend next few months visiting friends and touring sights of yorkshire gradually regaining his health he returned to london in december 1834 and

described as poetry on canvas by william macready who bought it from etty preparing for a fancy dress ball was portrait of daughters of charles watkin williams wynn which etty had begun in 1833 etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait remarking to williams wynn family that he intended to make a fine work of art as well as a resemblance showing williams wynn s daughters charlotte and mary in elaborate italian style costumes it was critically well received as evidence that etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity as well as demonstrating that etty could paint on commission for elite leading to further commissions warrior arming was a study of godfrey de bouillon painted to satisfy then current fad for medievalism etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of armour and warrior arming is a technically adept study of effects of lights from multiple sources shining on polished armour most contentious of etty s 1835 ra exhibits was venus and her satellites a depiction of toilet of venus this was condemned in much of press as pornographic and was described as having a total absence of soul with observer in particular extremely hostile calling for archbishop of canterbury to become involved in chastising etty for his lack of taste despite this condemnation etty considered venus and her satellites one of his best works and sold it to rev edward pryce owen for substantial sum of 300 guineas about ps in terms in august right thumb venus and her satellites 1835 alt seven topless women an empty suit of armour and a balding man playing lyre in august 1835 etty spent a brief holiday in shropshire where he delivered venus and her satellites to owen while en route back he made a detour to manchester to visit an art exhibition while there he made acquaintance of wealthy cotton merchant daniel grant etty and york after jonathan martin s arson attack on york minster in 1829 caused major damage there were proposals by dean and chapter to take opportunity of destruction to restructure interior of building etty was prominent in effort to resist redesign and to restore building to its original state a campaign led by etty and other york luminaries was successful and plans were eventually defeated in february 1831 by time of minster fire corporation of york body responsible for local government was already engaged in a debate about future of city s defensive walls walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain and with population of city rising rapidly city was becoming cramped and dangerous city gates bars had become a public health hazard given number of locals using them as toilets and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of walls dangerously unstable bars restricted stagecoaches meaning york was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along lucrative london edinburgh route faced with need to clear city s slums in 1800 corporation sought permission from parliament to demolish bars and much of walls owing to opposition from york minster scheme was abandoned but by 1826 barbicans of four of gates had been demolished in face of this a public campaign to save walls was launched in 1824 but attention on both sides of debate was diverted by minster fire in 1828 etty had written to his mother expressing horror at demolition proposals but distracted by need to complete sleeping nymph and satyrs was unable to take any action himself by 1831 corporation had decided to demolish barbicans but to retain and restore walls right thumb railway lines entering york station through city walls 1861 cutting of an arch in walls and noise and smoke of trains so close to york minster distressed etty alt trains passing beneath a long wall to enter a station near a large cathedral in february 1832 etty began a campaign of writing to local york newspapers urging preservation of walls and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of damage their demolition would do to tourist trade many locals whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry remained hostile to preservation campaigns a proposal in 1838 by york and north midland railway to cut an archway through walls to allow access to a railway station within walls galvanised etty and he delivered two lectures on preservation of walls during visits to york in 1838 39 and made four paintings of bars etty s words went unheeded and archway was duly cut in walls much to his dismay although station was soon moved to its current location outside walls to allow through running of trains to both north and south while walls were eventually saved in 1889 many years after etty s death etty is sometimes credited with their salvation it is open to debate how significant his part was some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and preservation of walls was result of decisions made by corporation and lobbying by local newspapers while others feel that corporation would not have made these decisions had etty and other like minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so in 1838 etty started lobbying for establishment of an art school in york he proposed that hospitium of st mary s abbey be used for this purpose with lower floor becoming a museum of sculpture and upper floor becoming a school and exhibition hall hospitium scheme was abandoned but york school of design duly opened on a different site in 1842 although school was created by an artist who had built his reputation on nudes nude art remained controversial in 1847 following a complaint from a female student about a display of replicas of ancient greek sculptures master was requested to have penis of each of offending statues cut off a proceeding that called forth indignation of male students and remonstrances of even lady students later life 1836 1849 in 1836 architect john harper arranged a small exhibition in york of works by modern artists which included 11 etty paintings this included first public showing of venus and her doves which had been commissioned by daniel grant although exhibition broke even it met with little public interest and no further etty retrospectives were held for some years harper did take opportunity to buy etty s a family of forest also known as flowers of forest which had failed to sell at 1836 summer exhibition a family of forest illustrates a passage from ancient greek poem theogony dealing with golden age before humanity suffered pain misery or need to work setting sun in background and man looking away from woman and child and instead into distance signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end by this time etty was becoming conflicted religiously although he had been raised as a methodist following catholic emancipation in 1829 etty became increasingly drawn to roman catholicism although he considered himself in my heart s core deeply and sincerely of ancient faith he refused formally to convert to catholicism owing to concerns that it would upset his family and friends worries that he would be denied access to anglican buildings such as york minster and a distaste for concept of auricular spoken confession he remained closely associated with catholicism throughout his later life and was one of few non catholics to attend 1838 opening of augustus pugin s chapel for st mary s college oscott at time most important roman catholic building in england sirens and ulysses right upright 1 8 thumb sirens and ulysses 1837 restored 2010 also in 1836 etty began work on sirens and ulysses which he considered among his greatest works and which is his largest surviving painting measuring 442 5 cm by 297 cm 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in sirens was based on a passage from homer s odyssey in which sailors resist irresistible song of sirens theme and scale of painting were probably suggested to etty by thomas myers who had been encouraging etty to paint very large canvases myers s suggested theme appealed to etty who later wrote that it illustrated importance of resisting sensual delights etty made every effort to ensure realism in picture going as far as to visit mortuaries to sketch corpses in varying stages of decay to ensure accuracy of cadavers on beach when etty completed sirens in 1837 it was one of main attractions at 1837 summer exhibition first to be held in royal academy s new building in trafalgar square now part of national gallery painting with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses immediately divided opinion some critics considered it one of finest artworks ever made with gentleman s magazine particularly taken with work describing sirens as a historical work of first class and by far best that mr etty ever painted other critics were less kind spectator considered it a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity glowing in colour and wonderful in execution but conceived in worst possible taste left thumb william etty at life class william holman hunt 1840s alt balding man sketching a naked figure possibly because of its size sirens and ulysses failed to sell at summer exhibition in october 1837 etty met again with daniel grant who without having seen painting offered ps250 about ps in today s terms for sirens and for samson and delilah also exhibited by etty that year etty poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio sold both paintings to grant for well below their true worth etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry and as soon as it was complete sirens began to deteriorate it was shown at 1857 art treasures exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display and placed in long term storage in archives of royal manchester institution and its successor manchester art gallery in 2006 restoration began on it and in may 2010 sirens was returned to public display and is now one of key works in manchester art gallery decline right upright thumb wrestlers even as a highly acclaimed artist in his 50s etty continued to attend life classes after sirens etty s output remained as high as ever with seven paintings exhibited at 1838 summer exhibition but quality of his work is generally considered to have gone into decline by 1838 critics began to comment that etty s paintings were no longer inventive but simply reworkings of his earlier paintings while in june of that year william makepeace thackeray under pen name of michael angelo wrote that is like great men lazy or indifferent perhaps about public approbation by 1839 criticisms of etty were being raised in even those newspapers and journals which had previously championed his work a new type of criticism of etty also began to appear in 1839 from a new generation led by art union who praised etty s technical abilities but saw his choice of subjects as out of touch and anachronistic and very frequently doing as little good for mankind as priest who preaches his sermon in latin left upright thumb dead pheasant and fruit alt dead bird lying next to a piece of fruit from around this time onwards while etty still held to his belief that purpose of art is to illustrate moral lessons he began to abandon literary religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work he began to paint still lifes beginning with pheasant and peach likely to be painting now called dead pheasant and fruit in 1840s he exhibited six in total and painted many more etty was first english painter to paint significant still lifes which at time were thought by english a primarily netherlandish form also for first time he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings etty still continued to paint history paintings but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received etty s decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to london art dealers from 1835 dealer richard colls had become increasingly close to etty and by 1844 had a near monopoly on his work as importance of landed gentry to art market declined new purchasers of art were industrialists generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in old masters they preferred to buy works by then contemporary artists such as etty and relied on dealers to advise them in may 1840 etty made trip to brussels and antwerp which he had been forced by revolution to abandon in 1830 he intended to study works of rubens but briefness of his tour in company of betsy etty he visited ostend bruges antwerp brussels aachen cologne bonn and rotterdam in course of ten days meant he had little time for study following year he returned to antwerp and mechelen for a longer visit to visit st rumbold s cathedral and to study substantial collections of rubens paintings in two cities on this second journey he twice visited a trappist monastery outside antwerp staying overnight on one visit and bought a trappist habit he also bought a capuchin habit from a monastery in bruges these acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years right upright thumb portrait of mlle rachel etty probably met celebrated french actress through william macready despite a perceived decline in his work s quality 1840s were most financially successful of etty s career his income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared etty was in a position to invest money for first time by 1841 etty had around ps300 invested rising to in 1845 and ps17 000 in 1849 he continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than betsy etty writing in his diary in 1843 that being in sound mind and body i declare it to be my firm intention never to marry in which resolution i pray god to help me that i may devote myself purely to my art my country and my god in may 1843 etty was one of eight artists chosen by prince albert to paint frescoes on theme of milton s comus for a new pavilion being built in grounds of buckingham palace etty was unhappy with his selection as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience but reluctantly did so choosing to paint on theme of circe and sirens three result was a disaster etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work as any freshly applied paint would flake away from existing paint layer and lunette shape of panel left etty with a large empty space above central figures etty s fresco was deemed unsalvageable and although he offered to paint a replacement on theme of hesperus he was rejected and william dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco etty was paid only a token ps40 fee left thumb givendale church 1843 in 1840s etty began painting landscapes for first time perceived lack of respect shown to one of england s leading artists led to some outcry and attacks in press upon then very unpopular albert william makepeace thackeray wrote in 1845 think of greatest patronage in world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse and paying for them below their value think of august powers and principalities ordering works of such a great artist as etty to be hacked out of palace wall that was a slap in face to every artist in england in august 1843 during a break from his work on fresco etty made what was to prove his final overseas journey since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of joan of arc and he wanted to visit places associated with her setting out on 16 august he spent two weeks touring sites in rouen paris and orleans associated with her life unlike etty s disastrous prior visits to france this journey passed without incident and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of french living musidora and joan of arc right upright thumb musidora bather at doubtful breeze alarmed 1843 this version painted 1844 exhibited 1846 was arguably etty s last significant

to bathe her fervent limbs in refreshing stream unknowing that she is being watched by her suitor damon etty s composition is shown from viewpoint of damon by so doing etty aimed to induce same reactions in viewer as damon s dilemma as described by thomson that of whether to enjoy spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate or to follow accepted morality of time and look away in what art historian sarah burnage has described as a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome musidora met with almost universal acclaim compared favourably to titian and rembrandt and described by critic as a preeminent work and triumph of british school by time musidora was exhibited etty s health was in serious decline suffering severe asthma it was not unusual for passers by to accuse him of drunkenness as he made his way wheezing through london streets and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted london to his beloved york abandoning smaller paintings which kept him profitable he strived to complete his joan of arc triptych before his health gave out this was on a huge scale 28 ft 8 5 m in total width and 9 ft 9 in 3 m high three pictures from left to right depicted joan devoting herself to service of god and her country joan scattering enemies of france and joan dying a martyr etty sold triptych for huge sum of 2500 guineas about ps in terms to dealer richard colls and engraver c w wass colls and wass had ambitious plans to recoup their money by selling engravings of pictures and by taking paintings on a tour of britain and europe paintings proved less popular than expected very few engravings were sold and tours did not take place wass declared bankruptcy in 1852 paintings were separated and sold on to a series of buyers with third panel fetching just 7 guineas in 1893 as etty s popularity continued to wane by 1950s all three panels of joan of arc were believed lost or destroyed although some preliminary studies survive

academy following structural alterations to give him a better view of river etty moved into house in june 1848 completing move in september although he retained his london apartments his move from london caused some consternation among that city s models who were losing one of their most regular customers as well as concerns from etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in york he continued to exhibit sending seven paintings to that year s summer exhibition but they drew little interest although lack of nudes was applauded by some reviewers by this time robert vernon s bequest of his collection to nation had led to eleven etty paintings going on public display in cellars of national gallery in late 1848 he wrote a brief autobiography published following year in art journal in which he staunchly defended himself against accusations of pornography which had been levelled at him throughout his life right upright thumb study for crochet worker 1849 final work now lost was one of last pieces completed by etty and was exhibited in his final summer exhibition it shows his great niece mary ann purdon alt young woman holding a knitting needle intently looking at a piece of cloth in her hands in 1849 royal society of arts decided to organise a retrospective exhibition of etty s work first since minor york exhibition of 1836 etty agreed only on condition that all nine of his large works were included three joan of arc paintings were in london and easily accessible and royal scottish academy was happy to lend combat benaiah and judith triptych but royal manchester institution was deeply reluctant to lend sirens and ulysses in light of concerns that transporting it would damage fragile paintwork further they were eventually persuaded to lend piece after etty and some of his friends visited manchester to personally request they release it exhibition went ahead from 9 june to 25 august 1849 bringing together 133 etty paintings for first time etty hoped that it would raise public awareness of his abilities writing to his friend rev isaac spencer please god i will give them a taste of my quality exhibition was well received and well attended even etty s old adversaries at morning chronicle recommending that readers lose no time in visiting this collection it was a financial disaster for royal society of arts faced with cost of transporting large numbers of delicate artworks from around country during exhibition etty suffered a serious bout of rheumatic fever exhausted by illness and stress of exhibition when exhibition was complete he returned to york in very poor health on 3 november 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt night before his condition deteriorated rapidly and by 10 november he was bedridden on tuesday 13 november watching sun set over river ouse he was heard to say wonderful wonderful this

in political and financial chaos in wake of bankruptcy of george hudson there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive fees and as a consequence etty was buried in churchyard of st olave s church his local parish church on 6 may 1850 contents of his studio were auctioned in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value in years following his death etty s work became highly collectable his works fetching huge sums on resale he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some with charles robert leslie observing in 1850 it cannot be doubted that voluptuous treatment of his subjects in very many instances recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art while we may fully believe that he himself thinking and meaning no evil was not aware of manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds six months after william s death betsy etty married chemist stephen binnington a distant relation of etty family she moved into his house in haymarket and some time after his death moved to 40 edwardes square where she died in

of english realist movement now considered to have begun in 1848 with formation of pre raphaelite brotherhood william holman hunt and john everett millais two of three founders of pre raphaelites were heavily influenced by etty s early works but recoiled from his later style holman hunt recollected that in my youth etty had lost robustness he once had paintings of his advanced age taste by their sweetness millais had consciously modelled his style on etty and his works prior to formation of pre raphaelites are very similar in composition but after 1848 only similarity in style is use of colour as pre waned millais s style became more varied and some of his later work such as knight errant owes a strong debt to etty s influence right thumb una alarmed by fauns william edward frost

surrounded by nude half humans during his life etty had acquired followers such as irish painters william mulready and daniel maclise but both rejected etty s preoccupation with nudes mulready painted nudes but became best known for domestic genre paintings while maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career one of few painters who consciously attempted to continue etty s style after his death was william edward frost who had been an acquaintance of etty s since 1825 in early 1830s frost painted on commission for thomas potts whose 1833 commission of etty to paint his daughter elizabeth s portrait had been etty s first significant portrait commission and later was commissioned on etty s recommendation to paint a portrait of etty s cousin thomas bodley frost successfully imitated etty throughout his career to extent that his figure studies and etty s are often misattributed to each other although frost eventually became a royal academician in 1870 by this time etty s style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion victorian painting had gone through radical changes and by 1870s realism of etty and pre raphaelites had given way to ideas of aesthetic movement abandoning traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject although aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting these works were in a very different style to etty s new generation of history painters such as edward burne jones lawrence alma tadema and frederic leighton sought to depict passivity rather than dynamism seen in previous works depicting classical world by end of 19th century value of all of etty s works had fallen below their original prices as 20th century began increasingly influential modernist movement which came to dominate british art in 20th century drew its inspiration from paul cezanne
