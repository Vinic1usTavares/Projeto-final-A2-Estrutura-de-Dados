siege of kehl lasted from october 1796 to 9 january 1797 habsburg and wurttemberg regulars numbering 40 000 under command of maximilian anton karl count baillet de latour besieged and captured french controlled fortifications at village of kehl in german state of baden fortifications at kehl represented important bridgehead crossing rhine to strasbourg an alsatian city a french revolutionary stronghold this battle was part of rhine campaign of 1796 in french revolutionary war of first coalition in 1790s rhine was wild unpredictable and difficult to cross in some places more than four or more times wider than it is in twenty first century even under non flood conditions its channels and tributaries wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during dry seasons at kehl and city of strasbourg lay a complex of bridges gates fortifications and barrage dams these had been constructed by fortress architect sebastien le prestre de vauban in seventeenth century crossings had been contested before in 1678 during french dutch war in 1703 during war of spanish succession in 1733 during war of polish succession and earlier in 1796 when french crossed into german states on 23 24 june critical to french success was army s ability to cross rhine at will crossings at huningen near swiss city of basel and crossing at kehl gave them ready access to most of southwestern germany from there french armies could sweep north south or east depending on their military goal throughout summer of 1796 french and austrians had chased each other back and forth across south german states by october habsburg force under command of archduke charles had pushed french back to rhine with conclusion of battle of schliengen on 24 october french army withdrew south and west toward rhine french commander jean victor marie moreau offered an armistice that archduke was inclined to accept archduke wanted to secure rhine crossings so he could send troops to northern italy to relieve dagobert sigmund von wurmser at besieged mantua an armistice with moreau would allow him to do that however his brother francis ii holy roman emperor and civilian military advisers of aulic council categorically refused such an armistice forcing charles to order simultaneous sieges at huningen and kehl these tied his

kehl under louis desaix and overall commander of french army of rhine and moselle jean victor marie moreau almost ended siege when they executed a sortie that nearly captured austrian artillery park

connected with captured french fortification called bonnet de pretre from these positions austrians bombarded french defenses with enfilade fire after defenses were thoroughly riddled by heavy bombardment from besiegers french defenders capitulated and withdrew on 9 january 1797 background initially rulers of europe viewed 1789 revolution in france as an event between french king and his subjects and not something in which they should interfere in 1790 leopold succeeded his brother joseph as emperor of holy roman empire and by 1791 danger surrounding his sister marie antoinette and her children alarmed him in august 1791 in consultation with french emigre nobles and frederick william ii of prussia he issued declaration of pillnitz declaring interest of monarchs of europe as one with interests of louis and his family he and his fellow monarchs threatened ambiguous but serious consequences if anything should happen to royal family french emigres continued to agitate for support of a counter revolution abroad on 20 april 1792 french national convention declared war on austria in this war of first coalition 1792 98 france ranged itself against most of european states

at bruchsal where a sturdy bridge allowed for passage across river troops there under orders of general marc amand scherb included 68th demi brigade and two squadrons of 19th dragoons had remained behind after battle of ettlingen to observe garrisons of mannheim and and to defend passage into france an initial attack on french positioned resulted in favor of french who charged austrians with bayonet and pushed petrasch s troops back realizing that his command was too small to withstand a concerted attack by stronger austrians scherb began a withdrawal on 5 6 september austrians and french spent most of day skirmishing in advanced posts austrian and rear guards french these skirmishes though masked austrian intention of approaching kehl and securing crossing over rhine between village and strasbourg by 15 september part of scherb s force arrived in kehl after having been continually harassed between there and bruchsal philippart pp 66 68 once established in kehl this small cadre

garrison under command of balthazar alexis henri schauenburg consisted only of one battalion of 24th demi brigade and some detachments of 104th this was too weak to defend a position of such importance or to develop additional extensive works recognizing kehl s weakness general moreau detached a demi brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry from his army in black forest with instructions to proceed by forced marches to kehl but general petrasch sent lieutenant colonel aspre with two battalions to occupy renchen and to insure that moreau s reinforcements did not augment garrison at kehl before break of dawn on 18 september 03 45 three austrian columns attacked kehl principal column comprising regiment ferdinand crossed kinzig river above french position and proceeded toward dykes of rhine above kehl this placed them between scherb and his force and kehl using dykes as protection and guided by some peasants who had been previously employed in strengthening kehl defenses they advanced as far as horn work on upper rhine and entered a gorge which led them to outskirts of village philippart p 71 second column of regiment ferdinand under command of major busch proceeded via sundheim toward kehl and obtained possession of village itself although not bridge leading to strasbourg third column which included three companies of serbians and a division of hussars executed a false feint on left bank of river one corps of reserve under command of colonel approached as far as french earthworks on banks of rhine to support columns ahead of him another which included a battalion of 12th regiment moved past hamlet of neumuhl toward kehl philippart p 72 quickly austrians possessed all earthworks of town village itself and fortress their skirmishers reached one side of abutment of old palisade bridge and advanced to other side crossing islands formed by branches of kinzig and rhine they halted almost under eyes of french sentinels there is some confusion about why they stopped but apparently they mistook abutment for last bridge itself french executed several attempts to retake bridges 68th under command of general jean baptiste de de was repulsed three times by superior austrian numbers and murderous fire of case shot from four cannons that lined principal road french cavalry tried to retire into kehl via kinzig bridge but heavy austrian fire destroyed most of them not until 19 00 did fortune favor french when lieutenant colonel aspre and two hundred men of regiment ferdinand were captured within fort itself next in command major was badly wounded and there remained no one in overall command of 38th regiment french general schauenburg who had gone to strasburg for troops returned with some reinforcements and met at once an impetuous austrian attack philippart pp 73 74 at 22 00 austrians still held redoubt and houses at edge of village arrival of a fresh battalion of habsburg regiment manfredini led to a new attack but it was repulsed austrians had insufficient reserves to meet fresh troops from strasbourg by 23 00 french had recovered fort strasbourg village of kehl and all of french earthen works philippart p 75 consequences austrian failure to hold kehl and strasbourg crossing in september 1796 gave moreau some measure of security in his actions in black forest and southern flood plain of rhine if austrians had held crossing general petrasch s entire corps could have fallen upon french army at that time through black forest defiles and congregating in freiburg with sufficient forces petrasch also could have advanced as far as huningen and carried its tete de point which had fewer defenders than kehl not only would this embarrass french who had up to that point maintained a steady and secure retreat westward out of southern germany it would trap french army in germany between petrasch and approaching archduke charles as it was when petrasch could not actually effect capture of crossing he was forced to remain outside kehl holding approaches to village philippart pp 76 77 despite limited success of s action it had a broad impact on movements of main armies of moreau and archduke charles by

back to france question remained however who would control crossings after 1796 campaign charles had formulated a plan to circumvent that issue and to free enough of his troops to send a relief force into northern italy where von wurmser held mantua against french if french would agree to an armistice he could take command of rhine fortresses french would withdraw and he could send a sizable force to northern italy to help relieve mantua siege of mantua was long and costly and had tied up a significant portion of both french and austrian force french directory was willing to give up mantua in exchange for rhine bridgeheads which they deemed more important for direct defense of france henri jacques guillaume clarke their envoy sent to negotiate between austrians and french in italy could

charles was instructed to lay siege to fortresses to take them and secure any possible french access to southern germany via rhine aulic council still believed austrian forces could relieve mantua consequently by tying charles down at rhine besieging highly defensible vauban fortresses at river at kehl and huningen council effectively sealed fate of wurmser s troops in mantua after it became

bribed or coerced someone inside to betray fortification an attacker aware of a prolonged siege s great cost in time money and lives might offer generous terms to a defender who surrendered quickly defending troops would be allowed to march away unharmed often retaining their weapons as a siege progressed however defender s position became more precarious surrounding army would build earthworks in a line of circumvallation to completely encircle their target preventing food water and other supplies from reaching besieged city this was followed by construction of a line of contravallation

their operations islands were connected to kehl and to each other through a series of flying bridges pontoon bridges troops could also be moved by boat if necessary philippart pp 105 108 111 125 on 26 october baillet de latour immediately lay groundwork for a lengthy siege by ordering construction of extensive earthworks around bridgehead lines of contravallation trenches nearest to french position included a series of redoubts connected by trenches initially french considered these to be purely defensive and they were inclined to ignore industrious austrian diggers and focus instead on their own fortifications which were sketchy and relied upon palisades unprotected by dirt these could not withstand a vigorous attack until strengthened philippart pp 102 103 after several days of strengthening their outer works by 30 october several artillery pieces were brought up to augment outer defense in addition released from main army after battle of schliengen general dessaix arrived to command fortress and augment garrison with his troops subsequently french reconstruction of fortress and its defensive lines increased several minor sorties against austrian lines resulted on 14 november 1796 dominique vandamme commanding a column of dessaix s force directed a small group of skirmishers and hussars to attack most forward of austrian posts this successful sortie took eighty austrian prisoners philippart p 103 on 21 november while austrians constructed their trenches on right bank of kinzig french planned for a considerable sortie against lines of contravallation between kinzig and rhine philippart p 104 action of 22 november at daybreak on 22 november 16 000 infantry and 3000 4000 cavalry moved against combined austrian and wurttemberg positions between kinzig and rhine french infantry departed from small island of erlen in rhine and from left of entrenchment camp first column forced first two imperial redoubts another penetrated earthen works near center and carried village of sundheim and two redoubts that ran contiguously to village three other redoubts between two were not carried though and austrians sallied out of these fortifications and fell upon french this action was principal assault on austrian imperial line and apparently took besiegers by surprise latour and archduke personally moved to gap french created pulling six battalions of armed workmen and all austrian troops after them philippart pp 104 105 french immediately ran into problems infantry intended to support first wave did not arrive in time cavalry could not deploy properly due to marshy ground and close quarters after four hours entire french sortie party withdrew taking 700 prisoners seven pieces of cannon and two howitzers want of horses prevented them from taking another 15 pieces of cannon which they spiked according to french accounts thick fog favored imperial action because it prevented french from reconnoitering furthermore as moreau reported later humidity on ground impeded march of their columns although it is unclear how fog impeded only french visual reconnaissance and march but not austrian s regardless fighting was heavy general moreau himself was wounded in head and his aide de camp was badly wounded general desaix s horse was killed under him and he received a contusion in his leg and general latour s horse was also shot from under him philippart p 106 this action convinced french that austrian and imperial forces were too numerous and too well established for them to shake french instead focused their efforts on reinforcing their palisades strengthening batteries and developing redoubts and earthen works philippart pp 107 113 expansion of siege much of kehl fortification was built on old ruins in particular oldest of bridges which had been largely destroyed earlier in century this was an ancient bridge of piles that had been largely destroyed earlier in century but which french had been reconstructing where old stakes remained french rebuilt bridge where stakes were missing they filled in gaps with pontoon spans resting on boats by 28 november austrians had constructed enough parallels and batteries to fire upon oldest of bridges crossing river bridge was entirely demolished french repaired it austrians demolished it again it lay so directly in line of fire of one of batteries that it was an easy target french could not keep it intact three days straight and furthermore its wreckage threatened a pontoon bridge immediately downstream austrians continued to expand their works and erect new batteries on 6 december austrians opened fire simultaneously with their batteries and maintained a day long salvo at four in afternoon they attacked a french position defended by 300 men they succeeded in taking it but french recovered it with a counter attacked taking some prisoners at same time though austrians attacked another work called bonnet de pretre where only 20 men were posted they secured it and afterward connected it to network of fortifications philippart p 105 118 this gave austrian marksmen close access to bridges where they could pick off french defenders with musket fire it also allowed sappers to tunnel under bridgehead walls and engineers to establish artillery batteries that could fire at closer range to walls they built some new trenches on left of schutter stream by entrance to old village of kehl similarly french had made several night sorties on works of besiegers in these forays they would chase diggers out of lines but austrian reserves always recovered works before french could capture any cannons or destroy construction consequently every day austrians expanded their works and erected new batteries on 9 december in night austrians attacked french advanced posts at ruins of old post house and church of old village of kehl fighting was bitter and short but austrians finally took post to be driven out next morning in this subsequent attack at which archduke charles was present austrians lost about three hundred men and an officer they attacked again on 10 and 11 december but could not take posts austrians also launched fire ships to destroy pontoon bridge but these were repulsed and destroyed philippart p 118 austrians took a large island on which several of french reserve units had been positioned general lecourbe removed one of flying bridges to cut off all hope of a french retreat grabbed a standard and rallied a battalion to advance against austrians repulsing them as far as their trenches lecourbe s quick thinking preserved half of island for french philippart p 122 in following days austrians incorporated newly acquired territory into their massive lines and batteries opened trenches on left south of schutter at entrance to old village of kehl within week austrian batteries connected ruins at kehl with left flank of contravallation and linked entire line to one of rhine islands now exposed by receding water lines of contravallation formed of several redoubts were joined by entrenchments that entirely encircled kehl and access to bridges these began at a dyke near auenheim traversed route to and offenburg course of and schutter rivers encircled village of sundheim and finished at bonnet de pretre austrian troops on island could cover left flank and entire besieging army was covered by considerable entrenchments on islands in kinzig by end of week austrian and imperial defenses were connected in a grand parallel and a series of batteries in a semicircle around village philippart p 115 austrians took ruins of church and post house by bringing up artillery and bombarding positions this allowed them to complete lines of contravallation philippart p 119 according to spies and deserters archduke himself had been exhorting and cajoling his troops to lift their spirits prepared his troops by harangues and presents moreau reported on 1 january after a lengthy salvo 12 imperial battalions attacked outer redoubt and right wing of french entrenchment drove french out and immediately took possession of earthen works and six pieces of artillery french reserves had not been able to traverse rhine in sufficient time boats intended to transport such troops had been damaged by lengthy cannon fire connecting bridges which had also been damaged were repaired quickly but by time these repairs had been made austrians were deeply entrenched in their new positions and french could not force them out even miners who had dug under trenches were unable to blow up redoubt philippart

lack of bridges or appropriate transport could not bring up enough reserves to preserve lost ground boats were stove by fire of cannon by time bridges were repaired and sufficient reserves could be moved austrians were entrenched and had brought up their artillery austrians continued to advance their earth works and perfect their batteries philippart p 121 at 10 00 on 9 january french general desaix proposed evacuation to general latour and they agreed that austrians would enter kehl next day on 10 january 21 at 16 00 french instantly repaired bridge rendered passable by 14 00 which gave them more than 24 hours to evacuate everything of value and to raze everything else by time latour took possession of fortress nothing remained of any use all palisades ammunition even carriages of bombs and howitzers had been evacuated french ensured that nothing remained behind that could be used by austrian imperial army even fortress itself was but earth and ruins siege concluded 115 days after its investment and following 50 days of open digging trenches point at which active fighting began philippart p 127 aftermath austrian losses amounted to 12 percent of total forces engaged high
