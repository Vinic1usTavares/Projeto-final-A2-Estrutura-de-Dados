with iwata s assistance and when yamauchi retired he became company s president in may 2002 under iwata s direction nintendo developed nintendo ds and wii video game consoles helping company achieve financial success as a self declared gamer he focused on expanding appeal of video games across all demographics through a blue ocean business strategy company attained record profits by 2009 and barron s placed iwata among top 30 ceos worldwide iwata subsequently expanded his blue ocean strategy by defining a quality of life product line for wii that later evolved into a ten year business strategy to create stand alone products later hardware such as nintendo 3ds and wii u proved far less profitable than wii and nintendo s net sales fell by two thirds from 2009 to 2012 company saw its first operating losses in 30 years during this time iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 in 2015 after several years of refusal iwata put a portion of nintendo s focus into rapidly

awards early life thumb right a commodore pet 2001 same model series iwata purchased in 1978 and subsequently dismantled alt a commodore pet 2001 model personal computer satoru iwata was born on december 6 1959 and raised in sapporo japan where his father served as a prefectural official throughout middle and high school iwata displayed leadership skills through service as class president student council president and club president at various times his first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines iwata would frequent sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game called game 31 until he mastered it with money saved up from a dish washing job and some additional allowance from his father iwata purchased an hp 65 first programmable calculator in 1974 after entering hokkaido sapporo south high school in april 1975 he began developing his own games during his junior year several simple number games iwata produced such as volleyball and missile attack made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates iwata obtained his first computer a commodore pet in 1978 he dismantled and studied machine out of his desire to understand it computer coincidentally had a central processing unit mos 6502 similar to one used by nintendo for nintendo entertainment system nes a gaming console for which he would later develop games following high school iwata was admitted to tokyo institute of technology in april 1978 where he majored in computer science tomohiko uematsu an engineering professor noted iwata s proficiency with software programming and remarked that iwata could write programs faster and more accurately than any of his other students while attending school he was one of several unpaid interns at commodore japan assisting subsidiary s head engineer yash terakura with technical and software development tasks one of his main reasons for taking job was to spend more time around computers and learn of details not openly available to public terakura would later serve as a mentor to iwata teaching him about hardware engineering to supplement iwata s already extensive software knowledge iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games classmates living in nearby apartments referred to iwata s room as game center iwata he would frequently show off his games to seibu department store s computer department and by 1980 a group of employees there invited him to join their company hal laboratory inc hal laboratory while attending university iwata worked for hal laboratory as a part time programmer in 1980 among their first creations was a peripheral device that enabled older computers to display graphics for video games with this device iwata and members of hal created multiple games that were straight rip offs of namco s rally x galaxian and others despite this hal became first company to establish a license with namco for developing games he joined company in a full time capacity after graduating in 1982 becoming its fifth employee and only programmer around same time iwata s father was elected mayor of muroran despite his passion iwata s family did not approve of his career choice and his father did not talk with him for six months after iwata joined hal iwata became company s coordinator of software production in 1983 time during which he helped hal create a relationship with nintendo so they would be able to produce games for its newly released nintendo entertainment system he traveled to kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for nes to which nintendo obliged his first commercially published game was joust for nes a port of 1982 arcade game other video games he worked on were balloon fight nes open tournament golf earthbound and kirby games nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce open tournament golf however all of them declined as they did not believe large amount of data could be stored within an nes cartridge iwata seized this opportunity and recklessly stepped up to develop game it proved particularly taxing as iwata had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all 18 courses into game similarly hal had to program parallax scrolling for f 1 race as nes hardware did not initially support it iwata s proficiency with programming quickly placed him in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike he would often continue to work on weekends and holidays because of his passion with company on verge of bankruptcy iwata was promoted to president of hal in 1993 at insistence of nintendo s then president hiroshi yamauchi with assistance from nintendo iwata helped turn company around from its y 1 5 billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years lacking experience in management iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself often reading books on topic and seeking advice from others although he was not part of nintendo at time iwata assisted in development of pokemon gold and silver which were released for game boy color in november 1999 by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in games while working as a go between for game freak and nintendo he aided in programming of pokemon stadium for nintendo 64 by reading original coding in pokemon red and green and porting battle system into new game in just one week according to tsunekazu ishihara president of pokemon company iwata was instrumental in bringing pokemon to western markets while being president of hal he developed plan for localization after reviewing code for red and green which was then completed by murakawa with western releases coming two years after their japanese release additionally he assisted masahiro sakurai in development of super smash bros for nintendo 64 nintendo early years 2000 02 in 2000 iwata took a position at nintendo as head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on board of directors over next two years he sought to reduce cost and length of game development while preserving quality during his first two years at nintendo company saw profit increases of 20 and 41 percent values which are at least partially attributable to his work when yamauchi company s president since 1949 retired on may 24 2002 iwata succeeded as nintendo s fourth president with yamauchi s blessing he was first nintendo president unrelated to yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889 yamauchi left company in iwata s hands with a final request that nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal and make software that adheres to that same standard iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism with a policy established by yamauchi to create new development positions as needed however this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments at time of iwata s promotion nintendo though still a profitable company was not performing as well as other console makers recently released gamecube was performing poorly compared to competitors with sony s playstation 2 and microsoft s xbox outselling it his presidency also came at onset of popularization of online gaming and nintendo had yet to move into this facet of market he took a cautious approach to issue stating we re not negative toward idea of going online we re just practical he also fostered a relationship between nintendo and capcom that improved gamecube s appeal during an interview in 2002 iwata stated that he felt gaming industry was becoming too exclusive and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of line graphics one of his first actions as president was to meet directly with company s 40 department heads and 150 other employees this contrasted starkly with yamauchi s practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single annual speech shigeru miyamoto described previous business atmosphere as stuffy and stated iwata improved ventilation iwata was acutely aware that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level if employees disagreed with his view iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own stating creators only improve themselves by taking risks alongside increased level of interaction iwata also brought more data and science into business aspect of company whereas yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position iwata also promoted miyamoto genyo takeda yoshihiro mori and shinji hatano to representative directors on company s board of directors equaling his own position revitalization of company 2003 09 following up on his 2002 interview iwata highlighted an urgency in gaming market in his keynote speech at 2003 tokyo game show during this speech he reflected on history of industry and concluded with declining interest in video games a slump in sales in japanese market had begun at end of 1990s and continued into early 2000s competition between nintendo and sony resulted in increasingly hardware heavy consoles however nintendo 64 proved to be too cumbersome for developers and software suffered severely after a year long analysis conducted at iwata s behest nintendo concluded that pushing hardware was not most effective way to promote video games and decided to focus on software a major internal reorganization of nintendo took place in 2004 with iwata consolidating various departments established under yamauchi he sought to promote collaborative work throughout company he later established a user expansion project in 2005 whereby employees normally not associated with game development would submit ideas for new games in a march 2004 interview iwata stated games have come to a dead end he stressed that developers wasted far too much time focusing on core gamers and would be unable to turn a profit if they did not tend to average game player furthermore he wished to prove that nintendo considered a conservative company at time would become a forefront innovator of entertainment iwata articulated a blue ocean strategy to help nintendo successfully compete against other console manufacturers instead of competing on technical specifications iwata drew on his previous experience as a game developer to produce novel and entertaining hardware and games nintendo ds iwata helped lead a revitalization of nintendo s handheld business by transitioning company from game boy advance to nintendo ds which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games idea for using two screens on a single device originated with yamauchi before his retirement while miyamoto suggested use of a touchscreen miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of device and its prototypes nintendo ds proved to be a highly profitable system and went on to become second best selling video game console of all time with more than 154 million units inclusive of subsequent iterations sold by september 2014 in june 2004 iwata sought a conference with dr kawashima about a game that could appeal to non gamers this project would later become brain age train your brain in minutes a day released in may 2005 iwata personally oversaw development of brain age series even foregoing a public appearance on day of nintendo ds s release in japan on december 2 miyamoto supported iwata s work with series and sent one of his proteges kouichi kawamoto to help develop game brain age series is partially credited with launching popularity of nintendo ds and series as a whole sold over 30 million copies by december 2008 subsequent iterations of nintendo ds ds lite and dsi also saw positive sales ds lite improved upon original ds featuring brighter screens and a slimmer design in accordance with consumer demand released in march 2006 in japan and three months later worldwide ds lite ultimately sold nearly 94 million units statistics showed that households often shared a single ds and iwata sought to expand this from one per household to one per person console s third iteration dsi embodies this idea with i representing a single person despite concerns that video game market was already over saturated by ds and ds lite iwata was confident that dsi would sell especially in european markets dsi built upon success of ds lite by similarly meeting consumer demand in addition to being slimmed further dsi featured two cameras sd card support an audio reader and nintendo dsi shop relatively quick succession of ds lite and dsi broke conventional pattern for release of game systems each being released roughly 18 months apart instead of 5 years iwata saw gradual price drop in five year cycle as a way of indirectly telling consumers to wait to purchase products and a punishment for those who bought it at launch he sought to alleviate this issue with quick releases wii discussions between iwata miyamoto and takeda about a new home console began in first half of 2003 with encouragement from yamauchi iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become wii iwata subsequently assigned takeda to project telling takeda to go off tech roadmap overall premise was that a mom has to like it during console s development process iwata challenged engineers to make wii no thicker than three dvd cases stacked together a feat they ultimately accomplished takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with gamecube alongside internal hardware designed by nintendo s engineers iwata proposed that console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone miyamoto took lead on developing a new controller while takeda s team provided internal components after six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes takeda procured a cmos sensor that later became core aspect of remote with addition of accelerometers they were able to effectively produce motion controls initially codenamed revolution during a teaser at e3 2004 following iwata s goal of creating a gaming revolution iwata publicly revealed wii at e3 2005 holding it above his head to emphasize its small size and light weight design reveal of wii s signature wii remote controller was withheld until tokyo game show in september 2005 during his speech at conference iwata reiterated his stance on growing gaming market but expanded upon it by emphasizing need to make controls less complicated controller s remote control design partially stemmed from iwata s desire to have a device that was immediately accessible to all he also insisted that wii remote be referred to as simply a remote rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to anyone wii ultimately popularized use of motion control based video games and proved highly successful for nintendo helping to nearly double company s stock price tapping into market of casual players wii marked a breakthrough moment in history of video games a new genre of gaming was established for family market iwata s former experience as a programmer a rarity for technology ceos was said to help contribute towards his leadership of company by end of 2009 fiscal year nintendo saw record net sales and profit of y 1 8 trillion us 18 7 billion and y 279 billion us 2 8 billion respectively due to his success barron s included iwata on their list of 30 top ceos worldwide from 2007 to 2009 quality of life products thumb right players of pokemon go gathered around a virtual pokemon gym in brest france social interactions outside homes like this was one of goals of iwata s quality of life initiative starting with introduction of wii in 2006 iwata placed focus on development of products that improved quality of life wii fit series conceptualized by miyamoto epitomized this movement at e3 2009 iwata revealed development of an add on product to wii wii vitality sensor device measured autonomic nerve functions namely pulse and incorporate acquired data into relaxation products iwata saw device as a continuation of blue ocean strategy previously articulated he indicated that market of motion controls was turning into a red ocean whereby too many companies would saturate market and restrict profits vitality sensor was developed in hopes of providing a novel way to interact with video games and continue nintendo s history of innovation however testing of a prototype device yielded less than desirable results and nintendo had postponed release of product indefinitely by 2013 in january 2014 iwata unveiled a ten year strategy for company based on quality of life products target was a new market outside video games developed under partnerships with dr watanabe and first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in october 2014 unlike vitality sensor sleep sensor was to be a stand alone product that would not need to be worn following iwata s death in july 2015 analysts questioned whether nintendo would continue quality of life initiative despite a planned united states release in march 2016 some suggested product had been temporarily shelved while others believed product had been indefinitely postponed like vitality sensor before it device was formally discontinued by february 2016 however tatsumi kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue nintendo based products like nintendo switch designed to encourage use on go and social interactions mobile augmented reality game pokemon go that requires travelling outside house and its addition pokemon sleep that works based on a player s sleep patterns all represent continuations of iwata s quality of life initiative switch title ring fit adventure which includes accessories that let players manipulate game through physical exercise is seen as a successor to wii fit and continuing quality of life program financial downturn 2010 14 subsequent hardware units under iwata s tenure including nintendo 3ds and wii u were not as successful as ds and wii and nintendo s finances took a downward turn starting in 2010 during development phase of 3ds a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3d without need of accessories iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep nintendo s engineers in line it was hoped that successor to nintendo ds would reinvigorate company after profits began declining however weak sales upon release of nintendo 3ds caused company s stock to fall by 12 percent on july 29 2011 console s poor sales prompted a price cut in august from its launch price of us 250 to us 170 sales of 3ds continually fell below expectations iwata later admitted in 2014 that he had misread market and had not appropriately accounted for changing lifestyles since launch of wii he continually placed focus on family oriented games despite declining popularity wii u released in november 2012 was sold below its production cost as nintendo hoped for stronger software sales to alleviate ongoing losses addition of hd graphics a feature not present in original wii placed unexpected strain on development teams and led to software delays compounding frustration of consumers was iwata s disinterest in competitors such as microsoft and sony both of which experienced similar issues during releases of xbox 360 and playstation 3 respectively paul tassi of forbes claimed that nintendo could have handled change more efficiently by drawing lessons from microsoft and sony s transition to hd graphics console ultimately failed to meet sales expectations and became slowest selling nintendo platform with 9 5 million units sold by june 2015 miyamoto attributed lackluster sales to public misunderstandings of console s concept and functionality iwata later admitted console to be a failure as a successor to wii with games being unable to showcase notable originality in wii u back to back failures of 3ds and wii u prompted akino of asset management co to suggest that iwata should resign from his position nintendo s overall net sales declined from its peak of y 1 8 trillion us 18 7 billion in 2009 to y 549 billion us 4 6 billion in 2015 net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014 in 2010 nintendo revealed that iwata earned a modest salary of y 68 million us 770 000 which increased to y 187 million us 2 11 million with performance based bonuses in comparison miyamoto earned a salary of y 100 million us 1 13 million iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for poor sales while other members of nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20 30 percent this also served to ensure job security of nintendo s employees preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short term finances in 2012 company experienced its first operating loss since entering video game market more than 30 years earlier losses continued for next two years before company finally returned to profitability at end of 2015 fiscal year slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as pokemon omega ruby and alpha sapphire and super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u in june 2013 iwata took on additional role of nintendo of america s ceo as one of his first changes as ceo iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at e3 and instead have several smaller events each aimed at a certain demographic while traveling to tokyo in late 2013 iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with nintendo s games this concept soon developed into amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later amiibo proved to be a huge success with more than 6 million figurines sold by end of 2014 roughly a month after launch by march 2016 combined sales of figures and cards a product released in 2015 exceeded 64 million units proving financially beneficial across all nintendo platforms mobile market and switch 2015 thumb right nintendo switch in its handheld form with joy con controllers attached in early 2010 success of apple inc s mobile app store prompted concern among game developers that medium was shifting to smart devices that july iwata acknowledged competition from apple and considered them enemy of future however during an interview following year iwata appeared entirely against idea of nintendo moving into mobile market claiming company would cease to be nintendo if they did so he reasoned that mobile gaming would lack integrity over quality of games in an effort to turn a profit a slow shift in this view ensued over following years as mobile gaming market continued to grow in 2012 he acknowledged that mobile devices provided significant competition but remained confident in his company s abilities in a message to shareholders in march 2014 fiscal year iwata stated i believe that era has ended when people play all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems he cited convenience of mobile devices for quick entertainment and expansive capabilities over a handheld console s dedicated software criticism arose over his continued stubbornness in moving to mobile market with analysts and investors continually requesting a change in outlook yoshihisa toyosaki president of architect grand design inc claimed that nintendo is out of touch referring to company s history of ignoring outside input this ultimately negatively influenced nintendo s finances and popularity to a degree in march 2015 iwata put part of nintendo s focus on growing mobile game market creating a landmark partnership with mobile provider dena to publish titles as traditional hardware console sales began to falter this came in stark contrast to company s previous business model which put focus on console exclusive titles to prompt people to buy their platforms iwata emphasized that although nintendo ips would be utilized in mobile games company would not compromise their integrity he also stressed that main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn most money similar to idea behind wii after partnership with dena was established iwata reiterated his stance that common free to play type mobile games which he referred to as free to start threatened future quality of games although he acknowledged practice as a viable means of promoting titles in short term he considered model outdated and not a sound direction for core development he also emphasized that business model for these games did not match with core values of nintendo and could not serve as basis of long lasting relationship with nintendo s customers iwata oversaw development of nintendo switch through final months of his life serving as console s head developer in a february 2017 interview with magazine time miyamoto believed iwata s goal for system was to make it portable and allow communication between people iwata focused on technical aspects of device during this stage public relations thumb right iwata was well known for incorporating his humor into his nintendo direct videos such as during a pre recorded video shown at e3 2012 when he stared at bananas in silence for several seconds before turning to camera alt refer to caption during earlier years of his presidency at nintendo iwata would often forego media appearances unless new hardware was being announced in order to spend more time programming however his attitude towards this changed and he eventually became a prominent part of nintendo s public relations iwata helped nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media and he shared insights on nintendo s employees games and hardware through his interview series iwata asks inspiration for this series which began in september 2006 stemmed from iwata s background as a game programmer and his curiosity of mindset of other developers these interviews often showcased friendly camaraderie between iwata and other members of nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace they also revealed a different side of normally secretive nintendo openness to discuss some of inner workings of company in 2011 iwata helped to institute nintendo direct a series of online press conferences open to all that revealed upcoming nintendo games and products outside of typical industry channels these videos were often quirky and humorous reflecting personality of iwata himself this stood completely against generally serious tones displayed by sony and microsoft one such video displayed a mock battle between him and nintendo of america president reggie fils aime to showcase inclusion of mii characters nintendo digital avatars in super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u these frequently spurred creation of internet memes such memes include phrase please understand which was often used by iwata for delays or other negative news adding iwata laughs to forum posts as a reference to his frequent laughter in segments of iwata asks and images of iwata staring silently at a bunch of bananas as part of a pre recorded e3 2012 video to promote donkey kong franchise as a byproduct of his presence in iwata asks and nintendo direct iwata became public face of nintendo iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them even when time did not allow he would mingle with interviewers and chat casually other
