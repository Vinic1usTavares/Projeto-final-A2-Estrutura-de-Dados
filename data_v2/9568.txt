tropical storm grace holds record for being farthest northeast forming tropical cyclone in atlantic basin seventh named storm of slightly below average 2009 atlantic hurricane season grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over azores on october 4 it strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and developed an eye like feature although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited development of thunderstorm activity near center storm lost its tropical characteristics on october 6 and storm s remnants merged with a separate system near british isles on october 7 grace had only minor effects on land although while it was passing through azores islands close to storm s center recorded winds of up to 44 mph 71 km h and moderate rainfall although not solely related to cyclone heavy rainfall in portugal led to some street flooding remnants also impacted parts of ireland and united kingdom where rainfall approaching 2 in 51 mm and tropical storm force winds were recorded however no damage occurred meteorological history tropical storm grace originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on september 27 roughly 470 mi 755 km east of cape race newfoundland initially attached to an occluded front low detached from system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics by october 1 shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop near center of system as it tracked through central azores however following day convection began to decrease with system and national hurricane center nhc ceased monitoring it over following two days system executed a counter clockwise loop near azores during afternoon of october 4 convection redeveloped around center of low and was classified as a tropical storm near sao miguel island although storm was tropical at this time nhc did not issue advisories for several hours first advisory from nhc was issued at 11 00 ast on october 4 at this time system was officially named grace seventh named storm of 2009 atlantic hurricane season storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye like feature although grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclone development low wind shear allowed convection to persist a steady northeastward track was taken by storm in response to a southerly flow over northwestern atlantic storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures with winds estimated at 65 mph 100 km h early on october 5 operationally it was held at 70 mph 110 km h but was downgraded due to uncertainties in storm s intensity as it was progressing over cold waters a large extratropical cyclone near grace caused storm to deteriorate in organization with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric by this time storm was over waters likely inhibiting convective development shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout day on october 5 however grace maintained tropical characteristics namely a deep warm core early on october 6 nhc issued their final advisory on grace as it merged with a frontal system over northeastern atlantic just prior to merging lowest pressure in relation to storm was recorded at 986 mbar hpa 29 12 inhg extratropical remnants of grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over celtic sea early on october 7 however united states naval research laboratory continued to monitor system for several more hours until it moved over north sea although officially designated a tropical cyclone by nhc meteo france french meteorological service stated in their annual report to world meteorological organization that grace should not have been classified a tropical system in their report they argued that although storm presented deep convection an eye like feature and winds above 60 mph 95 km h overall development of grace was more similar to that of a mid latitude non tropical cyclone however operationally meteo france considered grace to be a subtropical cyclone they also criticized nhc for warning on this system based on recent trends of link between global warming and increased hurricane activity impact and records thumb right overcast skies from outskirts of grace in belgium alt dark and stormy clouds with sunlight breaking through in background upon being classified a tropical cyclone within azores a few islands received minor rainfall and high winds gusts up to were recorded on ponta delgada while merging with frontal system on october 6 storm s outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over parts of portugal resulting in some street flooding in higher elevations wind gusts were estimated to have exceeded due to storm s relatively rapid forward movement by time it reached united kingdom rainfall was limited in ireland of precipitation fell in city of cork sustained winds in city were recorded up to rainfall in country peaked at in wexford near coastline of wales a buoy recorded sustained winds up to equivalent to a minimal tropical storm late on october 6 remnants of grace moved inland over wales bringing heavy rains and high winds to region maximum rainfall in united kingdom reached in capel one ship cap castillo call sign recorded sustained winds of on october 5 while located about south of storm s center moisture from storm s remnants fueled another more powerful cyclone that caused flooding in parts of belgium after producing upwards of of rain operationally grace was not classified a tropical storm until it reached latitude 41 2degn this marked second northernmost formation of a tropical storm in atlantic on record only tropical storm alberto of 1988 had formed farther north however a post storm analysis concluded that grace had actually become a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than initially estimated placing its location of development further south at 38 5degn storm still marked farthest northeast a tropical cyclone formed in atlantic basin breaking record set by hurricane vince in 2005 in its tropical cyclone report on grace national hurricane center reported that formation of grace was poorly forecast first mention of precursor low on october 1 predicted that it would not develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone over following three days system was not mentioned in nhc s tropical weather outlooks until just prior to grace s classification lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to storm s unusual location and sparsity of data for storms in region see also tropical cyclones named grace list of azores hurricanes tropical cyclone effects in
