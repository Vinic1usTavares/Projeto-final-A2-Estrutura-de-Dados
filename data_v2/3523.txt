album to feature guitarist zach blair who joined while band was touring in support of sufferer witness according to blair i wanted to go in as if you listen to every record this band rise against had out you could tell that zach blair played on this record he took influence from how nels cline sounded on album sky blue sky when he joined wilco blair was already well acquainted with stevenson

against appeal to reason marked a musical shift from gritty punk rock that had previously defined their career to a more accessible and radio friendly sound with greater emphasis on production value new york times felt album was more tune oriented than band s previous works while john hanson of sputnikmusic said that album is appealing to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with bill stewart of popmatters disagreed with these sentiments writing appeal to reason is a rise against album if you possess more than a passing familiarity with band i wouldn t even bother scrolling through rest of this review and i d certainly avoid checking out rating at end of it because that first sentence for better or worse says everything that needs to be said about this album critics have characterized album s music as melodic hardcore with influences of pop punk majority of album s lyrics discuss political issues in united states jeff miers of buffalo news calls album a response to oppressive of bush years in regards to specific tracks on album allmusic states that rise against rages against moral decay rotting core of u s on opening collapse post amerika just as they strike out against slow dumbing down of america on re education through labor in addition to political topics more personal issues constitute a large portion of lyrical content savior is about forgiveness and broken relationships while dirt whispered is about need to sacrifice for what a person loves bassist joe principe said political side of this band is just that it s a side there are political lyrics there are social awareness and there are lyrics about environment i think if people take time to read lyrics they ll know we re not strictly force feeding you our politics album includes one acoustic song hero of war which is about an iraq war veteran looking back on his war experiences it is described by rolling stone as an ambivalent aggro folk track mcilrath said of song i wanted to take perspective of what is war going to be looked back on as in another interview mcilrath stated it was a way to document what s going on like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come he went on to say there are not many songs talking about what s going on during eight years of occupation in iraq that combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories about what is going on on ground amid all bullshit showed me differences from what is really happening to what is happening in news media i just thought that this needed to go into a song release appeal to reason was released on october 7 2008 it was first rise against album to be released by interscope records in united states album peaked at number three on

intelligence there is no fluff here band has put together a fast smart and generally focused piece of work here rolling stone magazine commented on band s further emergence into mainstream with appeal to reason and wrote rise against may be nervous about leaving underground behind but with sharp songs like these they re ready for rest of world a v club aaron burgess agreed with this statement and wrote that uptempo tracks such as savior kotov syndrome and entertainment would convince long time fans that rise against had not sold out appeal to reason also had less positive reception with most negative reviews criticizing band s further movement into mainstream entertainment weekly commented songs like re education through labor and entertainment which seeks to redress evils of media manipulation upon land are peppy but pretty empty power chord downers with little bark or bite popmatters said mcilrath rarely reaches beyond his one note vocal performance despite apparent and commendable earnestness review further chastised blair s formulaic three chord guitar playing through album while reviewing rise against s next album endgame alternative press critic scott heisel wrote sure it may have sold half a million copies but rise against s appeal to reason was in our humble opinion a dud album was a slow lumbering affair that seemingly betrayed band s natural melodic
