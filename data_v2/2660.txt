both great depression and world war ii were detrimental to nhl although league peaked at ten teams between 1926 and 1931 financial pressures led to demise of several of these in 1930 pittsburgh pirates relocated to become philadelphia quakers before folding in 1931 in 1934 ottawa senators became st louis eagles and likewise ceased operations after one year in their new market montreal maroons suspended operations in 1937 as montreal market was unable to support two teams new york americans renamed brooklyn americans suspended operations in 1942 citing financial difficulty and a lack of players due to war by 1942 43 season league was reduced to six teams those six teams are now known somewhat misleadingly as original six there was no more expansion or contraction until 1967

permission to play in new york with only five returning players from previous season rangers general manager lester patrick suggested suspension of his team s play for duration of war patrick was otherwise persuaded however rangers managed only six wins in a 50 game schedule giving up 310 goals that year rangers were so desperate for players that 42 year old coach frank boucher made a brief comeback recording four goals and ten assists in 15 games that year canadiens dominated league finishing with a 38 5 7 record five losses remains a league record for fewest in one season canadiens did not lose a game on home ice their 1944 stanley cup victory was team s first in 14 seasons canadiens again dominated 1944 45 finishing with a 38 8 4 record they were defeated in playoffs by underdog

years other teams and leagues attempted to challenge for cup in 1947 nhl reached an agreement with trustees p d ross and cooper smeaton to grant cup control to nhl thereby allowing league to reject challenges from other leagues last such challenge came in 1953 from cleveland barons of american hockey league it was rejected as ahl was not considered of equivalent calibre to nhl which was a condition of nhl s deal with trustees hockey hall of fame was established in 1943 under leadership of james t sutherland a former president of canadian amateur hockey association caha hall of fame was established as a joint venture between nhl and caha in kingston ontario considered by sutherland birthplace of hockey originally called international hockey hall of fame its mandate was to honor great

1944 45 lach richard and blake finished first second and third in nhl s scoring race with 80 73 and 67 points respectively richard became a media and fan focus with attempts to score 50 goals in a 50 game season a feat no other player had accomplished in league history during that season in a 9 1 victory over detroit on december 28 1944 richard set a single game scoring record scoring five goals and three assists later scoring his 45th goal in his 42nd game he broke joe malone s goal scoring record opposing teams did all they could to prevent him from reaching 50 goal mark he was slashed elbowed and held as no team wanted to be known for giving up 50th goal despite opposition s efforts in boston at 17 45 of third period of montreal s final game of season richard scored his 50th goal

1955 richard was suspended for remainder of season including playoffs after receiving a match penalty for slashing boston s hal laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene suspension created a wave of anger towards campbell who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in montreal after receiving numerous death threats mainly from french canadians accusing him of anti french bias dismissing warnings campbell attended march 17 game as planned his presence was interpreted by many fans as provocation he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit an hour into game a fan lobbed a tear gas bomb in campbell s direction firefighters decided to clear building a riot ensued outside forum as disenchanted fans leaving forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators hostile crowd overwhelmed 250 police officers on scene seventy people were arrested another 37 people were injured fifty stores were looted and 100 000 in property damage was reported in what became known as

following year to win cup while canadiens were eliminated in 1955 stanley cup finals richard led montreal to 1956 stanley cup incident highlighted growing cultural gap between french quebec and english canada riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of quebec s quiet revolution campbell s decision to suspend richard was widely supported by fans outside of quebec some including detroit s ted lindsay said suspension did not go far enough and argued richard a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history should have been banned for life on october 19 1957 richard became first player to score 500 career goals he retired in 1960 as an eight time stanley cup champion as well as nhl s all time leading scorer with 544 goals in 1961 league waived customary

conn smythe watched special television feeds of maple leaf games television already had detractors within nhl especially campbell who declared it greatest menace of entertainment world in 1952 even though only 10 of canadians owned a television set canadian broadcasting corporation cbc began televising games on november 1 1952 hockey night in canada was first broadcast on television with foster hewitt calling action between leafs and bruins at maple leaf gardens broadcasts quickly became highest rated show on canadian television broadcast came three weeks after montreal radio host rene presented a french language telecast of montreal canadiens opener against chicago marking beginning of la soiree du hockey which radio canada french arm of cbc broadcast until 2004 on that same night danny gallivan made his debut as english language play by play announcer for canadiens while campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person smythe felt opposite there ll be thousands of people seeing hockey as played by pros for first time they ll be sold on it because it s a great game and they won t be satisfied to stay at home but will turn out to rinks as an experiment in 1956 57 season cbs first broadcast hockey games in united states amazed with initial popularity of broadcasts it inaugurated a 21 game package of games following year nhl itself adapted to become viewer friendly in 1949 to make puck easier to see league mandated ice surface painted white in 1951 so each team was distinguishable on black and white television league required home teams wear colored jerseys and road teams wear white for same reason teams painted centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from solid blue lines dynasties toronto maple leafs thumb

barilko and a friend disappeared in northern ontario where they had flown on a fishing trip barilko s disappearance became front page news across canada a massive search failed to locate missing plane barilko s remains were not found until 1962 first year maple leafs won cup since barilko s overtime winner eleven years previous barilko s disappearance was immortalized 40 years later by canadian rock band tragically hip in their 1992 song fifty mission cap by 1962 disappearance of bill barilko and maple leafs subsequent failure to win stanley cup led toronto fans to believe a curse was upon team leafs won 1962 championship shortly before barilko s remains were discovered in 1963 they repeated as champions in 1964 leafs again played for stanley cup against red wings in third period of game six trailing series 3 2 maple leafs defenceman bobby baun suffered a broken ankle from a gordie howe slap shot despite injury baun returned with his ankle taped up to score winning goal in

stanley cup titles in early 1950s beginning in 1948 49 red wings went on to win seven consecutive regular season titles a feat no other team has accomplished during that time wings won four stanley cups during 1952 stanley cup finals legend of octopus was created for fourth game of finals brothers pete and jerry brought a dead octopus to detroit olympia at time they reasoned eight tentacles of an octopus represented eight wins required to win stanley cup wings had won seven consecutive playoff games and brothers hoped octopus would inspire detroit to an eighth victory tradition was born as detroit handily defeated montreal 3 0 during this time wings were led by gordie howe in 1943 at age of 15 howe was invited to rangers player camp in winnipeg but quickly became homesick and failed to favorably impress rangers coaches next season red wings invited him to their camp where coach jack adams called him best prospect i ve seen in 20 years two years later at age of 18 howe debuted in nhl for detroit on march 28 1950 during a playoff game against leafs howe was nearly killed as he mistimed an attempted check on toronto s ted kennedy causing him to slam head first into boards rushed to hospital doctors drilled a hole into howe s skull to relieve pressure on his brain despite fears he would never play again mr hockey recovered to start following season then won his first of four

between 1954 and 1956 red wings faced canadiens in stanley cup finals detroit won first two match ups however montreal captured 1956 stanley cup ending one dynasty and starting another subsequently canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960 a feat no other team has duplicated in 1953 canadiens signed jean beliveau a well anticipated prospect in nhl for years because his quebec senior hockey league team quebec aces matched any contract offer canadiens made beliveau repeatedly refused to turn professional with montreal ultimately montreal bought entire league outright along with rights to all players and turned it professional beliveau finally signed with montreal for 105 000 over five years and a 20 000 bonus an unprecedented contract for a rookie playing for montreal beliveau went on to win ten stanley cups led by richard and beliveau 1950s canadiens had overwhelming offensive ability to slow their offence nhl amended its rules to illustrate 1955 56 canadiens frequently scored multiple goals during same two minute powerplay in one game against boston during a penalty beliveau scored three goals in 44 seconds for following season league instituted a rule permitting a player serving a minor penalty to return to ice when a goal was scored against his team breaking colour barrier on january 18 1958 by joining bruins as an injury call up for a game in montreal willie o ree became first black player in nhl playing only two games with bruins in 1957 58 season o ree returned in 1960 61 playing another 43 games with boston although he only played 45 nhl games scoring four goals he earned label jackie robinson of hockey throughout season o ree faced blatant racism from opponents remarking people just wanted a piece of me maybe because they thought i was different so i had to defend myself i wasn t going to be run out of any rink he endured racial slurs from fans in each of chicago detroit and new york though taunts were largely absent in montreal and toronto o ree was supported by his teammates and boston fans he stated they were mean to me in places like detroit and new york too but never in boston i ll never forget how my teammates there took care of me men like johnny bucyk doug charlie burns and don mckenney they accepted me totally all of them had class in 1961 o ree was traded to montreal but was unable to crack canadiens line up playing over 20 minor league seasons o ree twice won western hockey league s scoring title in 1964 with los angeles blades and in 1969 with san diego gulls o ree s breakthrough came several years after another black player herb carnegie was denied same opportunity in 1938 39 playing junior hockey with ontario hockey association s toronto rangers during a practice carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told see that man sitting in blues that s conn smythe owner of toronto maple leafs he says he d take you tomorrow if he could turn you white stung by comments carnegie resolved to excel at game he was offered a tryout with rangers in 1950 then a spot on their lowest minor league team they told me that if i signed with rangers and went to new haven i would make international headlines i told them my family couldn t eat headlines that was probably when rangers decided to forget about me norris house league during 1960s it was often joked nhl stood for norris house league because norris family held interests in several league teams james d norris was co owner of black hawks along with arthur wirtz his brother bruce inherited ownership of red wings james d norris was also largest shareholder in madison square garden giving him control over rangers black hawks qualified for playoffs only once between 1949 and 1957 team s fortunes turned in 1958 59 following acquisition of ted lindsay and glenn hall from detroit making playoffs black hawks lost to montreal in semi finals in 1959 and 1960 before capturing their first championship in 23 years in 1961 stanley cup finals chicago next won cup 49 years later in 2009 10 season hawks resurgence in 1960s led norris and wirtz to take advantage of their customers dubbed chicken wings by fans hawks were famous for fleecing fans ticket sellers were arrested for scalping team charged 9 for playoff tickets in 1965 3 more than detroit toronto or montreal hawks also refused to broadcast road playoff games in chicago preferring to charge fans to watch games via closed circuit television at chicago stadium fans responded by littering ice and passing out leaflets urging a boycott of team during chicago s last regular season game in 1964 65 expansion in 1963 rangers governor william jennings introduced to his peers idea of expanding league to american west coast by adding two new teams for 1964 65 season his argument was based around concerns western hockey league intended to operate in near future as a major league jennings also hoped inclusion of teams on west coast would make league truly national and thereby improve chances of returning to television in united states as nhl had lost its deal with cbs while governors did not agree to proposal topic of expansion surfaced every time owners met subsequently in 1965 there was agreement to expand by six teams doubling size of nhl san francisco oakland and vancouver were declared acceptable cities with los angeles and st louis as potential sites fourteen applications were received from across canada and united states including four from los angeles in february 1966 governors met and awarded franchises to los angeles minnesota philadelphia pittsburgh san francisco and st louis league rejected bids from baltimore buffalo and vancouver six winning bids each paid 2 million for their franchises st louis was awarded a franchise with no bid received league s decision to grant a franchise was contingent on a potential owner stepping forward a decision influenced by norris and wirtz families who owned st louis arena canadians were outraged no expansion teams were awarded to canada prime minister lester b pearson stated nhl decision to expand only in u s on sacred principles of all canadians maple leafs coach punch imlach stated vancouver was sold out and toronto and montreal did not want to share television revenue with another canadian team leafs co owner stafford smythe rejected accusations that he opposed expansion to vancouver pointing out that he had offered to build and operate an 8 million facility in city s downtown area a proposal that he contended made little sense unless vancouver had an nhl team however smythe s proposal was contingent on him acquiring parcel of land required from city then valued at 2 5 million for 1 proposed transaction was defeated in a municipal referendum smythe therefore placed blame for vancouver s failed bid on city vancouver lost its chance day it turned down referendum on our arena proposal smythe said that proved to me that people out there aren t interested in going major league original six era ended with 1967 stanley cup finals between two time defending champion canadiens and maple leafs oldest team in league third place leafs were led in goal by 37 year old terry sawchuk and 42 year old johnny bower known as over hill gang in six games toronto became oldest team to win cup defeating favored canadiens maple leafs have not appeared in stanley cup finals since rules and innovations in 1942 due to world war ii related travel restrictions league president frank calder abolished 10 minute overtime for regular season games so teams could catch their trains without delay with war s conclusion regular season overtime did not return although playoff games continued until a winner was decided overtime was re introduced in regular 1983 84 season in 1943 to make it more entertaining rules committee looked to increase game s speed rangers coach frank boucher proposed neutral zone divided by a centre red line so teams could pass puck out of defensive zone into their half of neutral zone previously league required defensive players carry puck from defensive zone not permitting a pass across blue line introduced in 1943 44 new rule changed game formerly strong fore checking pinned opponents in their own zone for minutes at a time subsequently teams rushed up ice with defencemen passing to forwards beyond blue line scoring increased 10 league wide four of six teams topped 200 goals first time teams did so in early 1960s stan mikita inadvertently introduced curved blade to a hockey stick cracking his blade during a practice and not wanting to retrieve another mikita shot puck in anger he noticed curve in cracked blade caused puck to behave differently both mikita and bobby hull experimented with heating and bending their stick blade to create different curves using a curved blade mikita went on to win four art ross trophies as nhl s leading scorer he later said he regretted idea it s one of worst inventions in hockey because it eliminated use of backhand nhl amateur draft was first held on june 5 1963 at queen elizabeth hotel in montreal quebec created by campbell it was meant to more evenly distribute talent to that point teams directly sponsored junior clubs buying a player s rights a 16 year old with st michaels juveniles garry monahan was first player selected in 1963 draft monahan remains youngest player ever selected in an nhl draft entry draft system did not fully replace sponsorship system until 1969 goaltending right thumb jacques plante s original fibreglass mask goaltender clint benedict was first to wear facial protection donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose because its design interfered with his vision benedict quickly abandoned mask twenty nine years later jacques plante made goalie mask a permanent fixture in hockey in 1956 plante began wearing a mask in practice after shots from teammates twice broke cheekbones montreal coach toe blake refused to allow plante to wear his mask in games on november 1 1959 in a game at madison square garden that changed when plante was struck in face teams did not dress backup goaltenders game was delayed 20 minutes while doctors frantically stitched up plante when blake asked plante if he was ready to return plante refused unless allowed to wear his mask livid blake agreed only if plante removed mask when his face was healed wearing mask plante led canadiens on an 18 game unbeaten streak to finally remove mask at blake s urging promptly team lost their first game defeated blake relented plante s mask became a permanent fixture as he led canadiens to their fifth consecutive stanley cup soon after other goalies followed plante s lead remarkably terry sawchuk played goal for most of his career not wearing a mask he crouched very low such that his shoulders nearly touched his knees this stance became known as gorilla crouch during his career sawchuk relied on his ability to see puck under players bodies his outstanding mobility and reflexes to win four vezina trophies by 1955 he was regarded as greatest goaltender to ever play game sawchuk s career was cut short when he died in 1970 from injuries suffered in a drunken incident with teammate ron stewart hall of fame waived its waiting period immediately inducting sawchuk as nhl s all time record holder in wins 447 and shutouts 103 sawchuk s style of play was a precursor to modern goaltending butterfly style butterfly style used by most all modern goaltenders was invented by glenn hall considered both unique and foolish hall s style of dropping to his knees and kicking his pads out in a v formation forced shooters to aim for top half of net hall adopted technique as a youth when he lacked arm strength to stop shots with his stick an eight time all star hall became an nhl regular at start of 1955 1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for detroit and chicago this record is hailed as one of nhl s most unbreakable unionization first players union was formed february 12 1957 by red wings player ted lindsay who had sat on board of nhl s pension society since 1952 lindsay and his fellow players were upset by league s refusal to let them view books related to pension fund league claimed that it was barely breaking even financially and so could not contribute more than it did players on pension committee suspected otherwise leading lindsay and doug harvey of canadiens to discussions on forming a union in 1956 idea quickly gained popularity and when union s founding was announced publicly every nhl player had signed up with exception of ted kennedy who was retiring owners immediately worked to crush union toronto owner conn smythe compared players association to communism i feel that anything spawned in secrecy as this association was certainly has to have some odour to it red wings president bruce norris responded by trading lindsay to his brother s team black hawks move was widely seen as punitive as hawks had finished last in nhl every season save one from 1949 until 1957 lindsay was not only player sent to chicago as punishment glenn hall was included as he refused to distance himself from lindsay in toronto smythe repeatedly benched jim thomson who was union s secretary before also dealing him to black hawks players association responded by filing a 3 million antitrust lawsuit against nhl persuaded by teammates gordie howe and red kelly red wings players voted to withdraw from association in november 1957 other teams quickly followed and union capitulated union leadership ultimately agreed to drop lawsuit in exchange for small concessions which included a minimum annual salary of 7 000 increases to pension contributions and moving expenses for traded players led by alan eagleson national hockey league players association nhlpa was formed in 1967 eagleson became sport s first player agent in 1966 when he negotiated a deal on behalf of bobby orr with bruins that saw 18 year old rookie become highest paid player in nhl at its peak eagleson s practice represented 150 professional athletes eagleson had also helped settle an american
