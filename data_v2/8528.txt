battle of cedars was a series of military confrontations early in american revolutionary war during continental army s invasion of canada that had begun in september 1775 skirmishes which involved limited combat occurred in may 1776 at and around cedars west of montreal british north america continental army units were opposed by a small force of british troops leading a larger force of indians primarily iroquois and militia brigadier general benedict arnold commanding american military garrison at montreal had placed a detachment of his troops at cedars in april 1776 after hearing of rumors of british and indian military preparations to west of montreal garrison surrendered on may 19 after a confrontation with a combined force of british and indian troops led by captain george forster american reinforcements on their way to cedars were also captured after a brief skirmish on may 20 all of captives were eventually released after negotiations between forster and arnold who was bringing a sizable force into area terms of agreement required americans to release an equal number of british prisoners but deal was repudiated by congress and no british prisoners were freed colonel timothy bedel and lieutenant isaac butterfield leaders of american force at cedars were court martialed and cashiered from continental army for their roles in affair after distinguishing himself as a volunteer bedel was given a new commission in 1777 news of affair included greatly inflated reports of casualties and often included graphic but false accounts of atrocities committed by iroquois who made up majority of british forces background cedars is on north shore of saint lawrence river about from center of modern montreal to southwest of western tip of island of montreal from which it is separated by ottawa river nearby rapids in saint lawrence required portage making cedars a strategic landing point for anyone navigating river to or from montreal smith 1907 vol 2 p 365 crossing of

vaudreuil smith 1907 vol 2 p 372 montreal in september 1775 early in american revolutionary war a continental army under direction first of major general philip schuyler and later of brigadier general richard montgomery invaded british province of quebec montreal was taken without a fight on november 13 following siege of fort st jean montgomery left a garrison of troops under command of major general david wooster in control of montreal before leading rest of army to quebec city occupation of montreal was poorly managed and relations between americans and population including those supportive of americans deteriorated for a variety of reasons one major factor that contributed to poor relations was american interdiction of trade with indian populations on upper st lawrence and great lakes since trade goods might be used to support british garrisons in those areas fur trade was economically important to city and its interruption affected both supporters and opponents of american cause these events are recounted in great detail in e g smith 1907 vol 1 lanctot 1967 and stanley 1973 thumb right upright 1 0 major general david wooster alt a black and white mezzotint print of a three quarter length portrait wooster is standing facing left wearing a military uniform holding a pike in right hand with his left hand resting on a cannon following american losses at battle of quebec at end of 1775 wooster eventually led reinforcements to quebec he arrived early in april 1776 and military administration of montreal passed temporarily to colonel moses hazen before going to brigadier general benedict arnold who had been in command at quebec american forces occupying city numbered about 500 with additional forces at posts outside city wooster had reported to general schuyler as early as march 5 of rumored scheming between british troops and indians to west of city wooster 1885 pp 122 123 in response to these alarming reports as well as unauthorized departures of two fur traders and claude de lorimier a british indian agent from montreal hazen had sent 400 troops commanded by colonel timothy bedel of bedel s regiment to occupy a strategic position at cedars in early april lanctot 1967 p 141 establishes date but incorrectly assumes arnold issued order arnold was still at quebec city as was wooster on april 2 arnold confirmed order when he arrived in montreal later in april smith vol 2 p 365 lieutenant isaac butterfield led an advance force that arrived at cedars on april 26 and began construction of a wooden stockade fort fortifying it with two 4 pound cannons bedel and rest of detachment arrived on may 6 smith 1907 vol 2 p 366 british call to arms indian agent lorimier traveled west to oswegatchie where a company of 8th regiment of foot under command of george forster had occupied fort de la presentation leighton 2000 lorimier proposed recruiting a force of indians to launch an attack on continental forces at montreal from west when forster agreed lorimier went to saint regis where he recruited 100 mohawk men from akwesasne word of these activities led american rebels to fortify cedars smith 1907 vol 2 p 363 at fort niagara in early may loyalist captain john butler held a conference with several hundred tribesmen primarily from six nations of iroquois in which his goal was to break pledges of neutrality some of them had made in 1775 butler an experienced indian agent plied natives with liquor and tales of combat he convinced more than 50 seneca cayuga and onondaga warriors to join british cause as well as some warriors from further west glatthaar 2007 pp 112 113 historians are uncertain whether any of these recruits participated in action at cedars but it appears unlikely stanley 1973 is of opinion that indian participation was limited to those recruited by lorimier who went as far as gananoque to recruit stanley 1973 p 119 lanctot 1967 and smith do not identify any specific tribes participating in action smith 1907 vol 2 p histories of this action e g stone 1838 p 153 and beers 1883 p 93 claim that joseph brant was among indian leaders participating in this action this assertion is largely based on behavior of one of warriors and arnold s memoirs smith vol 2 p 596 documents that brant went to england in november 1775 and did not return to new york until june 1776 barbara graymont s recent biography of brant graymont 2000 does not mention event at all james stanley goddard one of fur traders who left with lorimier traveled further west in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to raise an indian force to oppose americans occupying quebec he reached fort michilimackinac in june where british commander captain arent depeyster sent him recruiting among menominee and winnebago tribes near green bay depeyster also sent out joseph a local indian interpreter to recruit from tribes closer to fort none of indians recruited by these men reached montreal until well after americans had left city barnett 2003 p 27 prelude once forces began assembling at oswegatchie lorimier made arrangements with a sympathetic priest near cedars for provisioning of supplies for troops with assistance of some men of 8th foot he strategically hid several shallow draft boats known as bateaux near a point where saint lawrence river could be crossed kingsford 1893 pp 63 64 forster left oswegatchie on may 12 with about 40 regular troops 10 british and french speaking canadien militia and 160 iroquois on may 14 they picked up 44 more iroquois at saint francis and camped at western end of saint francis lake on may 16 kingsford 1893 p 46 on may 17 forster received scouting reports about troop strength at cedars indians were concerned about number of troops but news that americans were in retreat from quebec emboldened them to act on may 15 bedel left cedars leaving butterfield in charge of fort bedel later claimed that reason for his departure was to meet with friendly caughnawaga indians in his court martial judges concluded this claim was suspect smith 1907 vol 2 p 593 he returned to montreal and reported that a force of 150 british troops of 8th foot and about 500 iroquois commanded by forster was approaching on this news colonel john paterson sent major henry sherburne with 140 men from his regiment toward cedars jones 1882 p 55 arnold who was meeting with retreating continental army command at sorel returned to montreal when news reached him and set about organizing a larger relief force martin 1997 p 210 battle cedars 300px thumb left map showing military movements british movements are in red american movements are in blue alt movements are explained in article text forster s force landed near american occupied fort on may 18 and sent in a demand for surrender butterfield countered with a request to withdraw under arms which forster refused parties exchanged fire during course of exchange forster received word that sherburne had crossed ottawa river from island of montreal to quinze chenes but believing cedars to have fallen already had retreated back across river this news caused besiegers to redouble their efforts next day additional help arrived for british in form of about 40 canadiens under jean baptiste de montigny forster sent them to harass sherburne word then came to forster that sherburne had resumed his advance butterfield unaware of this surrendered fort kingsford 1893 pp 47 1955 p 195 terms of capitulation included a guarantee of personal safety of captured men iroquois plundered fort s stores and denied some of captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items quinze chenes sherburne reached fort anne across ottawa river from quinze chenes on may 17 a scout he sent across river next day was captured by lorimier scout was allowed to notify sherburne of his capture in his message he included a claim that 500 indians had surrounded fort at cedars consequently sherburne decided to delay crossing river and sent word back to montreal requesting further assistance sherburne decided to advance on may 20 some of his men were apparently suffering from aftereffects of smallpox so these were left behind sherburne landed about 100 of his men at quinze chenes about from cedars when word of this crossing reached forster he ordered lorimier to take 100 indians and stop sherburne lorimier was at first only able to raise 40 warriors but was joined on way by another 40 sherburne not realizing that butterfield had already surrendered marched his troops right at lorimier s advancing force they fought for about 40 minutes before sherburne believing he was being attacked by a much larger force surrendered kingsford 1893 pp 49 50 iroquois claimed these captives as war spoils since they were not part of fort s garrison and prepared to kill some of them in retaliation for their own losses only intervention of forster who paid a ransom prevented this it did not prevent iroquois from stripping prisoners of all but their clothes kingsford 1893 p 51 arnold s relief right upright 1 0 thumb brigadier general benedict arnold alt a head and shoulders profile engraving of arnold he is

loyalist militia had assembled leaving some of prisoners there he advanced on may 23 to fort senneville a fortified works on southwest tip of montreal island that was owned by montigny in meantime arnold gathered most of few remaining forces in montreal and sent requests to outposts around city for additional troops by may 24 he was entrenched at lachine south of city and his force had reached 450 men forster began to advance on lachine but decided to retreat back to quinze chenes when his scouts notified him of arnold s position he also received intelligence from montreal that arnold s force was going to be massively reinforced reported number of reinforcements was 1 500 to 2 000 men more than arnold had available in area martin 1997 p 1893 p 52 once his scouts reported forster s retreat arnold gave chase he reached fort senneville which he burned on may 26 just as forster s men were landing on far shore at quinze chenes kingsford 1893 p 54 arnold decided to send a group of who were friendly to americans with a demand that forster release his prisoners and a threat that he would destroy area indian villages if any of prisoners were harmed forster countered that he would permit his indians to kill prisoners if arnold attacked arnold attempted to cross ottawa river with some of his men in bateaux but forster used four pounders captured at cedars to drive them back

called a war council so americans could consider their options he wanted to mount a surprise attack next morning hazen who had acquired significant experience fighting indians in french and indian war argued against idea disagreement between two men was severe enough that it nearly provoked arnold to file charges of insubordination against hazen council decided not to act voting arnold s proposed attack down kingsford 1893 p 55 early in morning of may 27 a boat crossed river carrying sherburne and forster s deputy lieutenant parke forster whose forces were somewhat reduced as some of indians had returned to their homes had negotiated a prisoner exchange with sherburne and butterfield after further negotiations both arnold and forster agreed to terms american prisoners were returned to arnold at fort anne on may 30 after being delayed for two days by high winds on river kingsford 1893 p 1997 p 214 aftermath americans never held up their side of prisoner exchange formally repudiating agreement over protests of george washington congress accused forster of mistreating american prisoners by turning them over to indians in a breach of etiquette letter containing repudiation was delivered to lieutenant general john burgoyne instead of british commander in chief and governor of province guy carleton congressional action may have been tainted by overly lurid accounts of action charles carroll part of a congressional delegation that was in montreal at time reported that a hundred or more american troops were murdered by savages kingsford 1893 p 60 arnold s report of incident included otherwise unsubstantiated allegations that two prisoners were killed by forster s indians some histories of action for example 1882 history by jones include accounts of significant atrocities committed by indians but little supporting evidence has been found congressional repudiation complicated an attempted prisoner exchange in 1781 involving burgoyne and henry laurens a congressman from south carolina whom british were holding in tower of london laurens was eventually freed in exchange for a promise to help negotiate lord cornwallis s release cobbett 1814 pp 860 2007 pp 182 185 arnold initially blamed bedel for defeat he removed both bedel and butterfield from command and sent them to sorel for court martial due to army s retreat two men were not tried until august 1 1776 at fort ticonderoga both were convicted and cashiered from army jones 1882 pp 56 57 bedel continued to volunteer his services and following burgoyne s surrender at saratoga in october 1777 he was given a new commission by congress smith 1907 vol 2 p 1915 p 499 site of some of skirmishes was designated a national historic site of canada in 1928 see also list of national historic sites of canada in
