country apart from use in textiles in form of cotton lint yarn thread cloth and garments its seeds are used for oil extraction diseases viruses and pests affect yield of bt cotton varieties cotton leaf curl virus which is a plant pathogenic virus of family stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield pests like white fly mealy bugs aphids pink boll worm infect plants reducing yield exports 474
