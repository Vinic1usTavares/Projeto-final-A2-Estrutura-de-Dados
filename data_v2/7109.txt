of human behaviour and culture a similar organisation institute for study of human knowledge ishk was established in united states under directorship of stanford university psychology professor robert ornstein whom shah appointed as his deputy in u s in his writings shah presented sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated islam emphasizing that sufism was not static but always adapted itself to current time place and people he framed his teaching in western psychological terms shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self reflection in reader he is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous mulla nasrudin stories shah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background his role in controversy surrounding a new translation of rubaiyat of omar khayyam published by his friend robert graves and his older brother omar ali shah came in for particular scrutiny however he also had many notable defenders chief among them novelist doris lessing shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for sufism in west and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of western universities his works have played a significant part in presenting sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom approachable by individuals and not necessarily attached to any specific religion though commonly mistaken as a moslem sect sufis are at home in all religions life family and early life idries shah was born in simla india to an afghan indian father sirdar ikbal ali shah a writer and diplomat and a scottish mother saira elizabeth luiza shah his family on paternal side were musavi sayyids their ancestral home was near paghman gardens of kabul his paternal grandfather sayed amjad ali shah was nawab of in north indian state of uttar pradesh a hereditary title family had gained thanks to services an earlier ancestor jan fishan khan had rendered to british p 13 reprint by elibron classics 2001 shah mainly grew up in vicinity of london according to l f rushbrook williams shah began accompanying his father in his travels from a very young age and although they both travelled widely and often they always returned to england where family made their home for many years through these travels which were often part of ikbal ali shah s sufi work shah was able to meet and spend time with prominent statesmen and distinguished personalities in both east and west williams writes such an upbringing presented to a young man of marked intelligence such as idries shah soon proved himself to possess many opportunities to acquire a truly international outlook a broad vision and an acquaintance with people and places that any professional diplomat of more advanced age and longer experience might well envy but a career of diplomacy did not attract idries shah shah described his own unconventional upbringing in a 1971 bbc interview with pat williams he described how his father and his extended family and friends always tried to expose children to a multiplicity of impacts and a wide range of contacts and experiences with intention of producing a well rounded person shah described this as sufi approach to education after his family moved from london to oxford in 1940 to escape blitz german bombing he spent two or three years at city of oxford high school for boys in 1945 he accompanied his father to uruguay as secretary to his father s halal meat mission he returned to england in october 1946 following allegations of improper business dealings personal life shah married parsi cynthia in 1958 they had a daughter saira in 1964 followed by twins a son tahir and another daughter safia in 1966 friendship with gerald gardner and robert graves and publication of sufis towards end of 1950s shah established contact with wiccan circles in london and then acted as a secretary and companion to gerald gardner founder of modern wicca for some time in those days shah used to hold court for anyone interested in sufism at a table in cosmo restaurant in swiss cottage north london every tuesday evening in 1960 shah founded his publishing house octagon press one of its first titles was gardner s biography gerald gardner witch book was attributed to one of gardner s followers jack l bracelin but had in fact been written by shah according to wiccan frederic lamond bracelin s name was used because shah did not want to confuse his sufi students by being seen to take an interest in another esoteric tradition lamond said that shah seemed to have become somewhat disillusioned with gardner and had told him one day when he was visiting for tea when i was interviewing gerald i sometimes wished i was a news of world reporter what marvellous material for an expose and yet i have it on good authority that this group will be cornerstone of religion of coming age but rationally rationally i can t see it in january 1961 while on a trip to mallorca with gardner shah met english poet robert graves shah wrote to graves from his pension in palma requesting an opportunity of saluting you one day before very long he added that he was currently researching ecstatic religions and that he had been attending experiments conducted by witches in britain into mushroom eating and so on a topic that had been of interest to graves for some time shah also told graves that he was intensely preoccupied at moment with carrying forward of ecstatic and intuitive knowledge graves and shah soon became close friends and confidants graves took a supportive interest in shah s writing career and encouraged him to publish an authoritative treatment of sufism for a western readership along with practical means for its study this was to become sufis shah managed to obtain a substantial advance on book resolving temporary financial difficulties in 1964 sufis appeared published by doubleday with a long introduction by robert graves book chronicles impact of sufism on development of western civilisation and traditions from seventh century onward through work of such figures as roger bacon john of cross raymond lully chaucer and others and has become a classic like shah s other books on topic sufis was conspicuous for avoiding terminology that might have identified his interpretation of sufism with traditional islam book also employed a deliberately scattered style shah wrote to graves that its aim was to de condition people and prevent their reconditioning had it been otherwise he might have used a more conventional form of exposition book sold poorly at first and shah invested a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it graves told him not to worry even though he had some misgivings about writing and was hurt that shah had not allowed him to proofread it before publication he said he was so proud in having assisted in its publication and assured shah that it was a marvellous book and will be recognised as such before long leave it to find its own readers who will hear your voice spreading not those envisaged by doubleday john g bennett and gurdjieff connection in june 1962 a couple of years prior to publication of sufis shah had also established contact with members of movement that had formed around mystical teachings of gurdjieff and ouspensky a press article had appeared augy hayter a student of both idries and omar ali shah asserts that article published in blackwood s magazine was written by idries shah under a pseudonym when reggie hoare a gurdjieffian and associate of bennett s wrote to author care of magazine intrigued by description of exercises known only to a very small number of gurdjieff students it was shah who replied to hoare and hoare who introduced shah to bennett shah himself according to hayter later described blackwood s magazine article as trawling describing author s visit to a secret monastery in central asia where methods strikingly similar to gurdjieff s methods were apparently being taught otherwise unattested monastery had it was implied a representative in england one of ouspensky s earliest pupils reggie hoare who had been part of gurdjieff work since 1924 made contact with shah through that article hoare attached special significance to what shah had told him about symbol and said that shah had revealed secrets about it that went far beyond what we had heard from ouspensky through hoare shah was introduced to other gurdjieffians including john g bennett a noted gurdjieff student and founder of an institute for comparative study of history philosophy and sciences located at coombe springs a estate in kingston upon thames surrey at that time bennett had already investigated sufi origins of many of gurdjieff s teachings based on both gurdjieff s own numerous statements and on travels bennett himself made in east where he met various sufi sheikhs he was convinced that gurdjieff had adopted many of ideas and techniques of sufis and that for those who heard gurdjieff s lectures in early 1920s sufi origin of his teaching was unmistakable to anyone who had studied both bennett wrote about his first meeting with shah in his autobiography witness 1974 at first i was wary i had just decided to go forward on my own and now another teacher had appeared one or two conversations with reggie convinced me that i ought at least to see for myself elizabeth and i went to dinner with to meet shah who turned out to be a young man in his early 40s he spoke impeccable english and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an english public school type our first impressions were unfavourable he was restless smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression halfway through evening our attitude completely changed we recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man but that he had indefinable something that marks man who has worked seriously upon himself knowing reggie to be a very cautious man trained moreover in assessing information by many years in intelligence service i accepted his assurances and also his belief that shah had a very important mission in west that we ought to help him to accomplish shah gave bennett a declaration of people of tradition and authorised him to share this with other gurdjieffians document announced that there was now an opportunity for transmission of a secret hidden special superior form of knowledge combined with personal impression bennett formed of shah it convinced bennett that shah was a genuine emissary of monastery in afghanistan an inner circle of sufis whose teachings had inspired gurdjieff thumb 220px right for next few years bennett and shah had weekly private talks that lasted for hours later shah also gave talks to students at coombe springs bennett says that shah s plans included reaching people who occupied positions of authority and power who were already half consciously aware that problems of mankind could no longer be solved by economic political or social action such people were touched he said by new forces moving in world to help mankind to survive coming crisis bennett agreed with these ideas and also agreed that people attracted by overtly spiritual or esoteric movements seldom possessed qualities needed to reach and occupy positions of authority and that there were sufficient grounds for believing that throughout world there were already people occupying important positions who were capable of looking beyond limitations of nationality and cultures and who could see for themselves that only hope for mankind lies in intervention of a higher source bennett wrote i had seen enough of shah to know that he was no charlatan or idle boaster and that he was intensely serious about task he had been given wishing to support shah s work bennett decided in 1965 after agonising for a long time and discussing matter with council and members of his institute to give coombe springs property to shah who had insisted that any such gift must be made with no strings attached once property was transferred to shah he banned bennett s associates from visiting and made bennett himself feel unwelcome bennett says he did receive an invitation to midsummer revels a party shah held at coombe springs that lasted two days and two nights primarily for young people whom shah was then attracting anthony blake who worked with bennett for 15 years says when idries shah acquired coombe springs his main activity was giving parties i had only a few encounters with him but much enjoyed his irreverent attitude bennett once said to me there are different styles in work mine is like gurdjieff s around struggle with one s denial but shah s way is to treat work as a joke after a few months shah sold plot worth more than ps100 000 to a developer and used proceeds to establish himself and his work activities at langton house in langton green near tunbridge wells a 50 acre estate that once belonged to family of lord baden powell founder of boy scouts along with coombe springs property bennett also handed care of his body of pupils to shah comprising some 300 people shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable about half of their number found a place in shah s work some 20 years later gurdjieffian author james moore suggested that bennett had been duped by shah bennett gave an account of matter himself in his autobiography 1974 he said that shah s behaviour after transfer of property was hard to bear but also insisted that shah was a man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities and considered that shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately to make sure that all bonds with coombe springs were severed he added that langton green was a far more suitable place for shah s work than coombe springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that coombe springs lost its identity he concluded his account of matter by stating that he had gained freedom through his contact with shah and had learned to love people whom he could not understand chapter 27 service and sacrifice period from 1960 to 1967 when i was once again entirely on my own was of greatest value to me i had learned to serve and to sacrifice and i knew that i was free from attachments it happened about end of time that i went on business to america and met with madame de salzmann in new york she was very curious about idries shah and asked what i had gained from my contact with him i replied freedom not only had i gained freedom but i had come to love people whom i could not understand according to bennett shah later also engaged in discussions with heads of gurdjieff groups in new york in a letter to paul anderson from 5 march 1968 bennett wrote madame de salzmann and all others are aware of their own limitations and do no more than they are able to do while i was in new york elizabeth and i visited foundation and we saw most of leading people in new york group as well as jeanne de salzmann herself something is preparing but whether it will come to fruition i cannot tell i refer to their connection with idries shah and his capacity for turning everything upside down it is useless with such people to be passive and it is useless to avoid issue for time being we can only hope that some good will come and meanwhile continue our own work author and clinical psychologist kathleen later wrote witnessing growing conservatism within gurdjieff foundation john bennett hoped new blood and leadership would come from elsewhere although there may have been flirtation with shah nothing came of it prevailing sense among leaders of gurdjieff work that nothing must change that a treasure in their safekeeping must at all costs be preserved in its original form was stronger than any wish for a new wave of inspiration sufi studies and institutes in 1965 shah founded society for understanding fundamental ideas sufi later renamed institute for cultural research icr an educational charity aimed at stimulating study debate education and research into all aspects of human thought behaviour and culture he also established society for sufi studies sss langton house at langton green became a place of gathering and discussion for poets philosophers and statesmen from around world and an established part of literary scene of time icr held meetings and gave lectures there awarding fellowships to international scholars including sir john glubb aquila kiani richard gregory and robert cecil head of european studies at university of reading who became chairman of institute in early 1970s shah was an early member and supporter of club of rome some sources have described shah as a founding member of club of rome augy hayter states to a certain extent one can say that a good deal of literature put out by shah and friends under various pseudonyms was designed to act as a decoy it occupied would be students and opponents alike and inflamed critics to quite amazing degree a lot of it was fake shah knew perfectly well that he was not a founding member of club of rome he was a member for a short time and was politely asked to leave because he didn t turn up to meetings but this mythology around shah s public personage was necessary in order to provide dream lie without which no truth can exist because a student must always have a choice and several presentations were given to institute by scientists like alexander king other visitors pupils and would be pupils included poet ted hughes novelists j d salinger alan sillitoe and doris lessing zoologist desmond morris and psychologist robert ornstein interior of house was decorated in a middle eastern fashion and buffet lunches were held every sunday for guests in a large dining room that was once estate stable nicknamed elephant a reference to eastern tale of elephant in dark over following years shah developed octagon press as a means of publishing and distributing reprints of translations of numerous sufi classics in addition he collected translated and wrote thousands of sufi tales making these available to a western audience through his books and lectures several of shah s books feature mullah nasruddin character sometimes with illustrations provided by richard williams in shah s interpretation mulla nasruddin stories previously considered a folkloric part of muslim cultures were presented as sufi parables nasruddin was featured in shah s television documentary dreamwalkers which aired on bbc in 1970 segments included richard williams being interviewed about his unfinished animated film about nasruddin and scientist john discussing use of nasruddin stories at rand corporation think tank other guests included british psychiatrist william sargant discussing hampering effects of brainwashing and social conditioning on creativity and problem solving and comedian marty feldman talking with shah about role of humour and ritual in human life program ended with shah asserting that humanity could further its own evolution by breaking psychological limitations but that there was a constant accretion of pessimism which effectively prevents evolution in this form from going ahead man is asleep must he die before he wakes up shah also organised sufi study groups in united states claudio naranjo a chilean psychiatrist who was teaching in california in late 1960s says that after being disappointed in extent to which gurdjieff s school entailed a living lineage he had turned towards sufism and had become part of a group under guidance of idries shah naranjo co wrote a book with robert ornstein entitled on psychology of meditation 1971 both of them were associated with university of california where ornstein was a research psychologist at langley porter psychiatric institute ornstein was also president and founder of institute for study of human knowledge established in 1969 seeing a need in u s for books and collections on ancient and new ways of thinking he formed ishk book service in 1972 as a central source for important contemporary and traditional literature becoming sole u s distributor of works of idries shah published by octagon press another shah associate scientist and professor leonard lewin who was teaching telecommunications at university of colorado at time set up sufi study groups and other enterprises for promotion of sufi ideas like institute for research on dissemination of human knowledge and also edited an anthology of writings by and about shah entitled diffusion of sufi ideas in west 1972 planned animated feature film by williams provisionally titled amazing nasruddin never materialised as relationship between williams and shah family soured in 1972 amid disputes about copyrights and funds however williams later used some of ideas for his film thief and cobbler later years shah wrote around two dozen more books over following decades many of them drawing on classical sufi sources achieving a huge worldwide circulation his writings appealed primarily to an intellectually oriented western audience by translating sufi teachings into contemporary psychological language he presented them in vernacular and hence accessible terms his folktales illustrating sufi wisdom through anecdote and example proved particularly popular shah received and accepted invitations to lecture as a visiting professor at academic institutions including university of california university of geneva national university of la plata and various english universities besides his literary and educational work he found time to design an air forming a company together with laws and run a number of textile ceramics and electronics companies he also undertook several journeys to his ancestral afghanistan and involved himself in setting up relief efforts there he drew on these experiences later on in his book kara kush a novel about soviet afghan war illness in late spring of 1987 about a year after his final visit to afghanistan shah suffered two successive and massive heart attacks he was told that he had only eight per cent of his heart function left and could not expect to survive despite intermittent bouts of illness he continued working and produced further books over next nine years death thumb right grave of idries shah in brookwood cemetery idries shah died in london on 23 november 1996 at age of 72 and was buried in brookwood cemetery according to his obituary in daily telegraph idries shah was a collaborator with mujahideen in soviet afghan war a director of studies for institute for cultural research and a governor of royal humane society and royal hospital and home for incurables he was also a member of athenaeum club at time of his death shah s books had sold over 15 million copies in a dozen languages worldwide and had been reviewed in numerous international journals and newspapers teachings books on magic and occult shah s early books were studies of what he called minority beliefs his first book oriental magic published in 1956 was originally intended to be titled considerations in eastern and african minority beliefs he followed this in 1957 with secret lore of magic book of sorcerers originally entitled some materials on european minority belief literature names of these books were according to a contributor to a 1973 festschrift for shah changed before publication due to exigencies of commercial publishing practices before his death in 1969 shah s father asserted that reason why he and his son had published books on subject of magic and occult was to forestall a probable popular revival or belief among a significant number of people in this nonsense my son eventually completed this task when he researched for several years and published two important books on subject shah sirdar ikbal ali 1992 alone in arabian nights london octagon press ltd p 136 in an interview in psychology today from 1975 shah elaborated main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to general reader for too long people believed that there were secret books hidden places and amazing things they held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with so first purpose was information this is magic of east and west that s all there is no more second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it which do not come within customary physics or within experience of ordinary people i think this should be studied that we should gather data and analyze phenomena we need to separate chemistry of magic from alchemy as it were shah went on to say that his books on subject were not written for current devotees of magic and witchcraft and that in fact he subsequently had to avoid them as they would only be disappointed in what he had to say these books were followed by publication of travelogue destination mecca 1957 which was featured on television by sir david attenborough lessing doris 1970 mysterious east new york times review of books 22 october both destination mecca and oriental magic contain sections on subject of sufism sufism as a form of timeless wisdom shah presented sufism as a form of timeless wisdom that predated islam he emphasised that nature of sufism was alive not static and that it always adapted its visible manifestations to new times places and people sufi schools are like waves which break upon rocks they are from same sea in different forms for same purpose he wrote quoting ahmad al badawi shah was often dismissive of orientalists descriptions of sufism holding that academic or personal study of its historical forms and methods was not a sufficient basis for gaining a correct understanding of it in fact an obsession with its traditional forms might actually become an obstacle show a man too many camels bones or show them to him too often and he will not be able to recognise a camel when he comes across a live one is how he expressed this idea in one of his books shah like inayat khan presented sufism as a path that transcended individual religions and adapted it to a western audience unlike khan however he religious or spiritual trappings and portrayed sufism as a psychological technology a method or science that could be used to achieve self realisation in doing so his approach seemed to be especially addressed to followers of gurdjieff students of human potential movement and intellectuals acquainted with modern psychology for example he wrote sufism states that man may become objective and that objectivity enables individual to grasp higher facts man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in sufism real intellect shah taught that human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need shah dismissed other eastern and western projections of sufism as watered down generalised or partial he included in this not only khan s version but also overtly muslim forms of sufism found in most islamic countries on other hand writings of shah s associates implied that he was grand sheikh of sufis a position of authority undercut by failure of any other sufis to acknowledge its existence shah felt best way to introduce sufi wisdom in west while at same time overcoming problems of gurus and cults was to clarify difference between a cult and an educational system and to contribute to knowledge in an interview he explained you must work within an educational pattern not in mumbo jumbo area as part of this approach he acted as director of studies at icr he also lectured on study of sufism in west at university of sussex in 1966 this was later published as a monograph entitled special problems in study of sufi ideas shah later explained that sufi activities were divided into different components or departments studies in sufism studies of sufism and studies for sufism studies for sufism helped lead people towards sufism and included promotion of knowledge which might be lacking in culture and needed to be restored and spread such as an understanding of social conditioning and brainwashing difference between rational and intuitive modes of thought and other activities so that people s minds could become more free and wide ranging studies of sufism included institutions and activities such as lectures and seminars which provided information about sufism and acted as a cultural liaison between sufis and public finally studies in sufism referred to being in a sufi school carrying out those activities prescribed by teacher as part of a training and this could take many forms which did not necessarily fit into preconceived notion of a mystical school shah s sufi aims and methodologies were also delineated in declaration of people of tradition given at coombe springs in addition to making this announcement to feeding into certain fields of thought certain ideas and pointing out some of factors surrounding this work projectors of this declaration have a practical task this task is to locate individuals who have capacity for obtaining special knowledge of man which is available to group them in a special not haphazard manner so that each such group forms a harmonious organism to do this in right place at right time to provide an external and interior format with which to work as well as a formulation of ideas suitable to local conditions to balance theory with practice in a bbc interview from 1971 shah explained his contemporary adaptive approach i am interested in making available in west those aspects of sufism which shall be of use to west at this time i don t want to turn good europeans into poor asiatics people have asked me why i don t use traditional methods of spiritual training for instance in dealing with people who seek me out or hunt me down and of course answer is that it s for same reason that you came to my house today in a and not on back of a camel sufism is in fact not a mystical system not a religion but a body of knowledge shah frequently characterised some of his work as really only preliminary to actual sufi study in same way that learning to read and write might be seen as preliminary to a study of literature unless psychology is correctly oriented there is no spirituality though there can be obsession and emotionality often mistaken for it anyone trying to graft spiritual practices upon an personality will end up with an aberration he argued for this reason most of work he produced from sufis onwards was psychological in nature focused on attacking nafs i false self i have nothing to give you except way to understand how to seek but you think you can already do that shah was frequently criticised for not mentioning god very much in his writings his reply was that given man s present state there would not be much point in talking about god he illustrated problem in a parable in his book thinkers of east finding i could speak language of ants i approached one and inquired what is god like does he resemble ant he answered god no indeed we have only a single sting but god he has two teaching stories shah used teaching stories and humour to great effect in his work shah emphasised therapeutic function of surprising anecdotes and fresh perspectives these tales revealed reading and discussion of such tales in a group setting became a significant part of activities in which members of shah s study circles engaged transformative way in which these puzzling or surprising tales could destabilise student s normal and unaware mode of consciousness was studied by stanford university psychology professor robert ornstein who along with fellow psychologist charles peter 1998 strange fate of sufism in new age in and eminent writers such as poet laureate ted marcia 1998 in garden of american sufi movements hybrids and perennials in and nobel prize winning novelist doris lessing was one of several notable thinkers profoundly influenced by shah shah and ornstein met in 1960s realising that ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings translating them into idiom of psychotherapy shah made him his deputy khalifa in united states ornstein s psychology of consciousness 1972 was enthusiastically received by academic psychology community as it coincided with new interests in field such as study of biofeedback and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness ornstein has published more books in field over years philosopher of science and physicist henri bortoft used teaching tales from shah s corpus as analogies of habits of mind which prevented people from grasping scientific method of johann wolfgang von goethe bortoft s wholeness of nature goethe s way of science includes tales from tales of dervishes exploits of incomparable mullah nasruddin and a perfumed scorpion henri bortoft wholeness of nature goethe s way of science 1996 floris books in their original historical and cultural setting sufi teaching stories of kind popularised by shah first told orally and later written down for purpose of transmitting sufi faith and practice to successive generations were considered suitable for people of all ages including children as they contained multiple layers of meaning shah likened sufi story to a peach a person may be emotionally stirred by exterior as if peach were lent to you you can eat peach and taste a further delight you can throw away stone or crack it and find a delicious kernel within this is hidden depth it was in this manner that shah invited his audience to receive sufi story by failing to uncover kernel and regarding story as merely amusing or superficial a person would accomplish nothing more than looking at peach while others internalised tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it tahir shah mentions his father s storytelling at several points throughout his 2008 book in arabian nights first to discuss how idries shah made use of teaching stories my father never told us how stories worked he did not reveal layers nuggets of information fragments of truth and fantasy he didn t need to because given right conditions stories activated sowing themselves he then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom my father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought he used to say that great collections of stories from east were like encyclopedias storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied to be appreciated and cherished to him stories represented much more than mere entertainment he saw them as complex psychological documents forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since dawn of humanity and more often than not passed down by word of mouth later on in book he continues his discussion of stories as teaching tools quoting following explanation his father gave him at end of a story olav hammer in sufism in europe and north america 2004 cites an example of such a story it tells of a man who is looking for his key on ground when a passing neighbour asks man whether this is in fact place where he lost key man replies no i lost it at home but there is more light here than in my own house versions of this story have been known for many years in west see streetlight effect this is an example of long noted phenomenon of similar tales existing in many different cultures which was a central idea in shah s folktale collection world tales peter wilson writing in new trends and developments in world of islam 1998 quotes another such story featuring a dervish who is asked to describe qualities of his teacher alim dervish explains that alim wrote beautiful poetry and inspired him with his self sacrifice and his service to his fellow man his questioner readily approves of these qualities only to find dervish rebuking him those are qualities which would have recommended alim to you then he proceeds to list qualities which actually enabled alim to be an effective teacher hazrat alim azimi made me irritated which caused me to examine my irritation to trace its source alim azimi made me angry so that i could feel and transform my anger he explains that alim azimi followed path of blame intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself in order to bring failings of both his students and critics to light allowing them to be seen for what they really were he showed us strange so that strange became commonplace and we could realise what it really is views on culture and practical life shah s concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures and hidden factors determining individual behaviour he discounted western focus on appearances and which often reflected mere fashion and habit and drew attention to origins of culture and unconscious and mixed motivations of people and groups formed by them he pointed out how both on individual and group levels short term disasters often turn into blessings and vice versa and yet knowledge of this has done little to affect way people respond to events as they occur shah did not advocate abandonment of worldly duties instead he argued that treasure sought by would be disciple should derive from one s struggles in everyday living he considered practical work means through which a seeker could do self work in line with traditional adoption by sufis of ordinary professions through which they earned their livelihoods and worked on themselves shah s status as a teacher remained indefinable disclaiming both guru identity and any desire to found a cult or sect he also rejected academic hat michael rubinstein writing in makers of modern culture concluded that he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of tradition in which contemplative and intuitive aspects of mind are regarded as being most productive when working together legacy idries shah considered his books his legacy in themselves they would fulfil function he had fulfilled when he could no longer be there promoting and distributing their teacher s publications has been an important activity or work for shah s students both for fund raising purposes and for transforming public awareness icr suspended its activities in 2013 following formation of a new charity idries shah foundation while sss had ceased its activities earlier ishk institute for study of human knowledge headed by ornstein is active in united states after 9 11 terrorist attacks for example it sent out a brochure advertising afghanistan related books authored by shah and his circle to members of middle east studies association thus linking these publications to need for improved cross cultural understanding when elizabeth hall interviewed shah for psychology today in july 1975 she asked him for sake of humanity what would you like to see happen shah replied what i would really want in case anybody is listening is for products of last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by public by everybody so that findings become part of their way of thinking they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it shah s brother omar ali shah 1922 2005 was also a writer and teacher of sufism brothers taught students together for a while in 1960s but in 1977 agreed to disagree and went their separate ways following idries shah s death in 1996 a fair number of his students became affiliated with omar ali shah s movement one of shah s daughters saira shah became notable in 2001 for reporting on women s rights in afghanistan in her documentary beneath veil his son tahir shah is a noted travel writer journalist and adventurer translations idries shah s works have been translated into many languages such as french german latvian persian polish russian spanish swedish turkish and others idries shah work was relatively late to reach polish reader pioneering translation into polish was done by specialist in iranian studies and

see some rather new and interesting implications about subject of mysticism nature of religious man edited by d b fry octagon press london 1982 p 99 and in his review of magic monastery 1972 noted that shah is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine he is concerned with method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted sufis transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in manner of zen masters and one of chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into subconscious and activate its hidden forces worlds of magic in

books a non profit initiative by american psychologist robert ornstein s institute for study of human knowledge ishk ishk provides these books to needy children through their own share literacy initiative shah school writings a hostile critic was james moore a gurdjieffian who disagreed with shah s assertion that gurdjieff s teaching was essentially in nature and took exception to publication of a chronologically impossible pseudonymous book on matter teachers of gurdjieff by rafael lefort that was linked to shah in a 1986 article in religion today now journal of contemporary religion moore covered bennett and graves controversies and noted that shah was surrounded by a nimbus of exorbitant adulation an adulation he himself has fanned he described shah as supported by a coterie of serviceable journalists editors critics animators broadcasters and travel writers which gamely choruses shah s praise moore questioned shah s purported sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored body of pseudonymous shah school writings from such authors as omar michael burke ph d and b m dervish who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise ostensibly from disinterested parties on shah referring to him as tariqa grand sheikh idries shah saheb prince idries shah king enoch presence studious king incarnation of ali and even qutb or axis all in support of shah s incipient efforts to market sufism to a western audience peter wilson similarly commented on very poor quality of much that had been written in shah s support noting an unfortunately fulsome style claims that shah possessed various paranormal abilities a tone of superiority an attitude sometimes smug condescending or pitying towards those on outside and apparent absence of any motivation to substantiate claims which might be thought to merit such treatment in his view there was a marked difference in quality between shah s own writings and quality of this secondary literature both moore and wilson however also noted similarities in style and considered possibility that much of this pseudonymous work frequently published by octagon press shah s own publishing house might have been written by shah himself arguing for an alternative interpretation of this literature religious scholar andrew rawlinson proposed that rather than a transparently self serving deception it may have been a masquerade something that by definition has to be seen through stating that a critique of entrenched positions cannot itself be fixed and doctrinal and noting that shah s intent had always been to undermine false certainties he argued that shah myth created by these writings may have been a teaching tool rather than a tool of concealment something made to be deconstructed that is supposed to dissolve when you touch it rawlinson concluded that shah cannot be taken at face value his own axioms preclude very possibility assessment thumb right 260px nobel prize winner doris lessing was profoundly influenced by shah doris lessing one of shah s greatest defenders stated in a 1981 interview i found sufism as taught by idries shah which claims to be reintroduction of an ancient teaching suitable for this time and this place it is not some regurgitated stuff from east or watered down islam or anything like that in 1996 commenting on shah s death in daily telegraph she stated that she met shah because of sufis which was to her most surprising book she had read and a book that changed her life describing shah s oeuvre as a phenomenon like nothing else in our time she characterised him as a many sided man wittiest person she ever expected to meet kind generous modest don t look so much at my face but take what is in my hand she quotes him as saying and her good friend and teacher for 30 odd years arthur j a professor of psychiatry and long time researcher in area of meditation and change of consciousness who began his study of sufi teaching stories in early seventies expressed view that western psychotherapists could benefit from perspective provided by sufism and its universal essence provided suitable materials were studied in correct manner and sequence given that shah s writings and translations of sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind he recommended them to those interested in assessing matter for themselves and noted that many authorities had accepted shah s position as a spokesman for contemporary sufism psychologist and consciousness researcher charles tart commented that shah s writings had produced a more profound appreciation in him of what psychology is about than anything else ever written asked to give an assessment of shah in 1973 j g bennett said that shah was doing important work on a large scale stirring people up very effectively all over place making them think showing them that modes of thought that appear to be free are really largely conditioned he referred to shah as krishnamurti of sufism breaking down people s fixed ideas in many directions as part of an awakening process that is a very necessary preparation for new world indian philosopher and mystic later known as osho commenting on shah s work described sufis as just a diamond value of what he has done in sufis is immeasurable he added that shah was man who introduced mulla nasrudin to west and he has done an incredible service he cannot be repaid idries shah has made just small anecdotes of nasrudin even more beautiful he not only has capacity to exactly translate parables but even to beautify them to make them more poignant sharper richard and jay kinney writing in hidden wisdom a guide to western inner traditions 2006 pronounced shah s sufis an extremely readable and wide ranging introduction to sufism adding that shah s own slant is evident throughout and some historical assertions are debatable none are but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in sufism for general reader they described learning how to learn a collection of interviews talks and short writings as one of shah s best works providing a solid orientation to his psychological approach to sufi work noting that at his best shah provides insights that inoculate students against much of nonsense in spiritual marketplace ivan tyrrell and social psychologist joe griffin in their book about innate emotional needs human givens a new approach to emotional health and clear thinking wrote that shah more than anyone else understood and appreciated real significance of givens of human nature griffin j tyrrell i 2004 human givens a new approach to emotional health and clear thinking hg publishing in another book godhead brain s big bang explosive origin of creativity mysticism and mental illness they said that shah s stories when told to young and old alike lay down blueprints in mind not only for living and overcoming everyday difficulties but also for travelling spiritual path their impact may not be recognized or felt for months or years after first hearing or reading them but eventually structural content they contain will exploit pattern matching nature of brain and make it possible for students to observe functioning of their own emotionally conditioned responses to changing life circumstances it then makes it easier for them to take any action required by reality and for their minds to connect to higher realms teaching stories should be read told and reflected on but not intellectually analysed because that destroys beneficial impact that they would otherwise have had on your mind shah they added was a great collector and publisher of tales and writings that contain this long term impact quality he understood vital importance for humanity of mental blueprint aspect of them and his books are full of nourishing examples griffin j tyrrell i 2011 godhead brain s big bang explosive origin of creativity mysticism and mental illness olav hammer notes that during shah s last years when generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy and he had become a respected figure among higher echelons of british society controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data mentioning kinship with prophet muhammad affiliations with a secret sufi order in central asia or tradition in which gurdjieff was taught and recoverable historical facts while there may have been a link of kinship with prophet muhammad number of people sharing such a link today 1300 years later would be at least one million other elements of shah s autobiography appeared to have been pure fiction even so hammer noted that shah s books have remained in public demand and that he has played a significant role in representing essence of sufism as a non confessional individualistic and life affirming distillation of spiritual wisdom peter wilson wrote that if shah had been a swindler he had been an extremely gifted one because unlike merely commercial writers he had taken time to produce an elaborate and internally consistent system that attracted a whole range of more or less eminent people and had provoked and stimulated thought in many diverse quarters moore acknowledged that shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularising a humanistic sufism and had brought energy and resource to his self aggrandisement but ended with damning conclusion that shah s was a sufism without self sacrifice without self transcendence without aspiration of gnosis without tradition without prophet without qur an without islam and without god merely that gore vidal opined that shah s books are a great deal harder to read than they were to write sufis reception reception of shah s movement was also marked by controversy some orientalists were hostile in part because shah presented classical sufi writings as tools for self development to be used by contemporary people rather than as objects of historical study internationally renowned german orientalist annemarie schimmel commented that sufis along with shah s other books should be avoided by serious students graves introduction to sufis written with shah s help described shah as being in senior male line of descent from prophet mohammed and as having inherited secret mysteries from caliphs his ancestors he is in fact a grand sheikh of sufi tariqa privately however writing to a friend graves confessed that this was misleading he is one of us not a moslem personage introduction is not included in octagon press editions of book after 1983 but has always been included in anchor doubleday editions and shah s fiercest critic university of edinburgh scholar l p elwell sutton in a 1975 article critical of what he called pseudo sufis like gurdjieff and shah opined that graves had been trying to upgrade shah s rather undistinguished lineage and that reference to mohammed s senior male line of descent was a rather unfortunate gaffe as mohammed s sons had all died in infancy although elwell sutton accepted that family were sayyids descended from seventh imam musa al kadhim great of hussein ibn ali who was younger son of marriage of fatimah daughter of prophet and ali ibn abi talib he considered this an undistinguished lineage with no special sanctity because sayyids proliferate throughout islamic world in all walks of society and on both sides of every religious and political fence he described shah s books as trivial replete with errors of fact slovenly and inaccurate translations and even misspellings of oriental names and words a muddle of platitudes and plain mumbo jumbo adding for good measure that shah had a remarkable opinion of his own importance he took a dim view of rushbrook williams festschrift collection written in honour of shah saying he considered many of claims made in book on behalf of shah and his father concerning their representing sufi tradition to be self serving publicity marked by a disarming disregard for facts expressing amusement and amazement at sycophantic manner of shah s in a bbc radio interview elwell sutton concluded that some western intellectuals were so desperate to find answers to questions that baffle them that confronted with wisdom from mysterious east they abandon their critical faculties and submit to brainwashing of crudest kind to elwell sutton shah s sufism belonged to realm of pseudo sufism centred not on god but on man omar khayyam affair in late 1960s and early 1970s shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding 1967 publication of a new translation of omar khayyam s rubaiyat by robert graves and shah s older brother omar ali shah translation which presented rubaiyat as a sufi poem was based on an annotated crib supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in shah family s possession for 800 years l p elwell sutton an orientalist at edinburgh university and others who reviewed book expressed their conviction that story of ancient manuscript was false shah s father sirdar ikbal ali shah was expected by graves to present original manuscript to clear matter up but he died in a car accident in tangier in november 1969 a year later graves asked idries shah to produce manuscript shah replied in a letter that manuscript was not in his possession but even if it were producing it would prove nothing because it could not be accurately dated using current methods and its authenticity would still be contested it was time shah wrote that we realised that hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when let s face it nobody is really listening he added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them and he felt his father s response had been correct graves noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to shah brothers gross deception and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings insisted that producing manuscript had become a matter of family honour he pressed shah again reminding him of previous promises to produce manuscript if it were necessary neither of brothers ever produced manuscript leading graves nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe bearing in mind shah brothers many obligations to graves that they would have withheld manuscript if it had ever existed in first place according to his widow writing many years later graves had complete faith in authenticity of manuscript because of his friendship with shah even though he never had a chance to view text in person scholarly consensus today is that jan fishan khan manuscript was a hoax and that graves ali shah translation was in fact based on a victorian amateur scholar s analysis of sources used by previous
