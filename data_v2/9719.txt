myrmeciites is an extinct form genus of bulldog ants in subfamily myrmeciinae of family formicidae which contains three described species and two fossils not placed beyond genus level described in 2006 from ypresian stage early eocene deposits all three of described species and one unplaced fossil are from british columbia canada while second unplaced fossil is from washington state usa these ants were large with largest specimens collected reaching behaviour of these ants would have been similar to extant myrmeciinae ants such as solitary foraging nesting either in soil or trees and leaving no pheromone trail to food sources due to poor preservation of these ants their phylogenetic position among myrmeciinae is unclear and no type species has been designated these ants are classified as incertae sedis in myrmeciinae but some writers have classified it as incertae sedis within insect order hymenoptera this reclassification however has not been accepted instead myrmeciites remains in myrmeciinae history and classification fossils of myrmeciites were first studied and described by bruce archibald stefan cover and corrie moreau of museum of comparative zoology in cambridge massachusetts they published their 2006 description of form genus which is a collection of species formally described but cannot be identified to genus level in an annals of entomological society of america journal article genus name is a combination of ant subfamily name myrmeciinae and latin suffix ites meaning having nature of which is commonly used in naming of fossil taxa its phylogenetic position within myrmeciinae is unclear due to incomplete and poor preservation of collected specimens paper that described form genus included description of three species including myrmeciites herculeanus myrmeciites goliath and myrmeciites tabanifluviensis archibald and colleagues classified myrmeciites as incertae sedis latin for of uncertain placement within ant subfamily myrmeciinae as specimens are too poorly preserved to be assigned to any tribe however in a 2008 paper cesare baroni urbani of university of basel switzerland classified myrmeciites as incertae sedis within insect order hymenoptera which comprises sawflies wasps bees and ants because critical characters used to identify myrmeciinae ants or even family formicidae cannot be carried out on myrmeciites despite these comments a 2012 report by russian palaeoentomologist gennady m dlussky does not make any comment in regard to baroni urbani s views instead he accepts classification of archibald and colleagues description archibald cover and moreau erected form genus as an encompassing category for all fossil ants which while belonging to subfamily myrmeciinae lack details needed for placement in other described genera this may be due to preservation quality or positioning of individual ant resulting in obscured details as myrmeciites is a form genus it does not have a designated type species per international code of zoological nomenclature m herculeanus m herculeanus was described from a single side of a compression fossil found at middle ypresian mcabee fossil beds kamloops group near cache creek british columbia incomplete specimen numbered uccipr l 18 f 974 is currently preserved in paleontology collections housed at thompson rivers university kamloops british columbia archibald cover and moreau coined specific epithet herculeanus from latin name hercules in reference to notably sturdy and large morphology of type specimen and after divine hero heracles in greek mythology who was son of zeus and alcmene species is discernible from other species of myrmeciinae by its notably larger size worker caste ant is estimated at over in life its size is comparable to ants in genus ypresiomyrma shape of petiole a narrow waist that is located between mesosoma and gaster is distinct from other species and is similar in structure to genus prionomyrmex though shape and size of mandibles are distinct overall m herculeanus was assigned to myrmeciinae due to its mandible length despite them being poorly preserved and due to appearance of its petiole and propodeum legs are long in comparison to its body length and gaster is robust it is unknown if species had a sting due to preservation of specimen size of single known worker is larger than any of studied queens as myrmeciinae queens are slightly larger than other castes in a species this indicates m herculeanus is most likely a distinct species due to incomplete nature of type specimen species was placed in myrmeciites m goliath second species described from mcabee fossil beds is m goliath and as with m herculeanus it is known from one specimen though both part and counterpart are known for m goliath holotype is housed in thompson rivers university kamloops collections as uccipr l 18 f 999 and 18 f 1000 for each side respectively species name goliath was chosen by archibald cover and moreau in reference to mythological goliath due to notable size of ant holotype specimen is a partial worker or queen which is incomplete with a notable portion of gaster missing species can be separated from other ants by large size holotype approaching only other eocene ants in this size range are members of genus titanomyrma that were formerly placed in m goliath is distinguishable from titanomyrma by shape and structure of antennae and length of legs which are notably shorter in titanomyrma head is very round and flattened compound eyes are present and mandibles are small less than half length of head head is also small in proportion to mesosoma legs are large and long and a poorly preserved petiole is known most of specimen is preserved in fine detail but some characters are so poorly preserved that exact placement of m goliath within myrmeciinae cannot be confirmed only future fossils that are better preserved can clarify position of m goliath m tabanifluviensis unlike other described myrmeciites species m tabanifluviensis is only species not from mcabee fossil beds holotype currently deposited in courtenay and district museum paleontology collections as 2003 2 10 cdm 034 was recovered from shale of an unnamed formation outcropping near town of horsefly british columbia specimen is incomplete with both head and portions of mesosoma and gaster missing adult had an estimated length in life of over right portions of legs are well preserved while left legs are missing with two spurs one of which is long and other is short and narrow due to incomplete nature of specimen and position of preserved portions gender is not identifiable though presence of wings indicates it to be a reproductive adult small size of specimen with a fore wing length of approximately separates this species from other members of british columbia myrmeciinae type locality for species near horsefly river was basis for archibald cover and moreau choosing specific epithet tabanifluviensis combined with horsefly genus name latin word meaning river and ensis meaning origin or place justification of placing this ant in myrmeciites is due to incomplete preservation unplaced specimens two additional specimens were placed within form genus but not into a specific species courtenay and district museum specimen 2003 2 9 cdm 03 a b is a long partial male recovered from falkland site near falkland british columbia generally robust nature of specimen excludes it from genus avitomyrmex but details needed for placement between genera ypresiomyrma and macabeemyrma are not present interpretive center specimen sr 05 03 01 is a possible queen or worker which would have been an estimated long in life due to lateral preservation of specimen most characters for placing specimen into one of defined species are obscured or absent specimen was recovered from outcrops of klondike mountain formation north west of republic washington ecology archibald and colleagues suggested that behavioural habits for myrmeciites ants like that of other extinct myrmeciinae taxa may have been similar to its extant relatives workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar soiling either in ground or in trees making them an arboreal nesting insect like other ants myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources these ants may have been solitary foragers relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes nuptial flight of m tabanifluviensis probably occurred during late spring or summer as in extant relatives references cited text external links myrmeciites at antwiki bringing ants to world myrmeciites at antcat category myrmeciinae
