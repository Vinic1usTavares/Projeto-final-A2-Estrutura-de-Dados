dusky crag martin ptyonoprogne concolor is a small passerine bird in swallow family it is about long with a broad body and wings and a short square tail that has small white patches near tips of most of its feathers this martin has sooty brown upperparts and slightly paler underparts two subspecies are resident breeding birds in south asia from indian subcontinent to southwestern china and northern parts of thailand vietnam and laos this martin nests under a cliff overhang or on a man made structure building a neat half cup mud nest with a soft lining both adults incubate two to four eggs and feed chicks this species does not form large breeding colonies but it is more gregarious outside breeding season it feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as martin flies near to cliff faces it may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns taxonomy dusky crag martin was formally described by in 1832 as hirundo concolor by british soldier and ornithologist william henry sykes it was moved to new genus ptyonoprogne by german ornithologist heinrich gustav reichenbach in 1850 reichenbach 1850 plate lxxxvii figure 6 its nearest relatives are three other members of genus rock martin p fuligula pale crag martin p obsoleta and eurasian crag martin p rupestris turner 1989 pp 158 164 genus name is derived from greek ptuon ptuon a fan referring to shape of opened tail and procne prokne a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow specific concolor is from latin con together and color colour and refers to bird s uniform colouration four ptyonoprogne species are members of swallow family of birds and are classed as members of subfamily hirundininae which comprises all swallows and martins except very distinctive river martins dna studies suggest that there are three major groupings within hirundininae broadly correlating with type of nest built groups are core martins including burrowing species like sand martin nest adopters which are birds like tree swallow that utilise natural cavities and mud nest builders ptyonoprogne species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to latter group hirundo species also build open nests delichon house martins have a closed nest and cecropis and petrochelidon swallows have retort like closed nests with an entrance tunnel genus ptyonoprogne is closely related to larger swallow genus hirundo into which it is often subsumed but a dna analysis showed that an enlarged hirundo should contain all mud builder genera including delichon house martins a practice which few authorities follow although nests of ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical hirundo species like barn swallow research showed that if delichon cecropis and petrochelidon are split from hirundo ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus in pakistan breeding range of dusky crag martin overlaps that of subspecies p f of pale crag martin but that species breeds much higher in mountains this altitudinal separation means that it is not known whether two closely related martins could hybridise which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species dusky crag martins from burma and thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies p c sintaungensis originally concolor sintaungensis baker 1832 but it is not clear that difference is greater than that between individual martins of nominate subspecies turner 1989 pp 163 164 description dusky crag martin is long with a broad body wings and tail it has sooty brown upperparts and slightly paler underparts with a streaked pale dull rufous chin throat and foreneck tail is short and square with small white patches near tips of all but central and outermost pairs of feathers underwing coverts are dark brown eyes are brown small bill is mainly black and legs are brownish pink sexes are alike but juveniles have rufous grey tips to plumage of upperparts and wings this species can be distinguished from eurasian crag martin and rock martin by its darker underparts and its white tail spots are significantly smaller than those of eurasian crag martin rasmussen anderton 2005 p 311 under tail coverts are of same shade as underside of abdomen but these are darker in eurasian crag martin ali ripley 1986 pp 53 56 this small martin s flight is typically slow and leisurely but it is capable of considerable speed when required calls are similar to those of eurasian crag martin and include a soft chi chi contact call and a twittering song distribution and habitat nominate subspecies of dusky crag martin breeds in much of indian subcontinent from base of himalayas south to nilgiri mountains and east to west bengal and p c sintaungensis is found in southwestern china and northern parts of thailand vietnam and laos dusky crag martin is largely resident apart from local movements after breeding but it has bred in malaysia at least once and occurred as a vagrant to sri lanka and probably borneo natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs gorges and caves with nesting typically up to an altitude of about although up to in thailand robson 2004 p 208 this martin also breeds in lowland areas utilising man made structures as a substitute for natural precipices stone buildings such as old forts are particularly favoured and dusky crag martin can be found in urban areas including mumbai nests on buildings can be from ground retrieved 7 april 2010 and include unusual sites such as light fittings behaviour breeding thumb old forts provide alternative nest sites to natural cliffs dusky crag martin pairs typically nest alone although in suitable locations several pairs may be quite close to each other baker 1926 pp 236 237 natural nesting habitat is under ledges on cliff faces or river banks but man made structures are readily used stone buildings such as old hill forts mosques and tombs are preferred and other artificial sites include bridges archways and culverts breeding has been reported in every month but mainly in february and march and again after rains start in july and august usually two broods are raised nest built by both adults is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass it is constructed under an overhang or in a crevice on a cliff or man made structure and is re used for second brood and in subsequent years clutch is two to four eggs white with reddish brown blotches particularly at wide end and averaging with a weight of both adults incubate eggs and feed chicks incubation and nestling periods are unknown but assumed to be similar to those of eurasian crag martin 13 17 days to hatching and 24 27 days to fledge hume 1890 pp 180 183 feeding dusky crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight when nesting birds often fly back and forth near to a rock face or building hunting for their prey this martin is more gregarious outside breeding season and may form small flocks where food is abundant vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting and a study of eurasian crag martin which has a similar foraging technique showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas martin exploits area close to cliff when it hunts relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns when feeding young foraging is concentrated on profitable patches in immediate vicinity of nest since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate predators and parasites in addition to predation by birds of prey such as peregrine falcon this small martin has been recorded in diet of greater false vampire bat lyra retrieved 6 april 2010 status total population of dusky crag martin has not been quantified but it is suspected to be increasing owing to availability of artificial nest sites this martin is locally common in india thailand and southern china round 1991 p 234 and there appear to be range extensions to northeast into guangxi southwards into lowland laos and westwards to hills and plains of sindh there is also a recent unconfirmed report from cambodia retrieved 7 april 2010 its large range and presumed high numbers mean that dusky crag martin is not considered to be threatened and it is classed as least concern on iucn red list references cited texts further reading p m 1992 nest construction technique of dusky crag martin
