mind numbing reviewers for metros game central wrote that tutorial was most notable part of game though ultimately nonessential they wrote that because of its length it may have been an attempt to protect player from awful reality of real game ellie gibson of eurogamer described it as being most boring tutorial sequence in history of world jamin smith of videogamer com criticized tutorial for insisting on explaining each and every move in game before forcing you to repeat it three times critics believed that motion control system in fighters uncaged did not work and that fighting mechanic was poorly made mark walton of gamespot wrote that he found it to be immensely frustrating saying that controls were simply broken wyatt fossett for gamesradar abhorred system disparaging ubisoft and ama studios for poorly optimized game saying that they didn t drop ball on this title they weren t even invited to sport in which ball exists in regards to motion detection fossett wrote that every third punch thrown is recognized and every block you attempt is either exaggerated or completely ignored smith compared combat to that of luck in rock paper scissors noting that 90 of time attack will be avoided or blocked while for other 10 character just stands there like a lemon refusing to acknowledge command jack devries thought that when in a fight moves become a series of desperate flails in an attempt for game to notice player s actions visuals were disliked by reviewers with smith saying game was plagued with bizarre design choices and lacklustre visuals and attributed this to rush of
