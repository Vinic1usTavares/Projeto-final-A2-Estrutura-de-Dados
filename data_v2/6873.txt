development and publication concept and characters for kaine came together within a day due to page limitations and deadlines manga artist kaori yuki was unable to flesh out some of characters something she regretted in afterword she thought that because of this some characters were unintentionally comedic she also noted how page limitations affected scenes where kaine escapes being murdered by oda or when he sings at concert in climax die was her favorite character to draw and in original ending she had intended for him to go mad although she visited a music studio to gather impressions for kaine she did not use any of them nor did she use a model for any of characters yuki expressed her embarrassment at including other three stories within collection due to their status as very early works in her retrospective on magical mystery tour she thought that art was amateurish orange time bomb is from early point in her career when she wrote romantic comedy manga she had been having difficulty selling her manga stories and an older colleague had advised her that she would not be successful with particular stories and illustrations she had been pursuing she then switched genres to romantic comedy and although she had a few stories published she was unhappy it was not until she wrote a dark scary miniseries with increasingly favorable reader responses that she decided that dark stories and gothic genre were most suitable for her style and potential at time she was writing tokyo top she was into european rock music and took inspiration from that cultural references to films can be found within tokyo top its title comes from film tokyo pop 1988 and visual allusions to rocky horror picture show 1976 appear near ending additionally title of orange time bomb has been suggested to be an allusion to novel a clockwork orange 1962 and its related film while magical mystery tour might be a reference to beatles album of same name 1967 tokyo top appeared in

highlight of collection citing intriguing narrative centered around rock music one reviewer for manga sanctuary remarked that despite lack of depth in some characters kaine was among some of yuki s best manga complemented by her artwork and a sublime ending planete bds faustine enjoyed story s premise art and character designs but wrote that resulting plot was unnecessarily convoluted and would have benefited from more pages to fully flesh events out conversely other reviewer for manga sanctuary interpreted narrative of kaine as a cliche filled caricature with art that while better than majority of other shojo manga was serviceable other three stories received a range of reactions with their age relative to kaine often remarked upon some critics wrote that they were interesting historical artifacts from yuki s beginnings as a manga artist according to reviewer for manga news short story format and artwork was reminiscent of her earlier manga cain saga and stories themselves were refreshing planete bd however regarded stories as amateur and uninteresting notes references external links kaori yuki s official site category 1996 manga category hakusensha manga category kaori
