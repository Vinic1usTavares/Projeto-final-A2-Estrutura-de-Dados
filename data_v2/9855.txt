pioneer helmet also known as wollaston helmet or northamptonshire helmet is a boar crested anglo saxon helmet from late seventh century found in wollaston northamptonshire united kingdom it was discovered during a march 1997 excavation before land was to be mined for gravel and was part of grave of a young man other objects in grave such as a hanging bowl and a pattern welded sword suggest that it was burial mound of a high status warrior sparsely decorated nature of helmet a utilitarian iron fighting piece belies its rarity it is one of just six anglo saxon helmets yet discovered joined by finds from benty grange sutton hoo york shorwell and staffordshire its basic form is nearly identical to that of richer coppergate helmet found in york like these pioneer helmet is an example of crested helmets that flourished in england and scandinavia from sixth through eleventh centuries distinctive feature of helmet is boar mounted atop its crest boar crested helmets are a staple of anglo saxon imagery evidence of a germanic tradition in which boar invoked protection of gods pioneer helmet is one of three together with benty grange helmet and detached guilden morden boar known to have survived these boar crests recall a time when such decoration may have been common anglo saxon poem beowulf in which boar adorned helmets are mentioned five times speaks of a funeral pyre heaped with boar shaped helmets forged in gold forging a link between warrior hero of legend and pioneer helmet of reality helmet was named after pioneer aggregates uk ltd who funded its excavation and conservation it was unveiled at new walk museum in leicester and is on display at royal armouries museum in leeds description thumb alt colour photograph of coppergate helmet basic construction of richer coppergate helmet is similar to that of pioneer helmet helmet has same basic form as anglo saxon coppergate helmet but is a utilitarian piece with little decoration and is larger perhaps to allow for additional padding it originally consisted of an iron skull cap from which hung two cheek guards form of neck protection that helmet afforded if any is uncertain owing to ploughing damage to helmet cap of helmet was constructed from twelve individual components riveted together basic form was created by four pieces a brow band joined by a nose to nape band and on either side a lateral band reaching from side of brow band to top of nose to nape band cutouts at front of brow and nose to nape bands functioned as eye holes and a wide strip of metal was riveted along edge of openings perhaps to provide balance or decoration four subtriangular infill plates were riveted inside to cover resulting holes finally three narrow c sectioned strips were added to provide additional strength one each running length of nose to nape and lateral bands nasal is not a separate component but rather is a continuation of nose to nape bands atop helmet was set boar it was affixed to c sectioned nose to nape strip and was forged from a single rod of iron its back was bent downwards to form hind legs while front of rod was split one part bent to form forelegs other part continuing forward to form boar s snout beyond very minor details snout was made to be slightly triangular hind was somewhat flattened and slight grooves in forelegs suggested individual limbs boar was not decorated beneath cap hung two cheek guards sinister cheek guard which is all that remains other than minor fragments of dexter was long and wide at top it was curved inward both laterally and longitudinally other than upper rear edge which was bent outwards either intentionally to improve articulation of joint or by damage incurred during use two strips of metal were then bent in half with one folded around brow band and one around cheek guard and attached by a single rivet through each these encased a narrow loop of wire which held cheek guards to cap a single rivet was also attached to middle of guard probably to facilitate attachment of leather strips used to draw tight cheek guards form of neck protection on helmet if any is unclear bottom of back of helmet is largely missing although portion that survives appears to have at least two perforations these would most likely have been used to attach a neck guard perhaps like one made of on coppergate helmet yet no such remains were found a series of unexplained iron rods found near helmet could theoretically have been used as stiffeners for an organic neck guard such as one made of leather but such an arrangement has no known parallels it is instead thought that rods were more likely belt stiffeners discovery helmet was discovered over easter in march 1997 in wollaston near wellingborough northamptonshire excavations in area had taken place for years on behalf of various aggregate companies before land was exploited for gravel and had uncovered an extensive network of iron age and roman farms evidence for post roman habitation however had been limited to two fragments of a brooch and two separate collections of pottery when metal detector surveying discovered a copper alloy hanging bowl and a decorated mount in what turned out to be a grave hanging bowl was detected by steve critchley working alongside archaeologist ian meadows meadows immediately recognised bowl for what it was and began an excavation grave was in shape of an elongated oval long and wide and may have originally been a tumulus it was only from a main contemporary roadway and was likely intended to have been seen by those passing by owing to ensuing years of cultivation and ploughing of fields grave was only deep when excavated various artefacts were therefore damaged and any originally placed higher in grave such as a shield or spearheads may have been completely destroyed grave was excavated with brushes and wooden tools revealing a number of bone fragments including part of a skull these were used to suggest that body was that of a man seventeen to twenty five years old laid in a supine position with his head on a pillow and knees slightly raised also found were three iron buckles a small iron knife a small copper alloy hook and a series of iron rods of unknown function a pattern welded sword was also found and together with hanging bowl and helmet marks grave as one for a person of high social status helmet lay next to where left hip of body would have rested it was on its sinister side with almost entirety of dexter side lost through ploughing prior to its deposition nasal had been bent inwards fracturing metal perhaps in a ritual killing of object a custom known to many cultures including anglo saxons and vikings practice involves deliberate breaking of objects before burial for reasons ranging from releasing of an object s spirit to deterrence of grave robbing when found it was at first thought to be a bucket archaeologists covered it in cling film then wrapped it in plaster of paris bandages and raised it in a soil block this was taken to conservation laboratory at houses museum in leicester where it was analysed and later conserved by anthony read plaster covered soil block was first x rayed revealing boar crested helmet within remaining half of helmet was broken into many pieces between 100 and 200 overall including some which were deposited within helmet itself these fragments were reassembled using cellulose nitrate adhesive hmg surviving cheek guard alone was reassembled from eighteen fragments helmet was then dried out and taken to leicester general hospital where it was subjected to digital x rays and ct scans using this information it was then cleaned and samples of organic materials principally textiles and leather perhaps from helmet s lining as well as possible feathers on brow band were taken it was then reassembled into seven larger parts cleaned again and finally reconstructed into one piece missing sections within remaining half were then filled in and painted and in last step boar was affixed to apex using epoxy newspapers as far away as australia and new zealand published accounts of discovery in april hailing it as find of decade helmet was placed on public display on 23 december 1997 wollaston burial was on private land owned by peter gammidge and john minney and helmet is now owned by gammidge and family of late minney it was termed pioneer helmet after pioneer aggregates uk ltd now owned by hanson who fully funded conservation and who had over time spent more than ps400 000 funding archaeology in area helmet was displayed until march 1998 at new walk museum in leicester site of its unveiling currently it is on display at royal armouries museum in leeds west yorkshire typology pioneer helmet is dated to late seventh century on basis of style of belt buckles found in grave which were current around 675 this suggests a terminus post quem earliest possible date for burial although not necessarily helmet s exact date of manufacture or deposition it is of anglo saxon origin one of only six such helmets known along with those from benty grange sutton hoo york shorwell and staffordshire like these examples with exception of frankish shorwell helmet pioneer helmet is broadly classed as one of crested helmets known in northern europe in sixth through eleventh centuries ad these are each characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose to nape crest except for an outlier fragment found in kiev all crested helmets originate from england or scandinavia and are distinct from continental and from same period iconography thumb alt colour photograph of a central european boar a central european boar boar was an important symbol in prehistoric europe where according to archaeologist jennifer foster it was venerated eulogised hunted and eaten for millennia until its virtual extinction in recent historical time anglo saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography coming after la tene examples in fourth century bc gaulish specimens three centuries later and roman boars in fourth century ad they likely represent a fused tradition of european and mediterranean cultures boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically celtic communities in iron age europe while roman historian tacitus writing around first century ad suggested that baltic aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection boar crested helmets are depicted on turn of millennium gundestrup cauldron discovered in denmark and on a torslunda plate from sweden made some 500 years later though romans also included boar in their stable of symbols four legions including twentieth adopted it as their emblem it was only one among many boar persisted in continental germanic tradition during nearly 400 years of roman rule in britain such as in association with scandinavian gods freyja and freyr its return to prominence in anglo saxon period as represented by boars from benty grange wollaston guilden morden and horncastle may therefore suggest post roman reintroduction of a germanic tradition from europe rather than continuation of a tradition in britain through 400 years of roman rule whatever its precise symbolism anglo saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection beowulf poet makes this clear writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over warriors wearing them boar crests in beowulf thumb alt colour photograph of benty grange helmet benty grange helmet boar crested pioneer helmet recalls anglo saxon poem beowulf in which helmets with boar imagery are referenced five times in three cases they appear to feature freestanding boars atop helmets like wollaston example such is case after grendel is defeated when a minstrel entertains beowulf and his men with story of fight at in which king of danes died in another case hrothgar laments death of my right hand man when ranks clashed and our boar crests had to take a battering in line of action both instances likely refer to crests such as those on benty grange and pioneer helmet or to one found in guilden morden these
