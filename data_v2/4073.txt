design a 150 popularly known as super yamato class was a planned class of battleships for imperial japanese navy in keeping with navy s long tradition they were designed to be qualitatively superior to battleships that might be faced in battle such as those from united states or great britain as part of this class would have been armed with six guns largest weapons carried aboard any warship in world design work on a 150s began after preceding in 1938 1939 and was mostly finished by early 1941 when japanese began focusing on aircraft carriers and other smaller warships in preparation for coming conflict no a 150 would ever be laid down and many details of class design were destroyed near end of war background and design in 1930s japanese government began a shift towards ultranationalist militancy planners envisioned an empire stretching from japan to resource rich european colonies in southeast asia and defensible islands in pacific ocean greater east asia co prosperity sphere extensive distances involved and likelihood of this expansion leading to a confrontation with united states led japanese to build and maintain a large fleet that could seize and hold onto these territories willmott 1999 p 2004 pp 42 43 u s posed a particular problem for japan as it possessed significantly greater industrial power willmott 1999 p 22 and several leading members of united states congress had pledged to outbuild japan three to one in a naval race imperial japanese navy had recognized since at least 1896 that country could not its potential opponents and therefore insisted that its ships had to be more powerful than foreign equivalents it established this qualitative lead at various times over next 40 years with s just before world war i s at end of that war and s in 1930s evans peattie 1997 p 59 a 150s were designed according to that doctrine to continue their qualitative superiority in battleships over their mostly likely opponents united states and great britain early conceptions for what would become a 150 battleships called for eight or nine 51 centimeter guns in double or triple turrets as successful construction of a gun in 1920 1921 made japanese confident that such a large weapon could be built designers hoped to give ships a top speed of which would give them a comfortable margin over american s however these grand specifications were curtailed when tests culminated in a ship that had a displacement of some it was felt that ships of this size would be too large and too expensive garzke dulin 1985 p 85 formal design studies began in 1938 1939 they initially focused on a ship closer to displacement of preceding on which plans had just been completed albeit one mounting six 51 centimeter guns garzke dulin 1985 pp 85 86 as japanese expected that americans would ascertain true characteristics of yamato class especially its primary armament of guns which would become largest naval weapons in use in world they hoped that 51 centimeter guns would outperform any american response to yamatos smaller guns specifications plans for a 150s were finished in early 1941 for most intents and purposes however these were destroyed at end of war along with most of other documentation relating to class general destruction of records and japan s extensive efforts before and during war to keep any information about ships out of hands of foreign nations severely limited amount of information on ships available to historians muir 1990 p 1989 p 8 this is for example why a 150 s exact specifications are up to some debate displacement was to be similar to yamato class which was around breyer 1973 p 330 and belt armor was probably going to be thick gardiner chesneau 1980 p 178 this was so large that steel mills in japan were incapable of manufacturing it instead two layers of armor plates would have been used despite its reduced effectiveness as compared to a single plate of same total thickness armament design of a 150s called for a main battery of six 45 caliber 51 centimeter guns in three twin turrets these would have been largest ever fitted to a capital ship dwarfing 46 centimeter guns mounted on yamato class garzke dulin 1985 pp 85 88 and were a key factor in historians william h garzke and robert o dulin s argument that a 150s would have been most powerful battleships in history by 1941 one possibly two of 51 centimeter guns were being constructed at kure naval arsenal and detailed designs of their turrets were drawn up turrets would have weighed and each gun would have massed they would have had a total length of and bore length was to have been around armor piercing shells would have weighed lacroix wells 1997 p 755 composition of a 150 s secondary armament is not fully known historians eric lacroix and linton wells have written that japanese designers were considering mounting a large number of 65 caliber type 98 dual purpose guns though this was not final these guns had a maximum elevation of 90deg which gave them an effective ceiling of and a horizontal range of they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of although resulting wear on barrels reduced their designed lifespan to only about 350 rounds they were able to fire 15 19 rounds per minute lacroix wells 1997 p 626 construction as war with united states became increasingly likely over second sino japanese war and particularly after japanese seizure of french indochina in mid 1940 all design work on battleships was diverted in early 1941 even though a 150 s design was nearly complete in order to focus on higher priority warships like aircraft carriers and cruisers two a 150s provisionally designated as warships number 798 and 799 were projected in a 1942 building program under this plan 798 would have been built in same dock as while 799 would be built in kure in same dock as after a fourth yamato class ship was launched ships would have then have been finished in 1946 1947 but war s turn against japanese after battle of midway meant that need for ships other than battleships never abated notes references bibliography category battleship classes category battleships of imperial
