hurricane juan was a significant tropical cyclone that heavily damaged parts of atlantic canada in late september 2003 juan is also first hurricane name and one of two to be requested to be retired by meteorological service of canada other being igor of 2010 it was tenth named storm and sixth hurricane of 2003 atlantic hurricane season juan formed southeast of bermuda on september 24 from a tropical wave that had tracked across subtropical atlantic ocean it tracked northward and strengthened over warm waters of gulf stream reaching category 2 strength on saffir simpson hurricane scale on september 27 hurricane peaked in intensity with sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h that same day losing some strength as it raced over cooler waters toward coast of nova scotia juan made landfall between shad bay and prospect in halifax regional municipality early on september 29 as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph 160 km h juan retained hurricane strength while crossing nova scotia from south to north though it weakened to a category 1 storm over prince edward island it was absorbed by another extratropical low later on september 29 near anticosti island in northern gulf of saint lawrence hurricane inflicted extensive damage across central nova scotia and into prince edward island with lesser damage east and west of storm centre most of damage occurred as a result of intense winds that buffeted region juan s passage resulted in eight fatalities and over ca 300 million us 200 million in damage it was described as worst storm to hit halifax since 1893 meteorological history a large tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure moved off coast of africa on september 14 2003 it initially tracked westward and remained disorganized due to unfavourable upper level wind shear on september 20 convection around system greatly increased during interaction with circulation of a large upper level low though unfavorable conditions caused activity to remain disorganized system as a whole moved to northwest around upper level low and developed a mid level circulation it interacted with a frontal zone and became better organized on september 23 while located 450 mi 725 km south of bermuda later that day a low level circulation developed within system though its involvement with proximate frontal zone prevented it from being classified a tropical depression deep convection increased near centre on september 24 and system quickly developed banding features and distinct outflow based on increase in organization national hurricane center nhc classified it as tropical depression fifteen later that day while it was located about 345 miles 555 km southeast of bermuda operationally agency did not initiate storm advisories until 27 hours after time of its formation determined by post hurricane season analysis initially depression possessed a combination of tropical and subtropical characteristics it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone though organization of convection and a warm core within system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone forecasters had predicted depression would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65 mph 105 km h however depression steadily organized and had strengthened into tropical storm juan by early september 25 juan moved northwestward at around 10 mph 16 km h in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east on september 26 an eye feature developed and very deep convection increased around circulation cloud pattern continued to consolidate and juan attained hurricane status later on september 26 while located 165 mi 270 km southeast of bermuda hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear allowing for additional strengthening by september 27 juan had attained a peak intensity of 105 mph 165 km h while located 635 mi 1 020 km south of halifax nova scotia at this peak strength eye of hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well defined and round central dense overcast thumb right hurricane juan making landfall in nova scotia on september 29 hurricane juan remained at peak intensity for over 24 hours after moving northwestward for an extended period of time it turned and accelerated to north eye became less distinct on september 28 and hurricane weakened slightly due to its fast forward motion juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between shad bay and prospect near halifax on september 29 with winds of 100 mph 160 km h it weakened quickly while rapidly moving across southern canadian maritimes and crossing nova scotia peninsula as a hurricane juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over prince edward island by early september 29 later that afternoon storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over northwestern gulf of saint lawrence preparations first advisories were issued by canadian hurricane centre on september 26 although at that time they broadly suggested possibility existed for wind and rain across atlantic canada as juan approached on september 27 warning broadcasts on local media in atlantic canada were changed accordingly public and emergency officials in expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster after chc bulletins indicated possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges as well as power outages on morning of september 28 reports indicated that juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal category 1 hurricane weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that storm would weaken prior to landfall by 6 p m adt 2100 utc additional warnings had been issued since juan was expected to make landfall as a strong category 1 or weak category 2 hurricane most businesses in areas affected were closed on sundays which meant that preparations could not be made at last minute although no large scale evacuations were made local evacuations for low lying areas were issued on evening of september 28 in all several hundred people were affected by these evacuations utility workers also stood on standby before storm hit preparing for large scale power outages impact nova scotia left thumb debris on streets of halifax following hurricane hurricane juan s maximum sustained wind speed at landfall in nova scotia was measured at 100 mph 155 km h urban concentration surrounding halifax harbour bore brunt of highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during storm some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145 mph 230 km h wave rider weather buoys off entrance of halifax harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65 ft 20 m significant erosion occurred on populated shores of harbour particularly in bedford basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of wave action storm surges of 5 to 7 feet 1 5 to 2 m were reported in harbour it was highest surge ever recorded in halifax harbour rainfall was fairly light due to fast movement and dry air on southern side of storm there were no rainfall reports greater than 2 inches 52 mm juan caused widespread structural and vegetation damage across region particularly in and around halifax regional municipality extensive damage to trees was reported which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines many homes and businesses suffered property damage particularly roof damage on structures and some weaker structures were destroyed hrm

path including a replica of hector in pictou harbour severity of property damage in metropolitan areas of halifax and dartmouth of halifax regional municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that juan was likely a category 3 hurricane however sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion many of deciduous trees in central nova scotia still had leaves which magnified effects of wind damage overall number of damaged trees was estimated to be in millions juan claimed six lives two directly in nova scotia both of direct deaths were due to fallen trees one was a halifax paramedic and other was a motorist in enfield three of four indirect deaths were as a result of a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut and fourth was in relief work after

local authorities in hrm with cleanup in urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration many utility workers especially those employed by nova scotia power and dozens of crews from maritime electric and nb power who responded under mutual assistance agreements worked for almost three weeks without any considerable amount of rest many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring extensive damage devastated point pleasant park remained closed for cleanup after storm before re opening in june 2004 nine months after storm hit with a damaged shoreline and almost 85 of its trees removed a revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005 government of nova scotia pledged 10 million 2003 cad in relief money after hurricane hit and private contributions were also made quickly after storm hit prince edward island also pledged 200 000 2003 cad immediately after hurricane hit and federal government also announced their own package mayor of toronto at time mel also contributed 50 000 2003 cad to replace damaged trees in prince edward island hurricane juan alerted residents governments utilities and emergency management agencies throughout atlantic canada to improve preparations for devastating events such as hurricanes especially with climatological data pointing to possible increased frequency of major ocean storms and extratropical cyclones in addition to juan three other storms fabian isabel and kate had a significant effect on land or offshore in canada during 2003 atlantic hurricane season preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when hurricane ophelia was forecast to brush near nova scotia in early september 2005 hurricane juan has also resulted in several changes to meteorological service of canada s canadian hurricane centre which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in dartmouth nova scotia to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage chc s hurricane warning system has also been improved traditionally chc did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings which were often not heeded by local residents beginning in 2004 atlantic hurricane season chc began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting canada canada issued its first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of hurricane kyle and in 2009 issued its second hurricane watch in anticipation of hurricane bill hurricane juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck nova scotia and prince edward island a few months later in february 2004 which quickly became known as white juan because paralyzing effects of massive snowfall evoked recent hurricane retirement because of its effects in canada name juan was retired in april 2004 and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane environment canada noted that its request for retirement was in consideration of lost and damaged lives impact to economy and widespread destruction of trees throughout two provinces it was first time that meteorological service of canada had specifically requested a hurricane name be retired name was replaced by joaquin for 2009 season but since it was not used during that year it was used in 2015 season although it was later retired see
