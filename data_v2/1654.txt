and pipeline was built only after oil crisis provoked passage of legislation designed to remove legal challenges to project in building pipeline engineers faced a wide range of difficulties stemming mainly from extreme cold and difficult isolated terrain construction of pipeline was one of first large scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with frozen ground project attracted tens of thousands of workers to alaska causing a boomtown atmosphere in valdez fairbanks and anchorage first barrel of oil traveled

wide right of way to build a subterranean 48 inch 122 centimeter pipeline including 11 pumping stations another right of way was requested to build a construction and maintenance highway paralleling pipeline a document of just 20 pages contained all of information taps had collected about route up to that stage in its surveying berry p 106 interior department responded by sending personnel to analyze proposed route and plan max brewer an arctic expert in charge of naval arctic research laboratory at barrow concluded that plan to bury most of pipeline was completely unfeasible because of abundance of permafrost along route in a report brewer said hot oil conveyed by pipeline would melt underlying permafrost causing pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud this report was passed along to appropriate committees of u s house and senate which had to approve right of way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in mineral leasing act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former secretary of interior stewart udall naske p 253 udall imposed freeze on any projects involving land claimed by alaska natives in hopes that an overarching native claims settlement would result roscow p 32 in fall of 1969 department of interior and taps set about bypassing land freeze by obtaining waivers from various native villages that had claims to a portion of proposed right of way by end of september all relevant villages had waived their right of way claims and secretary of interior wally hickel asked congress to lift land freeze for entire taps project after several months of questioning by house and senate committees with oversight of project hickel was given authority to lift land freeze and give go ahead to taps taps began issuing letters of intent to contractors for construction of haul road a highway running length of pipeline route to be used for construction heavy equipment was prepared and crews prepared to go to work after hickel gave permission and snow melted roscow p 59 before hickel could act however several alaska native and conservation groups asked a judge in washington d c to issue an injunction against project several of native villages that had waived claims on right of way reneged because taps had not chosen any native contractors for project and contractors chosen were not likely to hire native workers roscow p 60 on april 1 1970 judge george luzerne hart jr of united states district court for district of columbia ordered interior department to not issue a construction permit for a section of project that crossed one of claims roscow p 61 less than two weeks later hart heard arguments from conservation groups that taps project violated mineral leasing act and national

groups and environmental organizations had voiced opposition to pipeline project before 1970 introduction of national environmental policy act allowed them legal grounds to halt project arctic engineers had raised concerns about way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of arctic engineering and permafrost in particular coates p 185 a clause in nepa requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by wilderness society friends of earth and environmental defense fund in their spring

and evidence in congressional debates by end of march coates p 199 criticisms of project included its effect on alaska tundra possible pollution harm to animals geographic features and lack of much engineering information from alyeska one element of opposition report quelled was discussion of alternatives all proposed alternatives extension of alaska railroad an alternative route through canada establishing a port at prudhoe bay and more were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across alaska opposition also was directed at building of construction and maintenance highway parallel to pipeline although a clause in alyeska s pipeline proposal called for removal of pipeline at a certain point no such provision was made for removal of road sydney howe president of conservation foundation warned oil might last for fifty years a road would remain forever coates p 203 this argument relied upon slow growth of plants and animals in far northern alaska due to harsh conditions and short growing season in testimony an environmentalist argued that arctic trees though only a few feet tall had been seedlings when george washington was inaugurated coates p 200 portion of environmental debate with biggest symbolic impact took place when discussing pipeline s impact on caribou herds coates p 207 environmentalists proposed that pipeline would have an effect on caribou similar to effect of u s transcontinental railroad on american bison population of north america pipeline critics said pipeline would block traditional migration routes making caribou populations smaller and making them easier to hunt this idea was exploited in anti pipeline advertising most notably when a picture of a forklift carrying several legally shot caribou was emblazoned with slogan there is more than one way to get caribou across alaska pipeline coates p 208 use of caribou as an example of pipeline s environmental effects reached a peak in spring of 1971

that a settlement should include of land and a payment of 500 million issue remained at a standstill until alyeska began lobbying in favor of a native claims act in congress in order to lift legal injunction against pipeline construction in october 1971 president richard nixon signed alaska native claims settlement act ancsa under act native groups would renounce their land claims in exchange for 962 5 million and in federal land mead p 137 money and land were split up among village and regional corporations which then distributed shares of stock to natives in region or village shares paid dividends based on both settlement and corporation profits mead p 137 139 to pipeline developers most important aspect of ancsa was clause dictating that no native allotments could be selected in path of pipeline coates p 227 another objection of natives was potential for pipeline to disrupt a traditional way of life many natives were worried that disruption caused by pipeline would scare away whales and caribou that are relied upon for food legal issues and politics thumb left most road crossings are simply buried deep but this crossing on richardson highway is close to surface and employs special heat pipes that conduct heat from oil to fins at top of pipes in order to avoid thawing permafrost in both courts and congress alyeska and oil companies fought for pipeline s construction amidst opposition concerning pipeline s eis environmental impact statement arguments continued through 1971 objections about caribou herds were countered by observations of davidson ditch a water pipeline with same diameter of trans alaska pipeline which caribou were able to jump over coates p 210 to those who argued that pipeline would irrevocably alter alaska wilderness proponents pointed to overgrown remnants of fairbanks gold rush most of which had been erased 70 years later coates p 211 some pipeline opponents were satisfied by alyeska s preliminary design which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting automatic leak detection and shutoff and other techniques coates p 231 other opponents including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of valdez maintained their disagreement with plan coates p 220 223 all arguments both for and against pipeline were incorporated into 3 500 page 9 volume final environmental impact statement which was released on march 20 1972 although alaska sen ted stevens felt statement was not written by a proponent it maintained general approval for pipeline construction that was demonstrated in draft statement coates p 228 u s secretary of interior rogers morton allowed 45 days of comment after release and conservationists created a 1 300 page document opposing impact statement coates p 229 this document failed to sway judge hart who lifted injunction on project on august 15 1972 coates p 235 environmental groups that had filed injunction appealed decision and on october 6 1972 u s district court of appeals in washington d c partially reversed hart s decision appeals court said that although impact statement followed guidelines set by national environmental policy act it did not follow minerals leasing act which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for trans alaska pipeline oil companies and alyeska appealed this decision to u s supreme court but in april 1973 court declined to hear case coates pp 236 237 congressional issues with appeals court having decided that minerals leasing act did not cover pipeline s requirements alyeska and oil companies began lobbying congress to either amend act or create a new law that would permit a larger right of way senate interior committee began first hearings on a series of bills to that effect on march 9 1973 coates p 237 environmental opposition switched from contesting pipeline on nepa grounds to fighting an amendment to leasing act or a new bill coates pp 237 239 by spring and summer of 1973 these opposition groups attempted to persuade congress to endorse a trans canada oil pipeline or a railroad they believed leave it in ground argument was doomed to fail and best way to oppose pipeline would be to propose an ineffective alternative which could be easily defeated coates p 241 243 problem with this approach was that any such alternative would cover more ground and be more damaging environmentally than trans alaska pipeline coates p 244 hearings in both u s senate and house continued through summer of 1973 on both new bills and amendments to mineral leasing act on july 13 an amendment calling for more study of project mondale bayh amendment was defeated coates p 245 this was followed by another victory for pipeline proponents when an amendment by alaska sen mike gravel was passed by senate amendment declared that pipeline project fulfilled all aspects of nepa and modified mineral leasing act to allow larger

or its actual maximum of in 1988 facts p 63 from pump station 1 it takes an average of 11 9 days for oil to travel entire length of pipeline to valdez a speed of minimum flow through pipeline is not as clearly defined as its maximum operating at lower flows will extend life of pipeline as well as increasing profit for its owners 2012 flow of 600 000 bbd is significantly less than what pipeline was designed for low require that oil move slower through line meaning that its temperature drops more than in high flow situations a freeze in line would block a pig in line which would force a shutdown and repairs a 2011 engineering report by alyeska stated that to avoid freezing heaters would need to be installed at several pump stations this report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350 000 bbd but it did not attempt to determine absolute minimum other studies have suggested that minimum is 70 000 to 100 000 bbd with current pipeline alyeska could also replace 48 pipeline from prudhoe bay to fairbanks with a 20 pipeline and use rail rest of way which would allow as little as 45 000 bbd pumping stations maintain momentum of oil as it goes through pipeline how do pumping stations work pump station 1 is northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across length of pipeline original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each but pump station 11 was never built nevertheless pump stations retained their intended naming system eight stations were operating at startup and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose facts p 49 as of
