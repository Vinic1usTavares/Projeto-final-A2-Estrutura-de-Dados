japanese video game developer and publisher square enix formerly two companies called square and enix prior to 2003 has been translating its games for north america since late 1980s and pal region and asia since late 1990s it has not always released all of its games in all major regions and continues to selectively release games even today depending on multiple factors such as viability of platforms or condition of game itself process of localization has changed during that time from having a one person team with a short time and tight memory capacities to having a team of translators preparing simultaneous launches in multiple languages companies first major projects were dragon quest and final fantasy which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises since then majority of games produced by companies have been localized for western audiences although process was not given a high priority at square until international success of final fantasy vii a dedicated localization department was consequently created at company s tokyo headquarters around 1998 enix remained without a translation department until its merger with square in 2003 in recent years process of localization has undergone changes mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles most major titles are now developed with localization running in parallel to development with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to western market staff localization staff at square enix works mainly from japanese to english french german spanish italian as well as russian korean and mandarin for a number of titles in 2016 final fantasy xv became first major title from company to release in latin american spanish and brazilian portuguese minor titles are occasionally localized from english to european languages prior to merger of square and enix in 2003 enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its western releases to translators who had no close contact with original development teams as was case for dragon quest vii square also did not initially have a localization department though a number of such as kaoru moriyama and ted woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in early 1990s moriyama described work at time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to limitations of rom sizes she also commented hironobu sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for english version at that time following massive international success of final fantasy vii however company looked into improving quality of its translated products game was widely criticized for its rushed english translation which had been handled entirely by michael baskett company s only in house translator at time to that end square tasked richard honeywood originally a programmer with creating a dedicated localization team in tokyo headquarters his first major project was xenogears while there were only two members at first including honeywood staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007 and over 70 in 2015 success of final fantasy vii also led to creation of a london based european office in 1998 which would handle marketing and quality assurance for pal market approach before a translation is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language localization quality assurance qa and marketing staff play through a build of game and sometimes do a focus group study localization team s playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay once company a localization project a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary style naming schemes and fonts are chosen during translation phase voiced sections are translated first text files are cross checked by multiple translators and editors text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes and game goes to quality assurance during a period of several weeks to up to three months japanese qa teams look for bugs while western qa teams check linguistic issues localization team often re plays game during this phase translates manuals and help out on guidebooks if these are made finally game is sent to hardware manufacturers to be approved challenges for localization teams include space limitation due to data storage and or on screen space achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order and when voiced footage is not re recorded for lip movement dealing with file length and lip synch limitations when same team works on different games in a series such as final fantasy they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on setting of their games another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into english and different cultural expectations about character interactions localization process depends on factors such as development teams wishes as well as budget and schedule traditionally translation usually started late in development or after original japanese release but recent titles have been translated during initial development making translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators this was case for final fantasy xi final fantasy xiii final fantasy xiv and final fantasy xv a few titles like bouncer have actually been recorded in english first and then adapted to japanese last remnant also adopted this approach featuring motion capture and dialogue synched to english rather than japanese actors this was done due to company s wish to create a title for international market many early localizations like other rpgs both then and in more recent years made heavy use of antiquated speech patterns and archaic nouns such as thee and thou square was not greatly focused on their localizations before worldwide commercial success of final fantasy vii in later years original translators were joined by editors to catch grammar and spelling errors prior to development of final fantasy xiii 2 standard localization process for a title involved dual development between company s sound and localization departments which meant that difficulties could arise because of constant changes to dialogue starting from xiii 2 in house development tools such as and rosetta have been developed to ensure all parts of process were properly synchronized and centralized in recent years english language localization teams have tended to adopt two different approaches to translation and localization either they remain quite faithful to original japanese or they can make large changes as long as story outline remains same former method was adopted for final fantasy xiii and its sequels although some alterations were made in order to make english dialogue sound natural in choosing voice actors company prefers to avoid well known film and television actors citing ellen page s casting in beyond two souls as a counterexample vagrant story generally recognized as a high quality localization made some significant changes in style whereas original japanese text was rather straightforward english version made use of archaic medieval and old english words and dialogue in contrast european and asian versions are generally known to be closer to source text experiences honeywood described xenogears his first translation project at square and first to be handled internally by company as pure hell he stated that he started to change company s approach to localization after that game moving booths to always work very closely with original development teams improving communication with them and introducing full time editors woolsey an english translator in snes era also had a troublesome time while localizing secret of mana which he said nearly killed him translation was completed within a month of japanese release as square wanted to catch 1993 holiday season final fantasy xiiis localization handled by phil bright and tom slattery was also quite chaotic according to slattery lack of deadlines poor communication and synchronization between various departments and continuing changes to script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development due to script changes large sections of dialogue needed to be re translated and re recorded by english actors due to lack of necessary emotional drive for scenes in contrast alexander o smith who is often associated with ivalice games had a good working relationship with yasumi matsuno during localization of titles like vagrant story final fantasy xii and 2010 re release of tactics ogre let us cling together two worked closely to ensure that english versions were faithful to matsuno s vision a challenging localization was final fantasy x first final fantasy title to feature voice acting there team faced problems in both making dialogue more compatible with an english speaking audience and lip synching it roughly with in game characters whose lip movement was still for original japanese dialogue european releases of same games did not feature localized voices but instead included english voices this trend lasted until final fantasy xiv first game to feature german french chinese and korean voices changes when translating its game titles square enix tries to take into account cultural differences between japan and target territories this sometimes involves rewriting dialogue or altering graphics animations and sounds for instance in chocobo racing visual references to japanese folk heroes momotaro and kiji were changed to depict hansel and gretel since game was designed mainly for children and hansel and gretel are better known in west than momotaro and kiji according to honeywood trying to explain to original development teams why some changes are needed can range from frustrating to downright hilarious generally older development teams trust translators with making changes while newer teams can be more reluctant though they usually build up trust gradually localization team for world ends with you chose to preserve japanese elements to ensure game s cultural aspect remained intact while localizing final fantasy xii translators smith and reeder worked to preserve original script s meaning while using english dialects to reproduce japanese dialects found in original version to identify factions within game final fantasy viis script was done by a small team resulting in a rough script and inconsistencies one of more famous of these was name of aerith gainsborough name was originally meant to be a merging of air and earth but her name in original english release was spelled similar space issues frequently motivated character renames in older games such as chrono triggers crono and final fantasy ixs originally named salamander during his localization of secret of mana in 1993 woolsey was forced to trim down vast amounts of character dialogue due to an awkward fixed text font later stating that he was satisfied with final result with ports and remakes of older games dialogue can be changed or added by team as in case of final fantasy vi title can also be altered for various reasons final fantasy iv and vi were released in north america as final fantasy ii and iii this was due to fact that original ii and iii on nes had not received a western release final fantasy legend was originally to be called great warrior saga but changed it to its current title to tie in with final fantasy series which was well known and popular in north america prequel to secret of mana seiken densetsu was similarly renamed final fantasy adventure in its north american release only to be later renamed again to mystic quest in europe in an attempt to tie it with unrelated final fantasy mystic quest dragon quest one of earliest successful japanese role playing games had its title changed to dragon warrior so as not to confuse it with similarly titled tabletop role playing game dragonquest dragonquest title was discontinued in 1987 and square enix registered dragon quest trademark for their use in 2003 also due to copyright issues world ends with you could not be released under its original japanese title it s a wonderful world gameplay may be altered when it is felt that a game might be too easy or difficult for western audience some of older final fantasy titles such as final fantasy iv were altered to be more easy to play in west than in japan though their remakes and ports have generally restored difficulty gameplay also received notable cuts for its north american release on other hand final fantasy xii revenant wings was made more difficult in localized versions because western market was judged more familiar with real time strategy genre than japanese market for western release of dissidia final fantasy game was changed to suit western players including removing several rpg elements to make it more akin to an action game censorship can also affect localized versions of games and require obscuring mature themes rewriting risque remarks or phrases altering graphics or removing parts of some scenes this was common in nes and snes eras but less drastic later on once video game content rating systems were established original western releases of early games in final fantasy and dragon quest featured multiple occurrences of this form of censorship final fantasy viii also received some censorship for its european release including removal of a nazi like uniform less commonly this also goes other way for instance with final fantasy xii in which a sequence involving violence against a female character was censored in japanese version but restored in american and european releases references to religion can also be removed as in final fantasy iv and vi such references in xenogears caused square to consider not releasing it in north america releases in 2008 square enix expressed willingness to make worldwide simultaneous releases norm concerning final fantasy xi at time of original english only european release in 2004 producer hiromichi tanaka had stated that while japanese north american australian simultaneous releases are possible due to translating only japanese to english it was not possible for european countries due to difficulty of finding good japanese to european languages translators and fact that second hand translations from english would be akin to chinese whispers however team later integrated full fledged french and german localization teams achieving simultaneous release from japanese for three different languages from 2007 on another example of synchronized localization is final fantasy xiii company started localization process in several languages alongside game s development to lessen delay between local and international releases for self contained series or games linked by story events or similar elements square enix makes an effort to use same localization teams as in case of ivalice titles or kingdom hearts final fantasy xiv a realm reborn was localized in house by square enix under supervision by naoki yoshida dedicated teams were formed for each language with koji fox leading english version compared to its predecessor which featured english only voice overs even in japanese release a realm reborn featured english japanese german and french voice overs with all languages released in simultaneous fashion similar to final fantasy xi game featured voice work in a low number of cutscenes this was explained by fact that team did not want new voice recording to dominate creation of new content after initial release team later added korean and chinese languages to game albeit released in a different schedule as service is separate western release of lightning returns final fantasy xiii was delayed by over two months because of large amount of dialogue which changes due to game s time mechanic that needed to be translated and recorded viability of a game s platform can also affect both localization and release as in case of playstation portable exclusive final fantasy type 0 which would eventually come west as a high definition port for playstation 4 and xbox one and seiken densetsu 3 which was not localized due to undefined technical problems company has also recently started releasing japanese voice tracks as downloadable content as in case of lightning returns final fantasy xiii and one of titles it has published access games developed drakengard 3 another aspect of square enix s policy concerning western release of games was to make games that appealed to both western and japanese audiences but worldwide success of japan aimed bravely default caused them to rethink their strategy although english was originally main language of square enix s foreign releases including in non english speaking countries it seems some titles may debut without an english release in future such as chinese version of dragon quest x before an north american or european release has been confirmed final fantasy xv on other hand was first final fantasy game to feature nine languages in a simultaneous launch additional content localized versions sometimes expand on original games for example when honeywood found contradictions in story of chrono cross in 2000 he worked with masato kato director and scenario writer of game to rewrite sections and add explanatory dialogue which was not in original version for dragon quest viii journey of cursed king voice overs and orchestral music were recorded for western releases in 2005 while original japanese version did not have them final fantasy tactics war of lions also featured voice acting that was not included in original japanese release in 2007 generally gameplay content left out of original game due to time constraints may be completed and added in localized versions sometimes expanded localized versions of games from series like kingdom hearts and final fantasy are re released in japan re releases are usually based on a direct port of north american releases with english dialogue replacing original japanese audio japanese text acting as subtitles they can also include features and tweaks previously only available in western version alongside other additions such as adding japanese voice acting to 3ds version of dragon quest viii reception 1up com s wesley fenlon praised square enix for high quality of its translations especially as space allocated for text and dialogue had been expanded with new and re released versions of games jeremy parish writing for same site said that quality of square enix s english localizations had gone from laughable to some of best around both praise and criticism has been given to individual games for quality of their localizations xenogears company s first game to feature voice acting drew criticism in regard to its audio presentation while bouncer received a fairly positive response final fantasy x received praise although poor lip synching and some aspects of actors performances were criticized choice of changing a major line from thank you to i love you also received mixed reactions english release of x 2 ended up receiving seventh annual academy of interactive arts sciences award in 2004 for outstanding achievement in character performance final fantasy xii and vagrant story were both highly praised for qualities of their localizations during development of final fantasy xv director hajime tabata directly responded to feedback on english localization of game
