thumb right orbital photo of hadley apennine site apollo 15 landing site is marked with a circle hadley apennine is a region on near side of earth s moon that served as landing site for american apollo 15 mission fourth manned landing on moon and first of j missions in july 1971 site is located on eastern edge of mare imbrium on a lava plain known as palus hadley apennine is bordered by montes apenninus often referred to as apennine front a mountain range and hadley rille a meandering channel on east and west respectively data obtained from composition of soil samples collected on apollo 15 show that most about 90 of samples from apennine front are brown glass breccias and approximately 60 70 obtained from mare surface are basalt although basalts seem to vary in their texture their ages appear to be approximately same most of samples obtained on apennine front are kreep potassium rare earth elements phosphorus materials recrystallized norite or recrystallized breccia geography and geology location thumb right orbital photo of hadley apennine with apollo 15 traverses labeled hadley apennine is located west of montes apenninus and east of hadley rille apennine mountains form a escarpment that rises higher above hadley plain than himalayan front above plains of india and nepal hadley rille also referred to as rima hadley is located to west of apollo 15 landing site and was subject of substantial investigation during that mission feature named from nearby mons hadley is a channel that was likely formed by volcanic processes earlier in history of moon apollo 15 landing site american apollo 15 mission first of j series missions that featured both increased scientific capability and use of lunar roving vehicle landed in an area of hadley apennine region to west of apennine front situated between mountains mons hadley and mons hadley delta to northeast and south respectively this landing site was selected with objectives of exploring apennine front hadley rille and other geologic features in area apollo 15 was first mission in which landing sites were not restricted to equatorial areas hadley apennine site was chosen with specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within moon than had been obtained from fra mauro formation on apollo 14 and investigating hadley rille a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity site had been of interest to mission planners since early in program during early stages of apollo landing site planning apollo 19 which was originally planned to be fourth and penultimate j mission of initial exploration portion of apollo program was tentatively set to land in hadley apennine region albeit at a point south of eventual apollo 15 site and west of hadley rille near carlos pit at southwestern terminus of rille an area known as marius hills was also considered for apollo 15 but it was determined by mission planners that a landing on edge of mare imbrium at hadley apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than marius hills alternative and placing a seismometer at hadley apennine given locations of seismic packages from previous apollo expeditions would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study thumb right lunar module falcon backdropped by swann range of montes apenninus apennine front apennine mountains which rise to a height of nearly farther above mare plain than himalayan front above indian and nepalese plains are hypothesized to be fault block mountains displaced upward and segmented by impact that formed mare imbrium frontal escarpment of mons hadley delta is believed to be an exposed segment of pre imbrium impact lunar crust this made mountain one of mission s primary objectives as it would allow astronauts to obtain samples of lunar crust as it was before creation of mare imbrium area of apennine mountains between mons hadley and silver spur a mountain just southeast of mons hadley delta although lacking an official designation on maps and other official mission literature was informally referred to as swann range by apollo 15 astronauts david scott and james irwin after mission geology team leader gordon swann one of mountains in swann range was informally referred to by astronauts as big rock mountain after apollo program director at time of mission rocco petrone a thick regolith layer on lower slopes of mountains and a thin cover of debris on upper slopes are suggested by relative absence of large boulders on lower mountain flanks majority of samples collected by apollo 15 astronauts from apennine front are other than kreep potassium rare earth elements phosphorus materials included and recrystallized norite and breccia unknown before apollo 15 mission there are parallel linear patterns on faces of mountains in area although they appeared to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through regolith determining this is made difficult by lighting circumstances during mission a dark band on mount hadley believed to be a marking left by lava after receding was observed by apollo 15 crew thumb right hadley rille taken by apollo 15 astronaut james irwin rima hadley rima hadley a sinuous rille located west of apollo 15 landing site begins in an area of low domes at an elongated crater bela and runs on to north along apennine mountain range some research has suggested that both rille and bela are volcanic vents and lava flows created features another hypothesis suggests that rille was originally a lava tube roof of which collapsed creating current appearance of rille several large boulders some of which are as large as houses are strewn about feature s floor elongated crater bela which forms beginning of rima hadley could have been formed by collapse of a shallow magma chamber visual observation suggests that same is case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings rima hadley typically ranges in depth between but is approximately deep at apollo 15 landing site feature has a cumulative length of about and an average width of about sides of rille at apollo 15 site slope downwards at an angle of about 25 degrees before samples were returned from moon during apollo program several scientists believed that feature and other similar features were formed by flowing water this hypothesis has since been changed however to attribute process of feature s creation to volcanism rima hadley is interpreted as one of most defined sinuous rilles on lunar surface outcrops of rock were observed by apollo 15 crew on both near and far sides of rille and were photographed and in case of outcrops on near rim were sampled layering in these outcrops is evident from photos taken of them by crew some of strata observed have thicknesses of up to about and appear to vary in albedo reflectivity and texture large boulders near bottom of rille are believed to be blocks that have broken off of outcrops above south cluster and north complex south cluster a crater cluster located to south of apollo 15 site near mons hadley delta is believed to have formed as a result of a secondary impact or impact of ejecta debris from a larger impact elsewhere on moon probably crater about northwest of cluster s location this meant that apollo 15 astronauts were able to sample material from other parts of lunar surface without traversing a great distance feature also allowed astronauts to sample material that was originally located deep within moon south rim of dune crater within cluster was visited by astronauts north complex is a collection of several landforms including craters that were thought to have been formed by volcanic activity although apollo 15 astronauts were to visit this feature they were unable to do so due to time constraints and time consuming issues in obtaining core samples see also notes references external links hadley rille and mountains of moon labeled oblique lroc image lto hadley lunar topographic
