second in each primary during campaign he dubbed leftist douglas as pink lady in daily news a nickname which was reused by nixon campaign in general election just before primary when nixon who along with douglas had also cross filed sent out election materials which did not mention that he was a republican an ad appeared in daily news from hitherto unknown veterans democratic committee
