such as triangular relationships of main characters production was set in vancouver canada used for its middle america landscape with five months devoted to casting right actors in lead roles filming for pilot officially began four days after last actor was cast for series when time constraints would not allow production crew to physically create sets computer generated imagery was used to

winning two plot and themes introduced episode begins in 1989 when a meteor shower hits smallville at same time a small spacecraft containing an alien boy crashes in front of jonathan and martha kent s played by john schneider and annette o toole truck they adopt superhumanly powerful child and name him clark gough and millar use this opening scene to establish that three lead characters of series clark lana and lex share a common bond they are all without one or both parents clark is only survivor of his homeworld lana s parents are killed in meteor shower and lex is alienated from his father lionel luthor john glover after being rendered bald by meteor blast episode jumps forward twelve years to when clark tom welling is trying to find his identity he is unable to handle being told of his alien origins and runs away from home although he is attracted to lana lang kristin kreuk he cannot get close to her without falling over in pain because she wears a necklace made of meteor rock kryptonite which is a radioactive fragment of clark s destroyed homeworld this was a concept gough and millar devised to establish a reason for clark s clumsiness in other media it is usually portrayed as an act he puts on to deceive people of his true identity but clark and lana do share an intimate moment at a cemetery where lana is visiting grave of her parents in such scenes gough and millar created a theme of loneliness through life stories of clark and lana lana s boyfriend whitney fordman eric johnson becomes jealous of clark and lana s friendship and ties clark to a scarecrow pole using lana s necklace indirectly to subdue clark this image of clark in just his underwear and a red s painted on his chest stretches back to gough and millar s foundation for series which was about taking clark down to basic elements of superman character in second strand of story lex luthor michael rosenbaum and clark develop a yin and yang relationship clark first saves lex from drowning when they get into a car accident at end of episode lex saves clark when he is strung up in cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite jeremy creek adrian who was mutated by meteor rocks gaining special powers puts three former jocks who tied him to a scarecrow pole during meteor shower into comas he sets out to kill everyone attending school s dance after witnessing clark experience same hazing he did but clark is able to arrive in time to stop him production casting thumb upright tom welling initially refused role of clark kent twice before taking test for role gough and millar had five months for casting but their primary focus was on finding an actor to play clark kent they received kristin kreuk s audition tape for role of lana lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to network simpson pp 8 17 tom welling after twice turning down producers attempts to get him to audition for role of clark kent eventually accepted opportunity to be part of show simpson pp 112 115 it was david nutter who finally convinced welling to read script for pilot after finding welling s picture in a photo album at casting director s office welling s manager did not want him to take role because it could hurt his feature film career but welling liked script and agreed to come in for an audition welling s reason for turning down role was because producers were keeping quiet on what show was really about which left him with impression show was going to be superman in high school something he did not want to do nutter promised to let welling read script if he came in and auditioned after auditioning welling was given script to read which he thought was amazing for one of his auditions he read graveyard scene from pilot with kristin kreuk network thought they had great chemistry no one could agree on which actors had best audition for lex luthor michael rosenbaum auditioned twice simpson pp 120 123 and believing he did not take his first audition seriously outlined a two and a half page scene from pilot he indicated all places to be funny charismatic or menacing and performed so well that everyone agreed he was guy john schneider was brought in to play jonathan kent schneider was already well known as bo duke from dukes of hazzard and gough believed schneider s experience from dukes of hazzard added believability to idea that he could have grown up running a farm cynthia ettinger was originally cast as martha kent but during filming it was generally agreed ettinger included that she was not right for role annette o toole who previously portrayed lana lang in superman iii and who was fresh off recent cancellation of her television series huntress was cast in ettinger s place reshooting scenes ettinger had filmed simpson pp 136 139 eric johnson after auditioning for roles of lex and clark was cast as lana lang s boyfriend whitney fordman johnson only spent one day filming his scenes for pilot simpson pp 132 135 allison mack toyed with idea of auditioning for role of lana lang but chose instead to audition for role of chloe sullivan simpson pp 128 131 character was created just for series and was intended to add ethnic diversity to cast but part of reason gough and millar chose to cast mack against their initial intentions to give character an ethnic background was because they were impressed with allison mack s rare ability to deliver large chunks of dialogue conversationally sam jones iii who plays pete ross was last of series regulars to be cast gough and millar saw jones four days before they began filming for pilot in comics pete ross is caucasian and producers chose to cast jones who is african american against mythology simpson pp 124 127 filming once warner bros television secured rights to show gough and millar set out to write script and find a director for pilot gough and millar were fans of director david nutter s previous work they considered him to be a preeminent pilot director david nutter joined project because he wanted to make a pilot that respected audience but that was still fun and smart nutter also believes in creating shows that appeal to a wide variety of audiences simpson pp 20 23 he wanted final scene for pilot in which clark fantasizes about dancing with lana to express show s essence according to welling it brings them close not as close as clark would like but at end of this episode he imagines that he s with her and can really see it happening production was initially slated to take place in australia but vancouver british columbia canada had more of middle america feel for which creators were looking area offered a site for kent farm including their barn and city itself doubled as metropolis vancouver provided a cheaper shooting location and was in same time zone as los angeles filming began in march 2001 nutter spent sixteen days on main unit filming and an additional five days for second unit filming time constraints forced nutter to film strictly from adrien van s 150 page storyboard when filming opening meteor shower scene much of look for smallville came from millar who wanted epitome of smalltown usa construction coordinator rob maier explained it had to be cleaner than clean nicer than nice more beautiful than it would be in real world all of people in smallville are beautiful all of colors are bright and sharp for kent farm nutter wanted to have an old world sensibility and tone for pilot production crew only built a kitchen and dining room to represent kent home simpson pp 24 27 all exterior shots of farm were taken at andalinis farm owned by a local couple who also gave crew permission to paint their forest green house yellow since vancouver farm already had a barn production crew only had to build a loft with stairs leading up to it thumb right hatley castle provides outside look of luthor ancestral home but interior was shot at shannon mews in vancouver exterior shots of luthor mansion were shot at hatley castle in victoria two hours west of vancouver by ferry time constraints forced scenes which were shot from multiple angles to sometimes be shot at separate locations a scene involving whitney eric johnson and lana kristin kreuk sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations close ups of whitney were shot under a football stadium while close ups of lana were shot in a potato processing factory unable to shoot at house being used as lang residence crew built lana s front porch inside a sewage processing facility for final scene of episode where lana walks up stairs to her house local sewage treatment facility is also site for luthorcorp pesticide plant which lex was sent to smallville to manage crash site of clark s ship was shot at where mission to mars was filmed smallville s main street was filmed in both town of merritt which is three hours east of vancouver and in town of cloverdale most of filming took place in cloverdale since town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as smallville s main street when production crew came to film opening teaser they had to decorate town with ribbons and balloons as well as paint some of buildings to attain millar s idea of smalltown usa two sets were built just for pilot kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside farm s barn for cemetery scene between clark and lana production designer bernard hides built entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field effects on set computer generated effects for pilot were done by thomas special effects certain scenes because of time and money had to be created digitally opening sequence showing destruction of water tower by a meteor was created on computer a persistent problem during production was lack of cornfields as realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in kansas this became a problem for filmmakers over 10 000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse for pilot but they only grew two feet high which was not usable to crew day crew was filming scene for clark s landing there were no cornfields in surrounding area cornfields had to be digitally added digital corn was a common substitute for undersized corn that was grown but for scenes where digital corn was not an option six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in arizona other digital effects include flattened cornfield where lex was caught in a meteorite blast some scenes required physical effects instead of computer imagery when lex drives his car off a bridge and hits clark stunt performer who doubled as wolverine in film x men was literally hit by car as it

pilot received favorable reviews upon its release rob owen of pittsburgh post gazette thought it was a respectful addition to superman lore and had all markings of a super series owen noted christ like imagery of scene stating is it any wonder clark gets tied up there since superman too was sent to save us echoing owen dvd verdict noted same symbolism superman is in a way secular pop culture stand in for jesus christ a messiah figure for our generation series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode in which clark is symbolically crucified in a cornfield that striking bit of symbolism becomes central preoccupation of series clark is savior who sacrifices all for greater good of humanity and smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role elizabeth white of media life believed show had potential to be a big hit for wb but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot tuesdays at 9 00 p m est but also audience s expectations of what superman should be usa todays robert bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism bianco stated for all its innovations there s also something rehashed and repetitive about smallville shows often look more familiar at outset than they do as they progress there s talent and intelligence at work in smallville given time maybe they ll find a more distinctive voice jeremy conrad from ign swore to himself that he would never watch smallville because he was a huge superman fan and he did not like idea creators would be making changes to superman mythology after viewing pilot conrad stated it s a very solid
