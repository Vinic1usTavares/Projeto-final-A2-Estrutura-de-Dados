banksia oblongifolia commonly known as fern leaved dwarf or rusty banksia is a species in plant genus banksia found along eastern coast of australia from wollongong new south wales in south to rockhampton queensland in north it generally grows in sandy soils in heath open forest or swamp margins and wet areas a many stemmed shrub up to high it has leathery serrated leaves and rusty coloured new growth yellow flower spikes known as inflorescences most commonly appear in autumn and early winter up to 80 follicles or seed pods develop on spikes after flowering banksia oblongifolia from its woody lignotuber after bushfires and seed pods open and release seed when burnt seed germinating and growing on burnt ground some plants grow between fires from seed shed spontaneously spanish botanist antonio jose cavanilles described b oblongifolia in 1800 though it was known as banksia aspleniifolia in new south wales for many years however latter name originally coined by richard anthony salisbury proved invalid and banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as correct scientific name since 1981 two varieties were recognised in 1987 but these have not been generally accepted a wide array of mammals birds and invertebrates visit inflorescences though easily grown as a garden plant it is not commonly seen in horticulture description left thumb leaf undersides showing prominent rusty midrib a key distinguishing feature banksia oblongifolia is a shrub that can reach high though is generally less than high with several stems growing out of a woody base known as a lignotuber smooth bark is marked with horizontal lenticels and is reddish brown fading to greyish brown with age new leaves and branchlets are covered with a rusty fur leaves lose their fur and become smooth with maturity and are alternately arranged along stem measuring in length and in width leathery green leaves are oblong to obovate egg shaped or truncate with a recessed midvein and mildly recurved margins which are entire at base and serrate towards ends of leaves sinuses spaces between teeth are u shaped and teeth are 1 2 mm long leaf underside is whitish with a reticulated vein pattern and a raised central midrib leaves sit on 2 5 mm long petioles flowering has been recorded between january and october with a peak in autumn and early winter april to june inflorescences or flower spikes arise from end of 1 to 5 year old branchlets and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from node or base measuring high and wide yellow spikes often have blue grey tinged limbs in bud though occasionally pinkish mauve or mauve blue limbs are seen opening to a pale yellow after anthesis spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to high and wide with up to 80 follicles covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age oval shaped follicles measure long by 0 2 0 7 cm high 0 1 0 3 in and wide bare swollen spike now known as an infructescence is patterned with short spiky persistent bracts on its surface where follicles have not developed each follicle contains one or two obovate dark grey brown to black seeds sandwiching a woody separator measuring long they are made up of an oblong to semi elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body long by wide woody separator is same shape as seed with an impression where seed body lies next to it seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons long and wide which sit on a stalk or 1 mm diameter finely hairy seedling stem known as hypocotyl which is less than 1 cm high first seedling leaves to emerge are paired oppositely arranged and lanceolate with fine toothed margins measuring 2 5 3 cm long and 0 4 0 5 cm wide subsequent leaves are more oblanceolate elliptic oval shaped or linear young plants develop a lignotuber in their first year banksia oblongifolia can be distinguished from b robur which it often co occurs with by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes b robur has more metallic green flower spikes and often grows in wetter areas within same region b plagiocarpa has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated margins and its flower spikes are blue grey in bud and later bear wedge shaped follicles in sydney basin b paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to b oblongifolia but its leaves are more prominently spathulate spoon shaped and tend to point up rather than down leaf undersides are white and lack prominent midrib of b oblongifolia new growth is bare and lacks rusty fur and aged flower parts remain on old spikes taxonomy first collected by luis nee between march and april 1793 fern leaved banksia was described by antonio jose cavanilles in 1800 as two separate species from two collections first as banksia oblongifolia from vicinity of port jackson sydney and then as banksia salicifolia from around botany bay derived from latin words oblong and folium leaf species name refers to shape of leaves richard anthony salisbury had published name banksia aspleniifolia in 1796 based on leaves of cultivated material robert brown recorded 31 species of banksia in his 1810 work prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen and used epithet oblongifolia in his taxonomic arrangement placing taxon in subgenus banksia verae true banksias because inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike he recognised b salicifolia as same species at this point but was unsure whether salisbury s b aspleniifolia belonged under same name by time carl meissner published his 1856 arrangement of genus there were 58 described banksia species meissner divided brown s banksia verae which had been renamed eubanksia by stephan endlicher in 1847 into four series based on leaf properties he followed brown in using name b oblongifolia and placed it in series salicinae in 1870 george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his landmark publication flora australiensis in bentham s arrangement number of recognised banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 he declared b oblongifolia referrable to and a synonym of b integrifolia bentham defined four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characters b integrifolia was placed in section eubanksia botanists in 20th century recognised b oblongifolia as a species in its own right but disagreed on name those in queensland felt salisbury s name was invalid and used banksia oblongifolia while new south wales authorities used banksia aspleniifolia as it was oldest published name for species botanist and banksia authority alex george ruled that oblongifolia was correct name in his 1981 revision of genus after reviewing salisbury s original species description which is of leaves alone he concluded that it does not diagnose species to exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name description could have applied to juvenile leaves of b paludosa b integrifolia or even b marginata placement within banksia thumb right upright old bare spike with follicles tops nsw thumb right upright new stems arising from woody lignotuber after bushfire also showing rusty new growth lane cove national park thumb right upright habit royal national park current taxonomic arrangement of genus banksia is based on botanist alex george s 1999 monograph for flora of australia book series in this arrangement b oblongifolia is placed in banksia subgenus banksia because its inflorescences take form of banksia s characteristic flower spikes section banksia because of its straight styles and series salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical in a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 kevin thiele placed it in newly described subseries acclives along with b plagiocarpa b robur and b dentata within series salicinae however this subgrouping of salicinae was not supported by george b oblongifolia s placement within banksia may be summarised as follows genus banksia subgenus isostylis subgenus banksia section oncostylis section coccinea section banksia series grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series quercinae series salicinae b dentata b aquilonia b integrifolia b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia b robur b conferta b paludosa b marginata b canei b saxicola since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which then comprised genera banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia oblongifolia resolves as closest relative or sister to b robur with b plagiocarpa as next closest relative in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement b oblongifolia is placed in b subg spathulatae variation george noted that banksia oblongifolia showed considerable variation in habit and in 1987 conran and clifford separated taxon into two subspecies in examining populations in southern queensland they reported that two forms were distinct in growth habit and habitat and that they did not find any intermediate forms new south wales botanists joseph maiden and julius henry camfield had collected this taller form of b oblongifolia in kogarah in 1898 and given it name banksia latifolia variety minor b latifolia being a published name by which b robur was known before maiden and ernst betche renamed it banksia robur variety minor this name confusingly thus became name for taller variety they defined variety oblongifolia as a multistemmed shrub high with leaves long and wide and flower spikes high habitat is swamps and swamp borders or rarely sandstone ridges variety minor is a taller shrub high with leaves up to long and spikes high it is an understory plant in sclerophyll forests associated with eucalyptus signata and banksia spinulosa var collina both subspecies occur throughout range however george rejected varieties stating variability was continuous hybridization banksia robur and b oblongifolia hybrids have been recorded at several locations along eastern coastline field workers for banksia atlas recorded 20 populations between wollongong and in central queensland locales include north of sydney ku ring gai chase national park and dam near wollongong a study of an area of extensive hybridization between two near forest on woronora plateau south of sydney revealed extensive hybridization in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry morphology generally correlated with genetic profile but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridization furthermore there were a few plants with morphology suggestive of a third species b paludosa in their parentage and requiring further investigation a possible hybrid between b oblongifolia and b integrifolia was recorded near caloundra by banksia atlas volunteers distribution and habitat banksia oblongifolia occurs along eastern coast of australia from wollongong new south wales in south to rockhampton queensland in north there are isolated populations offshore on fraser island and inland at blackdown tableland national park and crows nest in queensland and also inland incursions at base of glasshouse mountains in southern queensland at grafton in northern new south wales and and lawson in blue mountains west of sydney b oblongifolia grows in a range of habitats in damp areas with poor drainage along edges of swamps and flats as well as wallum shrubland or coastal plateaux it is also found in open forest or woodland where it grows on ridges or slopes or heath soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone based though granite based and clay loams are sometimes present associated species in sydney region include heathland species such as heath banksia banksia ericifolia coral heath epacris microphylla and mountain devil lambertia formosa and tick bush and prickly leaved paperbark melaleuca nodosa in taller scrub and under trees such as scribbly gum eucalyptus and narrow leaved apple angophora bakeri in woodland agnes banks woodland in western sydney has been recognised by new south wales government as an endangered ecological community here b oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland with scribbly gum narrow leaved apple and old man banksia b serrata as canopy trees and wallum banksia b aemula variable smoke bush conospermum wedding bush showy parrot pea dillwynia sericea and nodding geebung persoonia nutans as other understory species biology right thumb honeybees visiting an inflorescence partway through anthesis banksia oblongifolia plants can live for more than 60 years they respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on large woody lignotuber larger lignotubers have greatest number of buds although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers a 1988 field study in ku ring gai chase national park found that shoots grow longer after fire particularly one within previous four years and that new buds grow within six months after a fire these shoots are able to grow flower and set seed two to three years after a fire woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times one field study in ku ring gai chase national park found 10 opened in absence of bushfire and that seeds germinated and young plants do grow older plants are serotinous that is they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire being relatively heavy seeds do not disperse far from parent plant bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at flowers include red wattlebird anthochaera carunculata lewin s honeyeater meliphaga lewinii brown honeyeater tawny crowned honeyeater gliciphila melanops yellow faced honeyeater lichenostomus chrysops white plumed honeyeater l penicillatus white cheeked honeyeater phylidonyris niger new holland honeyeater p novaehollandiae noisy friarbird philemon corniculatus noisy miner manorina melanocephala and eastern spinebill acanthorhynchus tenuirostris insects recorded visiting flower spikes include european honey bee and ants swamp wallaby bicolor eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire one field study found 30 of seeds were eaten by insects between bushfires insects recovered from inflorescences include banksia boring moth younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into woody axis of spike as they get older and boring into follicles and eating seeds other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of genera and as well as chalarotona and chalarotona and an unidentified weevil species fungal species asterina systema solare episphaerella banksiae and banksiae have been recorded on leaves like most other proteaceae b oblongifolia has proteoid roots roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in soil just below leaf litter these enhance solubilisation of nutrients allowing nutrient uptake in low nutrient soils such as phosphorus deficient native soils of australia a study of coastal heaths on pleistocene sand dunes around myall lakes found b oblongifolia on slopes wet heath and b aemula grew on ridges dry heath and two species did not overlap manipulation of seedlings in same study area showed that b oblongifolia can grow longer roots seeking water than other wet heath species and that seedlings can establish in dry heath but it is as yet unclear why species does not grow in dry heath as well as wet heath unlike similar situations with banksia species in western australia two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other cultivation conrad loddiges and his sons wrote of banksia oblongifolia in volume 3 of their work botanical cabinet in 1818 reporting it had been brought into cultivation in 1792 though had been initially and incorrectly called banksia dentata it flowered in november in united kingdom and was grown in a greenhouse over winter not commonly cultivated it adapts readily to garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part shade or full sun colours of inflorescences in bud and timing of flowers into winter give it horticultural value as does its reddish new growth larger plants have taller flower spikes it is propagated readily from seed with young plants taking five to seven years to flower from seed pruning can improve shrub s appearance and it is a potential bonsai subject references external links oblongifolia category flora of new south wales category flora of queensland category plants described in 1800
