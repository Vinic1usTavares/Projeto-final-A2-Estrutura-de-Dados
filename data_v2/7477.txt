batsman on off side and had a very good defensive technique while his strength on leg side was noted on his test debut although an opening batsman he often went in lower down batting order he was more comfortable in normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches bill bowes called him most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen even more so than len hutton
