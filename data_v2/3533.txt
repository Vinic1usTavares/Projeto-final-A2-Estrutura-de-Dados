severe tropical cyclone nora was a strong tropical cyclone that affected far north queensland and northeastern northern territory during march 2018 ninth named storm and third severe tropical cyclone of 2017 18 australian region cyclone season nora developed from a tropical low which formed near torres strait on 19 march system initially moved quickly to west northwest and then began tracking slowly southwestwards over arafura sea while gradually developing a turn to east on 22 march brought tropical low into a favourable environment for strengthening and system reached tropical cyclone intensity later that day nora then underwent a period of rapid intensification as it moved southeastwards into gulf of carpentaria storm peaked on 23 march as a high end category 3 severe tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 958 hpa 28 29 inhg nora made landfall north of pormpuraaw at about 13 00 utc on 24 march as a minimal category 3 system nora weakened steadily as it tracked southwards along coast and was downgraded to a tropical low following day nora s remnants meandered over land for several days before moving back over gulf of carpentaria and dissipating on 28 march nora was responsible for major impacts across large parts of far north queensland strong winds knocked down many trees and power lines in towns of pormpuraaw kowanyama and mapoon blocking roads and cutting power to more than 500 homes damage was caused to houses council buildings personal property and other buildings very heavy rainfall occurred across most of cape york peninsula and far north queensland many communities became isolated by floodwaters after roads were either blocked or damaged extreme rainfall fell in parts of queensland s east coast including 593 0 mm 23 3 in in just 24 hours in port douglas flash flooding occurred in cairns as a result of intense rainfall including in car parks shopping centres and hotels torrential rain caused landslides that blocked highways in region many people had to be rescued by emergency services after becoming trapped by floodwaters agricultural losses in crops and livestock as well as damage to infrastructure were also sustained when farms were flooded total economic impact of severe tropical cyclone nora is estimated to have exceeded au 32 5 million us 25 million meteorological history several atmospheric features and climate drivers which are typically conducive to tropical cyclogenesis were present in australian longitudes during march 2018 in early to mid march a monsoon trough developed to north of australia stretching from eastern indonesian archipelago to northern coral sea although associated convective activity decreased somewhat as monsoon trough began to weaken this was offset by interaction of significant cross equatorial flow from northern hemisphere with a large area of strong southeasterly wind from australian continent convergence of these winds provided ample rotational energy for development of any low pressure systems in region reinforced by effects of a westwards propagating rossby wave southeasterly wind flow contributed to enhanced atmospheric circulation over tropical waters in addition presence of a weak but discernible pulse of madden julian oscillation in maritime continent supported generation of cloudy weather and increased atmospheric instability in region monsoonal activity began to restrengthen later in month and on 19 march australian bureau of meteorology bom noted that a tropical low had developed in vicinity of torres strait embedded within monsoon trough newly formed tropical low moved quickly to west northwest along southwestern coast of new guinea and was centred just off coast of indonesia s pulau island by 00 00 utc on 20 march system then began to track slowly southwestwards across eastern arafura sea while its central barometric pressure steadily deepened at 18 30 utc joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and indicated that likelihood of rapid intensification over following days was high on 22 march tropical low assumed a course towards east bringing it into an environment which was increasingly favourable for further development fuelled by sea surface temperatures of approximately 29 degc 84 degf low level circulation centre quickly consolidated as convective banding wrapped into developing system jtwc indicated that system had reached tropical storm strength on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale at 06 00 utc and gave it designation tropical cyclone 16p six hours later system was officially upgraded to a category 1 tropical cyclone and was assigned name nora by bom thumb nora rapidly intensifying over eastern arafura sea on 23 march alt as nora passed slowly to north of wessel islands in a weak steering environment already supportive environmental conditions became extremely favourable for strengthening a co located anticyclone in upper troposphere provided excellent poleward and equatorward outflow channels for system in an environment of low vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content had both become favourably high nora began to rapidly intensify reaching category 2 strength on australian scale at 00 00 utc on 23 march as a primitive eye began to emerge on visible light satellite imagery shortly thereafter nora turned southeastwards under influence of a strengthening high pressure ridge to east bom upgraded storm to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 09 00 utc just after one minute sustained winds had reached equivalent of minimal hurricane intensity over following three hours nora underwent explosive intensification with maximum ten minute sustained winds increasing by an average of 5 knots 9 km h 6 mph every hour nora peaked in intensity as it entered gulf of carpentaria reaching high end category 3 severe tropical cyclone status on australian scale bom estimated ten minute sustained winds to be at 155 km h 100 mph gusting to 220 km h 140 mph with a minimum central pressure of 958 hpa 28 29 inhg concurrently jtwc indicated that one minute sustained winds had reached 185 km h 115 mph equivalent to a category 3 major hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale shortly after reaching peak intensity nora began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle causing intensification trend to cease despite very warm waters in gulf of carpentaria diminishing upper level outflow caused system to begin weakening by 03 00 utc on 24 march drier air from cape york peninsula also became entrained into circulation as nora approached coast contributing to storm s decline in intensity nora made landfall in far north queensland at about 13 00 utc on 24 march as a low end category 3 system approximately 55 km 35 mi north of town of pormpuraaw after moving ashore cyclone turned generally southwards and tracked along coastline of gulf country system was downgraded to a tropical low by bom at 06 00 utc following day as it approached mouth of gilbert river development of a competing steering environment associated with a strengthening ridge over central australia caused ex tropical cyclone nora to become quasi stationary from 25 27 march system s remnant low pressure system re emerged over southern gulf of carpentaria on 28 march but was unable to restrengthen it dissipated near mornington island later that day nora was storm to make landfall on queensland s gulf of carpentaria coast since tropical cyclone abigail in 2001 it was also strongest tropical cyclone to exist in gulf of carpentaria since severe tropical cyclone monica in 2006 preparations tropical cyclones in gulf of carpentaria can be relatively unpredictable in their motion and are often difficult to forecast as a result tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for entire gulf coast of queensland and northeastern top end when nora intensified into a tropical cyclone early forecasts also predicted that nora would stay offshore for much longer while tracking into southeastern gulf of carpentaria forecasts indicated that system could have strengthened into a powerful category 4 severe tropical cyclone if this scenario were to have eventuated residents were warned that nora had potential to cause major impacts due to its predicted intensity size and direction of motion bom indicated that storm surge and large waves posed a potential threat to coastal communities in path of system and that inundation of low lying areas on shoreline was possible residents were also warned that widespread heavy rainfall was anticipated with isolated daily falls of up to 300 mm 12 in possible in some areas due to potential for communities to become isolated by flooding emergency electricity generators were installed near critical infrastructure and buildings such as schools hospitals accommodation facilities and some council buildings additional queensland police service officers and other emergency services personnel were also deployed to communities in far north queensland in order to assist with cyclone preparations and maintain safety during cyclone queensland fire and emergency services qfes assembled several rapid response and swift water rescue teams in preparation for cyclone these teams were able to respond to calls for assistance from endangered residents by air within four hours and were equipped to be self sufficient for up to 48 hours if required local council in croydon also installed retaining walls across roads in order to redirect flow of floodwaters despite region being one of most cyclone prone areas of australia mornington island located in southeastern gulf of carpentaria did not have a suitable cyclone shelter for residents to evacuate to in interest of safety local government offered an additional flight to cairns for any residents who wished to evacuate as a precaution queensland health evacuated a total of 25 patients from medical facilities in mornington island pormpuraaw and kowanyama including pregnant women dialysis patients and vulnerable elderly residents an evacuation shelter was also prepared in darwin northern territory s capital to accommodate for potential evacuations from towns in northeastern top end queensland government s closed state schools in pormpuraaw kowanyama and prior to arrival of cyclone in order to protect students and teachers impacts queensland thumb flooding to west of croydon from torrential rainfall generated by nora alt 270x270px nora was first tropical cyclone to make landfall on queensland s gulf of carpentaria coastline since tropical cyclone oswald in 2013 and first to do so at category 3 or higher since severe tropical cyclone abigail in 2001 after making landfall nora tracked southwards along coast passing just to east of pormpuraaw at category 3 intensity and then west of kowanyama as a category 2 system neither town experienced full strength of cyclone however strong winds were still experienced in both communities kowanyama was subjected to sustained gale force winds in early morning of 25 march and local airport recorded a maximum wind gust of 100 km h 62 mph just before 18 00 utc pormpuraaw sustained worst damage of all towns on gulf coast with damage to vegetation buildings and infrastructure exceeding what had been expected significant vegetation damage was sustained throughout town with many trees being knocked over by strong winds including numerous large fig and mango trees several buildings were damaged by falling trees including local shop and a council building many other properties including houses only narrowly avoided damage from other falling trees houses community homes other government buildings local school and personal property such as corrugated iron sheds sustained damage from strong winds some vehicles were also damaged by wind and vegetation debris and local radio station s satellite dish was destroyed town s electricity network was largely destroyed with many power lines being toppled by strong winds and falling trees as a result all 230 properties in pormpuraaw lost power as well as local sewage treatment plant running water and conventional communications were also cut forcing residents to rely on bottled water radios and satellite phones many roads were blocked by flooding and large number of downed trees and power lines rendering movement around town hazardous thumb total rainfall accumulation in queensland during seven days leading up to 30 march 2018 alt 270x270px other towns in region also sustained damage mapoon situated about 265 km 165 mi north of where nora made landfall was first place to lose electricity during storm with 30 properties losing power in kowanyama three electrical feeders were shut down after sparking was reported causing 250 properties to lose power at least five houses in town sustained damage from strong winds as well as at least five pieces of infrastructure queensland health reported that medical clinics in pormpuraaw and kowanyama had both sustained damage however this was deemed to be only superficial in nature and they were able to reopen day after cyclone nora also produced a large amount of rainfall kowanyama airport recorded 128 2 mm 5 0 in of precipitation during 24 hours to 23 00 utc on 24 march heavy monsoonal rainfall earlier in month had already saturated local catchment areas and rivers were susceptible to rising from further rainfall many roads in pormpuraaw and kowanyama became flooded and damaged as well as roads between towns causing several communities to become isolated and inaccessible by land several roads in other parts of cape york peninsula and far north queensland were also affected by floodwaters such as near towns of coen lockhart river and croydon level of magnificent creek also rose to about 2 m 7 ft higher than normal from rainfall a storm surge of 1 2 m 3 9 ft was recorded at town of weipa on northern side of cyclone as well as large waves concerns were initially held for a boat that had ventured into northern gulf of carpentaria during cyclone however all passengers were accounted for after contact was made with captain some livestock also escaped their enclosures in kowanyama during storm including a bull and a horse highest 24 hour rainfall mm in port 023 downs 015 015 015 downs 014 014 213 812 012 011 are made at 9 00 a m local time after weakening to a tropical low nora became slow moving over south central far north queensland for about two days during this time tropical moisture from nora and an associated monsoon trough caused very heavy to extreme rainfall throughout region bom issued a flood watch for all areas from townsville to cape tribulation and a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall for large parts of region in parts of east coast and gulf of carpentaria coast of queensland 24 hour rainfall totals of 50 100 mm 2 0 3 9 in were widespread and many areas received seven day totals in excess of 400 mm 15 7 in most intense precipitation occurred at port douglas where 593 0 mm 23 3 in of rainfall was recorded in 24 hours to 23 00 utc on 25 march city of cairns also received very heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding cars were swept away by floodwaters undercover car parks were inundated and a shopping centre and hotel were flooded with ankle deep water torrential rainfall caused landslides and knocked down trees blocking captain cook highway north of city two cairns residents were nearly buried by a landslide while driving on highway to port douglas range road on kennedy highway located just northwest of cairns also had to be closed due to rockslides more than 40 people had to be rescued by qfes on night of 26 27 march after floodwaters threatened caravan parks where they were staying two people had to be rescued by state emergency service ses after getting into danger by driving into floodwaters in total ses responded to more than 100 calls for assistance from endangered residents including at least 85 in cairns and port douglas on 25 march at least 10 tonnes 22 000 lb of sand was distributed for use in sandbags to mitigate damage from approaching floodwaters agriculture industry in region also sustained damage from flooding caused by nora crops of banana and sugar cane were affected and fences dams and other farm infrastructure were damaged livestock losses were also sustained many farmers had already been affected by heavy rainfall and flooding in february and early march northern territory prior to developing into a tropical cyclone areas in northeastern arnhem land experienced thunderstorms and gusty winds airport on groote eylandt located off east coast of top end recorded wind gusts of up to 78 km h 48 mph on 22 march after strengthening into a category 1 tropical cyclone nora produced a short period of sustained gale force winds at cape wessel north of gove peninsula peaking with a gust of 83 km h 52 mph heavy rainfall also occurred with 224 4 mm 8 8 in of precipitation recorded at cape wessel and 159 9 mm 6 3 in in from 20 24 march aftermath due to flooding of many roads in and around pormpuraaw and kowanyama as well as number of trees and amount of vegetation strewn across roads communities became inaccessible by land qfes urged residents to be careful when venturing outside as large number of power lines that had been knocked down posed a risk to safety power was restored to properties in mapoon on afternoon of 25 march after a repair crew was flown into town ses crews first arrived in pormpuraaw on 26 march in order to assist with cleanup operation energy used five aircraft to airlift repair crews electrical generators equipment and all terrain vehicles from cairns to other towns that had suffered electricity cuts power was restored to sewage treatment plant in pormpuraaw by 26 march and to all of town s properties by 29 march after adverse weather had cleared local police officers in kowanyama rounded up livestock that had escaped their enclosures during cyclone including a bull and a horse additional police officers from cairns were deployed to worst affected far north queensland communities during two weeks following cyclone to assist residents with clean up efforts queensland premier minister for fire and emergency services craig crawford and local politician cynthia lui also visited townships on 28 march to assess damage and support local residents in their cleanup operation relief funding from queensland au us farmers and small loans250 000190 capital loans250 000190 0003 kowanyama and mapoon vouchers for 3004 vouchers for single hardship to assist in recovery effort queensland government provided funding to residents and farmers who had been directly impacted by event as well as to local councils in affected areas a total of more than au 200 000 us 150 000 was distributed to residents in pormpuraaw kowanyama and mapoon this money was able to be used for repairing essential household items such as refrigerators and washing machines as well to assist those who had encountered financial hardship as a result of cyclone to purchase food and clothing loans were also made available to owners of small businesses and farms that had been affected by flooding in several areas of far north queensland councils in a total of 14 local government areas were able to access disaster assistance money to repair damaged assets such as roads and to aid in clean up efforts such as removal of debris these areas included cairns carpentaria cook croydon douglas etheridge hinchinbrook and lockhart river in june 2018 queensland government announced that au 6 5 million us 5 0 million would be spent on improving emergency services in far north queensland following severe tropical cyclone nora of these funds au 2 5 million us 1 9 million was committed to upgrading qfes communications centre in cairns remaining au 4 0 million us 3 1 million would be provided for constructing and upgrading emergency services facilities in cape york peninsula communities of weipa and horn island in september 2018 kowanyama aboriginal shire council was given a grant of au 1 1 million us 840 000 to establish a new road and construction unit to fund economic growth and jobs in region and to improve area s disaster recovery capabilities see also tropical cyclone rebecca 1985 followed a very similar track to nora tropical cyclone sadie 1994 followed a very similar
