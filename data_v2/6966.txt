typhoon dinah known as typhoon luding in philippines was fourth typhoon to form during august 1987 an area of low pressure developed near guam on august 19 and two days later low reached tropical storm intensity as it moved generally west intensification was initially gradual with dinah becoming a typhoon early on august 24 before it subsequently intensified at a faster pace dinah reached its highest strength on august 26 before turning northward on august 28 and into a less favorable conditions aloft which prompted weakening dinah entered sea of japan after passing near okinawa on august 29 where dinah leveled off in intensity system then began to recurve towards southwestern japan and after tracking through area dinah transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on august 31 although remnants could be traced for four more days as it approached international date line across okinawa one person was killed and six more were injured eight homes were destroyed or seriously damaged and 13 boats sunk or were damaged damage exceeded 1 3 million 1987 usd on island of kyushu 250 homes were flooded and about 450 000 homeowners lost power throughout japan eight people perished damage totaled 604 million and 89 were wounded typhoon destroyed nearly 40 000 dwellings and an additional 600 were flooded in south korea 4 372 structures were destroyed leaving more than 11 000 people homeless nationwide typhoon was responsible for flooding of crops property damage was estimated at 39 1 million meteorological history origins of typhoon dinah can be traced back to a poorly organized area of disturbed weather that formed on august 18 close to guam and was embedded in monsoon trough at time situated near equator at 06 00 utc on august 19 joint typhoon warning center jtwc started tracking system as system started to show signs of organization shortly thereafter a low pressure area developed along axis of system prompting jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert and japan meteorological agency jma to start keeping an eye on low late on august 20 there was a rapid increase in coverage of thunderstorm activity and satellite intensity estimates via dvorak technique reached t2 0 based on this jtwc upgraded system into a tropical depression at 00 00 utc on august 21 shortly after upgrade depression began to turn west in response to a subtropical high to its north system then moved beneath an upper level high resulting in improved outflow and decreased wind shear following an increase in dvorak classifications jtwc classified depression as tropical storm dinah on evening of august 21 early following day jma also upped cyclone into a tropical storm however strong wind shear prevented intensification at climatological rate of one t number per day as storm passed roughly south of guam midday on august 23 jma declared dinah a severe tropical storm shortly after upgrade dinah began to enter an area of lower shear which accelerated intensification after turning west northwest and an increase in storm s dvorak intensity estimates both jtwc and jma upgraded dinah into a typhoon on morning of august 24 at time of upgrade dinah was located about west of guam despite a brief increase in shear dinah began to rapidly intensify over ensuing 24 hours at 06 00 utc on august 25 jtwc increased intensity of typhoon to equal to category 3 status on united states based saffir simpson hurricane wind scale early on august 26 jtwc estimated that dinah while continuing northwest at a steady clip obtained maximum sustained wind speed with making it a super typhoon even though data from jtwc suggested that dinah began to weaken almost immediately thereafter jma estimated that dinah reached its maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure of and respectively at noon on august 26 around this time philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa also monitored storm and assigned it with local name luding typhoon dinah s forward speed then began to slow as storm approached a weakness in ridge midday on august 28 dinah began to turn north as it rounded high this change in storm s direction led to storm encountering stronger wind shear from a series of shortwave troughs that passed north of storm which redistricted typhoon s outflow this shear resulted in weakening though jtwc estimated typhoon still had winds of as storm passed approximately west of kadena air base on afternoon of august 29 dinah then leveled off in intensity as storm entered sea of japan and on august 30 dinah began to recurve to north northeast that day typhoon passed northwest of sasebo naval base in western japan while transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by 00 00 utc on august 31 dinah began to merge with a frontal zone near polar jet stream several hours later jtwc stopped monitoring system as it completed its extratropical transition but jma continuing to track extratropical remnants of dinah until september 3 when it crossed international date line preparations and impact storm lashed okinawa prefecture with strong winds of and gusts of lowest sea level pressure observed on island was although offshore a ship measured a pressure of capital of okinawa naha recorded of rain including during one day both of these totals were highest reported across japan all ferry and airline service to japan from naha was halted throughout capital of okinawa 13 fishing boats were damaged and three houses were destroyed throughout okinawa six people were injured including one who required brief hospitalization from cuts as a result of flying glass police reported that eight houses were seriously damaged or destroyed one person was killed and damage exceeded 1 3 million offshore a ferry also sank and a vessel and another ferry went aground in all dinah was considered worst tropical cyclone to affect okinawa in 20 years along kyushu 250 homes were flooded and about 450 000 homeowners lost power off coast of kyushu a vessel went aground and 41 boats were sunk throughout southwestern japan storm surge resulted in extensive damage to seawalls and piers a landing craft from was destroyed when seawall eroded and pier collapsed damage to united states military bases in archipelago totaled 6 7 million nationwide 37 homes were destroyed with 611 others flooded a total of of crops was flooded and 79 ships were damaged due to dinah eight people perished and 89 others were hurt damage in japan amounted to 604 million although typhoon dinah did not directly strike south korea storm inundated much of country which was already affected by typhoon thelma six weeks earlier in south province a peak rainfall total of was measured storm forced closure of 2 312 schools six people were killed when a small buddhist temple collapsed due to heavy rains near taegu located southeast of seoul officials said offshore a fishing boat sunk near island located approximately east of seoul and left 32 fishermen missing though one crewman was successfully rescued nationwide 33 people were killed 52 were unaccounted for a total of 432 structures received flooded and 4 372 buildings were destroyed resulting in over 11 000 people homeless overall typhoon deluged of crops property damage was assessed at 39 1 million see also typhoon hal 1985 notes references category 1987 in japan
