ticket with president william henry harrison tyler ascended to presidency after harrison s death in april 1841 only a month after start of new administration he was a stalwart supporter and advocate of states rights and as president he adopted nationalist policies only when they did not infringe on powers of states his unexpected rise to presidency with resulting threat to presidential ambitions of henry clay and other politicians left him estranged from both major political parties tyler born to a prominent virginia family became a national figure at a time of political upheaval in 1820s nation s only political party democratic republicans split into factions he was initially a democrat but opposed andrew jackson during nullification crisis seeing jackson s actions as infringing upon states rights and criticized jackson s expansion of executive power during bank war this led tyler to ally with whig party tyler served as a virginia state legislator governor u s representative and u s senator he was put on 1840 presidential ticket to attract states rights southerners to a whig coalition to defeat martin van buren s re election bid with harrison s death after just one month in office tyler became first vice president to succeed to presidency without election he served longer than any president in u s history not elected to office to forestall constitutional uncertainty tyler immediately took oath of office moved into white house and assumed full presidential powers a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in twenty fifth amendment while tyler did sign into law some of whig controlled congress s bills as a strict constructionist he vetoed party s bills to create a national bank and raise tariff rates believing that president should set policy rather than congress he sought to bypass whig establishment most notably senator henry clay of kentucky most of tyler s cabinet resigned soon into his term and whigs dubbing him his accidency expelled him from party tyler was first president to see his veto of legislation overridden by congress although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy he had several foreign policy achievements including webster ashburton treaty with britain and treaty of wanghia with qing china republic of texas separated from mexico in 1836 tyler a firm believer in manifest destiny saw its annexation as providing an economic advantage to united states and worked diligently to make it happen he initially sought election to a full term as president but after failing to gain support of either whigs or democrats he withdrew in support of democrat james k polk who favored annexation polk won election and tyler signed a bill to annex texas three days before leaving office under polk process was completed when american civil war began in 1861 tyler sided with confederacy and won election to confederate house of representatives shortly before his death although some have praised tyler s political resolve his presidency is generally held in low regard by historians he is considered an obscure president with little presence in american cultural memory early life and legal career john

campaigning skills narrowly won him election he was sworn into fourteenth congress on december 17 1816 to serve as a democratic republican contemporaries generally called this republican party but modern political writers use democratic republican to distinguish it from modern day republican party major political party in era of good feelings chitwood pp 31 34 while democratic republicans had supported states rights in wake of war of 1812 many members urged a stronger central government a majority in congress wanted to see federal government help to fund internal improvements such as ports and roadways tyler held fast to his strict constructionist beliefs rejecting such proposals on both constitutional and personal grounds he believed each state should construct necessary projects within its borders using locally generated funds virginia was not in so poor a condition as to require a charitable donation from congress he contended he was chosen to participate in an audit of second bank of united states in 1818 as part of a five man committee and was appalled by corruption he perceived within bank he argued for revocation of bank charter although congress rejected any such proposal his first clash with general andrew jackson followed jackson s 1818 invasion of florida during first seminole war while praising jackson s character tyler condemned him as overzealous for execution of two british subjects tyler was elected for a full term without opposition in early 1819 chitwood pp 35 40 major issue of sixteenth congress 1819 21 was whether missouri should be admitted to union and whether slavery would be permitted in new state acknowledging ills of slavery he hoped that by letting it expand there would be fewer slaves in east as slave and master journeyed west making it feasible to consider abolishing institution in virginia thus slavery would be abolished through action of individual states as practice became rare as had been done in some northern states tyler believed that congress did not have power to regulate slavery and that admitting states based on whether they were slave or free was a recipe for sectional conflict seager p 69 therefore missouri compromise was enacted without tyler s support it admitted missouri as a slave state and maine as a free one and it also forbade slavery in states formed from northern part of territories throughout his time in congress he voted against bills which would restrict slavery in territories chitwood pp 47 50 crapol pp 37 38 tyler declined to seek renomination in late 1820 citing ill health

over impending presidential election of 1824 congressional nominating caucus an early system for choosing presidential candidates was still used despite its growing unpopularity tyler tried to convince lower house to endorse caucus system and choose william h crawford as democratic republican candidate crawford captured legislature s support but tyler s proposal was defeated his most enduring effort in this second legislative tenure was saving college of william and mary which risked closure from waning enrollment rather than move it from rural williamsburg to populous capital of richmond as some suggested tyler proposed that a series of administrative and financial reforms be enacted these were passed into law and were successful by 1840 school achieved its highest ever enrollment chitwood pp 60 62 thumb upright alt an engraving of tyler an engraving of tyler in his mid thirties as governor of virginia tyler s political fortunes were growing he was considered as a

tyler was elected 131 81 over john floyd office of governor was powerless under original virginia constitution 1776 1830 lacking even veto authority tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could do little to influence legislature his most visible act as governor was delivering funeral address for former president jefferson a virginian who had died on july 4 1826 at end of speech tyler briefly lauded president john adams of massachusetts who had died same day tyler was deeply devoted to jefferson and his eloquent eulogy was well received chitwood pp 64 67 crapol pp 39 40 tyler s governorship was otherwise uneventful he promoted states rights and adamantly opposed any concentration of federal power in order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals he suggested virginia actively expand its own road system a proposal was made to expand state s poorly funded public school system but no significant action was taken chitwood pp 67 69 tyler was re elected unanimously to a second one year term in december 1826 chitwood p 72 in 1829 tyler was elected as a delegate to virginia constitutional convention of 1829 1830 from senate district that included chief justice john marshall he was appointed to committee on legislature his service in various capacities at a state level included as president of virginia colonization society and as rector and chancellor of college of william and mary pulliam 1901 p 68 70 u s senate in january 1827 general assembly considered whether to elect u s senator john randolph for a full six year term randolph was a contentious figure although he shared staunch states rights views held by most of virginia legislature he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on senate floor which put his allies in an awkward position furthermore he had made enemies by fiercely opposing president john quincy adams and kentucky senator henry clay nationalists of democratic republican party who supported adams and clay were a sizable minority in virginia legislature they hoped to unseat randolph by capturing vote of states rights supporters who were uncomfortable with senator s reputation they approached tyler and promised their endorsement if he sought seat tyler repeatedly declined offer endorsing randolph as best candidate but political pressure continued to mount eventually he agreed to accept seat if chosen on day of vote one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between two candidates tyler was merely more agreeable than randolph incumbent s supporters though contended that tyler s election would be a tacit endorsement of adams administration legislature selected tyler in a vote of 115 110 and he resigned his governorship on march 4 1827 as his senate term began chitwood pp 73 81 democratic maverick by time of tyler s senatorial election 1828 campaign for president was in progress adams incumbent president was challenged by gen andrew jackson democratic republicans had splintered into adams national republicans and jackson s democrats tyler disliked both candidates for their willingness to increase power of federal government but he was increasingly drawn to jackson hoping that he would not seek to spend as much federal money on internal improvements as adams of jackson he wrote turning to him i may at least indulge in hope looking on adams i must despair chitwood pp 83 84 crapol p 41 when twentieth congress began in december 1827 tyler s name does not appear in senate voting records until late january of following year likely due to illness tyler served alongside his virginia colleague and friend littleton waller tazewell who shared his strict constructionist views and uneasy support of jackson throughout his tenure sen tyler vigorously opposed national infrastructure bills feeling these were matters for individual states to decide he and his southern colleagues unsuccessfully opposed protectionist tariff of 1828 known to its detractors as tariff of abominations tyler suggested that tariff s only positive outcome would be a national political backlash restoring a respect for states rights chitwood pp 86 88 tyler remained a strong supporter of states rights stating they may strike federal government out of existence by a word demolish constitution and scatter its fragments to winds kleber p 698 tyler was soon at odds with president jackson frustrated by jackson s newly emerging spoils system describing it as an electioneering weapon he voted against many of president s nominations when they appeared to be unconstitutional or motivated by patronage opposing nominations of a president of his own party was considered an act of insurgency against his party chitwood pp 86 87 99 106 tyler was particularly offended by jackson s use of recess appointment power to name three treaty commissioners to meet with emissaries from ottoman empire and introduced a bill chastising president for this crapol p 41 in some matters tyler was on good terms with jackson he defended jackson for vetoing maysville road funding project which jackson considered unconstitutional chitwood pp 99 100 crapol p 41 he voted to confirm several of president s appointments including jackson s future running mate martin van buren as united states minister to britain chitwood pp 105 06 leading issue in 1832 presidential election was recharter of second bank of united states which both tyler and jackson opposed congress voted to recharter bank in july 1832 and jackson vetoed bill for both constitutional and practical reasons tyler voted to sustain veto and endorsed president in his successful bid for re election chitwood pp 124 25 break with party tyler s uneasy relationship with his party came to a head during 22nd congress as nullification crisis of 1832 33 began south carolina threatening secession passed ordinance of nullification in november 1832 declaring tariff of abominations null and void within its borders this raised constitutional question of whether states could nullify federal laws president jackson who denied such a right prepared to sign a force bill allowing federal government to use military action to enforce tariff tyler who sympathized with south carolina s reasons for nullification rejected jackson s use of military force against a state and gave a speech in february 1833 outlining his views he supported clay s compromise tariff enacted that year to gradually reduce tariff over ten years alleviating tensions between states and federal government chitwood pp 112 20 in voting against force bill tyler knew he would permanently alienate pro jackson faction of virginia legislature even those who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point this jeopardized his re election in february 1833 in which he faced pro administration democrat james mcdowell however with clay s endorsement tyler was re elected by a margin of 12 votes chitwood pp 120 23 jackson further offended tyler by moving to dissolve bank by executive fiat in september 1833 jackson issued an executive order directing treasury secretary roger b taney to transfer federal funds from bank to state chartered banks without delay tyler saw this as a flagrant assumption of power a breach of contract and a threat to economy after months of agonizing he decided to join with jackson s opponents sitting on senate finance committee he voted for two censure resolutions against president in march 1834 chitwood pp 125 28 by this time tyler had become affiliated with clay s newly formed whig party which held control of senate on march 3 1835 with only hours remaining in congressional session whigs voted tyler president pro tempore of senate as a symbolic gesture of approval chitwood p 132 he is only u s president to have held this office shortly thereafter democrats took control of virginia house of delegates tyler was offered a judgeship in exchange for resigning his seat but he declined tyler understood what was to come he would soon be forced by legislature to cast a vote that went against his constitutional beliefs senator thomas hart benton of missouri had introduced a bill expunging censure of jackson by resolution of democratic controlled legislature tyler could be instructed to vote for bill if he disregarded instructions he would be violating his own principles first act of my political life was a censure on messrs giles and brent for opposition to instructions he noted chitwood p 138 over next few months he sought counsel of his friends who gave him conflicting advice by mid february he felt that his senate career was likely at an end he issued a letter of resignation to vice president van buren on february 29 1836 saying in part chitwood p 134 presidential election 1836 while tyler wished to attend to his private life and family he was soon occupied with presidential election of 1836 he had been suggested as a vice presidential candidate since early 1835 and same day virginia democrats issued expunging instruction virginia whigs nominated him as their candidate new whig party was not organized enough to hold a national convention and name a single ticket against van buren jackson s chosen successor instead whigs in various regions put forth their own preferred tickets reflecting party s tenuous coalition massachusetts whigs nominated daniel webster and francis granger anti masons of northern and border states backed william henry harrison and granger and states rights advocates of middle and lower south nominated hugh lawson white and john tyler in maryland whig ticket was harrison and tyler and in south carolina it was willie p mangum and tyler whigs wanted to deny van buren a majority in electoral college throwing election into house of representatives where deals could be made tyler hoped electors would be unable to elect a vice president and that he would be one of top two vote getters from whom senate under twelfth amendment must choose seager pp 119 21 following custom of times that candidates not appear to seek office tyler stayed home throughout campaign and made no speeches tyler received only 47 electoral votes from georgia south carolina and tennessee in november 1836 election trailing both granger and democratic candidate richard mentor johnson of kentucky harrison was leading whig candidate for president but he lost to van buren chitwood pp 147 51 presidential election was settled by electoral college but for only time in american history vice presidential election was decided by senate which selected johnson over granger on first ballot hatch p 189 national political figure tyler had been drawn into virginia politics even as a u s senator from october 1829 to january 1830 he served as a member of state constitutional convention a role which he had been reluctant to accept original virginia constitution gave outsize influence to state s more conservative eastern counties as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county regardless of population and only granted suffrage to property owners convention gave more populous and liberal counties of western virginia an opportunity to expand their influence tyler a slaveowner from eastern virginia supported existing system he largely remained on sidelines during debate however not wishing to alienate any of state s political factions he was focused on his senate career which required a broad base of support and gave speeches during convention promoting compromise and unity chitwood pp 88 98 after 1836 election tyler thought his political career was at an end and planned to return to private law practice in fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in williamsburg unable to remain away from politics tyler successfully sought election to house of delegates and took his seat in 1838 he was a national political figure by this point and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as sale of public lands chitwood pp 152 53 tyler s successor in senate was william cabell rives a conservative democrat in february 1839 general assembly considered who should fill that seat which was to expire following month rives had drifted away from his party signalling a possible alliance with whigs as tyler had already fully rejected democrats he expected whigs would support him still many whigs found rives a more politically expedient choice as they hoped to ally with conservative wing of democratic party in 1840 presidential election this strategy was supported by whig leader henry clay who nevertheless admired tyler at that time with vote split among three candidates including rives and tyler senate seat remained vacant for almost two years until january 1841 chitwood pp 157 63

factions head of whig ticket would likely be next president harrison clay and general winfield scott all sought nomination tyler attended convention and was with virginia delegation although he had no official status because of bitterness over unresolved senate election virginia delegation refused to make tyler its favorite son candidate for vice president tyler himself did nothing to aid his

balance convention deadlocked among three main candidates with virginia s votes going to clay many northern whigs opposed clay and some including pennsylvania s thaddeus stevens showed virginians a

abandon him in favor of harrison who gained presidential nomination seager pp 132 33 vice presidential nomination was considered immaterial no president had failed to complete his elected term not much attention was given to choice and specifics of how tyler came to gain it are unclear chitwood pointed out that tyler was a logical candidate as a southern slaveowner he balanced ticket and also assuaged fears of southerners who felt harrison might have abolitionist leanings tyler had been a vice presidential candidate in 1836 and having him on ticket might win virginia most populous state in

president johnson made a successful speaking tour tyler was called upon to travel from williamsburg to columbus ohio and there address a local convention in a speech intended to assure northerners that he shared harrison s views in his journey of nearly two months tyler made speeches at rallies he could not avoid questions and after being heckled into an admission that he supported compromise tariff many whigs did not resorted to quoting from harrison s vague speeches in his two hour speech at columbus tyler entirely avoided issue of bank of united states one of major questions of day

torchlight processions and alcohol fueled political rallies seager p 135 interest in campaign was unprecedented with many public events when democratic press depicted harrison as an old soldier who would turn aside from his campaign if given a barrel of hard cider to drink in his log cabin whigs eagerly seized on image and log cabin campaign was born fact that harrison lived on a palatial estate along ohio river and that tyler was well to do were ignored while log cabin images appeared everywhere from banners to whiskey bottles cider was favored beverage of many farmers and tradesmen and

unprecedented event that caused considerable uncertainty regarding presidential succession article ii section 1 clause 6 of united states constitution which governed intra term presidential succession at time now superseded by twenty fifth amendment states that interpreting this constitutional prescription led to question of whether actual office of president devolved upon vice president tyler or merely its powers and duties cabinet met within an hour of harrison s death and according to a later account determined that tyler would be vice president acting president dinnerstein p 447 however tyler firmly and decisively asserted that constitution gave him full and unqualified powers of office and had himself sworn in immediately as president setting a critical precedent for an orderly transfer of power following a president s death presidential oath was administered by judge william cranch in tyler s hotel room he considered oath redundant to his oath as vice president but wished to quell any doubt over his accession chitwood pp 202 03 when he took office tyler at 51 became youngest president to that point fearing that he would alienate harrison s supporters tyler decided to keep dead president s entire cabinet even though several members were openly hostile to him and resented his assumption of office at his first cabinet meeting webster informed him of harrison s practice of making policy by a majority vote this was a dubious assertion since harrison had held few cabinet meetings and had baldly asserted his authority over cabinet in at least one cabinet fully expected new president to continue this practice tyler was astounded and immediately corrected them tyler delivered an inaugural address before congress on april 9 in which he reasserted his belief in fundamental tenets of jeffersonian democracy and limited federal power tyler s claim to be president was not immediately accepted by opposition members of congress such as john quincy adams who felt that tyler should be a caretaker under title of acting president or remain vice president in name chitwood pp 203 07 among those who questioned tyler s authority was clay who had planned to be real

from his conviction that he was rightful president when his political opponents sent correspondence to white house addressed to vice president or acting president tyler had it returned unopened crapol p 10 economic policy and party conflicts harrison had been expected to adhere to whig party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders particularly clay when tyler succeeded him he initially concurred with new whig congress signing into law preemption bill granting squatters sovereignty to settlers on public land a distribution act discussed below a new bankruptcy law and repeal of independent treasury but when it came to great banking question tyler was soon at odds with congressional whigs and twice vetoed clay s legislation for a national banking act although second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in first veto its final version did not this practice designed to protect clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for whig nomination in 1844 became known as heading captain tyler a term coined by whig representative john minor botts of virginia tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as exchequer but clay s friends who

recognized need for higher tariffs but wished to stay within 20 percent rate created by 1833 compromise tariff he also supported a plan to distribute to states any revenue from sales of public land as an emergency measure to manage states growing debt even though this would cut federal revenue whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise distribution act of 1841 created a distribution program with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low

industries but south had no industrial base and depended on open access to british markets for their cotton in a recommendation to congress tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override

franchise to let most men vote tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in rhode island he would employ force to aid regular or charter government he made it clear that federal assistance would be given only to put down an insurrection once underway and would not be available until violence had taken place after listening to reports from his confidential agents tyler

soon after becoming president texas had declared independence from mexico in texas revolution of 1836 although mexico still refused to acknowledge its sovereignty people of texas actively pursued joining union but jackson and van buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another southern state though tyler intended annexation to be focal point of his administration secretary webster was opposed and convinced tyler to concentrate on pacific initiatives until later in his term crapol pp 176 78 tyler s desire for western expansionism is acknowledged by historians and scholars but views differ regarding motivations behind it biographer edward c crapol notes that during presidency of james monroe tyler then in house of representatives had suggested slavery was a dark cloud hovering over union and that it would be well to disperse this cloud so that with fewer blacks in older slave states a process of gradual emancipation would begin in virginia and other upper southern states crapol 2006 p 5 tyler s solution was a further expansion of slavery and admission of missouri as a slave state he saw territorial expansion as a way to thin out and diffuse slave population historian william w freehling however wrote that tyler s official motivation in annexing texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by great britain to promote an emancipation of slaves in

ready to pursue texas now lacking a party base he saw annexation of republic as his only pathway to independent re election in 1844 for first time in his career he was willing to play political hardball to see it through as a trial balloon he dispatched his ally thomas walker gilmer then a u s representative from virginia to publish a letter defending annexation which was well received despite his successful relationship with webster tyler knew he would need a secretary of state who supported texas initiative with work on british treaty now completed he forced webster s resignation and installed hugh s legare of south carolina as an interim successor crapol pp 180 83 186 with help of newly appointed treasury secretary john c spencer tyler cleared out an array of officeholders replacing them with pro annexation partisans in a reversal of his former stand against patronage he elicited help of political organizer michael walsh to build a political machine in new york in

tyler and upshur began quiet negotiations with texas government promising military protection from mexico in exchange for a commitment to annexation secrecy was necessary as constitution required

calhoun was a leading advocate of slavery and his attempts to get an annexation treaty passed were resisted by abolitionists as a result when text of treaty was leaked to public it met political opposition from whigs who opposed anything that might enhance tyler s status as well as from foes of slavery and those who feared a confrontation with mexico which had announced that it would view annexation as a hostile act by united states both clay and van buren respective frontrunners for whig and democratic nominations decided in a private meeting at van buren s home to come out against

attempted a return to his old democratic party but its members especially followers of van buren were not ready to accept him he knew that with little chance of election only way to salvage his presidential legacy was to move public opinion in favor of texas issue he formed a third party democratic republicans using officeholders and political networks he had built over previous year multiple supportive newspapers across country issued editorials promoting his candidacy throughout early months of 1844 reports of meetings held throughout country suggest that support for president was not limited to officeholders as is widely assumed just as democratic party was holding its presidential nomination in baltimore maryland tyler supporters in that very city were holding signs

necessary super majority of democratic votes and slowly fell in rankings it was not until ninth ballot that democrats turned their sights to james k polk a less prominent candidate who supported annexation they found him to be perfectly suited for their platform and he was nominated with two thirds of vote tyler considered his work vindicated and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election annexation achieved tyler was unfazed when whig controlled senate rejected his treaty by a vote of 16 35 in june 1844 he felt that annexation was now within reach by joint resolution rather than by treaty and made that request to congress former president andrew jackson a staunch supporter of annexation persuaded polk to welcome tyler back into democratic party and ordered democratic editors to cease their attacks on him satisfied by these developments tyler dropped out of race in august and endorsed polk for presidency polk s narrow victory
