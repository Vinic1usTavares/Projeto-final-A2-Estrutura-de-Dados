1872 north cascades earthquake occurred at in central washington state a maximum mercalli intensity of viii severe was assessed for several locations though less intense shaking was observed at many other locations in washington oregon and british columbia some of these intermediate outlying areas reported v moderate to vii very strong shaking but intensities as high as iv light were reported as far distant as idaho and montana due to remote location of mainshock and a series of strong aftershocks damage to man made structures was limited to a few cabins close to areas of highest intensity because earthquake occurred before seismometers were operating in region magnitude of shock and its location were never precisely determined but intensity reports that are available for event were studied and various epicenters for event were proposed based on these limited data one study presented an estimated of 6 5 7 0 with a proposed location on east side of cascade range near lake chelan results of a separate study indicated that it may have been a larger event placing shock in north cascades just south of canada united states border at ross lake preface cascadia subduction zone rarely influences western portion of washington state but november 1873 m7 3 shock near california oregon border may have been associated with it although activity in pacific northwest especially west of cascades in washington has occasionally been located near subduction zone earthquakes there 1949 olympia 1965 puget sound 2001 nisqually have mostly been intraslab events a large m7 earthquake on seattle fault in 900 c e may have generated a tsunami in puget sound 1872 event east of cascades is not understood well due to lack of instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports earthquake thumb left isoseismal map for event as there were only six seismometers operating in washington state and western british columbia even as late as 1969 there are insufficient instrumental records for older events in region focal depths are unknown for shocks that occurred before that time but seismologists bakun et al concluded that event occurred on a shallow fault on east side of cascade range they employed a method that was developed by w h bakun and c m wentworth for using earthquake intensity information that could be mapped to a corresponding moment magnitude intensities for twelve 20th century pacific northwest earthquakes were used for calibration before analyzing known intensities for 1872 event in an attempt to resolve location and magnitude reports were interpreted in a way that placed epicenter near south end of lake chelan but other considerations left other plausible focal points both north and northeast of lake magnitude was estimated to be 6 5 7 0 with 95 confidence using a similar strategy s d malone and s bor analyzed known intensities for 1872 shock then compared intensity patterns for a number of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in pacific northwest a factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps epicenter is usually close to center of pattern but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be had only intensity information and no instrumental information been available an isoseismal map of 1949 olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified seismic waves and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter malone and bor ran three simulations with a projected m7 4 event occurring at a depth of but took into consideration differences in attenuation both east and west of cascades three exploratory locations were investigated including setting at south end of lake chelan that reportedly had significant ground disturbances their preferred location near ross lake and a third location north of canada united states border that had been proposed much earlier by w g milne ross lake site was chosen because it most closely matched their isoseismal pattern but it was not strongly preferred over milne site and lake chelan location was excluded as being epicenter due to regional attenuation characteristics that required a location further to west several depths were investigated but each had little impact on isoseismal patterns below intensity vi and since most northwest earthquakes occur between deep they believe shock was also near that depth but did not dismiss possibility that it was a shallower event more recently sherrod using lidar identified a fault scarp in spencer canyon subsequent field work determined that this fault scarp most likely is ground rupture for 1872

over a very wide area from pacific ocean to montana and british columbia to oregon area that was most affected was largely unpopulated and very few homes existed a log building that was built on unconsolidated river sediment close to mouth of wenatchee river had dislodged roof logs and kitchen became detached from rest of structure another log cabin between entiat and also had roof damage mercalli intensities as high as vi strong reached western portion of state near highly populated puget sound region and to southeast beyond where hanford nuclear reactor site later stood aftershocks a relationship exists between depth of mainshock and occurrence of aftershocks and several pacific northwest earthquakes illustrate this link like february 1981 m5 5 elk lake event in southwest washington that was followed by more than 1 000 in first two years m7 3 1959 hebgen lake earthquake in montana had a significant sequence of aftershocks and shallow m7 1983 borah peak event was followed by four aftershocks in opposition intraslab events and crustal shocks above subduction zone on west side of cascades have had insignificant aftershock sequences usually amounting to a minimal number of small aftershocks for example 2001 nisqually shock occurred nearly deep and was followed by only four small aftershocks and there was a similar procession for 1946 vancouver island earthquake a m7 6 crustal shock that also had a focal depth near aftershocks did follow 1872 event and during initial 24 hours they were strong enough to be felt over a broad area from idaho and into southern british columbia intensity of shocks waned as time passed and after a year they were still occurring but were only being felt at wenatchee lake chelan and entiat bakun et al listed considerable aftershock sequence as a strong indication that initial event was shallow entiat area remained seismically active well into 20th century leading to speculation that earthquakes were long
