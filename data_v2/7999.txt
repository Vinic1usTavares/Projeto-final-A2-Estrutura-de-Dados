lascar is a stratovolcano within central volcanic zone of andes a volcanic arc that spans countries of peru bolivia argentina and chile it is most active volcano in region with records of eruptions going back to 1848 it is composed of two separate cones with several summit craters westernmost crater of eastern cone is presently active volcanic activity is characterized by constant release of volcanic gas and occasional vulcanian eruptions lascar has been active since at least 56 000 years ago though some argue for activity beginning 220 000 years ago first known activity occurred at eastern cone and was characterized by lava flows before shifting to western cone where lava domes were emplaced an eruption event known as piedras grandes was followed by large soncor eruption a new western edifice was constructed on top of soncor vent during holocene activity then shifted again to eastern edifice and continues there to this day magma supplied to volcano ultimately comes from subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate a number of other volcanoes are found in region such as aguas calientes cordon de puntas negras and giant la pacana caldera volcano experienced at least three major eruptions throughout its history one is soncor eruption about 26 450 500 years ago another in 7 250 bce and third in 1993 first of these eruptions released of material and is known as soncor eruption largest eruption of lascar known to recorded history occurred in april 1993 and caused ash fall as far away as buenos aires because lascar is located in a remote area it is monitored primarily by remote sensing explosive eruptions are greatest hazard at lascar lascar like el tatio is a destination for volcano tourism etymology name originates from word laskar or thought to refer to shape of volcano other names for volcano are hlascar hlascar kar las laskar and toconao geography and geological context regional setting volcanoes in andes occur in four separate regions northern volcanic zone between 2degn and 5degs central volcanic zone between and southern volcanic zone between and and austral volcanic zone south of southern volcanic zone these volcanic zones are separated by areas where recent volcanism is absent one common theory is that subduction processes responsible for volcanism form a subducting plate that is too shallow to trigger formation of magma this shallow subduction appears to be triggered by nazca ridge and juan fernandez ridge areas where they subduct beneath peru chile trench coincide with limits of central volcanic zone it is possible that when these ridges are subducted buoyancy they carry disrupts subduction process and reduces supply of water which is important for formation of melts of these volcanic zones central volcanic zone of which lascar is a member of is largest covering parts of peru bolivia argentina and chile central volcanic zone is located between two areas where subduction is shallower and volcanic activity is absent in central volcanic zone volcanism has been active for 120 million years although it has undergone eastward migration during this time water released from subducting plate triggers formation of basaltic magmas that are then injected into crust about 122 volcanoes with holocene eruptions exist in andean volcanic belt including ojos del salado which with a height of is highest volcano in world many of these volcanoes are covered by snow and ice a number of supervolcanoes exist in central volcanic zone they are part of altiplano puna volcanic complex local setting volcanism of lascar relates to subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate central andes contain many hundreds of volcanoes extending over countries of argentina bolivia chile and peru in this remote territory where eruptions are poorly recorded many volcanoes are higher than they are constructed on a crust that is between thick volcanic centres include calderas and associated large ignimbrites lava domes and stratovolcanoes among better researched volcanoes are galan nevados de ollague purico complex san pedro san pablo la pacana tata and tumisa over 44 volcanoes in region are considered potentially active with a number of young volcanoes featuring fumarolic or hydrothermal activity guallatiri for example features fumarolic activity that is visible in satellite images also fumarolically active are sabancaya el misti ubinas tacora isluga irruputuncu olca ollague san pedro putana and lastarria largest historical eruption occurred at huaynaputina in 1600 given low population density around many of these volcanoes there is often little information on their activity lascar is located in antofagasta region of chile and is or high according to different sources with a surface area of volcano has a volume of geographically area of lascar is located between altiplano and salar de atacama farther west terrain at lascar dips in direction of salar new town of talabre is west of lascar it had a population of 50 inhabitants and farming were principal economic activities in talabre chile route 23 passes about west of lascar unlike neighbouring volcanoes acamarachi licancabur and there is no evidence of archeological sites on lascar possibly because of volcanic activity however inhabitants of town of consider lascar a protective mountain spirit and in argentina it is believed that snow will fall if lascar is steaming strongly lascar is located in main volcanic arc on western margin of altiplano andesitic dacitic aguas calientes is located east of lascar it may have formed a lava flow close to summit during holocene aguas calientes is older than lascar and it might share a magma chamber miocene quaternary volcanic centres in neighbourhood include cerro negro in north acamarachi northeast tumisa southwest and cordon de puntas negras in south which lascar is sometimes considered to be part of tumisa to south of lascar was active between 2 5 and 0 4 million years ago is composed of dacite and surrounded by pyroclastic flow deposits east of lascar lies la pacana caldera cerro west of lascar is a hill formed by permian triassic granite an area of increased electrical conductivity has been identified beneath lascar and extends to some neighbouring volcanoes reaching a depth of over south of lascar quebrada de chaile quebrada de soncor and quebrada de talabre canyons run towards salar de atacama they are deep and wide these valleys were probably formed by erosion during glacial periods valleys drain western northern and southwestern slopes of lascar southeastern slopes drain into laguna lejia which is close to volcano and northwestern slope drains through quebrada de morro blanco lascar is located atop of a ridge formed by cerro corona and cerro de saltar lava domes south and north of lascar respectively cerro corona gets its name from a crown shaped structure at its top these domes cover a surface area of about these lava domes are about 5 million years old and are composed of dacite and smaller amounts of pyroxene andesite along with rhyolite and visible minerals including biotite and hornblende an eruption 16 700 years ago from corona deposited tephra containing biotite and quartz in laguna lejia and generated a rhyodacitic lava flow another debris flow from corona spread towards salar de atacama geology lascar is formed by two irregularly shaped truncated cones that extend east west on a trend that includes aguas calientes six craters are located on volcano but sometimes only five craters are counted in which case central crater is considered to be active one extinct western cone also known as is composed of layers of lava and pyroclastics its large crater is filled by another cone which forms highest summit of lascar volcano immediately east of it lies eastern cone which is contiguous with western cone eastern cone also known as is capped off with three distinct craters which are delimited by arcuate fractures measurements made from 1961 to 1997 determined that eastern crater is wide and deep and thus largest central crater is wide and deep and western crater is wide and deep increasing to depth in 2005 2006 craters show evidence that activity has migrated westward westernmost of these three eastern craters is currently active one surrounded by rims that reach heights of in 1985 a hot spot in this crater was observed in satellite images in centre of westernmost crater lies a smaller crater deep and wide there are many fumaroles along rim of inner crater layers of lava and pyroclastics are discernible in craters these craters are not collapsed calderas and there is no evidence of deposits a large explosion would produce remnants of a previous edifice are visible in craters this older edifice constitutes bulk of eastern cone there are traces of a collapse of volcano towards northeast with an associated horseshoe shaped scar large lava flows are noticeable on flanks of volcano with a total of eight lava flows recognized they extend from summit craters although none of them appear to be associated with currently active crater flows from first stage of lascar s activity are exposed at its western foot while lava flows are buried beneath pyroclastic material on eastern flank a lava flow on northern flank reaches almost to village of talabre this lava flow is known as tumbres talabre lava flow its margins are high and it features a central channel flow advanced just north of head of quebrada talabre before passing over cliffs and entering it another lava flow on southwest flank is known as capricorn lava this dacitic lava was erupted on lascar at high altitude and has a blocky surface it features well developed levees and a flow front its rocks have a pale gray blue colour and their composition resembles soncor flow despite more mafic lavas and pyroclastics being erupted in time period between emplacement of soncor flow and capricorn lava an early pyroclastic flow saltar flow is exposed on eastern flank it was emplaced after collapse of oldest edifice covering aguas calientes western slopes flow deposit was later modified by glacial activity soncor flow is found primarily on western side of lascar with part of it also southeast of lascar on western slope it buries even older piedras grandes flow which crops out only at margins of soncor flow while piedras grandes flow was formed by a glacier run that transported blocks with sizes of up to soncor was formed by a large eruption large eruption gave rise to a pyroclastic flow that extended westward and contained breccia and various magmas it was accompanied by a plinian fall deposit finally andesitic pumice tumbres flow is found on northwest west southwestern slopes of lascar quebrada talabre cuts into upper flanks of lascar and eventually joins quebrada soncor lahar deposits are found in adjacent valleys suggesting that wetter periods had occurred during lascar s activity quebrada talabre was scoured by pyroclastic flows during 1993 eruption exposing bedrock and tertiary ignimbrites traces of glacial action are found on older parts of lascar at altitudes above and include meltwater gorges striated rock surfaces and u shaped valleys moraines are found at tumisa down to an altitude of volcano sits above a major local geological trend north south miscanti line other volcanic centres are also located on this line including corona and saltar lava domes and miscanti and lejia volcanoes miscanti line dissects quaternary basement beneath lascar and it may be a hinge of a fold that is being propagated by faults formation of first cone at lascar may have been facilitated by intersection between miscanti line and another east west lineament formed by pliocene pleistocene tectonic compression of region and lineament would have worked as an ascent path for magma at least four alignments of volcanoes are recognized in region composition lascar rocks consist of andesite and dacite these rocks have a composition mainly characterized as two pyroxene but old piedras grandes and soncor rocks contain hornblende other minerals include anhydrite augite plagioclase apatite ilmenite magnetite olivine orthopyroxene quartz rhyolite in groundmass and spinel in inclusions dacite has more plagioclase and rhyolite additional component minerals found at lascar include anorthite augite bordering on diopside fassaite forsterite hypersthene and more rocks of lascar belong to calc alkaline series concentrations range from 55 5 to 67 8 by weight and rocks have medium to large concentrations of potassium magmas are contaminated by local crust but not to extent found in galan or purico complex eruption products chemistry of lascar s rocks is fairly similar to those of neighbouring tumisa volcano magma erupted by lascar appears to form from mixing of mafic and more evolved magmas 1993 eruption deposits contain bands of different rocks specifically basaltic andesite magma is periodically injected into a magma chamber where crystal fractionation and mixing processes take place process happens frequently thus magmas are relatively presumably if supply of mafic magma is steady products are andesitic otherwise dacite forms this origin of lascar magmas is reflected in textures of rocks overall magma supply rate of lascar is magma chamber of lascar appears to lie at depths of although lack of deformation of edifice during 1993 eruption indicates that it may be deeper over or even over deep there appear to be two distinct chamber systems an andesitic one that is responsible for frequent andesite lava and pyroclastic flow activity and a dacitic one that was involved in piedras grandes and soncor activities temperatures of magma chamber range from mafic magmas that are injected in chamber are about hotter than extant andesite and dacite chamber may be surrounded by alteration this alteration gives rise to wollastonite and pyroxene containing skarn depending on distance from magma chamber walls metasomatism does further affect rocks derived from magma chamber walls conditions at magma chamber may be comparable to these under which epithermal mineral deposits form oxidation conditions in magma chamber are favourable for formation of sulfate but unfavourable for deposition of sulfide minerals a number of xenoliths occur in lascar s rocks a large amount of phenocrysts are ultimately derived from them hornfels skarn and rocks that are part of lascar s lava dome ridge are source of these xenoliths minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite anhydrite anorthite apatite biotite calcite diopside fassaite garnet gypsum ilmenite magnetite monazite orthopyroxene perovskite plagioclase prehnite quartz wollastonite and zircon a number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma of lascar and of other volcanoes such as tumisa gas emissions lascar emits plumes of gas and white clouds of condensed water vapor mostly over many hundreds of fumarolic vents which are chiefly located in active crater in december 2002 two fumaroles had temperatures exceeding total flux is estimated to be and occurs even between eruptions there are high temperature fumaroles temperatures equal to or exceeding and low temperature fumaroles temperatures of less than with noticeable chemical differences between two latter tend to emit far more water than carbon dioxide fumaroles also release carbon monoxide hydrogen hydrogen chloride hydrogen sulfide and smaller amounts of helium hydrocarbons and other organic compounds are also found in low temperature fumaroles trace elements include arsenic boron and titanium with smaller amounts of barium chromium copper lead strontium and zinc release rates of amounted to in 1989 and in 2003 overall sulfur output ranges between this corresponds to about 1 of global volcanic sulfur emissions and is comparable to kilauea and lascar was a substantial source of sulfur dioxide for atmosphere around 30deg south reaching a proportion of 20 40 sulfur over south america and still 10 20 over south indian ocean in 2005 lascar was third largest source of volcanic sulfur dioxide in world among continuously active volcanoes behind etna in italy and in papua new guinea since 2014 however peruvian volcanoes sabancaya and ubinas have become largest source of tropospheric sulfur dioxide from central volcanic zone there are temporal variations in output after a decrease in 2009 sulfur output increased in 2012 probably as a consequence of arrival of new magma at depth there is no clear association between periods of degassing and eruptions sulfur is released from areas all over cone resulting in a noticeable sulfur smell hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride are also released in large amounts with estimates made in 2003 2004 indicating a mass flux of and respectively they correspond to about 2 and 5 respectively of global volcanic flux of these compounds finally lascar is vigorous producer of sulfate dust particles which are released at a rate of about 100 000 trillion particles per second emission of other elements element output antimony arsenic bismuth boron cadmium chromium copper indium lead selenium tellurium thallium tin zinc gases are partly supplied from shallow magma volume of magma erupted is too small to contain all exhalations release of gas by magma is favoured by strong temperature contrasts between incoming magma and magma chamber and processes occurring during mixing may explain high emission of sulfur dioxide by lascar presence of argon and nitrogen in low temperature fumaroles indicates that air is involved in their formation although a portion of each of these two gases is non atmospheric sulfur and chlorine may be derived from crust evaporites such as these found at salar de atacama subducted lithosphere or mantle carbon in gases may come from skarn assimilation sulfur isotope data support notion that evaporite deposits contribute part of lascar s sulfur water appears to be in part magmatic and in part precipitation derived high concentrations of halogens are typical for subduction associated volcanoes halogens are supplied to volcanoes through subduction induced processes that act on crust and subducting plate heat output of lascar is about during regular activity but has been estimated to be as high as electrical conductivity data suggest that a hydrothermal system exists beneath lascar but existence of such a system has been questioned basement lascar rests atop atana ignimbrite a rhyodacitic sheet which was erupted by la pacana caldera 4 5 3 7 million years ago pampa and ignimbrites are somewhat younger 2 6 2 2 million and less than 1 million years respectively these ignimbrites form a 3deg steep slope in area other basement rocks are sandstone containing marine devonian carboniferous lila formation red orange permian cas formation containing volcanic rocks and granites as well as volcanic permian triassic peine formation and cerro negro strata which also contain intruded rocks and lake sediments these formations are not visible in lascar area but they crop out close to salar de atacama tertiary sediment and volcanic rocks can also be found presence of mesozoic limestone is indicated by xenoliths in lascar s lavas only place they crop out farther east is in argentina this limestone formation has been identified as formation later deposits include cenozoic sedimentary strata landforms over this basement include ignimbrites lava domes and stratovolcanoes exposures of basement are often delimited by faults climate and biota 300px thumb right lascar and vegetation area around lascar is one of driest and highest volcanic settings in world precipitation at lascar is about and consists mostly of snow persistent snow cover exists on western and southern slopes of volcano it contributes partly to fumarole water in 1993 yearly precipitation at several towns around lascar ranged from lascar is located close to atacama desert one of world s driest deserts during glacial periods volcano most likely featured small glaciers equilibrium line at lascar was at an altitude of during last glacial maximum traces of glaciation also exist at de saltar end of glaciation may have accompanied an increase in volcanic activity a phenomenon that has been noted at other volcanoes 8 500 years ago climate in region became much drier and amount of erosion decreased substantially temperatures in surrounding region range between measurements made on southwest rim of main crater in 2009 2012 indicated air temperatures of present day snowline in region lies at an altitude of higher than summit of lascar due to dry climate there is little vegetation at lascar bunch grass and shrubs grow on volcano s slopes in deep valleys groundwater and streams support more plants volcanic activity at lascar affects neighbouring ecosystems such as aguas calientes crater lake and laguna lejia flamingos disappeared from latter after 1993 eruption and did not return until 2007 other reports claim that flamingos remained other animals like donkeys and llamas were seen around volcano one day after its eruption eruptive history lascar is most active volcano in andean central volcanic zone and a steady pattern of eruptive activity has persisted for centuries volcano persistently features a tall plume of water and sulfur dioxide most present day activity consists of release of fumarolic gas with additional vulcanian activity that generates eruption columns several kilometres high typically every three or two years as well as active deformation of three active craters observed in interferometric synthetic aperture radar long term magma supply rate of lascar is about early activity oldest volcanic activity at lascar occurred between 220 000 and less than 50 000 years ago activity has alternated between eastern and western part of volcano during its history eastern edifice formed first stage i erupting andesite containing pyroxene and eventually forming chaile and saltar pyroclastic flows oldest mafic andesites are less than 43 000 years old while chaile and saltar pyroclastic flows erupted over 26 500 years ago an alternative dating scheme considers chaile to be 47 000 16 000 years old and saltar 167 000 9 000 years old lava flows less than thick issued from stage i cone and reached lengths of they occur beneath altitudes of their vents buried by later activity lavas from stage i are mostly exposed north and west of lascar chaile flows are actually formed by two separate units and are found on southwest flanks of volcano up to a distance of they reach thicknesses of in upper unit and in lower one saltar flow reached widths of and thicknesses of increasing to where flow entered valleys at least nine units form saltar deposit with northern flows displaying flow welding these deposits have volumes of and probably formed when an explosive eruption took place in a lava lake after end of stage i a period of glacial erosion occurred prior to new activity which created furrows in saltar flow imprecise argon argon dating on younger andesites has yielded dates of 14 000 18 000 and 17 000 22 000 years later volcanic activity buried this edifice beneath thin pyroclastic flows western edifice generated a complex of lava domes stage ii which was probably surrounded by a horseshoe shaped crater open to west possibly magma chamber of stage i had almost solidified when injection of basaltic magma at depths of over triggered a remelting andesite rhyodacite intrusions occurred beneath volcano some of which were still hot when soncor eruption tore them out of ground an ice cap formed over lascar at that time feeding two glaciers that extended northeast and southeast away from volcano piedras grandes unit stage ii activity was accompanied by eruption of block and ash flows consisting of andesite and an eruption whose deposits include blocks with sizes of this unit formed during stage ii is known as piedras grandes and is exposed on western slopes below about altitude unit is about wide and consists of large blocks encased in ash composition of piedras grandes unit is andesite containing amphibole basaltic andesite and hornblende piedras grandes unit is over 26 500 years old possibly between 63 000 and 100 000 years old temperatures have been estimated to be for andesite and for basaltic andesite magmas were formed from a remelted proto pluton that had been heated and resupplied with volatiles by mafic magmas lava domes interacted with glaciers resulting in formation of a glacier run whose deposits are found as far as from volcano blocks with sizes of up to were transported by this flow an alternative theory posits that piedras grandes unit formed when an ice cap on lascar interacted with a block and ash flow erupted by aguas calientes soncor eruption a major plinian eruption occurred 26 450 500 years ago releasing of ejecta both volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows deposits left contain both andesite and dacite with phenocrysts consisting of apatite augite biotite iron titanium oxides orthopyroxene and plagioclase in a rhyolite matrix plinian deposit has a colour ranging from white to creamy like piedras grandes rocks they tend towards high potassium quantities and resemble other volcanic rocks of lascar and central andes in composition deposits are formed by a plinian fallout deposit and an ignimbrite rich in lithics this plinian deposit reaches thicknesses of and fell from a eruption column soncor ignimbrite extended as much as west from volcano north and south it is white heterogeneous and mostly featureless with only weak sorting but features a noticeable compositional zonation ignimbrite features three facies one rich in breccia another rich in pumice and a normal ignimbrite ignimbrite was channeled to salar de atacama by quebrada de chaile quebrada de soncor and quebrada de talabre canyons and some smaller valleys northeastwards by quebrada de morro blanco and as far as southeastwards over pampa leija area in these valleys ignimbrite can be as much as thick pumices are encased in ignimbrite as lenses and levees and are also found in terrain above canyons estimated temperatures decreased from at vent to farther down flows at time of emplacement ignimbrite was still magma temperatures have been estimated at soncor fallout deposit contains a basal gravelly layer and several layers of andesitic and dacitic pumice which also contain lithics total volume of soncor eruption products has been estimated to be either dense rock equivalent or net volume both minimum estimates lithic rocks derived both from pre soncor volcano and basement are also represented magma erupted was generated in a magma chamber starting from andesite which underwent complex processes this magma chamber was located at a floor depth of older estimate and probably had a complex shape given certain chemical properties of soncor rocks at time preceding eruption magma chamber had a thermal stratification injections of mafic magmas had heated magma chamber and induced convection a volatile phase containing chlorine formed inside magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from magma this sulfur extraction was facilitated by high oxygen content of magma which allowed formation of sulfur dioxide water is a principal volatile involved in processes of plinian eruptions water content of soncor and piedras grandes magmas was about 4 5 soncor magmas were associated with a volatile phase that underwent extensive interaction with future eruption products previous volcanic edifice was destroyed by this eruption which may have formed a caldera vent was no wider than as it is completely hidden beneath western cone such a vent or caldera is substantially smaller than volume of rocks erupted a discrepancy that is also evident in 1932 eruption of quizapu soncor magma chamber may have been too deep to collapse when it was emptied explaining why no significant caldera was formed soncor deposit was subsequently affected by glaciation and stage i edifice by a debris avalanche which was radiocarbon dated at 22 310 2 700 2000 years ago in quebrada de chaile this debris avalanche is thick and long capricorn lava overlies soncor deposits post soncor activity later a new stratovolcano grew over soncor vent this volcano was formed by andesite dacite lava flows stage iii and scoria lava flows from this stage have thicknesses of and lengths reaching it has a volume of growth of this volcano was preceded by a period of erosion between 20 800 20 100 and 12 500 years ago coincident with lake minchin humid period glaciers in region reached their maximum size at that time deposits left by this erosional period contain no clear evidence of stage iii activity indeed lascar was probably inactive between 14 000 and 10 500 years ago however an eruption of cerro corona lava dome occurred during this period and activity of stage iii did not commence earlier than 22 300 years ago tumbres eruption occurred around 7250 bce commencing with eruption of pumice falls that reach thicknesses of less than afterwards up to four different units of pyroclastic flows each thick formed deposits up to long at end of eruption a caldera and two western craters formed deposits left by this eruption contain basaltic andesite andesite and were subject to agglutination and welding originally considered part of stage iii it was more recently attributed to stage iv given considerable 6 000 years temporal gap between tumbres eruption and stage iii volcanism and geochemistry of rocks agglutinate above tumbres deposits was formed either by tumbres eruption or by a subsequent stage a pyroclastic cone in western crater may be associated with this agglutinate activity subsequently shifted to eastern edifice around 5150 1250 bce as obtained by surface exposure dating tumbres talabre lava flow was erupted from eastern crater this flow extends northwest and is thick tumbres talabre flow was originally considered to be of late 19th century age it probably formed when one of craters filled with andesitic lava to point of overflow three eastern summit craters formed at time when tumbres talabre flow erupted in remains of stage i cone this edifice is currently active one with deepest of its three summit craters being active historical activity lascar has erupted about thirty times since 19th century written reports of volcanic activity exist since 16th century when spaniards arrived in region though few records exist from before 1848 volcanic activity recorded after 1848 consists chiefly of fumarolic emissions and occasional explosive activity recorded eruptions occurred in 1858 1875 1883 1885 1898 1900 and 1902 ranging from a volcanic explosivity index vei of 0 to vei 2 1933 eruption was seen as far away as chuquicamata another series of eruptions occurred between november 1951 and january 1952 one eruption is recorded from 1940 eruptions were observed in march 1960 which were accompanied by earthquakes felt in toconao as well as in september 1964 when ash fell in yet another eruption sequence occurred between 1959 and 1969 eruptions in 1972 and 1974 are uncertain for some eruptions including january 1854 eruption it is not clear whether they occurred at lascar or aguas calientes and some early reports of volcanic activity at aguas calientes probably refer to lascar in 1984 lascar awakened to new activity satellite images noted presence of hot spots on volcano landsat images taken during this time indicate that a lava lake may have existed in central crater generating a plume of volcanic gases and in september 1986 a vulcanian eruption happened and dropped ash in salta argentina this eruption was first noticed when ash fell on salta and was accompanied by anomalies in heat emission from volcano recorded by satellite eruption was also observed by geologists in toconao where explosion was violent enough to wake up people who were sleeping observers noted formation of a cauliflower shaped cloud that eventually developed into a mushroom cloud with a maximum height of above volcano eruption itself lasted only about five minutes and consisted of two pulses ash fall in salta occurred about one hour after eruption this eruption was most significant of previous two decades having a vei of 3 preceding historical eruptions did not exceed 2 a and lava dome formed in early 1989 this dome began to shrink in october 1989 and in december 1989 white clouds rose above lascar s crater on 20 february 1990 an eruption column rose above crater resulting in ash fall over away from volcano in march 1990 lava dome had a temperature of with some parts exceeding lava bombs with diameters of up to were hurled as far as from crater presumably as a consequence of lava dome exploding some of material came from conduit walls lava dome had disappeared but in early 1992 another lava dome formed eventually reaching a size of width and height and was accompanied by explosions it probably started shrinking in april 1992 although shrinkage was directly visible only in november small explosions accompanied shrinkage until by march 1993 dome had disappeared again an alternating cycle of fumarolic activity an accumulation of fumarolic gases in conduit and lava dome and explosive activity followed by renewed fumarolic activity have characterized lascar s activity since 1984 explosive activity presumably occurs when gases can no longer escape this occurs because as magma loses its gas content number of pores in it and thus its permeability to gas decreases further fractures permitting gas passage are obstructed when magma contracts most of time numerous fumaroles within crater form a plume that reaches an altitude of during minor explosive eruptions eruption columns reach heights of up to temperatures of lava dome can reach this cycle ended after 1993 probably because april 1993 eruption modified conditions in volcanic system alternatively cycle may have continued to reach another lava dome collapse stage in early 2003 while eruptions before 1993 had always been preceded by a reduction in heat radiated from volcano such a reduction in 1999 2000 did not lead to an eruption and when an eruption took place in july 2000 it was preceded by only a brief drop in heat radiation 1993 eruption vulcanian explosions started on 18 april 1993 and on 19 20 april 1993 a major eruption occurred a phreatic eruption around 14 30 on 18 april formed prelude to eruption eruption commenced with two explosions at 6 28 and 9 20 local time forming eruption columns high another explosion at 13 02 sent a column high at least ten different pulses were observed generating columns of various heights and forming mushroom clouds strongest pulse occurred on 20 april between 6 28 and 9 20 and sent flows towards northwest this pulse generated an eruption column high total mass flux of eruption was about comparable to 1982 eruption of el lava dome in crater was destroyed and was probably source of lava bombs that were thrown as far as away from vent some of these bombs had diameters of and left large impact craters eruption columns underwent several collapses creating pyroclastic flows at least seven to nine times first pyroclastic flow was observed around 10 12 on 19 april other flows occurred at 12 05 after 13 37 17 25 21 35 21 48 23 40 23 50 and on 20 april at 9 20 after being discharged through gaps in crater rim pyroclastic flows on northwestern and eastern sides reached lengths of and on southern side these flows reached a thickness of about and advanced through quebrada de talabre which had intercepted flows on northern flank on southeastern flank pyroclastic flows formed a fan extending several hundred metres into pampa leija pyroclastic flows reached a speed of and themselves generated ash surges that partly rose above flows hot pyroclastic flows on southeastern flank covered a surface area of southern flank flows at first proceeded along a gully before spreading out total area covered by flows is about on northern slopes tumbres fan and on southern slopes lejia fan flows left lobate structures that form a stacked deposit which shows such structures as levees and finger like toes speed of these flows has been estimated at about 30 of these flows were formed by ash and 70 by blocks with larger fragments accumulating on margins of each flow deposit pyroclastic flow deposits contain lithics from several sources as well as pumice pumice mostly accumulated on surface of flows and individual stones are up to wide lithic blocks are up to thick total volume of these pyroclastic flows is about there is a pronounced morphology characterized by a channel upslope and snout like toes downslope flow surfaces display pronounced fractures with a v profile which developed a year after eruption pyroclastic flow surfaces subsided after eruption with pulses of faster subsidence coinciding with 1995 antofagasta earthquake and 2007 tocopilla earthquake flows were strongly erosive extracting rocks and material from bedrock even far away from vent noticeable erosion occurred in areas over which pyroclastic flows had passed forming abrasion surfaces and removing loose detritus from ground these flows took a long time to cool down in quebrada tumbres they had not cooled down completely by december 1993 additional surfaces were covered by ash cloud surges reaching thicknesses of no more than on sides of pyroclastic flows in some parts of edifice ejecta formed layers thick enough to undergo deposits and small structures such as levees and lobes were conserved by dry climate in region ash from volcano was carried by western wind towards argentina and atlantic ocean ash fall in tucuman and santiago del estero was intense enough that traffic ground to a halt and air travel was impacted internationally tephra fall from this eruption was recorded in argentina including in buenos aires away and in brazil paraguay and uruguay ash from this eruption was identified in ice cores from while sulfates reportedly appeared in ice taken from arctic and antarctica over of ash fell over a surface area of over larger particles fell closer to volcano while smaller particles were carried farther volcanic ash deposited close to volcano was partially remobilized by winds a few days after eruption this eruption was most significant eruption of lascar in last 9 000 years with a volcanic explosivity index of 4 and a duration of 32 hours and one of most significant volcanic eruptions in recent history of chile it caused noticeable changes in morphology of volcano including formation of a new fracture along summit craters however summit craters themselves were not heavily altered apart from formation of a trench across three craters that runs in west east direction whole volcano did not deform during eruption sequence eruption released about of sulfur dioxide about half quantity released by 1980 eruption of mount st helens and was sufficient to cause a noticeable increase in atmospheric opacity quebrada was blocked and its water chemistry noticeably altered by eruption about of gypsum was deposited in drainages around volcano forming a significant supply of sulfur in region people of talabre were evacuated during eruption to toconao although some ignored evacuation orders there were no injuries or fatalities fatalities however eruption did lead to water pollution in region including increases in cadmium copper and lead concentrations in local rivers an increase of mercury from eruption was detected as far as laguna del plata argentina 1993 eruption was followed by a significant increase in fluorine content of plants covered by ash regulatory limits on concentrations of other elements in water were also exceeded although only temporarily post 1993 activity eruption record at lascar becomes more irregular after 1993 eruption during april 1993 a new lava dome formed in crater reaching a diameter of it started to shrink again by may on 17 december 1993 another explosion created an eruption column high by 28 december dome had subsided completely in centre leaving only its margins subsequently a number of fumaroles were active around crater explosive eruptions accompanied by formation of eruption columns reaching heights of several kilometres sometimes leading to ash fall in jujuy argentina occurred on 27 february 1994 in july 1994 november 1994 and march 1995 and on 10 may 20 july and 18 october 1996 during july 1995 eruption subsidence was noted on satellite images of inside of central crater collapse structures during this activity were larger than those noted in previous activity possibly because april 1993 eruption had emptied part of system otherwise activity between 1993 and 2000 was not accompanied by deformation of edifice an eruption in july 2000 was seen from chuquicamata and noise was audible as far as san antonio de los away eruption lasted for two hours and formed a eruption column an ash plume was carried east three eruptions in october 2002 formed ash columns that rose while an explosion in december 2003 created a column high no lava domes were recorded in crater during that period 300px thumb right 2006 eruption further activity occurred in may 2005 with a ash cloud and in april 2006 an eruption commenced at 11 35 local time on 18 april 2006 this explosion was strong enough to rattle windows in school at talabre 18 april eruption was seen from el abra copper mine away and resulted in ash fall north northeast from volcano four eruptions occurred at 15 20 17 22 19 00 and 21 00 utc forming eruption columns reaching altitudes of next day additional explosions occurred at 15 04 15 05 and 17 39 utc with a maximum column height of a video taken by chilean air force on 20 april showed a pit in floor of main crater during following days additional explosions generated columns up to high with little ash production eruption ended around 15 32 on 20 april although some explosions occurred in following days other eruptions were recorded in november 2006 and july 2007 weak eruptions characterized by earthquakes and release of plumes occurred in february march 2012 and march april 2013 between april and june 2013 glow was observed at summit accompanied by occasional release of gray clouds glowing was also reported in october and november 2013 last eruption on 30 october 2015 created a column of ash that prompted a raise in local volcano alert level thermal anomalies from this eruption persisted into 2017 but with a tendency to decrease in number accompanied by persistent degassing monitoring and threats because of volcano s remote location much information on its activity comes from remote sensing in addition occasional reconnaissance flights seismographic monitoring and infrequent visits to volcano occur observatorio de los andes del sur in also employs webcams to watch lascar lascar s activity has been monitored by thematic mapper which has been used to monitor volcanic activity since 1985 when hot spots were observed on lascar eruptions of april 1993 and september 1986 were both preceded by a reduction of thermal radiation observed by thematic mapper seismic activity occurs at lascar research has indicated peculiar patterns including so called rapid fire events on a background of continuous activity as well as occurrence of long period earthquakes here and in other volcanoes this kind of seismic activity is associated with intense fumarolic activity that occurs in absence of outright eruptions harmonic tremor has been recorded at lascar perhaps caused by a hydrothermal system such tremors may be produced by movement of liquid materials in volcano a number of earthquakes were recorded in early february 2012 between january 2014 and june 2016 about 2 4 volcano tectonic earthquakes per month were recorded long period earthquakes with magnitudes not exceeding 1 3 were also recorded with a maximum of 209 events noted in may 2015 explosive eruptions and ash falls are major threat to humans from lascar frequent smaller explosive events commonly occur unexpectedly and can thus endanger people on mountain towns of tumbres and talabre may be affected by pyroclastic flows and ash falls can occur east of volcano such ash falls could potentially hit towns of san pedro de atacama talabre and toconao as well as llano de observatory san pedro de atacama paso de jama jujuy international road and pass past eruptions caused ash fall in argentina and disruption of air travel and could have major effects in salta province in case of renewed activity in 1982 town of talabre was moved for safety reasons stemming from flooding and volcanic activity and ballistic blocks ejected by volcano are a threat to mountaineers and scientists working on lascar sector collapse and lahars have occurred in past but are unlikely to be present day hazards national geology and mining service of chile publishes a volcano alert level for lascar heavy metal exposure is a problem for region high quantities of arsenic have been observed in local crops thallium from volcano is a pollution hazard in talabre area high nickel concentrations in crops from talabre appear to be caused by volcanic activity as well see also list of volcanoes in chile notes references sources further reading external links lascar at sernageomin cl atacama photo gallery panoramic view into
