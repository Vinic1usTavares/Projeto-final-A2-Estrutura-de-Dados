morchella sextelata is a species of ascomycete fungus in family morchellaceae described as new to science in 2012 it is found in north america in washington idaho montana wyoming new mexico and yukon territory it has also been found in china although it is not known if this is a result of an accidental introduction or natural dispersion fruit bodies have a roughly conical cap up to tall and wide with a surface of mostly vertically arranged pits cap is initially yellowish to brownish but it darkens to become almost black in maturity stipe is white and hollow measuring high by wide morchella sextelata is one of four species of wildfire adapted morels in western north america others being m capitata m septimelata and m tomentosa m sextelata cannot be reliably distinguished from m septimelata without use of dna analysis taxonomy morchella sextelata was originally identified as phylogenetic species mel 6 in species rich elata clade brown morels elucidated by microbiologist kerry o donnell and colleagues in a 2011 publication specific epithet sextelata alludes to this preliminary name although m sextelata is not distinguishable from morchella septimelata on physical or ecological characteristics they are clearly genetically distinct species and can be differentiated by comparing dna sequences or with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis allopatric speciation is thought to have been driving evolutionary force that caused m sextelata to diverge from its ancestors roughly 25 million years ago original specimens collected were obtained as part of morel data collection project a research effort designed to improve understanding of north american morels description thumb upright left an immature fruit body fruit bodies of morchella sextelata are high with a conical cap that is high and wide at widest point cap surface features pits and ridges formed by intersection of 12 20 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter secondary vertical ridges with occasional sunken horizontal ridges cap is attached to stipe with a sinus about 2 4 mm deep and 2 4 mm wide ridges are smooth or very finely tomentose covered with densely matted filaments they are initially colorless becoming pale tan then dark grayish brown in maturity eventually darkening to nearly black they are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity pits are somewhat elongated vertically they are smooth brownish to yellowish tan to pinkish to buff whitish to pale brownish stipe is long by wide and is roughly equal in width throughout its length or sometimes slightly club shaped near base its surface is either smooth or covered with whitish granules flesh is whitish measuring 1 2 mm thick in hollow cap it may become layered and chambered in base of stipe sterile inner surface of cap is whitish and pubescent covered with short soft hair ascospores of m sextelata are elliptical and smooth typically measuring 18 25 by 10 16 um asci spore bearing cells are eight spored hyaline translucent cylindrical and measure 200 325 by 5 25 um paraphyses are cylindrical septate and measure 175 300 by 2 15 um their tips are variably shaped from rounded to club shaped to fuse shaped contents of paraphyses are hyaline translucent to faintly brownish in dilute potassium hydroxide koh hyphae on sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 50 180 by 5 25 um terminal cells are variably shaped similar to paraphyses and have brownish contents in koh north american morchella are generally considered choice edibles but edibility of m sextelata was not mentioned in its original description similar species morchella sextelata is morphologically indistinguishable from several other morel species in m elata clade including m septimelata m brunnea m angusticeps and m septentrionalis m septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution m brunnea is found in non burned forests of western north america m angusticeps is found east of rocky mountains and m septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution about 44degn northward in eastern north america m septimelata however also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from m sextelata although there are subtle differences in structure of sterile ridges between species authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent habitat distribution and ecology thumb right a group of fruit bodies in yosemite national park california in an area burned by 2013 rim fire morchella sextelata may be either saprobic or mycorrhizal at different times in its life cycle its fruit bodies grow in partially burned conifer forests particularly those dominated by douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa they tend to appear in great numbers year immediately following fire and appear in decreasing frequency in successive years fruiting occurs from april through july at elevations between distribution includes washington idaho montana wyoming and yukon territory m sextelata has also been found in china but it remains unclear whether dispersal between these distant locations occurred naturally or through accidental introduction by humans morchella sextelata identified as phylogenetic species mel 6 has been shown to colonize non native species bromus tectorum cheatgrass as an endophyte increasing overall growth of grass as well as abundance of seeds and their tolerance to extreme heat this has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in success of cheatgrass as an invasive species in western north america references external links category morchellaceae
