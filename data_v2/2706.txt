games require player to control a rocket attempting to land on moon by entering instructions to rocket in a turn based system in response to textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to ground in original lunar players controlled only amount of vertical thrust to apply based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel with each round representing one second of travel time rocket added a simple text based graphical display of distance from ground in each round while lem added horizontal velocity and ability to apply thrust at an angle in 1970 and 1971 dec employee and editor of newsletter david h ahl converted two early mainframe games lunar and hamurabi from focal language to basic partially as a demonstration of language on dec pdp 8 minicomputer

lunar module on surface of moon using game s telemetry data if player module s landing module will either fly off into space or crash into moon s surface game is controlled with a light pen and output display was a vector graphics system light pen allowed adjusting throttle value and angle of lunar lander burness has said that he does not recall playing original lunar but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of game which he had played he based calculations of fuel consumption for maneuvering rocket on actual lunar lander specifications which he obtained from massachusetts institute of technology which co designed lander entire game was written in ten days in august 1979 atari produced an arcade game version of concept called lunar lander this version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed player to rotate ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring like moonlander both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface as well as a text readout of ship s speed altitude and remaining fuel are displayed once a game begins it only ends when a player runs out of fuel rather than due to a time limit players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of map game features four levels of difficulty in controlling ship lunar lander was atari s first vector graphics game and first multiple perspective video game when lander got close to surface view changed to a close up view of lander vector engine

based game and so many versions of graphical game existed by 1981 that electronic games in a review of a version by scott adams for atari 8 bit computers and trs 80 claimed it was yet another entry in a field as crowded as category of space invaders imitators sometimes it seems as though every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme moon lander for mk14 was one

video games to be based on a real space program as opposed to many games inspired by fictional forms of space exploration see also 1982 an arcade game from atari based on similar concepts space taxi
