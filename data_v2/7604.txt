streptococcal pharyngitis also known as strep throat is an infection of back of throat including tonsils caused by group a streptococcus gas common symptoms include fever sore throat red tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes in neck a headache and nausea or vomiting may also occur some develop a sandpaper like rash which is known as scarlet fever symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person it may be spread directly or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching mouth nose or eyes some people may carry bacteria without symptoms it may also be spread by skin infected with group a strep diagnosis is made based on results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms prevention is by washing hands and not sharing eating utensils there is no vaccine for disease treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment pain can be treated with paracetamol acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen strep throat is a common bacterial infection in children it is cause of 15 40 of sore throats among children and 5 15 among adults cases are more common in late winter and early spring potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess signs and symptoms typical signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are a sore throat fever of greater than tonsillar exudates pus on tonsils and large cervical lymph nodes other symptoms include headache nausea and vomiting abdominal pain muscle pain or a rash or palatal petechiae latter being an uncommon but highly specific finding symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days strep throat is unlikely when any of symptoms of red eyes hoarseness runny nose or mouth ulcers are present it is also unlikely when there is no fever cause strep throat is caused by group a b hemolytic streptococcus gas or s other bacteria such as non group a b hemolytic streptococci and may also cause pharyngitis it is spread by direct close contact with an infected person thus crowding as may be found in military and schools increases rate of transmission dried bacteria in dust are not infectious although moist bacteria on toothbrushes or similar items can persist for up to fifteen days contaminated food can result in outbreaks but this is rare of children with no signs or symptoms 12 carry gas in their pharynx and after treatment approximately 15 of those remain positive and are true carriers diagnosis modified centor of 1 or fewer 10 no antibiotic or culture needed 2 11 17 antibiotic based on culture or radt 3 28 35 4 or 5 52 antibiotics a number of scoring systems exist to help with diagnosis however their use is controversial due to insufficient accuracy modified centor criteria are a set of five criteria total score indicates probability of a streptococcal infection one point is given for each of criteria absence of a cough swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes temperature tonsillar exudate or swelling age less than 15 a point is subtracted if age 44 a score of one may indicate no treatment or culture is needed or it may indicate need to perform further testing if other high risk factors exist such as a family member having disease infectious disease society of america recommends against empirical treatment and considers antibiotics only appropriate when given after a positive test testing is not needed in children under three as both group a strep and rheumatic fever are rare unless a child has a sibling with disease laboratory testing a throat culture is gold standard for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis with a sensitivity of 90 95 a rapid strep test also called rapid antigen detection testing or radt may also be used while rapid strep test is quicker it has a lower sensitivity 70 and statistically equal specificity 98 as a throat culture in areas of world where rheumatic fever is uncommon a negative rapid strep test is sufficient to rule out disease a positive throat culture or radt in association with symptoms establishes a positive diagnosis in those in which diagnosis is in doubt in adults a negative radt is sufficient to rule out diagnosis however in children a throat culture is recommended to confirm result asymptomatic individuals should not be routinely tested with a throat culture or radt because a certain percentage of population persistently carries streptococcal bacteria in their throat without any harmful results differential diagnosis as symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions it can be difficult to make diagnosis clinically coughing nasal discharge diarrhea and red irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis other conditions that may present similarly include epiglottitis kawasaki disease acute retroviral syndrome s syndrome ludwig s angina peritonsillar abscess and retropharyngeal abscess prevention tonsillectomy may be a reasonable preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections more than three a year however benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for gas may also represent a person who is a chronic carrier of gas who is getting recurrent viral infections treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended treating people who are carriers of gas is not recommended as risk of spread and complications is low treatment untreated streptococcal pharyngitis usually resolves within a few days treatment with antibiotics shortens duration of acute illness by about 16 hours primary reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses antibiotics prevent acute rheumatic fever if given within 9 days of onset of symptoms pain medication pain medication such as nsaids and paracetamol acetaminophen helps in management of pain associated with strep throat viscous lidocaine may also be useful while steroids may help with pain they are not routinely recommended aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to risk of reye syndrome antibiotics antibiotic of choice in united states for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin v due to safety cost and effectiveness amoxicillin is preferred in europe in india where risk of rheumatic fever is higher intramuscular penicillin g is first choice for treatment appropriate antibiotics decrease average 3 5 day duration of symptoms by about one day and also reduce they are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess arguments in favor of antibiotic treatment should be balanced by consideration of possible side effects and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is erythromycin and other or clindamycin are recommended for people with severe penicillin allergies first generation cephalosporins may be used in those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis however incidence of this side effect is not reduced by use of antibiotics prognosis symptoms of strep throat usually improve within three to five days irrespective of treatment treatment with antibiotics reduces risk of complications and transmission children may return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered risk of complications in adults is low in children acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of developed world it is however leading cause of acquired heart disease in india sub saharan africa and some parts of australia complications arising from streptococcal throat infections include acute rheumatic fever scarlet fever streptococcal toxic shock syndrome glomerulonephritis pandas syndrome peritonsillar abscess cervical lymphadenitis economic cost of disease in united states in children is approximately 350 million annually epidemiology
