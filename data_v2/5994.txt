ignore coin he then turns to stack of tarot cards and recites a passage from alice s adventures in wonderland who cares for you you re nothing but a pack of cards themes and style story is influenced by many previous deconstructions of superhero genre morrison himself wanted novel to be his own re imagining of batman morrison includes themes such as symbolism and psychological horror while depicting how insanity works within setting of arkham asylum morrison references carl jung aleister crowley and alice in wonderland july 20 2014 while also presenting psychologically different versions of several classic characters in batman universe examples include maxie zeus an electrified emaciated figure with messianic delusions obsessed with electric shocks and coprophagia clayface who is rapidly wasting away from lack of feeding mad hatter whose obsession with alice in wonderland has pedophilic overtones and batman himself who is driven close to breaking point by asylum killer croc was originally drawn as suffering deformities similar to those of joseph merrick elephant man although his final incarnation is that of a humanoid crocodile joker s mental condition is described as super sanity he re invents himself every day to suit his circumstances he may be a harmless prankster one moment and a homicidal maniac next joker is portrayed with a somewhat homosexual element described as being indirectly in love with batman may 30 2014 in script morrison initially wanted joker to wear make up and black lingerie in parody of madonna dc s editors however removed this believing that readers might assume that jack nicholson s portrayal of character in batman film would be portrayed as a transvestite singer 2011 p 65 unlike traditional superhero comics many forms of sexual references are seen and many of villains in novel are heavily sexualized december 21 2010 mad hatter is said to be a child molester clayface is described as aids with two legs and both amadeus arkham and charles cavendish are seen cross dressing singer 2011 p 68 setting of arkham asylum plays a large role in how inmates perceive their own insanity as said by mad hatter s i think asylum is head we re inside a huge head that dreams us all into being he also described asylum as being a looking glass that shows subject their own twisted psyche morrison used hypostasis to push story forward saying that psychoanalytic theory and jungian archetypes was an influence singer 2011 p 67 artwork thumb right 300px a panel from arkham asylum showing dave mckean s artwork and letterer gaspar saladino s distinctive lettering treatment dave mckean drew most of principal art as well as cover art of graphic novel in illustrating story mckean blends paintings drawings photography and mixed media collage to come up with striking page designs and dense symbols singer 2011 p 64 he has said that he was trying to make book despite subject rather than because of it at end of day if you really love to do batman comics then that s probably best thing to do not liking them and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time he also came to think that overpainted lavish illustrations in every panel just didn t work it hampers storytelling grant morrison from asylum to star nicholas sequart april 29 2008 mckean liberally uses symbolism imagery and surrealism and many scenes involve use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device for example a greek inscription can be seen scratched on doorway of maxie zeus s electroshock chamber which translates into discover thyself much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by release of 15th anniversary edition containing morrison s annotated script arkham asylum has also been praised for gaspar saladino s distinctive lettering work and giving characters their own fonts kimball kirk treasure keeper part twelve of twelve into asylum dial b for blog 500 sept accessed may 20 2011 practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread especially in dc s vertigo line and many marvel comics different speech bubbles were used for many characters batman s is black with white lettering maxie gets blue with a greek font while joker s speech is without a bubble at all red ink spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as character himself critical reaction and legacy graphic novel was published in october 1989 in wake of tim burton s film batman upon its release graphic novel became a commercial success and catapulted morrison and mckean s name in comic book industry editor karen berger revealed that it has sold close to a half million copies by 2004 making it best selling original graphic novel in american superhero comics

works calling it his first big commercial hit and his first shot writing batman a character he would spend a great deal of time with over course of his career was this ground breaking graphic novel featuring grim twisted artwork of painter dave mckean in this darkly poetic psychologically rich tale batman faces off against joker two face scarecrow and other villains inside gotham city s house for criminally insane joseph szadkowski of washington times called it as one of key sequential art stories of batman library szadkowski joseph batman vs joker in asylum washington times washington 10 september 2009 keith dooley of comics authority describes it as psychologically and visually jarring book that brings reader along with amadeus arkham and batman on their journeys through their psyches in a world full of symbolism adding also that batman his foes and all of humanity are greatly affected by power of symbolism with this story laying before reader that these fictional characters stories are also in many ways our stories october 31 2013 lucas siegel from newsarama also praised comic describing art as striking beautiful and yes today s secret word disturbing august 15 2008 andy shaw of on other hand had a more negative response praising artwork of dave mckean and calling it brilliant but criticized morrison s story as claustrophobic and has more ponderous psychology than action and as a result not enough room to fit any decent action in shaw would later add that morrison s work doesn t stand up to his rivals and that mixing history of asylum famous dumping ground for batman s psychotic foes with a typical batman adventure is interesting enough but morrison throws too much at hero in too small a space this makes batman s journey through arkham s finest appear too easy more of a stroll through a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life coupled with an anti climatic ending there s little feeling of impending disaster chronicled event should probably appear in batman s casebook of over hyped morrison himself admitted that amount of symbolism made him ending up being accused of doing most pretentious batman book ever singer 2011 p 54 in october 2005 a 15th anniversary edition was released new reprint contained morrison and karen berger s annotated script that breaks down and explains much of symbolic references in series as well as principal art and step by step samples of story sequel during san diego comic con 2017 morrison announced that he is currently working on a follow up
