lactarius rupestris is a species of mushroom in russulaceae family described as a new species in 2010 it is known only from semi arid region in national park of catimbau of brazil mushroom is characterized by a stout fruit body with a smooth and sticky orange cap up to in diameter gills on underside of cap are closely spaced and frequently anastomosed stem is long by thick mushrooms exude a sparse cream colored latex when cut or injured discovery and classification species was found in brazilian semi arid region in national park of catimbau in july 2007 it was described as new to science in a 2010 mycotaxon publication by felipe of universidade federal de pernambuco l rupestris is one of 19 species of lactarius known from brazil epithet rupestris refers to campos rupestres montane savanna ecoregion where type species was collected authors note that fungus does not readily fit into any of infrageneric i e below level of genus classification schemes outlined by previous authorities for example although l rupestris has several characteristics that make section proposed by a somewhat close match taxon cannot be included because surface of its cap is neither sufficiently areolate cracked nor dry enough and its spores are excessively ornamented in comparison description cap of l rupestris is concave to somewhat funnel shaped with a central depression its color is orange at center to brownish orange towards margin cap surface is somewhat sticky and texture is either smooth to slightly cracked it has an indistinct layer of matted mycelial hairs margin lacks striations and grooves and is curled inward slightly gills are slightly decurrent running slightly down length of stem cream salmon in color and crowded closely together they are up to broad and are frequently branched gill edges are smooth and same color as gill face there are several tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from cap margin to stem interspersed between gills stem is long by thick centrally attached to stem cylindrical and tapers slightly near base it is pale ochraceous salmon and slight longitudinal ribs can be seen with a magnifying glass flesh is spongy pale yellow ochre in cap and cream yellow in stem latex is cream colored to roughly same color as gills and not abundant microscopic characteristics spores are roughly ellipsoid to roughly spherical and typically measure 7 8 5 by 6 7 um ornamentation on spore surface is amyloid staining blue to blue black in melzer s reagent and finely wart like with each wart ranging to 0 5 0 7 um high warts are interconnected by thin ridges but ridges do not form a complete reticulum hilar appendage part of a spore once attached to basidium via sterigma ranges in shape from narrowly obtuse to somewhat conical plage is not very distinct but has an amyloid spot basidia spore bearing cells in hymenium are 35 50 by 8 11 um club shaped and bear mainly four but sometimes two long 6 10 um sterigmata are very scarce on gill faces when present they are thin walled 170 um long by 24 um wide with brownish refractive contents and arise from deep in tissue of hymenophore edge of gill is sterile lacking basidia and has marginal cells that are 30 45 by 4 6 um cylindrical to somewhat sinuous curvy thin walled and hyaline translucent tissue of cap has abundant sphaerocysts spherical swollen cells common to russulaceae and measure 25 65 by 24 50 um in addition to filamentous hyphae that are up to 10 um wide lactiferous latex containing hyphae are common in cap tissue they are up to 15 um wide with a longitudinal orientation although they diverge from trama somewhat spreading out from center of gill they do not form projecting pseudocystidia subhymenium layer of cells directly under hymenium is made of club shaped to nearly spherical cells that are 16 27 by 9 17 um tissue that comprises hymenophore is made of several parts it contains abundant nearly 17 25 by 13 18 um cells and filamentous hyphae that measure 3 5 6 5 um lactiferous hyphae are frequent up to 7 12 um wide straight and only occasionally branching cap cuticle is a trichoderm meaning outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel like hairs perpendicular to cap surface it is up to 140 um thick and comprises two layers upper layer suprapellis is made of plentiful colorless hyphae that are 20 51 by 4 6 um thin walled up to 0 5 um and range in shape from obtuse to somewhat acute to knob like or pear shaped lower layer of cap cuticle subpellis is made of both plentiful hyphae that are 3 8 um wide and somewhat more inflated colorless cells up to 10 18 um wide lactarius rupestris does not have clamp connections in its hyphae habitat and distribution thumb right mushroom is known only from vale do catimbau national park in brazil mushroom was found buried with up to two thirds of stem in sandy soil near several shrubs fabaceae subfamily mimosoideae and others in a semi arid region after heavy precipitation species is known only from type locality in vale do catimbau national park in brazil in state of pernambuco it fruits at an elevation of this is part of biodiverse ecoregion in an area known as campos rupestres although fungus is suspected to be mycorrhizal like all lactarius there was a wide diversity of plant species growing in open dry forest where mushroom was found including members of tree families euphorbiaceae fabaceae myrtaceae and all known to form mycorrhizal associations so authors did not speculate on any specific interactions see also list of lactarius species notes references see also
