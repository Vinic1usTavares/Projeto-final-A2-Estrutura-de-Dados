solomon islands and island of new britain including its capital rabaul mcaulay pp 23 24 lerew was given command of no 24 squadron in may 1941 and raised to temporary wing commander in october no 24

historian alan stephens stephens pp 135 136 on 1 december raaf headquarters in melbourne put lerew s squadron on notice for deployment to rabaul as an advance garrison in defence of northern australia preparations at rabaul no 24 squadron s hudsons began moving to vunakanau airfield rabaul from raaf station townsville in far north queensland on 5 december 1941 by middle of month they had been joined by unit s wirraways gillison p 241 vunakanau afforded little shelter for staff or aircraft and japanese reconnaissance planes were already active in vicinity suggesting an attack was imminent no 24 squadron began carrying out reconnaissance missions with its hudsons and on one occasion attempted to bomb an enemy ship without success raaf headquarters threatened to relieve lerew for his apparent lack of results and delays in communications and demanded to know his excuses possessed of what official history of raaf in world war ii described as an impish irreverence lerew listed among his reasons disappointment in lack of assistance rendered by almighty he later reported that he was being caused more worry by his own headquarters in south than from enemy situated in north gillison

of 1942 was four hudsons six wirraways and 130 staff on new year s day lerew led hudsons on a raid against island igniting a fuel dump that was still burning when squadron returned to follow up attack two days later gillison pp 313 314 during 4 7 january vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted japanese bombers destroying all but one of hudsons although wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions their rate of climb was so poor that only once did one of them manage to engage an enemy seaplane without result this action on 6 january was first air to air combat between raaf and japanese forces at this point lerew signalled headquarters for six modern fighters with which to defend his airfield none were forthcoming gillison pp 318 320 squadron leader arch tindal northern area command armaments officer added his weight to lerew s pleas for modern aircraft tindal had arrived to inspect no 24 squadron in middle of an enemy attack on 3 january and immediately leapt into nearest wirraway to attempt an interception he later submitted a report to headquarters at townsville echoing lerew s concerns regarding wirraway s capabilities and warning that rabaul is now wide open to bombing attack mcaulay pp 79 90 91 despite this morale remained high in unit lerew remarked on devil may care attitude of his personnel who frequently waited until last moment to take cover during air raids on 17 january lerew was able to gain sufficient height in his wirraway to confront a japanese seaplane in a head on attack but his 303 machine gun ammunition was not sufficient to bring it down in 1956 while at a conference in tokyo he coincidentally met japanese plane s pilot who informed him that his lone assault had damaged an engine and killed two crewmen

recalled we sat at our guns shocked by massacre we had just observed japanese fighters compounded humiliation by executing aerobatics over bombed airfield odgers pp 38 39 lerew signalled headquarters two wirraways useless defence will you now please send some fighters receiving reply regret inability to supply fighters if we had them you would get them gillison pp 356 358 next day he was ordered to attack approaching japanese fleet with all available aircraft as his two serviceable wirraways had no bomb racks this left only one remaining hudson with which to execute order it duly took off to search for enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall and returned to base it was following a further directive from headquarters on 21 january 1942 to keep his airfield open that lerew after discussion with his intelligence staff sent signal that made him famous morituri vos salutamus message flummoxed headquarters until an officer familiar with latin decoded it as legendary phrase used by ancient gladiators to honour their emperor we who are about to die salute you lerew also chose to ignore two other orders received from headquarters firstly to turn his remaining ground staff and aircrew into infantrymen to assist with army s defence and secondly to leave rabaul in his remaining hudson to take command of a new squadron in port moresby new guinea to first order he replied that trained raaf crews would be more valuable in future actions than in a last ditch effort to repel invader at rabaul to second he simply turned a blind eye refusing to escape alone in only aircraft left that could evacuate his personnel on 22 january he sent off ninety six staff in hudson and in flying boats called in from port moresby wilson pp 117 118 others escaped overland or in boats lerew s careful planning helped ensure that only three of his men were captured by japanese later war service following evacuation of rabaul lerew took command of a composite squadron in port moresby which later became no 32 general reconnaissance squadron gillison p 365 on 11 february 1942 he led a flight of three hudsons in a raid on gasmata harbour making what official history of raaf in world war ii described as first mast height attack on enemy shipping in new guinea campaign having set two ships on fire hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down including lerew s with his aircraft in flames he ordered his crew to bail out of rear hatch while he parachuted from front window lerew landed in jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making his way to a coastwatcher post and returning to port moresby in a schooner nine days after having been posted missing his crew members had died gillison pp 450 451 on 7 april lerew was awarded distinguished flying cross for outstanding courage determination skill and tenacity in course of bombing raids on enemy positions in new britain success of gasmata operation prompted chief of air staff to commend lerew s squadron for effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition mcaulay p 199 left thumb upright 1 25 alt twin engined twin tailed military monoplane in flight side on hudson similar to those in nos 24 and 32 squadrons returning to australia lerew held various base commands including raaf station townsville raaf station nowra in new south wales and batchelor airfield near darwin northern territory he led no 7 squadron operating bristol beauforts out of first nowra and then townsville from august to december 1942 he then returned to raaf station laverton to take charge of no 1 aircraft depot no 1 ad lerew s biographer lex mcaulay speculated of this quick succession of postings across country it is easy to assume that this wing commander whose critical reports were seen by war cabinet and who had twice escaped enemy at close quarters was not to be allowed personal contact with media of day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events mcaulay p 203 though degree qualified in civil engineering lerew believed he was underused in technical environment of no 1 ad and sought another overseas posting nevertheless his tenure at laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work in september 1943 he investigated crash of a vultee vengeance flown by an experienced aviator and found that when rolling aircraft to right it was possible for pilot s movements to release his safety harness making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control aircraft lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses mcaulay pp 218 219 lerew was posted to raaf overseas headquarters london in december 1943 he travelled via united states meeting film stars bing crosby bob hope and dorothy lamour on set of road to utopia at los angeles in february 1944 mcaulay pp 221 226 in london he undertook study of raf and usaaf methods of operations as well as diplomatic duties of invasion of france on 6 june 1944 he wrote there has been no rejoicing a hushed quietness has descended over london and all of england most people have relatives in it and there is only one wish that is that it will end quickly it is depressing to be playing no part in it mcaulay pp 232 233 later in year lerew was invested with his distinguished flying cross by king george vi at buckingham palace he returned to australia in early 1945 and married laurie steele australian born widow of a royal air force night fighter pilot having met her when he was stationed in england couple had two daughters but eventually divorced in march lerew took part in investigation into crash of a hudson carrying major general george vasey he determined that pilot s lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor and recommended further such training for raaf flight crew mcaulay pp 246 247 promoted group captain he formed directorate of flying safety in june 1945 and served as its inaugural director mcaulay p 246 believing that promotion of flying safety in raaf cut across both administrative and operational spheres and aware of notorious feud between service s two senior officers air vice marshals george jones and bill bostock lerew had proposed that new directorate be placed squarely under auspices of jones as chief of air staff with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates mcaulay pp 241 244 post war career and later life right thumb upright alt half length portrait of moustachioed man in military battle jacket with aviator s wings on left breast pocket and four stripes on shoulders lerew c 1945 46 dubious about prospects for advancement in post war military lerew applied for a role in recently established provisional international civil aviation organization picao in march 1946 while still director of flying safety in raaf he had just been appointed air officer commanding north western area in darwin on 7 october 1946 when picao offered him position of technical officer which he accepted mcaulay pp 253 p 313 he left raaf on 8 november 1946 emigrating to montreal quebec canada to take up his new employment with picao which became icao in 1947 appointed chief of aerodromes air routes and ground aids section in january 1951 he conducted assessments of airfields throughout world and led team that recommended be developed as athens international airport mcaulay p 302 lerew received credit for several of icao s accomplishments over next decade including various administrative reforms within organisation and finalising a standard runway approach lighting system in 1953 following five years of disagreement among members mcaulay pp 305 306 a colleague remembered him as having that very fortunate duality of personality being serious efficient and knowledgeable in his official capacity with an equally inherent twin ability to really liven things up off duty mcaulay p 299 in mexico on 20 august 1966 lerew married josephine henriette oude a dutch national he had met three years earlier he was promoted icao s chief of flight branch in april 1969 in which capacity he served until retiring from organisation in 1972 in retirement lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes in december 1974 when they tired of oppressively humid weather in darwin and left just before cyclone tracy struck on christmas day and in february 1976 when they decided to camp well away from lake atitlan guatemala which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22 000 people dead couple eventually settled in vancouver where john lerew died of cancer on 24 february 1996 aged eighty three he was survived by josephine and children of his first marriage mcaulay p 315 notes references category 1912 births category 1996 deaths category
