king s highway 401 commonly referred to as highway 401 and also known by its official name as macdonald cartier freeway or colloquially as four oh one is a controlled access 400 series highway in canadian province of ontario it stretches from windsor in west to ontario quebec border in east part of highway 401 that passes through toronto is north america s busiest highway and one of widest together with quebec autoroute 20 it forms road transportation backbone of quebec city windsor corridor along which over half of canada s population resides and is also a core route in national highway system of canada route is maintained by ministry of transportation of ontario mto and patrolled by ontario provincial police speed limit is throughout its length with only exceptions posted limit westbound in windsor and in most construction zones by end of 1952 three individual highways were numbered highway 401 partially completed toronto bypass between weston road and highway 11 yonge street highway 2a between west hill and newcastle and scenic highway between gananoque and brockville now known as thousand islands parkway these three sections of highway were 11 8 54 7 and 41 2 km 7 3 34 0 and 25 6 mi respectively in 1964 route became fully navigable from windsor to ontario quebec border in 1965 it was given a second designation macdonald cartier freeway in honour of two fathers of confederation at end of 1968 gananoque brockville section was bypassed and final intersection grade separated near kingston making highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817 9 km length on august 24 2007 portion of highway between miller road in trenton and don valley parkway highway 404 junction in toronto was designated highway of heroes as road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen canadian forces personnel from cfb trenton to coroner s office in toronto on september 27 2013 highway of heroes designation was extended west to keele street in toronto to coincide with move of coroner s office to new forensic services and coroner s complex at humber river hospital in 2011 construction began on a westward extension called rt hon herb gray parkway this new route follows but does not replace former highway 3 between former end of freeway and e c row expressway at which point it turns and parallels that route towards site of future gordie howe international bridge an section of parkway east of e c row interchange opened on june 28 2015 with remaining section completed and opened on november 21 in summer 2019 widening of highway between highway regional road 8 in kitchener to highway regional road 24 in cambridge to 12 lanes was completed there are plans are underway to widen remaining four lane sections between windsor and london to six lanes and to widen route between cambridge and milton as well as through oshawa expansive twelve plus lane collector express system now existing from pickering through toronto partway across mississauga will be extended west through mississauga to milton and east through ajax and whitby route description thumb left highway 401 at weston road has volumes of over 500 000 vehicles per day during summer months making it one of busiest stretches of highway in world highway 401 extends across southwestern central and eastern ontario in anticipation of future expansion of highway transportation ministry purchased a right of way along entire length generally highway occupies only a portion of this allotment shragge pp 93 94 it is one of world s busiest highways a 2016 analysis stated annual average daily traffic aadt count between weston road and highway 400 in toronto was nearly 420 000 while a second study estimates that over 500 000 vehicles travel that section on some days this makes it north america s busiest roadway surpassing santa monica freeway in los angeles and i 75 in atlanta just in time auto parts delivery systems of highly integrated automotive industry of michigan and ontario have contributed to highway s status as world s busiest truck route carrying 60 percent of vehicular trade between canada and us highway 401 also features north america s busiest multi structure bridge at hogg s hollow in toronto four bridges two for each direction with collector and express lanes carried an average of 373 700 vehicles daily in 2006 highway is one of major backbones of a network in

influences land use surrounding highway it parallels route to north between tilbury and woodstock near tilbury highway 401 loses its tall wall median barrier and narrows to four lanes following lot lines laid between concession roads in a plan designed to limit damage to sensitive agricultural lands through which highway runs butorac p 10 here highway s flat and straight route is notorious for leading to driver inattention section from windsor to london especially west of tilbury has become known for deadly car accidents and pile ups earning it nickname carnage alley as highway approaches london highway 402 merges in resulting in a six lane cross section within london it intersects city s two municipal expressways highbury avenue and veterans memorial parkway section between london and woodstock generally parallels former highway 2 but lies on south side of thames river this area is not as flat but highway is generally straight this part of highway 401 often experiences heavy snowsqualls in early winter sometimes extending as far east as toronto to south of woodstock highway 401 curves northeast and western terminus of highway 403 merges into it from here highway heads

zone around toronto protected from development after this gap highway interchanges with highway 407 express toll route within gta highway passes several major shopping malls including yorkdale shopping centre scarborough town centre and pickering town centre highway 401 widens into a collector express system as it approaches hurontario street in mississauga a concept inspired by dan ryan expressway in chicago system divides each direction of travel into collector and express lanes giving highway a wide span and four carriageways to avoid confusion between carriageways blue signs are used for collector lanes and green signs for express lanes unlike collector lanes which provide access to every interchange express lanes only provide direct access to a select few interchanges access between two is provided by transfers which are strategically placed to prevent disruptions caused by closely spaced interchanges overall purpose of collector express system is to maximize traffic flow for both local and long distance traffic in addition highway 401 was equipped with a traffic camera system called compass in early 1991 using closed circuit television cameras vehicle detection loops and led changeable message signs compass enables mto traffic operations centre to obtain a real time assessment of traffic conditions and alert drivers of collisions congestion and construction system stretches from highway 403 410 interchange in mississauga to harwood avenue in ajax two sets of collector express systems exist in gta first set is long and connects highway 403 highway 410 and

in early 20th century road design and construction advanced significantly following frequent erosion of lake shore road then emery pp 179 182 a concrete road known as toronto hamilton highway was proposed in january 1914 construction began on november 8 of that year following onset of world war i highway was designed to run along lake shore instead of dundas street to north because numerous hills encountered along dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility middle road a dirt lane named because of its position between two was not considered since lake shore and dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs shragge p 55 road was formally opened on november 24 1917 wide and nearly long it was first concrete road in ontario as well as one of longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in world shragge p 55 toronto to hamilton highway which when completed in 1917 was both ontario s first concrete highway and one of longest such inter city stretches in world over next decade vehicle usage increased substantially and by 1920 lakeshore road was again congested particularly during weekends in response department of highways examined improving another road between toronto and hamilton road was to be more than twice width of lakeshore road at and would carry two lanes of traffic in either direction shragge pp 79 81

highland creek ravine in 1936 department of highways began construction on a new bridge over large valley bypassing former alignment around west hill brown p 105 from here highway was constructed on a new alignment to oshawa avoiding construction on congested highway 2 as grading and bridge construction neared completion on new highway between west hill and oshawa in september 1939 world war ii broke out and gradually tax revenues were re allocated from highway construction to war effort at same time between september 6 and 8 1939 ontario good roads association conference was held at inn near huntsville drawing highway engineers from across north america to discuss new concept of dual highways on first day of convention mcquesten announced his vision of freeway an uninterrupted drive through scenic regions of ontario discouraging local business and local traffic from accessing highway except at infrequent controlled access points it was announced in days thereafter this concept would be applied to a new trans provincial expressway running from windsor to ontario quebec border highway engineers evaluated factors such as grading curve radius and narrow median used along middle road which was inaugurated on august 23 1940 as queen elizabeth way qew stamp p 31 and began to plan course of a new dual highway mostly parallel to highway 2 with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion unlike qew this highway would not be built along an existing road but rather on a new right of way avoiding need to provide access to properties along with immense improvements to machinery and construction techniques over its six year course war provided planners an opportunity to conduct a survey of 375 000 drivers asking them about their preferred route to travel to their destination using this information a course was plotted from windsor to quebec bypassing all towns along way highway 2s s for scenic was first completed section of new roadway built to connect with thousand islands bridge at ivy lea and opened as a gravel road in late 1941 or early 1942 road followed shore of saint lawrence river and connected with western end of twinned highway 2 near

in september 1955 entire bypass including widening of highway 27 into an expressway south of highway 401 was completed in august 1956 upon its opening bypass was described by one reporter as a motorist s dream providing some of most soothing scenery in metropolitan area reporter continued with regard to eastern section through scarborough that it winds smoothly through pastures across streams and rivers and beside green thickets it seems a long way from big city by 1959 however bypass was a lineup of cars as 85 000 drivers crowded roadway designed to handle a maximum of 48 000 vehicles on a daily basis motorists found new road to be a convenient way of travelling across toronto this convenience helped influence suburban shift in city and continues to be a driving force of urban sprawl today meanwhile beyond toronto highway was being built in a patchwork fashion focusing on congested areas first construction west from highway 27 began in late 1954 as did kingston bypass in eastern ontario work began to connect latter with scenic highway in 1955 after 1954 new york state thruway opened from buffalo to new york city michigan officials encouraged ontario to bypass

late 1980s but took over a decade to reach fruition by 2000 this was followed shortly thereafter by widening of highway through ajax and a new interchange at pickering beach road renamed salem road and stevenson road 1990s also saw first step in widening highway to six lanes from toronto to london a project in mid 1990s brought highway up to a minimum of six lanes between highway 8 in kitchener and highway 35 115 in newcastle other projects prepared sections for eventual widening in 1993 stretch of highway 401 eastbound near milton and westbound near whitby had chevrons painted in each lane in an effort to reduce tailgating a concept borrowed from france and britain signs advised motorists to keep at least two chevrons apart in essence warning them not to follow too closely some of these chevrons remained intact in westbound lanes in whitby until 2012 though signs stating their use had been removed beginning in 1998 several projects were initiated on highway 401 within toronto these included addition of one lane through highway 427 interchange in 2005 as well as resurfacing of pavement through city advantage i 75 between june 1990 and 1998 highway 401 and interstate 75 were used for a pilot project named advantage i 75 to test reliability and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks termed macs mainline automated clearance system it allows a truck to travel from florida to ontario without a second inspection macs was initially tested at two truck inspection stations in kentucky with transponders installed in 220 trucks exact time date location weight and axle data were logged as a truck approached an equipped station following initial tests macs was deployed at every inspection station along i 75 from miami to detroit and along highway 401 from windsor to belleville in 1994 project demonstrated effectiveness of electronic systems in enforcing freight restrictions without delaying vehicles while alleviating security fears such systems
