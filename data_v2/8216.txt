known as divided bridge was a road bridge which crossed river thames at datchet from 1706 until it was demolished in 1848 it was situated on reach between old windsor lock and romney lock and linked windsor on berkshire bank to datchet on buckinghamshire side bridge replaced a ferry service which had operated at site since at least middle of 13th century first datchet bridge was a wooden bridge commissioned by queen anne as crossing was a convenient back way to windsor castle responsibility for upkeep and maintenance of crossing later passed to counties of berkshire and buckinghamshire over whose boundary bridge spanned there followed many decades of dispute between counties over who should pay for what this culminated in 1836 with each county deciding to build their own half in different materials and not touching in middle resulting crazy erection buckinghamshire s side in wood and berkshire s in iron known as divided bridge was demolished in 1848 and is only case on thames where an established bridge crossing site has completely disappeared background thumb 250px left alt a small wooden raft in middle of a river which runs through a flat rural landscape datchet mead and datchet ferry in 1686 with windsor castle in background datchet on north bank of river thames has existed as a settlement since before 990 but first recorded mention of a river crossing is in 1224 when henry iii gave john le a great oak with which to make a boat for passage of datchet in 1278 edward i paid for william of eton to a build a great barge for datchet ferry although crown had provided for vessels right to operate ferry and collect tolls sat with lord of manor of datchet this continued until 1680 when then lord of manor colonel andrew pitcairn wheeler sold manor of datchet to budd wase but kept back ferry rights which he subsequently mortgaged for ps1000 equivalent to ps today in 1699 wheeler wrote to william iii complaining that a wall built by king along windsor bank was adversely affecting ferry trade to settle complaint crown purchased ferry rights from colonel wheeler for ps7000 equivalent to ps today crossing was important to crown as road through datchet and across thames provided a convenient short route from london to windsor castle and ferry was much used by royalty and courtiers privy purse records show two payments from elizabeth of york to datchet ferryman in 1502 and similarly from princess mary in 1522 and her father henry viii between 1530 and 1532 in elias ashmole s account of 1520 procession of order of garter he describes how queen catherine after watching procession returned to windsor castle from colnbrook by way of fery next way to castle ferry however did not always provide a quick and efficient service in 1678 ferryman matthew hale received a formal rebuke from charles ii s secretary of state henry coventry for unduly delaying a royal messenger coventry warned hale in no uncertain terms despite coventry s warning royal dissatisfaction with inefficient service provided by hale family who by 1706 had kept ferry for over 150 years continued to grow this culminated in decision by queen anne to provide a fixed

just prior to its rebuilding in 1812 in 1706 a wooden bridge was built by order of queen anne to replace ferry between datchet buckinghamshire and windsor berkshire it was made of oak provided by surveyor general of woods south of trent edward wilcox who was ordered to fell sufficient non navy timber from royal forest for better convenience of our passage from our castle at windsor building work was supervised by surveyor general samuel travers and final cost was ps1000 equivalent to ps today better convenience of passage was further enhanced by queen anne s intimate friend sarah churchill duchess of marlborough and her husband first duke who then lived at langley and who had a carriage drive built from their house over bridge and on to windsor castle unlike upstream toll bridges at windsor and maidenhead crossing at datchet was toll free for both river and road and quickly became a popular crossing seeking compensation for loss of income on their bridges corporations of windsor and maidenhead made claims to treasury in 1708 windsor was granted an ex gratia payment of ps55 equivalent to ps today plus ps25 and ps20 to two tenants equivalent to ps and ps respectively maidenhead s complaint not made until 1714 was noted but no compensation paid bridge was initially maintained by crown which paid ps800 equivalent to ps today for repairs in 1737 and in 1770 replaced original all wood structure with a bridge of ten wooden arches on stone piers by 1794 bridge was absolutely dangerous for carriages to pass over it and a stone one was now in contemplation later same year central arches of new bridge collapsed during heavy flooding and king george iii deciding that he did not wish to finance rebuilding instead instated a temporary free ferry there followed many years of wrangling between crown and counties of berkshire and buckinghamshire over who should bear cost of building and maintenance of bridge as county boundary ran down centre of channel of thames thus cutting bridge in half matter was forced by intervention of john richards rector of datchet who was also a lawyer richards took legal action and resulting judgement from king s bench in 1809 was that two counties must equally share rebuilding costs a total of ps2 375 each equivalent to ps today counties forced to co operate built a new wooden bridge on old stone piers which was opened by queen charlotte and princess elizabeth on 4 december 1812 divided bridge thumb 250px right alt a ramshackle bridge with a cantilevered centre section crossing a river divided bridge in 1847 from berkshire bank co operation was short lived and arguments over maintenance started again in 1834 when buckinghamshire side needed repairs and berkshire refused to contribute lack of maintenance led to bridge collapsing once more in 1836 and counties came up with unique solution of each building their own half buckinghamshire decided to rebuild with wooden railings whilst berkshire built its half in iron suspended by chains kelly s directory of 1847 noted datchet is separated from windsor by river thames over which is a very singular bridge one half of it is kept in repair by county of bucks and other half by berks former has a wooden railing and latter an iron one suspended by chains but neither bucks nor berks sides touch each other even during building counties would not work together and had to be ordered by lord chancellor to proceed in such a manner as not to impede each other consequently when bridge was finished two sides did not touch in middle with berkshire s final span being cantilevered out from last berkshire stone pier thus needing no support from buckinghamshire side result was an unsatisfactory ungainly structure sarcastically noted on opening as having scarce a bridge upon river thames which surpasses it centre gap was apparent during divided bridge s whole lifetime and lacking structural integrity hideous monstrosity quickly became unsafe it was no wonder that when took his caravans across crazy erection elephant van broke through and beast in it nearly came to an untimely end dispute between counties was resolved once and for all in 1848 when windsor castle act 1848 decreed dismantling of divided bridge and building of two new road bridges victoria bridge slightly upstream and albert bridge slightly downstream both new bridges opened in 1851 once divided bridge was demolished old windsor to datchet road was rerouted over victoria bridge and berkshire side became part of private grounds of windsor castle this is only case on entire thames where
