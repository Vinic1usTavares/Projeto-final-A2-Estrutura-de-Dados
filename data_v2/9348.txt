a squadron of french royal navy setting sail from cap francais in 1782 expedition was part of a global naval war between france and great britain during american revolutionary war operating under secret orders from marquis de castries france s marine minister la perouse sailed from cap francais in may 1782 and arrived at prince of wales fort in early august that fort and york factory trading post both surrendered without a fight although some of furs stored at york were spirited away by a company ship that evaded french fleet many of british prisoners were put on a sloop and allowed to sail back to england men on la perouse s fleet which had sailed with minimal winter provisioning to maintain secrecy suffered hardships including scurvy and other diseases hudson s bay company finances suffered because of raid which also contributed to reductions in native population that did business with company background during a visit to france in late 1780 jean francois de galaup comte de la perouse a captain in french navy first proposed to charles pierre claret de fleurieu french minister of ports idea of an expedition against fur trading posts of hudson s bay company dunmore pp 130 133 france s marine minister marquis de castries and king louis xvi approved plan and castries issued la perouse secret orders that could override those of any fleet commander la perouse served under in event an opportunity presented itself for such an expedition idea was to organize a small fleet in secret and make as rapid as possible a journey north to hudson bay from either newport rhode island or boston massachusetts most northerly ports of north america open to french ships dunmore p 134 la perouse s duties during 1781 campaign season did not provide him with any chances to exercise his secret orders but aftermath of disastrous french loss in april 1782 battle of saintes did present an opportunity dunmore pp 134 148 france and spain had been planning an assault on jamaica but losses incurred during battle including capture of admiral paul comte de grasse and his flagship ville de paris led them to call off expedition dunmore p 148 la perouse on his arrival at cap francais after battle raised idea with de grasse s successor louis philippe de vaudreuil vaudreuil approved of plan and provided la perouse with three ships a ship of line sceptre 74 guns and frigates astree 38 and engageante 34 astree was under command of paul antoine fleuriot de langle and engageante was led by lieutenant andre charles de la jaille dunmore p 149 preparations for expedition were carried out secretly and in some haste since french were aware of short season in far north ships crews and most of their officers were not informed of fleet s destination and la perouse seeking to avoid all suspicion even avoided carrying cold weather clothing dunmore p 151 admiral vaudreuil recorded fleet s destination in his records as france with possible stops in newport or boston and langle and la jaille were given sealed orders to be opened only upon reaching latitude of nova scotia dunmore p 152 fleet took on 250 regular infantry from regiment 40 gunners four field guns and two mortars these troops were told they were being sent to supplement french army at newport after two weeks of preparation fleet sailed from cap francais on 31 may 1782 expedition thumb

bay fleet encountered company ship seahorse which was making sail for fort prince of wales la perouse sent one of frigates to chase her seahorse captain william cristopher suspecting from its behavior that french ship lacked good charts for bay escaped by a ruse he gave orders to have his sails furled as if he were preparing to anchor this prompted french captain believing shallow waters to lie ahead to drop his anchor once he had done so cristopher raised his sails and sped off before frenchman could raise anchor willson p 322 prince of wales fort on 8 august la perouse arrived at prince of wales fort an impressive but crumbling stone fortress that was defended by 39 civilians willson p 320 its governor samuel hearne surrendered fort without firing a shot when size of french force became evident next day he did so despite requests from some of his men to allow them to mow down french troops with heavy guns loaded with grapeshot newman p 275 after resupplying his ships and confiscating fort s guns french proceeded to loot premises according to hearne french took more than 7 500 beaver skins 4 000 marten pelts and 17 000 goose quills newman pp 276 277 they also spent two days trying to raze fort but were only able to destroy gun mounts and damage upper ramparts willson pp 321 322 many of prisoners were put aboard company sloop severn which had been anchored by fort others were taken aboard french ships and some were incorporated into french crews york factory la perouse then collected most of company s small boats and sailed for york factory a company outpost on a peninsula between hayes and nelson rivers on 11 august willson p 323 according to perouse s report he arrived in area about 5 leagues 15 miles 24 km from york on 20 august remembrancer p 363 fort s defenses faced hayes river where company ship king george was anchored and fast flowing hayes river would have made an approach there impractical in face of that opposition remembrancer p 364 thumb left upright a french military map showing french approach to york factory la perouse sailed into mouth of nelson river and moved troops to smaller company ships on 21 august to prepare an amphibious landing with plan of approaching fort from rear a distance of about newman p 277 he then proceeded with his engineer to take soundings in nelson river and discovered that due to its shallowness even smaller boats would have difficulty approaching firm land his small boat then became mired in mud by receding tide and was not freed until 3 am next morning captain langle then proposed to major rostaing commander of troops that they cross muddy shallows on foot this was agreed and troops then set out across shallows unknown to them conditions improved only marginally once land was reached and they spent next two days wading through bogs and muck to reach fort meanwhile la perouse returned to fleet because bad weather was threatening its safety both frigates lost their anchors when sharp rocks underwater cut through their cables in turbulent conditions remembrancer p 365 york factory was occupied by 60 white men and 12 indians when french ships were spotted governor humphrey marten loaded trade goods onto king george so they would not fall into french hands when french arrived on 24 august marten surrendered fort although la perouse sent a frigate after king george when she sailed off during night after fleet s arrival her captain jonathan fowler successfully eluded pursuit due to his superior knowledge of shallow waters of bay monthly chronicle of north country lore p 294 major rostaing took british of garrison prisoner destroyed what goods he could not take willson p 325 and burned wooden fort to ground tyrell p xxvii he was however careful to preserve a cache of supplies for use by indians who came to fort to trade these acts of kindness and others by la perouse in treatment of his captives brought him recognition from hearne louis xvi and british government thumb right upright samuel hearne governor at fort prince of wales la perouse did not learn of capitulation until 26 august and continuing bad weather and difficulties with frigates meant that he did not effect a junction with rostaing until 31 august terms of capitulation included surrender of fort severn another small outpost he chose not to go to fort severn on account of lateness of season and poor condition of his ships and men who were suffering from scurvy and other maladies during process of loading goods and supplies onto fleet five small boats overturned and 15 men drowned willson p 326 aftermath la perouse then began journey back to atlantic towing severn as far as cape resolution there she was cut loose to make her way back to england while la perouse sailed for cadiz with sceptre and engageante astree made sail for brest to deliver news of expedition s success to paris newman p de la societe de brest p 235 expedition took a tremendous toll on his ships crews by time ships returned to europe sceptre had only 60 men out of an original complement including land troops of almost 500 fit to work about 70 men died of scurvy engageante had suffered 15 deaths from scurvy and almost everyone was sick with one malady or another both ships had also suffered damage due to cold weather and battering by ice floes dunmore p 158 fleuriot de langle received a brevet promotion to capitaine de vaisseau upon his arrival in brest in late october levot p 703 according to company goods taken at prince of wales alone were worth more than ps14 000 and la perouse s raid so damaged company finances that it paid no dividends until 1786 dunmore p 156 when peace finally came with 1783 treaty of paris french agreed to compensate company for its losses raid did permanent damage to company s trading relationships chipewyans who traded with company suffered severely due to company s inability to provision them and to an ongoing smallpox epidemic that was ravaging indian populations throughout north america by some estimates chipewyans lost half their population company s inability to trade with them for two seasons drove many survivors to develop trading relationships with montreal newman p 279 neither hearne nor marten was sanctioned by company for surrendering both returned to their posts following year houston pp 56 84 when french took prince of wales fort they found samuel hearne s journal which la perouse claimed as a prize journal contained hearne s accounts of his explorations of northern reaches of north america and hearne pleaded with la perouse for its return request was granted on condition that journal be published whether hearne had intended to publish it anyway is unclear but by 1792 year of hearne s death he had prepared a manuscript and submitted it for publication it was published in 1795 as a journey from prince of wale s fort in hudson s bay to northern ocean houston p 84 la perouse was rewarded by king louis with a rise in pay of 800 livres exploit also drew popular acclaim in europe and north america dunmore p 159 his next major assignment was to lead a voyage of exploration into pacific ocean in 1785 dunmore p 180 his fleet in which fleuriot de langle served as second in command was last seen in vicinity of australia in spring 1788 although remnants of expedition have been found his fate is
