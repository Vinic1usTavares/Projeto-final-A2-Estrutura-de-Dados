set luther s original words and original melody both dating to 1524 and thus already 200 years old when bach wrote his cantata bach used a style that has been called archaic instruments include a choir of trombones doubling voices 1 in opening chorale fantasia ah god look down from heaven melody of chorale is sung by alto in long notes as a cantus firmus doubled by two oboes durr calls it an exemplary cantus firmus motet with each entrance of chorale tune prepared by fugal entrances of other voices on same theme instruments double voices with occasional exception of continuo john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 and recorded at saint denis in paris assumes that severe text caused bach to return to austere motet style which was already old fashioned 2 second movement is a secco recitative they teach vain false deceit which is opposed to god and his truth which changes to arioso for two lines that resemble words of chorale these lines are marked adagio and in them continuo plays in canon with voice 3 alto aria o god remove teachings that pervert your word is written in more modern concertante style with a solo violin as obbligato instrument playing lively figuration last line of text remains close to original and again bach quotes chorale tune 4 bass recitative wretched are confused is accompanied by strings it changes to arioso during middle section which lets god respond to pleas of sinners ich muss ihr helfer sein i must be their helper even in outer sections string writing enforces a certain rigidity of rhythm 5 tenor aria through fire silver is purified through cross word is verified is accompanied by a concerto of oboes and strings instruments are first silent in middle section but return for its transition to da capo with words be patient in cross bearing and distress gardiner notes that instrumental music suggests liquid movement or flow of molten metal and reminds of bach s interest in coins and precious metals and of contemporary alchemists in dresden trying to turn base metal to gold for august strong but making porcelain instead 6 closing chorale this god you would keep pure before this wicked race is a
