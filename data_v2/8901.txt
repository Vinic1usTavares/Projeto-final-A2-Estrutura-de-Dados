of canopus design in addition new design incorporated longer and thus more powerful main and secondary guns and an improved hull form these characteristics produced a ship with better armour

thumb starboard bow view of formidable hms formidable was laid down at portsmouth dockyard on 21 march 1898 and launched on 17 november 1898 she was at time of her launching very incomplete and she was launched primarily to clear slipway so construction could begin on battleship formidable was completed in september 1901 and was commissioned at portsmouth on 10 october for service in mediterranean fleet captain alexander william chisholm batten paid off hms resolution on 9 october and he and his crew turned over to formidable on following day in september 1902 she visited aegean

second fleet home fleet again at nore where she served until outbreak of war in august 1914 hard steaming during this service led to her developing serious machinery problems world war i at beginning of first world war formidable and 5th battle squadron were based at portland and assigned to channel fleet to defend english channel after covering safe transportation of british expeditionary force to france in august 1914 formidable took part in transportation of portsmouth marine battalion to ostend on 25 august on 14 november formidable and other ships of 5th battle squadron were rebased at

loss under command of vice admiral commanding channel fleet sir lewis bayly 5th battle squadron spent 31 december participating in gunnery exercises off isle of portland supported by light cruisers and squadron received no escort of destroyers for operation after exercises that night fleet remained at sea on patrol even though submarine activity had been reported in area visibility that night was good though sea was rough enough to make detection of a submarine difficult bayly suspected no danger from submarines and so steamed his ships in line ahead formation at a speed of formidable was last battleship in line followed only by two cruisers unknown to british german submarine stalked squadron while it was exercising all afternoon trying to find a suitable attack position at around 02 20 on 1 january 1915 u 24 launched a torpedo at formidable striking her on starboard side abreast of forward funnel formidables commander captain loxley hoped to save ship by bringing her close to shore other british ships were at that point unaware of what had happened but after formidable turned out of line topaze increased speed to determine what she was doing by time topaze closed with formidable twenty minutes later latter vessel had already taken on a list of 20 degrees to starboard and loxley had issued order to abandon ship men attempting to save vessel remained aboard and through counter flooding reduced list though formidable was by then very low in water at around 03 05 u 24 launched another torpedo at stricken formidable hitting her again on starboard side close to her bow topaze joined by diamond began rescue effort but heavy seas made it very difficult to bring men aboard formidable remained afloat for another hour and forty minutes and at 04 45 began to capsize and sink by bow she remained afloat with her stern in air for a few minutes before sinking loxley was last seen on bridge calmly overseeing evacuation of ship diamond picked up thirty seven officers and crew from water brixham trawler provident picked up 73 members of formidables crew from battleship s launch at around midday while formidables pinnace managed to reach lyme regis after 22 hours at sea saving another 47 men a total of 35 officers and 512 men were killed in sinking an inquiry from admiralty into sinking determined that risk of conducting training exercises in channel without destroyer protection was excessive and should not be continued bayly was relieved of command for failing to take adequate precautions against submarine attack thumb german u boat u 24 sinks
