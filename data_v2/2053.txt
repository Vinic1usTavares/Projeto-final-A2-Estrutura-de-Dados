ancient one ancient one demonstrates her power to strange revealing astral plane and other dimensions such as mirror dimension she reluctantly agrees to train strange whose arrogance and ambition remind her of kaecilius strange studies under ancient one and mordo and from ancient books in library that is now guarded by master wong strange learns that earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called sanctums in new york city london and hong kong which are all connected and accessible from kamar taj sorcerers task is to protect sanctums though pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again strange progresses quickly and secretly reads text from which kaecilius stole pages learning to bend time with mystical

scene mordo confronts pangborn and steals mystical energy he uses to walk telling him that earth has too many sorcerers cast thumb left to right cumberbatch derrickson swinton mcadams ejiofor mikkelsen and wong at 2016 san diego comic con benedict cumberbatch as dr stephen strange a neurosurgeon who after a car crash that led to a journey of healing discovers hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions cumberbatch described strange as arrogant with film about him going from a place where he thinks he knows it all to realizing he knows nothing he compared character to version of sherlock holmes that he portrays in sherlock calling both characters intelligent and having of same colors film s mysticism resonated with cumberbatch for whom spirituality has been important since he spent his gap year teaching english at a tibetan buddhist monastery in darjeeling india strange s abilities in film include casting spells with tongue twisty fun names creating mandalas of light for shields and weapons and creating portals for quick travel around world strange is also aided by a cloak of levitation for flight and eye of agamotto a relic containing an infinity stone that can manipulate time cumberbatch took great care in defining physical movements and gestures for spells knowing that they would be noted and studied by fans he described these gestures as balletic and very dynamic and received help with finger tutting movements from dancer chiwetel ejiofor as karl mordo a master of mystic arts close to ancient one and a mentor to strange this version of mordo is a combination of different characters from doctor strange mythos and unlike in comics is not introduced as villainous ejiofor noted this calling mordo a very complex character that really i don t think can be nailed down either way director scott derrickson added that change in character stemmed from casting ejiofor and conversations director had with him ejiofor described mordo s relationship with ancient one as long and intense while noting a growing respect between character and strange until things get complicated derrickson felt mordo was a fundamentalist saying when someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code process of breaking out of that is a violent one he becomes disillusioned with ancient one s moral contradictions difference is strange can accept that contradiction mordo cannot cope with it which leads to antagonism between mordo and strange to explore in future films discussing diversity of film s cast when addressing controversial casting of characters ancient one and wong derrickson was confident that decision to cast ejiofor as mordo and thus changing character from white to black was right one to make rachel mcadams as christine palmer an emergency surgeon initially written as a love interest for strange but shortly before filming derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming out other side of it as friends mcadams described this dynamic by saying love is between them no matter what stage they re at in actual relationship with this change in characterization producer kevin feige described palmer as a lynchpin to strange s old life once he steps into role of a sorcerer she is someone he connects with at beginning and reconnects with and helps anchor his humanity he explained that having this character be a connection to strange s life in new york city in normal world after his journey was important to studio which is why palmer was chosen for character over more prominent but more fantastical character clea palmer is also known as hero night nurse in comics a storyline that does not play into film but that feige hinted could be explored in future films rosario dawson portrays another night nurse character claire temple in marvel s netflix television series benedict wong as wong a master of mystic arts tasked with protecting some of kamar taj s most valuable relics and books character is depicted in comics as strange s asian tea making manservant a racial stereotype that derrickson did not want in film and so character was not included in film s script after non asian actress tilda swinton was cast as other significant asian character from doctor strange comics ancient one which was also done to avoid comics racial stereotypes derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include wong in film character as he ultimately appears is completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn t fall into any of stereotypes of comics which derrickson was pleased gave an asian character a strong presence in movie actor wong was also pleased with changes made to character and described him as a drill sergeant to kamar taj rather than a manservant he does not practice martial arts in film avoiding another racial stereotype derrickson added that wong will have a strong presence in marvel cinematic universe moving forward michael stuhlbarg as nicodemus west a rival surgeon to strange benjamin bratt as jonathan pangborn a paraplegic who learned from ancient one how to heal himself through mystic arts scott adkins as lucian one of kaecilius followers mads mikkelsen as kaecilius a master of mystic arts who broke away from ancient one a combination of several antagonists from comics kaecilius was used in film to drive introduction and development of bigger villains for future including certain individuals who live in other dimensions derrickson compared this dynamic to that of saruman and sauron in lord of rings giving film a huge and fantastical villain like sauron but also having human with kaecilius like saruman for strange to face throughout film derrickson admitted that marvel s villains are often criticized and noted that mcu films dedicate little time to developing antagonists for doctor strange he just hoped to show kaecilius s point of view and what makes him tick in time that he could feeling that character is a man of ideas with watertight logic like john doe from seven and joker from dark knight on these motivations feige explained that kaecilius believes ancient one is a hypocrite protecting her own power base and that world may be better off if we were to allow some of these other things through mikkelsen s makeup took between 2 3 hours to apply tilda swinton as ancient one a celtic mystic who becomes strange s mentor character in comics is a tibetan man a situation which co writer c robert cargill compared to kobayashi maru an unwinnable training exercise in star trek universe he explained that adapting character as comics portrayed him would be realizing major asian fu manchu stereotype and would involve film with tibetan sovereignty debate but not giving one of few significant asian roles to an asian actor would also understandably be received negatively derrickson wanted to change character to an asian woman but felt that an older asian woman would invoke dragon lady stereotype while a younger asian woman would be perceived as exploiting asian fetish and a fanboy s dream girl to avoid character filling any of those three stereotypes or enabling stereotype of a western character coming to asia to learn about being asian derrickson decided to cast a non asian actor in role but to still take opportunity to cast an amazing actress in a male role feeling that swinton was obvious choice to play domineering secretive ethereal enigmatic and mystical derrickson wrote ancient one in film specifically for actress before she was offered role additionally though film uses terms her and she swinton chose to portray character as androgynous while feige explained that ancient one and sorcerer supreme are mantles in film held by multiple characters through time so a more comic accurate ancient one could exist within mcu still swinton s casting was widely criticized as whitewashing in response to this derrickson said that though he was pleased with diversity of film s cast in terms of both gender and ethnicity asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in american cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change what i did was lesser of two evils but it is still an evil cumberbatch also portrays uncredited villainous entity dormammu actor suggested he take on role to derrickson feeling that having character be a horrific reflection of strange would work better than just being a big ghoulish monster director agreed elaborating that casting implies that dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension and so is simply imitating strange for their confrontation to create character cumberbatch provided motion capture reference for visual effects team and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited british actor whom derrickson described as having a very deep voice producers also had tony todd record voice over for dormammu as an alternative to cumberbatch but ultimately decided on using cumberbatch for voice chris hemsworth reprises his role of thor from previous mcu films in film s mid credits scene additionally linda louise duan appears unnamed as tina minoru mark anthony brighton portrays daniel drumm and topo portrays hamir all masters of mystic arts under ancient one latter is based on hamir hermit wong s father in comics who was ancient one s personal manservant character is neither a manservant nor wong s father in film zara phythian alaa safi and katrina durden portray zealots under kaecilius and pat kiernan appears as himself doctor strange co creator stan lee makes a cameo appearance as a bus rider reading aldous huxley s doors of perception amy landecker was cast as anesthesiologist bruner but majority of her role was cut from finished film production development a film based on marvel comics character doctor strange was initially listed as being in development at new world pictures with a script dated january 21 1986 by bob gale for unknown reasons gale s film never went further into production by 1989 alex cox had co written a script with doctor strange co creator stan lee script had character traveling to fourth dimension before facing villain dormammu on easter island chile a film using this script was almost made by regency but company s films were distributed by warner bros at time which was in a dispute with marvel over merchandising by december 1992 wes craven had signed to write and direct doctor strange for release in either 1994 or 1995 with savoy pictures distributing in 1995 david s goyer had completed a script for film by april 1997 columbia pictures had purchased film rights and jeff welch was working on a new screenplay with bernie brillstein and brad grey producing by april 2000 columbia dropped doctor strange which then had michael france attached to write a script and interest from chuck russell and stephen norrington to direct by june 2001 dimension films acquired film rights with goyer back on board as writer and director goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of murder mysteries and promised not to be highly dependent on computer generated imagery however by august 2001 miramax acquired film rights from dimension and by march 2002 goyer had dropped out of project a 2005 release date was announced next march while in june 2004 a script still had yet to be written marvel studios ceo avi arad stated we are nowhere with that that s a tough one to write but we are working on it we are trying to find real jerry garcia of writing community in april 2005 paramount pictures acquired doctor strange from miramax as part of marvel studios attempt to independently produce their own films at time film was projected to have a budget of no more than 165 million in 2007 guillermo del toro and neil gaiman pitched a version of film to marvel with gaiman writing and del toro directing gaiman was especially interested in including character clea but studio was not interested in march 2009 marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser known properties including doctor strange in june 2010 marvel studios hired thomas dean donnelly and joshua oppenheimer to write doctor strange while promoting transformers dark of moon in april 2011 actor patrick dempsey indicated he was lobbying to play title character in january 2013 marvel studios president kevin feige confirmed that doctor strange would appear in some capacity as part of phase three of marvel cinematic universe feige then reiterated that a doctor strange feature film was in development at marvel studios that may and again in november in february 2014 hollywood reporter wrote that marvel was considering mark andrews jonathan levine nikolaj and dean israelite to direct film and was considering jonathan aibel and glenn berger to rewrite film s script feige denied this report but confirmed that marvel was considering prospective candidates by march marvel was considering andrews levine and scott derrickson to direct film pre production in june 2014 derrickson was chosen to direct film he had written a 12 page scene for film featuring strange and an assailant fighting in astral plane while a doctor attempts to save strange s physical body in a hospital based on a sequence from comic doctor strange oath derrickson illustrated sequence with his own concept art alongside storyboards from professional artists and an animatic which he presented in a 90 minute pitch to studio this cost derrickson an obnoxious amount of his own money but he felt it necessary to prove that i wanted job more than anyone especially after marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct doctor strange than any of their other films derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with marvel for film after he was hired marvel bought 12 page scene from derrickson and it became one of film s main set pieces on transitioning from horror films to a superhero film derrickson said it was nice to work on something more positive and not have my headspace in something so dark for so long but it was also weirdly similar because of fantastical nature of movie in his horror films derrickson tried to use real characters and real character drama played by good actors to encounter fantastical and so he wanted actors of same high caliber for doctor strange through which he could introduce more fantastical elements to mcu derrickson and marvel had originally discussed him writing film alongside his sinister co writer c robert cargill with derrickson also directing but marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of july 2016 if derrickson filled both roles when derrickson was chosen as director marvel passed on cargill as an individual writer with jon spaihts hired to rewrite script instead spaihts a big fan of doctor strange as a child had started pestering marvel as soon as he read reports of company searching for a director for film this eventually led to him meeting with studio before they actually began looking for writers for film spaihts said that they talked all afternoon and fit was right but he received a call from marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take film in same direction as spaihts and were going to look at other writers spaihts told his agent to not take that answer call them back tell them there s a lot of right answers and get me back in room and after talking with marvel for another three or four hours he was given job marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for film derrickson was already hired when spaihts joined and pair spent several months working on film s story with feige and executive producer stephen broussard they started writing film from beginning and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story or if it would begin with strange already as a fully formed sorcerer spaihts ultimately felt that origin story of this character as depicted in comics is so operatic and beautiful and so tragic and epic in its sweep that it was unavoidable we had to tell that story and tell our best version of it elements from spaihts early drafts that he later stated were still in final film include many of film s set pieces such as climactic battle which came straight from derrickson as well as little things from spaihts like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a nepalese temple derrickson wanted nightmare to be film s antagonist along with concept of nightmares themselves as being a dimension but feige felt getting across idea of dream dimension as another dimension would have been challenging alongside everything else that film introduces dormammu most present villain in comics became film s main villain during early development process marvel derrickson and spaihts all envisioned benedict cumberbatch playing title role by end of june marvel had reportedly been looking at tom hardy and jared leto for film s lead as well while edgar ramirez who worked with derrickson on 2014 s deliver us from evil had discussed a possible role with director in july after fans and media had also championed cumberbatch for role of doctor strange actor explained at 2014 san diego comic con international that he would be unable to accept role due to commitments to other projects feige stated that a lead actor would be announced relatively quickly and by end of that month joaquin phoenix entered talks to play character by september 2014 marvel studios was in negotiations to shoot doctor strange at pinewood shepperton in uk with crews being assembled for a move into shepperton studios in late 2014 early 2015 for filming in may 2015 negotiations with phoenix ended in october 2014 as actor felt that blockbuster films would never be fulfilling with too many requirements that went against his instincts for character marvel then placed leto ethan hawke oscar isaac ewan mcgregor matthew mcconaughey jake gyllenhaal colin farrell and keanu reeves on their shortlist for character ryan gosling also had discussions to play character while reeves was not approached about role and cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention in october cumberbatch entered negotiations to play character and was officially cast in december feige explained that marvel had kept returning to him for role while considering other actors with derrickson noting that even during discussions with phoenix he and marvel still wanted to cast cumberbatch in role company eventually decided to change film s production schedule to fit around cumberbatch s commitments allowing him to join project thumb left upright derrickson promoting doctor strange at 2016 san diego comic con with film s new production schedule its intended release date was pushed back to november 2016 and derrickson was able to do some work on script himself he brought cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned describing film cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film saying it s a very magical fantasy universe but at same time it plays by some of superhero tropes that people enjoy spaihts returned later in process to do some more writing and help bring movie home and said he was delighted by work that derrickson and cargill had done in interim feige and derrickson have noted that in addition to oath and steve ditko s original work on doctor strange an influence on all film s writers was doctor strange comic book into in january 2015 chiwetel ejiofor entered preliminary talks with marvel for a role in film later revealed to be baron mordo ejiofor s role was confirmed during 2015 d23 expo in april derrickson and members of production team visited new york city to scout potential filming locations while feige revealed that filming would begin that november a month later tilda swinton was in talks to play ancient one in june 2015 derrickson announced that he was going to london to begin work on film and feige confirmed that strange s sanctum sanctorum would appear located on bleecker street in new york city s greenwich village as in comics swinton confirmed her role in film in july when rachel mcadams was being considered for female lead mcadams cautioned that it s still super early and i don t know where that s gonna go if it s gonna go anywhere at all but she ultimately confirmed her role during 2015 toronto international film festival mads mikkelsen entered into early negotiations to play a villain in august one of a number of actors being considered for unspecified role in september 2015 guardians of galaxy director james gunn stated that many of crew that worked on that film were unable to return for its sequel because they had committed to doctor strange derrickson also revealed that gunn had provided notes on script beyond general conversing mcu directors have between themselves for their films at end of month feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made before end of year and by early november michael stuhlbarg entered negotiations to appear in film as nicodemus west a rival of strange derrickson had offered role to stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with actor and he agreed to join cast after reading some doctor strange comics and being drawn to character s guilt ridden arc where west blames himself for ruining surgery on strange s hands and robbing him of his ability to operate feige felt that visuals of film needed to be a ditko kubrick miyazaki matrix mind trip and said that you don t get into it in harry potter but if a scientist went to hogwarts he d find out how some of that stuff is happening we re not going to spend a lot of time on that but there will be some of that and particularly for a character like strange who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds in developing film s magic derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat representation of magic from previous films like fantasia and harry potter wanting to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal and to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that feige called doctor strange doorway into supernatural side of mcu a role that derrickson noted was also served by character in early comics when doctor strange comics broke open marvel comic book universe into marvel multiverse discussing portrayal of other dimensions in film feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like comics earth 616 and earth 617 but would instead feature dimensions that are so mind bending that you can barely perceive them like astral plane dark dimension and mirror dimension astrophysicist adam frank served as a scientific consultant on film having already known derrickson and been a marvel fan since childhood frank advised on human experience of space and time helping marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs whether they were materialist rationalist reductionist or had this enlarged perspective he noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas but do appear to appreciate that amazing things happen from science so by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible but to allow that science to open up new possibilities people are used to that in their lives so i think it makes sense to them and it s exciting to them this was an aspect of previous mcu films that frank called a great thing speaking as a scientist saying that they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them filming principal photography began in nepal on november 4 2015 under working title checkmate ben davis serving as cinematographer for film after doing same on guardians of galaxy and avengers age of ultron described doctor strange as marvel s fantasia and noted that a lot of previsualization was required to figure out how to shoot psychedelic m c escher inspired imagery davis used arri alexa 65 camera for film along with arri alexa xt plus vision research phantom flex which shoot up to 1000 fps were used for high speed sequences like strange s car crash thumb cumberbatch filming doctor strange in kathmandu november 2015 derrickson chose nepal as a location to feature an eastern city that would not be familiar to most audiences after scouting and deciding on locations in country many of those areas were destroyed by april 2015 nepal earthquake rather than choosing another country derrickson and cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to nepal following event was all more reason to shoot there cumberbatch said that shooting in nepal was absolutely vital to this film i think not least because it s so based in something that is exotic it was a magical way to start shoot it s important to a film like this which has a profound into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension that portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous eventual filming locations around kathmandu valley included and temples and new road in kathmandu and patan durbar square in patan production moved to longcross studios in uk on november 11 and was scheduled to stay there until march 2016 real kathmandu street that led into fictional kamar taj courtyard was replicated at longcross which production designer charles wood described as very hard because kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it s steeped in history to transition from that level of detail and history with shape of streets warping of buildings these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles was a real challenge for authenticity set was dressed with real food and populated with dogs pigeons and nepalese extras many of whom were relatives of people who live on real kathmandu street inside of kamar taj was also constructed at longcross with sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke exotic feel of ancient sanctuary wood s goal was to make set feel like ancient one and her disciples actually lived there and give it a truly spiritual truly magical feel while integrating it into a real building that production filmed in kathmandu this and kathmandu street were two of twenty one sets that crew built at longcross others included doctor strange s sanctum sanctorum and a hong kong street complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep rain out filming also took place in hong kong and in new york city s hell s kitchen neighborhood additional new york city set scenes were shot at shepperton studios and later in london by end of november casting of mikkelsen and stuhlbarg was confirmed alongside amy landecker and scott adkins in unspecified roles additionally benedict wong heard about film from his friend ejiofor and sought a role in it himself he was cast as wong in january and immediately joined production for filming lamborghini provided six huracan lp 610 4s for use in film one of which production wrecked during filming lamborghini said that they felt there are a lot of characteristics of doctor strange that are connected with lamborghini philosophy lamborghini crash scene was filmed at northfleet kent by river thames also in january 2016 filming took place at exeter college oxford next month feige revealed that film originally had a prologue that took place in cern due to real world research being done at facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes production moved to new york city s flatiron district in april where set photos revealed that zara phythian had joined cast principal photography wrapped in new york city on april 3 2016 post production in june 2016 a diamond select toys press release for doctor strange toys in their marvel line named mikkelsen s character kaecilius and mcadams character christine palmer mikkelsen s role was confirmed in an official tie in comic for film while mcadams was confirmed at san diego comic con 2016 additionally benjamin bratt was revealed to have been cast as jonathan pangborn adkins role was revealed to be lucian a follower of kaecilius and landecker s role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist dr bruner latter was mostly cut from film with landecker explaining that she had been cast in small role for two scenes at beginning of film because derrickson was a fan of her performance in a serious man which also starred stuhlbarg after filming her first scene in which she assists strange with a surgery landecker asked not to be involved in other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind and instead wished to attend a special premiere at white house for her series transparent actress believed she was later cut from first scene but she is still credited for a brief appearance also derrickson revealed that lulu wilson had been cast as strange s sister for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age scene had been shot and derrickson thought it was great as a self contained scene but it didn t work with rest of film and was cut also at san diego comic con derrickson noted that there were still a couple pickup shoots to do for film to clarify logic further content for film s training sequence was also shot during these reshoots as early test audiences loved training portion of film and wanted more wong indicated that reshoots had been completed in august dan harmon wrote material for these additional scenes which derrickson described as script analysis and dialogue work not enough to receive credit in film feige said that in addition to any humor that harmon could add to film he was brought on to give us his opinions on sci fi concepts before film s sets were demolished thor ragnarok director taika waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring strange meeting chris hemsworth s thor scene was for ragnarok and shot before that film began production derrickson and marvel felt scene was kind of perfect to show strange joining wider mcu after his stand alone introduction and so added it to doctor strange as a mid credits scene a post credits scene directed by derrickson teases mordo s role as an antagonist to strange in a potential doctor strange sequel stan lee s cameo in film was directed by gunn on set of guardians of galaxy vol 2 this was alongside several other lee cameos to limit amount of travel he had to do for next four mcu films gunn contacted derrickson during shoot to ensure that shot matched up with respective doctor strange scene and kept throwing lines at lee on day to give derrickson and marvel plenty of options to choose from for film additional options gunn filmed included lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what word excelsior meant lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason being totally crazy and lee laughing hysterically at a garfield book noting how character hates mondays but he loves lasagna gunn felt garfield option was originally meant to appear in final version of film but ended up being too long for scene by october 10 2016 derrickson had completed film feige described film s use of 3d as serving storytelling saying hopefully it helps bend people s minds even more than with just flat screen he said that there are sequences of film that 3d is actually necessary to tell dimensional story that is happening through visuals however he noted that during visual effects reviews for film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting story when viewed in 2d which necessitated adjustments so sequences would work in all formats over one hour of footage in film was specially formatted for imax visual effects visual effects for doctor strange were provided by industrial light magic ilm method studios framestore lola vfx luma pictures rise fx crafty apes and contributing to 1450 effects shots previsualization was handled by third floor all vendors worked on common magical elements mandalas magical runes shields whips stalks and aerial lily pads and portals visual effects supervisor stephane ceretti who also worked on guardians of galaxy explained similarities and differences between two films saying there s some resemblance in some of things that we ve done in same way it s a totally different world in guardians it s more sci fi oriented and crazy colors more of a comedy kind of take on things as well this one is a little bit more serious it s also a little bit more trippy we use very different techniques actually guardians was also for us a huge animation film this one was less of it this one was more about environments and effects further discussing film s visuals derrickson described influences as steve ditko stan lee comics which were all about these weird visuals as well as a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and m c escher additional inspiration for film s visuals came from a bunch of experimental fractal videos from youtube that derrickson found and mobile video game monument valley derrickson s ambition was to use cutting edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new to not just blow things up feige explained that one of more difficult areas to be inventive was action sequences as derrickson did not want them to simply be someone shoots a bolt of lightning and someone blocks a ball of lightning so someone throws another bolt of lightning instead they tried to incorporate use of different dimensions into action in interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we ve seen in any other movies on film s set pieces derrickson reiterated that film s astral fight scene was based on oath comic while adding that end fight was an attempt to capture quality of that artwork from original comics and mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take inception to nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther but i certainly owe something to that movie specifically for climax of film derrickson wanted to play on superhero trope of a big fight scene where they re tearing up a city and there s a portal opening up and they have to close it subverting it by having villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing which cgi thing can hit other cgi thing harder thumb left manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen top with visual effects added by ilm bottom ilm worked on folding manhattan mirror sequence chosen because of their work creating a digital new york in avengers and time fight sequence in hong kong which consisted of 200 and 150 shots respectively they began work on film 10 months before filming began to plan out manhattan sequence it was mainly cgi though some new york location shots were used sequence was mainly handled by ilm s san francisco and vancouver offices hong kong time sequence was done mainly by ilm s london office ilm also created digital doubles for many of actors which were shared with other vendors method studios who worked on quantum realm in ant man worked on magical mystery tour sequence with strange hurtling through various dimensions sequence was handled by method s los angeles studio with their vancouver studio contributing opening shot of sequence only shot method did not work on in sequence was one that linked to dormammu as luma pictures assisted in his creation they handled his other appearances in film method created 7 dimensions for sequence initial wormhole to speaker cone world fractals of soft solid world a version of quantum realm strange falling through his own eye and cosmic scream dark dimension and shape shifting realm shape shifting realm originally had strange morphing and changing shape but that was ultimately removed as derrickson felt audience needed to see cumberbatch method s vancouver studio created strange s car crash rooftop training and sequence in which strange experiments with time on an apple in kamar taj library car crash blended high speed photography and some green screen sequences with digital assets for both cumberbatch and car in total method worked on 270 effects shots framestore was chosen to work on cloak of levitation due to their work creating rocket in guardians of galaxy ceretti called cloak s actions kind of scripted but not as deeply as end result and said that during pre visualization process we had a big discussion about arc of story of cloak in film framestore also worked on environment shots mandelbrot set sequences high resolution digital doubles astral form and crimson bands of cyttorak restraint for kaecilius totaling over 365 shots alexis framestore s cg supervisor called astral form one of hardest effects we ve had to deal with at framestore finding right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful lola vfx worked on zealots eyes supplementing make up work with effects based on a they also created digital tears for kaecilius when he is in crimson bands of cyttorak in addition to dormammu and dark dimension luma pictures also created first mirror sequence at beginning of film in creating dormammu ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid fiery head look from comics as it had been done before whole idea is he s a character that lives in between dimensions he can also take whatever shapes he wants to take when he is talking to strange you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff these kind of opening windows to other dimensions and all reflective qualities of it we really wanted to add evocation of that fire but we didn t want to do fire so we went for a multicolored approach to try and keep psychedelic look of entire space on dark dimension ceretti said we tried to make it alive all time whole idea of dark dimension is that it s a dynamic environment with luma team referencing ditko art and a poster that when lit with a blacklight it becomes very saturated with colors crazy blacklight colors he continued it was all about finding right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute work of steve ditko but to make it more current to 21st century if you look at detail of shapes that we have in dark dimension you can almost point to things in comic books that we really tried to be faithful to music in may 2016 michael giacchino revealed that he would score film derrickson called score magic in literal sense of word adding giacchino is doing what good scorers do which is he is not just creating music that supports images he s adding a third thing to movie it becomes something new with his music in there that it didn t have with temp music score was recorded at abbey road studios during a recording session paul mccartney heard one of giacchino s cues being recorded and likened it to beatles song i am walrus derrickson a bob dylan fan looked for a place in film to include one of his songs but could not find one however he was able to include song interstellar overdrive by pink floyd derrickson had hoped to use either interstellar overdrive or jimi hendrix experience s are you experienced for film s credits but royalties to use either in credits were too expensive resulting in giacchino creating track master of mystic end credits a soundtrack album from hollywood records was released digitally on october 21 2016 with a physical release on november 18 2016 marketing in august 2015 a concept art trailer narrated by derrickson was shown at d23 expo images showed artwork of cumberbatch in a traditional doctor strange outfit from comics as well as a rough sequence of plot highlighting points such as strange s car crash his journey for healing and fighting ejiofor as mordo before character was moved away from a villainous role in film per discussions between derrickson and actor trailer was met with a very big reaction from gathered crowd on april 12 2016 first teaser trailer for film debuted on jimmy kimmel live clark collis of entertainment weekly compared series of kaleidoscopic world bending scenes featured in trailer to film inception as did scott mendelson of forbes forbes added that structure of trailer resembled early marketing for film batman begins hollywood reporters graeme mcmillian criticised these similarities as well as similarities to matrix and between cumberbatch s american accent and that of hugh laurie s gregory house from house calling them not necessarily a real problem of course but there s nothing there outside derivative aspects due to nature of trailer there s no story beyond white man finds enlightenment in asia trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe performances will elevate material mcmillian did enjoy visual effects and visual of tilda swinton literally knock ing benedict cumberbatch s soul out of his body but concluded as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for marvel but a potential new genre this feels far less bold and assured than first trailer for guardians of galaxy in july 2016 marvel comics released a prelude tie in comic written by will corona pilgrim with art by jorge fornes issue sees four masters of mystic arts kaecilius wong tina minoru and daniel drumm pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic a second issue centered on ancient one training apprentices in magical arts at kamar taj was released a

ancient one sends strange on his first trippy tour through multiverse was where imax 3d really shines audience is given an incredible visual tour of multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities it really is something to behold in imax 3d concluding that after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage imax 3d is definitive format to see film britt hayes for screen crush felt footage was dizzying and far weirder and wilder than trailers are letting on though felt it was a bit difficult to judge some of what was shown out of context especially earlier scenes regarding same sequence where ancient one sends strange through multiverse hayes said seth rogen s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on psychedelic visuals employed here it s astounding elaborate stuff and easily provides most entertaining moments in footage ign s terri schwartz said sequences shown were where derrickson s horror aesthetics shine through marvel provided twitter

critical response review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reports an 89 approval rating with an average score of 7 3 10 based on 358 reviews website s critical consensus reads doctor strange artfully balances its outre source material against blockbuster constraints of mcu delivering a thoroughly entertaining superhero origin story in bargain on metacritic film holds a score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 49 critics indicating generally favorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale while posttrak reported filmgoers gave it a 91 overall positive score and a 73 definite recommend hollywood reporters todd mccarthy called doctor strange an engaging smartly cast and sporadically eye popping addition to franchise adding this action movie ostensibly rooted in mind expanding tenets of eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside blockbuster combine s established money machines mccarthy in addition to praising acting felt that there were certain sequences that go far beyond inception in visual spectacle and that time manipulation sequences seen to outstanding advantage in 3d were what mind trip seeking audiences back in doctor strange s origin days would have called far out but today s fans will simply deem amazing peter debruge of variety called film marvel s most satisfying entry since spider man 2 and wrote that despite having same look feel and fancy corporate sheen as other mcu films it boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from increasingly cookie cutter comic book realm of late debruge also praised casting along with multitude of visual effects film was able to achieve alonso duralde reviewing for thewrap said true doctor strange is an origin story and occasionally hemmed in by genre s narrative requirements but it s smart enough to bring in great british actors to make predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating regarding film s visuals duralde praised them exclaiming in a year where bloated empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of cg fatigue this funny freaky adventure reminds us of how effective vfx can be when they ve got some imagination behind them manohla dargis of new york times said giddily enjoyable doctor strange is part of marvel s strategy for world domination yet it s also so visually transfixing so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget brand justin chang of los angeles times said within familiar narrative contours of origin story writer director scott derrickson in enough out of body experiences spatial temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you wonder if he and his co writers were dropping acid behind scenes conversely angelica jade bastien writing for rogerebert com said for all of its wondrous world building and trippy effects doctor strange isn t evolutionary step forward for marvel that it needs to be storytelling wise underneath all of its improvements core narrative is something we ve seen countless times mara of us weekly called film joyless and wrote despite benedict cumberbatch s alluring powers he can t save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3 d special effect tricks nobody is having much fun here save for doctor s cloak of levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations rex reed of new york observer called doctor strange an awkwardly cliche riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality and said none of it makes any sense for characterization dialogue narrative arc acceptable acting and coherence go elsewhere adam graham of detroit news said cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in lead role but that s thing he s a better party guest than he is a host doctor strange is a fine introduction but by end you re not sad to be headed for door accolades year award category recipient s result 2016 evening standard british film

onto them for potential future films in october 2016 derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel saying i love character i love visual possibilities and i know comics so well first movie is tip of an iceberg there s so much progress that can be made he would like to follow example of dark knight and bring in a villain where you really got to go deep and have a more visceral experience cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more doctor strange solo film derrickson hoped to feature nightmare in a potential sequel and expressed interest in further exploring characters jonathan pangborn and hamir in a sequel after their smaller roles in first film he also explained that he is being kept in loop about how avengers films will use strange because of his
