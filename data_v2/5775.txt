as first and sixth post colonial governor of virginia from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786 henry was born in hanover county virginia and was for most part educated at home after an unsuccessful venture running a store and assisting his father in law at hanover tavern henry became a lawyer through self study beginning his practice in 1760 he soon became prominent through his victory in parson s cause against anglican clergy henry was elected to virginia house of burgesses where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against stamp act of 1765 in 1774 and 1775 henry served as a delegate to first and second continental congresses but did not prove particularly influential he gained further popularity among people of virginia both through his oratory at convention and by marching troops towards colonial capital of williamsburg after gunpowder incident until munitions seized by royal government were paid for henry urged independence and when fifth virginia convention endorsed this in 1776 served on committee charged with drafting virginia declaration of rights and original virginia constitution henry was promptly elected governor under new charter and served a total of five one year terms after leaving governorship in 1779 henry served in virginia house of delegates until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784 actions of national government under articles of confederation made henry fear a strong federal government and he declined appointment as a delegate to 1787 constitutional convention he actively opposed ratification of constitution he returned to practice of law in his final years declining several offices under federal government a slaveholder throughout his adult life he hoped to see institution end but had no plan for that beyond ending importation of slaves henry is remembered for his oratory and as an enthusiastic promoter of fight for independence early life and struggles 1736 1759 henry was born on family farm studley in hanover county in colony of virginia on may 29 1736 his father was john henry an immigrant from aberdeenshire scotland who had attended king s college university of aberdeen there before emigrating to virginia in 1720s settling in hanover county in about 1732 john henry married sarah winston syme a wealthy widow from a prominent local family of english ancestry patrick henry shared his name with his uncle an anglican minister and until elder patrick s death in 1777 often went as patrick henry jr henry attended a local school until about age of 10 there was then no academy in hanover county and he was tutored at home by his father young henry engaged in typical recreations of times such as music and dancing and was particularly fond of hunting since family s lands and slaves would for most part pass to his older half brother john syme jr henry needed to make his own way in world at age of 15 he became a clerk for a local merchant and a year later opened a store with his older brother william store was not successful religious revival known as great awakening reached virginia when henry was a child his father was staunchly anglican but his mother often took him to hear presbyterian preachers although henry remained a lifelong anglican communicant ministers such as samuel davies taught him that it is not enough to save one s own soul but one should help to save society he also learned that oratory should reach heart not just persuade based on reason his oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers seeking to reach people by speaking to them in their own language religion would play a key part in henry s life his father and namesake uncle were both devout and were both major influences in his life nevertheless he was uncomfortable with role of anglican church as established religion in virginia and fought for religious liberty throughout his career henry wrote to a group of baptists who had sent a letter of congratulations following henry s 1776 election as governor my earnest wish is that christian charity forbearance and love may unite all different as brethren he criticized his state of virginia feeling that slavery and lack of religious toleration had retarded its development he told virginia ratifying convention in 1788 that religion or duty which we owe to our creator and manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction not by force or violence and therefore all men have an equal natural and unalienable right to free exercise of religion according to dictates of conscience and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others thumb right view of rural plains near creek in virginia henry was reportedly married to sarah shelton in parlor in 1754 henry married sarah shelton reportedly in parlor of her family house rural plains it also became known as shelton house as a wedding gift her father gave couple six slaves and pine slash farm near mechanicsville pine slash was exhausted from earlier cultivations and henry worked with slaves to clear fresh fields latter half of 1750s were years of drought in virginia and after main house burned down henry gave up and moved to hanover tavern owned by sarah s father henry often served as host at hanover tavern as part of his duties and entertained guests by playing fiddle among those who stayed there during this time was young thomas jefferson aged 17 en route to his studies at college of william and mary and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with henry then despite their age difference of six years jefferson in 1824 told daniel webster patrick henry was originally a bar keeper a characterization that henry s biographers have found to be unfair that his position was more general than that and that main business of hanover tavern was serving travelers not alcohol william wirt henry s earliest biographer rejected jefferson s suggestion that henry s profession then was a bartender but noted it would have been very natural in mr henry s situation to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to revolutionary lawyer and politician 1760 1775 parson s cause while at hanover tavern henry found time to study law how long he did so is unclear he later said it was as little as a month on advice of a local lawyer henry in 1760 applied for a lawyer s license appearing before examiners prominent attorneys in colonial capital of williamsburg examiners were impressed by henry s mind even though his knowledge of legal procedures was scant he passed in april 1760 and he thereafter opened a practice appearing in courts of hanover and nearby counties droughts of 1750s had led to a rise in price of tobacco hard currency was scarce in virginia and salaries in colony were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco prior to drought price of tobacco had long been twopence per pound 0 45 kilograms and in 1755 and 1758 virginia house of burgesses elected lower house of colonial legislature passed two penny acts allowing debts expressed in tobacco to be paid at rate of twopence per pound for a limited period these included public officials including anglican clergy anglicanism was then virginia s established church and several ministers petitioned board of trade in london to overrule burgesses which it did five clergymen then brought suit for back pay cases known as parson s cause of them only reverend james maury was successful and a jury was to be empaneled in hanover county on december 1 1763 to fix damages henry was engaged as counsel by maury s parish vestry for this hearing patrick henry s father colonel john henry was presiding judge thumb left patrick henry arguing parson s cause by george cooke after evidence was presented proving facts at issue maury s counsel gave a speech in praise of clergy many of whom were in attendance henry responded with a one hour speech ignoring question of damages but which focused on unconstitutionality of veto of two penny act by king s government henry deemed any king who annulled good laws such as two penny act as a tyrant who forfeits all right to his subjects obedience and clergy by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief had shown themselves to be enemies of community opposing counsel accused henry of treason and some took up that cry but henry continued and judge did nothing to stop him henry urged jury to make an example of maury for benefit of any who might seek to imitate him and suggested jury return damages of one farthing jury was out for only moments and fixed damages at one penny henry was hailed as a hero according to biographer henry mayer henry had defined prerogatives of local elite by unorthodox means of mobilizing emotions of lower ranks of religious and political outsiders henry s popularity greatly increased and he added 164 new clients in year after parson s cause stamp act thumb upright patrick henry s treason speech before house of burgesses in an 1851 painting by peter f in wake of parson s cause henry began to gain a following in backwoods virginia because of his oratory defending liberties of common people and thanks to his friendly manner he boosted his standing further in 1764 by representing nathaniel west dandridge elected for hanover county in an election contest before burgesses dandridge was alleged to have bribed voters with drink a practice common but illegal henry is said to have made a brilliant speech in defense of rights of voters but text does not survive henry lost case but met influential members on committee of privileges and elections such as richard henry lee peyton randolph and george wythe in 1765 william johnson brother of thomas johnson who had been one of henry s clients in parson s cause resigned as burgess for louisa county as henry owned land in county acquired from his father to settle a loan he was eligible to be a candidate and he won seat in may 1765 he left immediately for williamsburg as session had already begun expense of seven years war 1756 1763 had nearly doubled britain s national debt and as much of war had taken place in and around north america british government looked for ways of directly taxing american colonies 1765 stamp act was both a means of raising revenue and one of asserting authority over colonies burgesses instructed their agent in london edward montague to oppose measure and other colonial legislatures similarly instructed their representatives considerable debate began over proposed measure and in virginia developed arguments henry had made in parson s cause patrick henry was sworn into a sleepy session of legislature on may 20 many of members had left town on about may 28 a ship arrived with an urgent letter from montague stamp act had passed on may 29 henry introduced virginia stamp act resolves first two resolutions affirmed that colonists had same rights and privileges as britons next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one s representatives fifth was most provocative as it named virginia legislature general assembly as representatives of virginia empowered to tax two other resolutions were offered though their authorship is uncertain edmund and helen morgan in their account of stamp act crisis suggested that henry acted as he saw stamp act as both a threat to virginians rights and an opportunity to advance himself politically there are no verbatim transcriptions of henry s speech in opposition to stamp act texts are reconstructions for most part based on recollections decades later by which time both speech and henry had become famous for example jefferson still in his studies at nearby college of william and mary recalled splendor of henry s oratory no attempt was made to reconstruct henry s words until 1790 when james madison wrote to former burgess edmund pendleton but madison learned that pendleton had not been present a second attempt did not occur until wirt began work on his biography of henry in 1805 a french traveler whose name is not known and whose journal was discovered in 1921 recorded at time of henry s speech that one of members stood up and said that he had read that in former times tarquin and julius had their brutus charles had his cromwell and he did not doubt but some good american would stand up in favour of his country as henry had seemingly called for killing of king george iii there were cries of treason in chamber including by speaker john robinson john tyler sr father of future president who was standing with jefferson as they watched session called this one of trying moments which is decisive of character and both recalled that henry did not waver if this be treason make most of it burgesses adopted first five resolutions two others which denied right of any other body but general assembly to tax virginians and which branded anyone who stated that parliament had that right an enemy of colony were not passed according to morgans passed resolutions differed little from language in petitions sent by burgesses to london in 1764 and opposition to henry may have been in part because he was an upstart in virginia politics on may 31 with henry absent and likely returning home burgesses expunged fifth resolution and royal governor francis fauquier refused to allow any of them to be printed in official newspaper virginia gazette with official texts of passed resolutions denied them newspapers in colonies and in britain printed all seven resolutions all of them presented as resolves of influential colony of virginia resolutions more radical as a group than what was actually passed reached britain by mid august first american reaction to passage of stamp act in north america they galvanized opposition to stamp act and made virginia leader in opposition to parliament s action according to thad tate in henry s american national biography article not only in virginia but across mainland british colonies henry quickly established his reputation as an uncompromising opponent of imperial policy morgans noted in virginia stamp act provided opportunity for patrick henry s spectacular entry into politics lawyer and landowner 1766 1773 fauquier dissolved burgesses on june 1 1765 hoping new elections would purge radicals but this proved not to be case as conservative leaders were instead voted out governor did not call burgesses into session until november 1766 by which time stamp act had been repealed by parliament preventing virginia from sending delegates to stamp act congress in new york henry s role in active resistance that took place in virginia against stamp act is uncertain although lack of a legislative session sidelined henry during crisis it also undermined established leaders of chamber who remained scattered through colony with little opportunity to confer as public rage for change grew hotter when burgesses eventually convened henry sometimes opposed colonial leaders but united with them against british policies in late 1760s and early 1770s henry spent more time concentrating on his personal affairs though he advanced in standing within burgesses serving on powerful committees henry family moved to a new house on his louisa county property probably in late 1765 and lived there until 1769 when he returned to hanover county his law practice remained strong until courts under royal authority closed in 1774 jefferson later complained that henry was lazy and ignorant in practice of law his sole talent trying cases before juries and accused henry of charging criminal defendants high fees to get them acquitted dickson campbell in her biography of henry found jefferson s comments unfounded that henry s rates were moderate for time and cited earlier historians as to henry s competence jefferson s comments came years after two once friends quarreled in 1769 henry was admitted to practice before general court of virginia in williamsburg a venue more prestigious than county courts henry invested some of his earnings in frontier lands in what is now western part of virginia as well as in present day west virginia and kentucky he claimed ownership though many of them were controlled by native americans and sought to get colonial and later state government to recognize his claims this was common among virginia s leading citizens such as george washington henry foresaw potential of ohio valley and was involved in schemes to found settlements income from land deals in 1771 enabled him to buy scotchtown a large plantation in hanover county which he purchased from john payne father of dolley madison she lived there for a brief time as a child scotchtown with 16 rooms was one of largest mansions in virginia owning estates such as henry s meant owning slaves henry was a slaveholder from time of his marriage at age of 18 despite this henry believed that slavery was wrong and hoped for its abolition but had no plan for doing so nor for multiracial society that would result for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in africa were realistic to re export them is now impracticable and sorry i am for it he wrote in 1773 i am master of slaves of my own purchase i am drawn along by general inconvenience of living here without them i will not i cannot justify it but number of slaves he owned increased over time and as a result of his second marriage in 1777 so that at his death in 1799 he owned 67 slaves henry and others sought to end their importation to virginia and succeeded in 1778 they assumed that in so doing they were fighting slavery but in generation after independence slave births greatly exceeded deaths and virginia became a source of slaves sold south in coastwise slave trade renewed involvement and first continental congress 1773 1775 in 1773 henry came into conflict with royal governor john murray 4th earl of dunmore governor appointed in 1771 had sent british soldiers to county to aid in apprehending a gang of counterfeiters once captured they were immediately taken to williamsburg for trial before general court ignoring precedent that judicial proceedings should begin in county where offense took place or where suspect was captured this was a sensitive matter especially because of recent gaspee affair in rhode island in which british sought to capture and transport overseas for trial those who had burned a british ship burgesses wanted to rebuke dunmore for his actions and henry was part of a committee of eight members that drafted a resolution thanking governor for capture of gang but affirming that using usual mode of criminal procedure protected both guilty and innocent they also penned a plan adopted by burgesses for a committee of correspondence to communicate with leaders in other colonies to inform and coordinate with each other members included henry although henry had by this time come to believe that conflict with great britain and independence was inevitable he had no strategy for advancing this burgesses were sitting when in 1774 word came that parliament had voted to close port of boston in retaliation for boston tea party and several burgesses including henry convened at raleigh tavern to formulate a response according to george mason a former burgess from fairfax county who joined committee in work henry took lead mason and henry would form a close political relationship that would last until mason s death in 1792 resolution that henry s committee produced set june 1 1774 date upon which port of boston was to be closed as a day of fasting and prayer it passed burgesses but dunmore dissolved body undeterred former legislators met at raleigh tavern and reconstituted themselves as a convention to meet again in august after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment they also called for a boycott of tea and other products five virginia conventions 1774 1776 would guide old dominion to independence as royal authority came to an end their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings denying authority of parliament over colonies and calling for a boycott of imports first convention met in williamsburg in chamber of burgesses beginning on august 1 dunmore was absent from capital fighting native americans and could not interfere divided between those who wanted separation from britain and those who still hoped for some accommodation it met for a week one major decision was election of delegates to a continental congress in philadelphia henry was chosen as one of seven delegates tying for second place with washington burgess for fairfax county both receiving three votes less than randolph thumb left 19th century engraving of washington center henry right and pendleton riding to philadelphia for first continental congress as washington s estate mount vernon lay on way from scotchtown to philadelphia he invited henry to stop there and to ride to philadelphia with him and henry did also accompanied by pendleton another virginia delegate to congress and a political rival of henry s delegates and prominent philadelphians took an intense interest in virginians who had taken lead in resistance to britain but whom few in other colonies had met this was henry s first stay in north excepting a brief business trip to new york in 1770 but he found that his actions were well known sessions began on september 5 1774 at carpenter s hall silas deane of connecticut described henry as speaker i ever heard but in a letter i can give you no idea of music of his voice or yet natural elegance of his stile or manner secretary of congress charles thomson wrote that when henry rose he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister but as he proceeded he evinced such an unusual force of argument and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified whole house then excited inquiry passed from man to man who is it who is it answer from few who knew him was it is patrick henry henry was involved in first dispute within congress on whether each colony should have an equal vote taking position that there should be proportionate representation with larger colonies to have a greater voice he argued that colonial borders must be swept away in need for americans to unify and create a government to fill void left with end of british authority fleets and armies and present state of things shew that government is dissolved where are your landmarks your boundaries of colonies distinctions between virginians pennsylvanians new yorkers and new englanders are no more i am not a virginian but an american henry lost argument and his theatrics made congress s leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on lead committee that charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights instead he was put on next most important committee one inquiring into commercial regulation in end though neither committee produced much of importance henry believed purpose of congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war in this he found common cause with john adams and samuel adams of massachusetts but not all were of that opinion according to tate henry turned out not to be an especially influential member of body congress decided on a petition to king henry prepared two drafts but neither proved satisfactory when congress on october 26 approved a draft prepared by john dickinson of pennsylvania who had consulted with henry and also richard henry lee henry had already departed for home and lee signed on his behalf petition was rejected in london after birth of their sixth child in 1771 patrick s wife sarah shelton henry began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness and one reason for move from louisa county to scotchtown was so they could be near family members henry s biographer jon kukla believed her to be victim of postpartum psychosis for which there was then no treatment at times she was restrained in a form of straitjacket although virginia had opened first public mental facility in north america in 1773 henry decided that she was better off at scotchtown and prepared a large apartment for her there she died in 1775 after which henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her and sold scotchtown in 1777 liberty or death 1775 thumb right currier ives depiction of henry giving his famous speech hanover county elected henry as a delegate to second virginia convention which convened at st john s episcopal church in town of richmond on march 20 1775 richmond was selected as better protected from royal authority convention debated whether virginia should adopt language from a petition by planters of colony of jamaica this document contained complaints about british actions but admitted king could veto colonial legislation and it urged reconciliation henry offered amendments to raise a militia independent of royal authority in terms that recognized that conflict with britain was inevitable sparking opposition of moderates he defended his amendments concluding with statement he is well known for as he concluded henry plunged an ivory letter opener towards his chest in imitation of roman patriot cato younger henry s speech carried day and convention adopted his amendments still they passed only narrowly as many delegates were uncertain where resistance urged by henry and other radicals would lead and few counties formed independent militia companies at urging of convention text of henry s speech first appeared in print in wirt s 1817 biography published 18 years after patrick henry s death wirt corresponded with men who had heard speech and others who were acquainted with people who were there at time all agreed that speech had produced a profound effect but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text judge st george tucker who had been present for speech gave wirt his recollections and wirt wrote back stating that i have taken almost entirely mr henry s speech in convention of 75 from you as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim original letter with tucker s remembrances has been lost for 160 years wirt s account was taken at face value in 1970s historians began to question authenticity of wirt s reconstruction judy textual and cultural authenticity of patrick henry s liberty or death speech quarterly journal of speech 63 1977 298 310 see ray raphael founding myths 311 note 7 for additional discussions among historians contemporary historians observe that henry was known to have used fear of indian and slave revolts in promoting military action against british and that according to only written first hand account of speech henry used some graphic name calling that wirt did not include in his heroic rendition tucker s account was based upon recollections and not notes several decades after speech he wrote in vain should i attempt to give any idea of his speech scholars have argued to what extent speech we know is work of wirt or tucker gunpowder incident thumb right royal proclamation against henry 1775 on april 21 1775 governor dunmore had royal marines under his command seize gunpowder from magazine in williamsburg and take it to a naval ship gunpowder belonged to government to be issued in case of need such as a slave uprising dunmore s actions outraged many virginians henry had departed for philadelphia having been elected a delegate to second continental congress but a messenger caught up with him before he left hanover county and he returned to take command of local militia seeking restoration of powder or that colonists be compensated for it on may 2 henry led his troops towards williamsburg with as dunmore wrote all appearances of actual war by this time word of battles of lexington and concord had arrived and many virginians believed that war with britain had begun with his troops reinforced by eager volunteers from nearby counties henry likely had force enough to take williamsburg and deal dunmore a humiliating defeat but increasingly prominent messengers urging caution slowed his advance and in new kent county still some from williamsburg three of henry s fellow delegates to congress helped persuade him to leave off his march as henry insisted colonists be compensated a member of governor s council agreed to pay value of powder by bill of exchange although dunmore issued a proclamation against a certain patrick henry of county of hanover and a number of his deluded followers 15 county committees quickly approved henry s action and when he finally departed for philadelphia he was escorted to potomac by militia who lined shore cheering as his ferry pulled away not all approved henry s march appalled some moderates who feared he might provoke a conflict in which virginia stood alone against britain s might they also saw him as a threat to sanctity of property for anyone s might be taken by henry and his troops as popular support for independence grew opponents either joined in movement or decided it was wiser to remain silent henry belatedly arrived at congress on may 18 1775 jefferson later stated that henry played only a supporting role and though there is not a complete record fact that he was not written of as having an impact appears to confirm that congress appointed washington as head of american forces an appointment that henry supported at end of session in august henry left philadelphia for virginia and would never again hold office outside its borders while henry was returning third virginia convention in august commissioned him as colonel of 1st virginia regiment and he took up appointment later that month although henry had little military experience this was not considered a major drawback at time and he was held to have distinguished himself in march on williamsburg general washington though felt that convention had made a capital mistake when they took henry out of senate to place him in field in september virginia s committee of safety placed henry in charge of all virginia s forces despite high title henry was placed under tight civilian control and to an extent willingness of moderates to go along with appointment reflected a view that in that position volatile henry would be contained henry moved to organize his regiment and had no difficulty recruiting men as commander he organized a navy in november 1775 dunmore who though he had abandoned williamsburg still held norfolk issued a proclamation offering freedom to any black slave or indentured servant willing and able to serve in his forces which already included several hundred former slaves henry wrote to all county lieutenants stating that proclamation is fatal to publick safety and urging an unremitting attention to government of slaves may i hope counteract this dangerous attempt constant and well directed patrols seem indispensably necessary henry saw no action himself and there were murmurs in convention against his command some feared he was too radical to be an effective military leader in february 1776 virginia s forces were reorganized as they were placed under continental command henry was to retain his rank of colonel but was placed under a former subordinate henry refused and left army his troops were outraged by slight to him and considered leaving service but he calmed situation independence and first time as governor henry did not sit in fourth virginia convention which met in december 1775 as he was ineligible because of his military commission once he was again a civilian freeholders of hanover county in april 1776 elected him to fifth convention to meet following month most delegates were for independence but were divided on how to declare it and over timing henry introduced a resolution declaring virginia independent and urging congress to declare all colonies free when he at last spoke according to clergyman edmund randolph henry appeared in an element for which he was born to cut knot which calm prudence was puzzled to untie was worthy of magnificence of his genius he entered into no subtlety of reasoning but was roused by now apparent spirit of people as a pillar of fire which notwithstanding darkness of prospect would conduct to promised land eventual resolution was based in large part on henry s and passed unanimously on may 15 1776 as well as declaring virginia independent resolution instructed state s delegates in congress to press for american independence which they would with lee introducing motion and jefferson penning declaration convention then proceeded to consider a constitution for virginia s government henry was appointed to a committee under leadership of archibald cary much of work fell to final appointee to committee george mason of fairfax county who did not arrive in williamsburg until may 18 delayed by illness mason first drafted a declaration of rights it was discussed in cary committee on may 25 mason s draft more than final declaration would be highly influential used by jefferson in writing declaration of independence and by writers of many 18th and 19th century state constitutions when draft was debated henry at request of a young delegate from orange county james madison produced an amendment changing mason s call for religious tolerance to one requiring full freedom of worship this was seen as a threat to virginia s established religion anglicanism and did not pass madison reworked it and had another delegate introduce it likely edmund randolph and it passed mason s draft called for a ban on bills of attainder henry got it removed by telling delegates that some high offender might be reached by no other means convention approved declaration of rights on june 12 virginia s form of government to be placed in its constitution was a concern not only within its borders jefferson in philadelphia though he would have preferred to be in williamsburg sent a plan and john adams sent henry a pamphlet containing his own views to which henry replied your sentiments are precisely same i have long since taken up and they come recommended by you but it was mason s plan for government of virginia which dominated with much power given to virginia house of delegates lower house of legislature house of delegates and senate of virginia together formed general assembly as virginia legislature is known under 1776 constitution governor elected by two houses of legislature was not even given power to veto legislation and was required to act with approval of governor s council on important matters henry opposed weakness of governor feeling it was risky at a time of war to have executive so weak but his views did not prevail he had reason to rue office s lack of power as on june 29 1776 convention elected him as virginia s first post independence governor by 60 votes to 45 for thomas nelson jr election of henry at that time virginia s most popular politician helped assure acceptance of new authorities but also placed him in a figurehead position removed from true power in new government house of delegates henry was taken ill almost immediately upon being sworn in as governor on july 5 and recuperated at scotchtown he returned to williamsburg in september and corresponded with general washington about military situation washington who was less effective because of inadequacies of his troops complained about state militias feeling a continental army committed for duration of war was needed henry helped recruit new troops for washington but his efforts were hampered by several issues including weakness of henry s office in december 1776 with general assembly alarmed at reports washington s army was in retreat as british occupied philadelphia legislators granted henry temporary expanded powers something that jefferson was still unhappy about years later feeling that henry was trying to set himself up as dictator in march 1777 henry wrote to washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months washington s anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused henry to drop matter stating that he deferred to washington s experience in military matters recruiting remained a problem many virginians were willing to be members of county militia but did not want to join continental army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease desertion was also a problem henry labored to solve with limited success many virginians had been induced to enlist with promises they would not be sent outside state or local area and left when orders came to march henry was elected to a second one year term without opposition and took oath on july 2 1777 on october 9 at scotchtown he married dorothea dandridge daughter of his old client nathaniel west dandridge of hanover county this made him closer kin to washington as nathaniel dandridge was martha washington s uncle to add to six children he had by sarah henry he would have eleven more by dorothea though two by second marriage died very young she brought 12 slaves with her adding to 30 patrick henry already had he sold scotchtown in 1777 and moved to leatherwood plantation in henry county which general assembly had just created and named for him when washington and his troops encamped at valley forge in winter of 1777 1778 henry arranged for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief there was discontent against washington who was not seen by some as a successful general and this resulted in so called conway cabal henry supported washington when dr benjamin rush of philadelphia one of those unenthusiastic about washington sent governor an unsigned letter discussing machinations against general henry immediately sent washington letter and though it is uncertain if henry recognized rush s handwriting washington did tipping him off to conspiracy president washington wrote of henry in 1794 i have always respected and esteemed him nay more i have conceived myself under obligation to him for friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in close of year 1777 with a view to embark him in opposition that was forming against me at that time in an effort to secure virginia s vast claims in west to mississippi river and north to present day minnesota against british and native american forces henry in december 1777 sent george rogers clark on an expedition against kaskaskia site of a british and french settlement this part of clark s mission was secret his public orders merely stated he was to raise a militia and go to kentucky then part of virginia clark captured kaskaskia in july 1778 and remained north of ohio river for remainder of henry s governorship although expedition did not turn out as well as hoped henry trumpeted its successes but after he left governorship in 1779 and was elected to house of delegates he became a foe of clark thumb boulder and plaque marking former location of leatherwood plantation in henry county virginia henry was elected to a third term on may 29 1778 again without opposition thomas jefferson led committee of notables sent to inform him of his election in december 1778 henry sent an urgent appeal to congress for naval aid in protecting chesapeake bay none was forthcoming and on may 8 1779 in final days of henry s governorship british ships under sir george collier entered bay landed troops and took portsmouth and suffolk destroying valuable supplies british departed on may 24 and henry limited to three consecutive terms in office by 1776 constitution left office soon after succeeded by jefferson and with his family returned to leatherwood leatherwood and house of delegates 1779 1784 at leatherwood henry devoted himself to local affairs in thinly populated county and was given seats on county court local governing body as prominent landowners were and on parish vestry he refused to be elected a delegate to congress stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible when governor jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780 henry replied with gratitude complaining of his isolation and wrote of his many concerns about state of affairs as war continued freeholders of henry county soon thereafter sent its eponym to house of delegates but within weeks health problems recurred causing his return to leatherwood while in richmond where capital had been moved henry opposed a congressional plan to continental currency and impose certain taxes feeling it would mostly benefit north he was successful in defeating it but after he left richmond supporters got legislature to pass it once he returned home he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of loyalists who were conducting raids in frontier area henry rode with troops though he did not lead them and they were generally successful in suppressing resistance volunteers were disbanded in september 1780 richmond had been made capital since it was believed to be less exposed to attack than williamsburg but in january 1781 british forces under renegade former american general benedict arnold sailed up james river and captured richmond with little opposition as henry joined other legislators and governor jefferson in fleeing to charlottesville although arnold soon withdrew to portsmouth in february troops under lord cornwallis entered state from north carolina war which had for most part been fought out of state would have many of its final moves played in virginia with washington s army near new york henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend state and in march helped draft an angry remonstrance from house of delegates to congress demanding help nevertheless in may british forces under colonel banastre tarleton raided charlottesville nearly capturing virginia government which fled to staunton there is a story that henry fled with other prominent leaders and sought refuge at home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing charlottesville but on learning henry was with group she decided it must be all right and offered them best she had jefferson did not go to staunton his term as governor had just expired but legislature had not met to hold an election after raid he took refuge at his farm in bedford county and virginia had no governor for ten days several legislators complained of jefferson s actions and called for an inquiry into conduct of executive jefferson and his council and henry was among those who took lead resolution passed but inquiry was set for next session and legislature thought better of it jefferson was angered at henry s actions and held a grudge that did not abate until well after henry s death in 1799 with war effectively ended by american victory at siege of yorktown henry served as delegate from his county through 1784 when he was elected again as governor peace brought many adjustments and henry sponsored legislation to reform virginia s currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before periods of high inflation jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled but in depreciated currency henry thought that unjust and because of his influence in general assembly his version prevailed this had international implications as some of creditors were british who sought payment in hard money rather than depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow at may 1783 house of delegates session henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal trade embargo against britain that passed despite opposition from john tyler sr speaker henry also introduced legislation to permit loyalists to return to virginia there was considerable opposition to that and measure was held over until later in year by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county henry spoke in debate asking shall we who have laid proud british lion at our feet be frightened of its once it was amended though in what way is not clear bill passed in november 1783 henry worked together with james madison a delegate after three years in congress on a number of issues they differed though on state support for virginia s protestant churches madison like jefferson desired a separation between church and state that meant no public financing of religion but henry believed that taxpayers who were christians should be assessed for maintenance of protestant church of their choice financing an array of churches in way that anglicanism had been funded in virginia until start of war henry was not alone in this belief both washington and lee supported such plans according to thomas s kidd in his biography of henry general assessment plan is one of main reasons henry is not more widely esteemed as a founder for in this debate he seems to have diverted from progressive flow of history general assembly might well have passed bill but on november 17 1784 legislators elected henry as governor madison believed that henry took position for family reasons his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in richmond rather than in remote henry county but cost was henry s bill as madison got it postponed to following year and eventually defeated instead madison got jefferson s statute for religious freedom through legislature this law requiring a separation of church and state passed general assembly in 1786 second period as governor 1784 1786 henry s second time as governor was for two years as legislature re elected him in 1785 it was generally more placid than his first during this time henry and his family lived at salisbury in chesterfield county about from richmond in open country that he rented though he had an official residence close to virginia capitol which was then under construction general assembly had passed legislation for new arms for militia and henry worked with lafayette to have them sent from france each county s militia was under firm local control a state of affairs that had resulted in problems during war as local militia refused orders from henry and other governors when asked to serve out of state or conscript recruits into continental army in 1784 seeking to bring militias under central control general assembly passed an act terminating all militia officer commissions and allowing henry with consent of governor s council to appoint replacements virginia constitution required that there be a recommendation from county court instead of asking county court henry solicited recommendations from prominent citizens in each county whom he or his council members knew result was near revolt in counties as citizens protested act as unconstitutional and counties refused to obey law went widely unenforced and in october 1785 henry requested legislators to repeal it they complied following year residents of western north carolina what is today state of tennessee sought to separate and become state of franklin a former delegate arthur campbell wanted to join virginia s adjacent washington county as part of scheme in 1785 henry had campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices as well as ousting campbell s supporters replacing them with residents of known loyalty although henry urged leniency in his report to general assembly that october stating that washington county separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of poor economy he had legislature pass a treason act forbidding setting up of a rival government within virginia territory henry also sought to advance virginia s development both as governor and through his personal investments he backed schemes to open navigation on upper potomac and james rivers envisioning canals to connect them to ohio river valley he also supported a scheme to have a canal across great dismal swamp believing that with it trade of eastern north carolina would flow through norfolk he owned land along proposed route and sought to interest general washington in scheme but was not successful despite henry s support for internal improvements he failed to notify s representatives of their appointment to meet with maryland over navigation on potomac and only two including george mason attended what became known as mount vernon conference 1785 edmund randolph unable to attend because of lack of timely notification hinted that reason for henry s neglect was not forgetfulness but a growing hostility towards things federal in 1786 henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to annapolis conference called with support of madison who was appointed a delegate henry stepped down at end of his fifth term stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it opponent of constitution 1787 1790 disinclined to return to distant leatherwood after his time as governor ended in november 1786 henry hoped to purchase land in hanover county but bought property in prince edward county instead hampden sydney college which he had helped found in 1775 is located in that county and henry enrolled his sons there local freeholders elected henry to house of delegates in early 1787 and he would serve there until end of 1790 new governor randolph offered to make henry a delegate to constitutional convention scheduled to meet in philadelphia later that year to consider changes to articles of confederation document that had governed loose union among states since 1777 henry refused appointment alleging it would be difficult financially one legend is that when henry was asked why he had not gone he replied i smelt a rat henry s record of urging unity made him a potential supporter of a closer bond between states and as late as end of 1786 madison hoped for henry as an ally in fight several factors had eroded henry s trust in northern states including what he deemed congress s failure to send adequate troops to protect virginia settlers in ohio river valley henry was outraged by jay gardoqui treaty which would have ceded exclusive navigation on mississippi river to spain for 25 years this was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit new england where there was a growing separatist movement northern votes were sufficient to relax john jay s negotiating instructions which had originally forbidden restricting american navigation on mississippi to allow him to reach a deal southern votes were sufficient to block treaty s ratification these events caused henry and some other virginia leaders to feel betrayed and to have little trust in good faith of north when philadelphia convention adjourned in september 1787 its president washington returned home and immediately sent a copy of new constitution to henry recommending he support it henry was in richmond for autumn legislative session as delegate for prince edward county while thanking washington for presiding in philadelphia and for sending document he said of it i have to lament that i cannot bring my mind to accord with proposed constitution concern i feel on this account is really greater than i am able to express he hinted though that he was still open to changing his mind this allowed henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of constitution such as mason and edmund randolph both delegates at philadelphia published their opinions and to refine his views in initial virginia battle over constitution call for a convention to decide whether state should ratify it henry and mason were among those who supported allowing convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made matter was compromised with language allowing convention s members full rein in deciding what to do and it was set for june 1788 with elections in march both those who supported it and those who did not felt time would be to their advantage henry was elected to convention from prince edward county without difficulty though john blair smith president of hampden sydney caused him some annoyance by having students read at an assembly in henry s presence a speech by henry and smith s own rebuttal henry opposed constitution because of its grant of a strong executive president he had not fought to free virginia from king george to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot henry accordingly deemed constitution a backwards step and a betrayal of those who had died in revolutionary cause at virginia ratifying convention which began on june 2 1788 according to kidd henry s personality blazed in all its power and glory henry suggested that framers of had no right to begin it we people and ignore powers of states he suggested that document put too much power in hands of too few he noted that constitution proposed without a bill of rights did not protect individual rights madison lead supporter of constitution was inhibited in replying to henry s criticisms since he was ill through most of convention henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in convention moved towards ratification but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one quarter of pages of richmond convention s debates governor randolph who had become a supporter of ratification suggested that if convention allowed henry to continue arguing it would last six months rather than six weeks henry was somewhat mollified after convention voted on june 21 to ratify constitution by fact that convention then proposed about 40 amendments some of them were later incorporated in bill of rights george mason henry s ally in opposing ratification intended a fiery diatribe on faults of new plan of government he was talked out of it by one account henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratification and as republicans with issues settled in a democratic way they had best all go home madison wrote to washington that henry still hoped for amendments to weaken power of federal government possibly to be proposed by a second national convention henry returned to house of delegates where he successfully defeated madison s effort to become federal senator from virginia for under original constitution senators were elected by legislators not people although henry made it clear he would not serve in office outside virginia he received a number of votes in election madison gained election to house of representatives in a district where he was opposed by james monroe though madison s supporters complained that henry s supporters in legislature had unfairly placed madison s county orange in a district leaning anti federalist henry also saw to it that requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from legislature to federal congress despite his qualms henry served as one of virginia s presidential electors voting for washington elected president and john adams elected vice president henry was disappointed when first congress passed only amendments dealing with personal liberties not those designed to weaken government a final cause henry engaged in before leaving house of delegates at end of 1790 was over funding act of 1790 by which federal government took over debts of states much of which dated from revolutionary war on november 3 of that year henry introduced a resolution which would be passed by house of delegates and by state senate declaring act repugnant to constitution of united states as it goes to exercise of a power not granted to general federal government this would prove first of many resolutions passed by southern state legislatures in decades to come defending states rights and strict interpretation of constitution later years leaving house of delegates after 1790 henry found himself in debt owing in part to expenses while governor and sought to secure his family s fortune through land speculation and a return to practice of law not fully reconciled to federal government henry contemplated a new republic in thinly settled frontier lands but his plans came to nothing he did not travel as widely for cases as he had in 1760s confining his practice mostly to prince edward and bedford counties though in a compelling case or for a large enough fee he would travel to richmond or over mountains to greenbrier county today in west virginia when new federal court opened in virginia in 1790 british creditors promptly filed over a hundred cases seeking to enforce claims from revolutionary war henry was part of defense team in jones v walker before federal court in 1791 his co counsel included john marshall who prepared written pleadings while henry did much of courtroom advocacy henry argued case for three days marshall looking back called him a great orator and much more a learned lawyer a most accurate thinker and a profound reasoner case ended inconclusively after one of judges died but legal teams reassembled for case of ware v hylton argued before another three judge panel that included chief justice of united states john jay and associate justice james iredell henry s argument provoked justice iredell to exclaim gracious god he is an orator indeed henry and marshall were initially successful but plaintiffs appealed and after marshall argued his only case before supreme court that court in 1796 ruled for british creditors henry s friendship with washington had cooled somewhat amid ratification debates but by 1794 both men were looking to reconcile henry found himself more aligned with washington than with jefferson and madison and washington still considered himself indebted to henry for notifying him about conway cabal washington offered henry a seat on supreme court in 1794 but he refused feeling his family needed him washington also tried to get henry to accept positions as secretary of state and as minister to spain and virginia governor light horse harry lee wanted to appoint him to senate henry refused each time henry s continuing popularity in virginia made him an attractive ally and even jefferson tried to recruit him sending word though a mutual friend that he bore no grudge after washington made it clear he would not seek a third term in 1796 marshall and harry lee discussed a possible henry run for president with him but henry was unwilling general assembly elected him as governor again that year but he declined citing age and health henry s refusal to accept these offices increased his popularity as he was like washington seen as a cincinnatus giving up power to return to his farm and his plow thumb left graves of patrick henry and his wife dorothea in family burying ground at red hill patrick s is on right inscription reads his fame his best epitaph henry sold his property in prince edward county in 1792 moving with his family to long island a plantation in campbell county in 1794 henry purchased red hill near brookneal virginia in charlotte county where he and his family lived much of year though they moved to long island in sickly season henry was gratified at election of his old friend john adams as president in 1796 over his foe jefferson but henry s commitment to federalist party was tested by repressive alien and sedition acts of 1798 he chose to say nothing but supported campaign of marshall a moderate federalist for house of representatives marshall won narrowly henry was under considerable pressure from virginia federalists to return to politics but it was not until former president washington urged him to run for legislature in early 1799 that henry gave in turning down an offer from president adams to make him an envoy to france henry was elected as delegate from charlotte county on march 4 1799 legislature had no immediate session scheduled so he returned to red hill and never left again dying there of stomach cancer at his home on june 6 1799 he was buried at red hill in henry s will he left his estates and his 67 slaves to be divided between his wife and his six sons he did not free any slaves despite his speeches against enslavement by tyrants and despite his various comments opposing institution of slavery itself tributes to henry upon his death were many virginia gazette printed a death notice

inscribed on final issue in series a 4 cent stamp first released in richmond on january 11 1961 legacy and historical view as historian richard beeman put it henry was a man who did not bother to write much of anything down a handicap when being evaluated by history lack of primary source materials regarding henry only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive has frustrated henry s biographers from wirt 1817 to beeman 1974 wirt commented two years before publishing his book it is all speaking speaking speaking tis true he could talk gods how he could talk but to make matter worse from 1763 to 1789 not one of his speeches lives in print writing or memory beeman for his part concluded revolutionary firebrand whatever his achievements possessed a miserable sense of history this was a deficiency not possessed by jefferson who not only survived henry by a quarter century but who got to fill vacuum of information about henry with his own recollections and opinions wirt did not print many of jefferson s criticisms of henry who had irritated jefferson to such an extent he was still criticizing henry to guests at monticello in 1824 jefferson s negative assessments of henry whether justified or not have adversely affected henry s historical reputation henry has always been acclaimed by americans for brilliance of his political oratory kukla wrote henry explained revolution to ordinary men and women through america in words they understood and inspired them to fight for liberty mayer argued henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept his career pointed transition from political of eighteenth century to mass politics of andrew jackson s day in his study of henry s oratory david a suggested that henry s position as great american orator of his day was not so much because of his heroism and eloquence but for adapting clashing philosophies religious and political that met in henry s virginia to create a new style of oratory that appealed to masses according to tate by his unmatched oratorical powers by employing a certain common touch to win unwavering loyalty of his constituents and by closely identifying with their interests he almost certainly contributed to making revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become kidd argued that historical focus on quality of henry s oratory may result from a discomfort with content of his speeches especially his opposition to constitution during civil war era both sides claimed henry as a partisan abolitionists citing his writings against slavery and those sympathetic to southern cause pointing to his hostility to constitution that opposition by henry came to be seen by many writers even those friendly to henry as a blot on an otherwise admirable career beeman writing in 1986 just before constitution s bicentennial predicted that during that anniversary it will be hard to avoid depicting henry as one of history s losers as one too short sighted to see beyond bounds of his own native state to glimpse promise of national greatness embodied in federal constitution henry has been cited as a hero to both left and right but has become a particular favorite of latter he is especially attractive to christian conservatives who cite his deep religious beliefs as well as his writings and speeches in favor of christian virtue and in defense of religious liberty because henry was educated at home by his father he has become a symbol of homeschooling movement in 2000 patrick henry college was founded in purcellville virginia in large part for those who had been homeschooled although henry s most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever in hands of right one sign at a tea party rally in 2010 read give me liberty or give me debt according to kidd few americans today tea or others take seriously henry s fundamental criticisms of constitution tate wrote of henry of numerous leaders who were active largely at state level and who generally opposed ratification of federal constitution henry was one of few who came to be ranked among truly major figures of american revolution kukla concurred noting that except for two years in continental congress henry never held national office and yet he was a founder of republic kidd
