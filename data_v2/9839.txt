region like previous pokemon games diamond and pearl chronicle adventures of a young pokemon trainer as they train and battle pokemon while also thwarting schemes of a criminal organization games add many new features such as internet play over nintendo wi fi connection changes to battle mechanics and pokemon contests along with addition of 107 new pokemon games are independent of each other but feature largely same plot and while both can be played separately it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete games pokedex development of diamond and pearl was announced at a nintendo press conference in fourth calendar quarter of 2004 games were designed with features of nintendo ds in mind it was forecasted to be released in japan in 2005 but ultimately shipped in 2006 in promotion of games nintendo sold a limited edition nintendo ds lite in japan and held a release party celebrating their north american release games received generally favorable reviews most critics praised addition of wi fi features and felt that gameplay though it had not received much updating from previous games was still engaging reviewers were divided on graphics however and audio was criticized as being primitive games enjoyed more commercial success than their game boy advance predecessors with around 18 million units sold worldwide diamond and pearl have sold over 2 million more units than pokemon ruby and sapphire and almost 6 million more units than pokemon firered and leafgreen while also outselling their successors pokemon black and white by over 2 million copies gameplay thumb left 150px bottom screen of nintendo ds displays poketch a multi functional device with features related to time tracking and player status pokemon diamond and pearl are role playing video games with adventure elements basic mechanics of games are largely same as their predecessors as with all pokemon games for handheld consoles gameplay is in a third person overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens a field map in which player navigates main character a battle screen and menu in which player configures their party items or gameplay settings players begin game with no pokemon or poke balls but are given choice of three pokemon as a part of story line once poke balls are obtained player can capture more pokemon players can use their pokemon to deal damage to other pokemon in battle whenever player encounters a wild pokemon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle screen switches to a turn based battle screen where pokemon fight during battle player may use a move use an item switch active pokemon or flee fleeing is not an option during battles against trainers all pokemon have hit points hp whenever a pokemon s hp is reduced to zero it faints and cannot battle unless revived at a pokemon center or with an item if player s pokemon defeats opposing pokemon by causing it to faint it receives experience points after accumulating enough experience points it will level up most pokemon evolve into a new species of pokemon whenever they reach a certain level pokemon s stats also increase every time it levels up and they will also learn new moves at certain levels as well if a pokemon is prevented from evolving it will learn new moves faster apart from battling capturing pokemon is most important element of pokemon gameplay although other trainers pokemon cannot be captured player can use different kinds of poke balls on a wild pokemon during battle a successful capture adds pokemon to player s active party or stores it if player already has maximum of six pokemon in their party factors in success rate of capture include hp of target pokemon and strength of poke ball used lower target s hp and stronger poke ball higher success rate of capture is also inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis adds a multiplier to capture rate making it easier to capture wild pokemon each species has a capture rate of its own as well new features as with other generations of pokemon games diamond and pearl retain basic gameplay of their predecessors while introducing additional new features day night cycle makes a return and has increased from three times of day in gold and silver to five time periods in diamond and pearl morning day afternoon evening and night loe p 20in game mechanics that depend on time of day afternoon counts as day and evening counts as night diamond and pearl also introduce several changes to battle mechanics in previous generations pokemon moves were classified as physical or special based on their type for example all fire type moves were special and all ground type moves were physical in diamond and pearl however moves are categorized into three groups attacks that make physical contact with opponent are physical attacks that do not make physical contact are special and moves that do not deal damage are classified as status loe p 15 some of games new features capitalize on nintendo ds s features poketch a simulated smartwatch resides on ds s bottom screen and hosts various applications including a clock calculator map counter and a drawing pad loe pp 30 31 these applications are obtained throughout game beneath sinnoh s surface is underground a large area used for wireless multiplayer gaming via ds wireless communication not nintendo wi fi connection in it players can create and decorate secret bases first featured in pokemon ruby and sapphire and participate in minigames items mined in underground can then be transferred into player s bag in main game diamond and pearl also employ support for nintendo wi fi connection since discontinued allowing players to communicate through voice chat trade and battle online main system for trade is global trade station which allows players to trade with people around world players can search for any pokemon that they have seen in game and can offer their own if another player is offering requested pokemon and is looking for offered pokemon trade occurs immediately loe p 41 a trade does not have to be instant an offer can be left for other players to browse and complete even while player is offline certain species of pokemon traded internationally will have a pokedex entry in language of game it originated from according to pokemon art director ken sugimori global trade station was new feature he was most pleased with pokemon contests are events in which player s pokemon compete in a show to win ribbons and in diamond and pearl they consist of three stages two more than contests of game boy advance games in visual competition stage players use nintendo ds s touchscreen to place accessories on their pokemon to boost a particular trait such as cool or cute and earn points loe p 34 35 in dance competition stage player must tap buttons on touchscreen in rhythm with music final stage acting competition is similar to pokemon contests of game boy advance games pokemon use their moves to appeal to judges and crowd like pokeblocks in third generation games baked goods called can be made from berries and fed to pokemon in order to boost a particular trait and therefore likelihood of success in a relevant contest connectivity to other devices in addition to compatibility with each other diamond and pearl offer compatibility with third generation pokemon games pokemon ruby and sapphire emerald firered and leafgreen pokemon ranger and pokemon battle revolution after earning national pokedex in diamond and pearl player can migrate pokemon from game boy advance games to diamond and pearl by inserting a game boy advance cartridge into game boy advance cartridge slot of nintendo ds while diamond or pearl is in ds slot after six pokemon are uploaded from cartridge they are sent to pal park an area where player can capture transferred pokemon this feature cannot be used on a nintendo dsi as dsi lacks a game boy advance cartridge slot pokemon uploads are restricted to six every twenty four hours per game boy advance cartridge and player must capture uploaded pokemon before performing another transfer pokemon transferred to diamond and pearl this way cannot be sent back to a game boy advance cartridge after completing a special mission in pokemon ranger player will be able to send a egg or from ranger to diamond or pearl finally players can wirelessly upload pokemon from diamond and pearl to wii games pokemon battle revolution and my pokemon ranch players can also connect to internet to battle and trade with other players around world ds

higher ratings than firered and leafgreen and ruby and sapphire japanese version of games have an 85 out of 100 on metacritic and an 85 generally favorable reviews on gamerankings highest score given was a 92 by uk official nintendo magazine while lowest was a 67 by game revolution ryan davis of gamespot gave games an 8 5 10 great and called games most well rounded pokemon games to date ign and gamezone also gave games an 8 5 10 uk official nintendo magazine gave games 92 and gamespy gave them a 4 5 5 games received slightly lower reviews from computerandvideogames com than ruby and sapphire had but earned an a grade from 1up com an improvement from ruby and sapphires b most reviewers felt that though gameplay and storyline had not changed much since first games diamond and pearl were still engaging ryan davis of gamespot said i t s a little surprising how well formula holds up in diamond and pearl which is a testament to strong fundamentals of series as well as quality of execution games wi fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews 1up com called addition of wireless connectivity games biggest improvements gamespot and gamespy both listed addition of online play as one of positive points of games and called system robust and probably most significant new feature computerandvideogames com said of global trade center suddenly pokemon feels properly alive for first time since playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in late 90s and you ll instantly forgive game freak their technical stubbornness first time you switch on your ds and find level 100 you craved is on your cart graphics generally received positive reviews gamespot praised blend of 2d and 3d graphics and gamezone said that graphics were better than what i had originally imagined and that a pokemon title hasn t ever looked this good on a handheld gamespy felt that graphics though simple made game a pleasure to explore computerandvideogames com however said that so called 3d isn t up to much it s just a viewpoint shuffle with ds s gutsy engine taking a nice long nap between odd hypnotic windfarm or fog effect audio was not so well received ign felt that cries made by pokemon still screech with flair of original game boy and that music while more advanced was not much beyond game boy advance quality gamezone also felt that sounds had not been updated saying this audio is only area that hasn t taken one step forward it remains stagnant and doesn t show any progression over gba titles gamespot cited games recycled sounds as one of negative points popular youtuber
