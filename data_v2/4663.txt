to be with him paste magazine writer garrett martin said although idea of pairing two co workers felt like a conventional television move he did not mind with leslie and ben because they are such a

create friction between leslie and ben he enjoyed lengths with which they were going to keep their relationship secret steve heisler of a v club called bubble an excellent episode that went a long way in fleshing out leslie and ben romance but primarily set scene for superior li l sebastian time magazine writer james poniewozik said bubble was not as funny as some of better third season episodes like harvest festival or andy and april s fancy party but was nonetheless enjoyable and perfectly funny references external links bubble at official parks and recreation site category 2011 american
