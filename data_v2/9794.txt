legal system of saudi arabia is based on sharia islamic law derived from qur an and sunnah traditions of islamic prophet muhammad sources of sharia also include islamic scholarly consensus developed after muhammad s death its interpretation by judges in saudi arabia is influenced by medieval texts of literalist hanbali school of islamic jurisprudence uniquely in muslim world sharia has been adopted by saudi arabia in an uncodified form this and lack of judicial precedent has resulted in considerable uncertainty in scope and content of country s laws government therefore announced its intention to codify sharia in 2010 and significant progress has been made with publication on january 3 2018 of a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents sharia has also been supplemented by regulations arabic although translated by saudi official bureau of translation as laws issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law nevertheless sharia remains primary source of law especially in areas such as criminal family commercial and contract law and qur an and sunnah are declared to be country s constitution in areas of land and energy law extensive rights of saudi state in effect saudi royal family constitute a significant feature current saudi court system was created by king abdul aziz who founded kingdom of saudi arabia in 1932 and was introduced to country in stages between 1927 and 1960 it comprises general and summary sharia courts with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations trials in saudi arabia are bench trials courts in saudi arabia observe few formalities and country s first criminal procedure code issued in 2001 has been largely ignored king abdullah in 2007 introduced a number of significant judicial reforms although they are yet to be fully implemented criminal law punishments in saudi arabia include public beheading stoning amputation and lashing serious criminal offences include not only internationally recognized crimes such as murder rape theft and robbery but also apostasy adultery witchcraft and sorcery in addition to regular police force saudi arabia has a secret police mabahith and religious police mutawa latter enforces islamic social and moral norms but their powers have greatly been restricted over last few years western based human rights organizations such as amnesty international and human rights watch have criticized activities of both mabahith and mutawa as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in saudi arabia these include number of executions range of offences which are subject to death penalty lack of safeguards for accused in criminal justice system treatment of homosexuals use of torture lack of religious freedom and highly disadvantaged position of women albert shanker institute and freedom house have also reported that saudi arabia s practices diverge from concept of rule of law history thumb abdul aziz al saud first king of saudi arabia and founder of country s court system sharia or islamic law primary source of law in modern saudi arabia was developed gradually by muslim judges and scholars between seventh and tenth centuries from time of abbasid caliphate in 8th century developing sharia was accepted as basis of law in towns of muslim world including arabian peninsula and upheld by local rulers eclipsing urf or pre islamic local customary law in rural areas urf continued to be predominant for some time and for instance was main source of law among bedouin of nejd in central arabia until early 20th century by 11th century muslim world had developed four major sunni schools of islamic jurisprudence or fiqh each with its own interpretations of sharia hanbali maliki shafi and hanafi in arabia a preference for hanbali school was advocated by wahhabi movement founded in 18th century wahhabism a strict form of sunni islam was supported by saudi royal family al saud and is now dominant in saudi arabia from 18th century hanbali school therefore predominated in nejd and central arabia heartland of wahhabi islam in more cosmopolitan hejaz in west of peninsula both hanafi and shafi schools were followed similarly different court systems existed in nejd there was a simple system of single judges for each of major towns judge was appointed by local governor with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases in hejaz there was a more sophisticated system with courts comprising panels of judges in 1925 abdul aziz al saud of nejd conquered hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form kingdom of saudi arabia in 1932 in 1927 king introduced a new court system to hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that hanbali fiqh should be used however nejd s traditional system of judges was left in place in face of conservative opposition from nejd religious establishment after becoming familiar with hejaz court system in following decades religious establishment allowed its introduction to rest of country between 1957 and 1960 additionally from 1930s abdul aziz created government tribunals or committees to adjudicate in areas covered by royal decrees such as commercial or labor law system of sharia courts and government tribunals created by abdul aziz largely remained in place until 2007 judiciary reforms see below until 1970 judiciary was responsibility of grand mufti country s most senior religious authority when incumbent grand mufti died in 1969 however then king faisal decided not to appoint a successor and took opportunity to transfer responsibility to newly established ministry of justice shia community of eastern province have a separate legal tradition although they follow sharia they apply shia jafari school of jurisprudence to it in 1913 when abdul aziz conquered area he granted shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases one judge in and one in al this remained position with two judges ministering to a population of around two million until 2005 when number of judges was increased to seven for all other areas of law shia community are under jurisdiction of regular sunni courts sources of law left thumb 250 px verses from quran a primary source of law of saudi arabia primary source of law in saudi arabia is islamic sharia sharia is derived from qur an and traditions of muhammad contained in sunnah ijma or scholarly consensus on meaning of qur an and sunnah developed after muhammad s death and qiyas or analogical reasoning applied to principles of qur an sunnah and ijma wahhabi interpretation of islam used in saudi arabia uses qiyas only in cases of extreme necessity delong bas wahhabi islam 2004 96 muslim countries that retain or adopt sharia usually determine which parts of sharia are enforceable and codify and thereby modernize them unlike other muslim countries saudi arabia regards uncodified sharia in its entirety as law of land and does not interfere with it it is therefore unique not only when compared to western systems but also in comparison to other muslim countries and according to one source is closest system in modern world to form of sharia adopted at advent of islam lack of codification of sharia leads to considerable variation in its interpretation and application furthermore there is no system of judicial precedent as wahhabism rejects imitation of past scholarship taqlid in favor of independent reasoning ijtihad delong bas wahhabi islam 2004 100 however saudi judges are expected to consult six medieval texts from hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of qur an and hadith if answer is not found in six hanbali texts judge may then consult jurisprudence of other three main sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning referred to as ijtihad nevertheless because judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments either his own or of other judges and can apply his personal interpretation of sharia to any particular case through ijtihad divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases there is a presumption against overturning a decision when it is based on ijtihad this principle is crucial in two respects firstly it concentrates substance of law in hands of judges as in consequence there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad rather than a king or a parliament can determine god s law secondly it renders a judge s decision practically immune to reversal on appeal role of ijtihad has led to calls for sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty as a result in 2010 minister of justice announced plans to implement a codification of sharia law although resistance from religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation royal decrees nizam are other main source of law but are referred to as regulations rather than laws to indicate that they are subordinate to sharia royal decrees supplement sharia in areas such as labor commercial and corporate law additionally other forms of regulations lai hah include royal orders council of ministers resolutions ministerial resolutions and ministerial circulars and are similarly subordinate to sharia any western commercial laws or institutions are adapted and interpreted from standpoint of shariah law coulson noel j graham and 1984 commercial law in gulf states islamic legal tradition 3 additionally traditional tribal law and custom remain significant for example judges will enforce tribal customs pertaining to marriage and divorce courts and judiciary court structure sharia court system constitutes basic judiciary of saudi arabia and its judges and lawyers form part of ulema country s religious leadership there are also extra sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees and since 2008 specialist courts including board of grievances and specialized criminal court final appeal from both sharia courts and government tribunals is to king and all courts and tribunals followed sharia rules of evidence and procedure sharia courts have general jurisdiction over most civil and criminal cases at present there are two types of courts of first instance general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases cases are adjudicated by single judges except criminal cases if potential sentence is death amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges there are also two courts for shia minority in eastern province dealing with family and religious matters appellate courts sit in mecca and riyadh and review decisions for compliance with sharia there are also non sharia courts covering specialized areas of law most important of which is board of grievances this court was originally created to deal with complaints against government but also has jurisdiction over commercial and some criminal cases such as bribery and forgery and acts as a court of appeal for a number of non sharia government tribunals these administrative tribunals referred to as committees deal with specific issues regulated by royal decrees such as labor and commercial law judges judicial establishment in broadest sense is composed of qadis who give binding judgements in specific court cases and and other members of ulema who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions fatwas grand mufti is most senior member of judicial establishment as well as being highest religious authority in country his opinions are highly influential among saudi judiciary judiciary proper that is body of qadis is composed of about 700 judges a relatively small number according to critics for a country of over 23 million qadis generally have degrees in sharia law from an islamic university recognized by saudi government with in many cases a post graduate qualification from institute of higher judiciary in riyadh training received from such sharia law degrees is entirely religious in character and is based on qur an and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to for example modern commercial issues although most judges have been educated and appointed under current system some of older judges received traditional qadi s training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque capabilities and reactionary nature of judges have been criticized main complaint reportedly made by saudis privately is that judges who have wide discretion in interpreting sharia have no knowledge and are often contemptuous of modern world reported examples of judges attitudes include rulings banning such things as children s game pokemon telephones that play recorded music and sending flowers to hospital patients saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool by one estimate 80 of 600 saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from qasim a province in center of country with less than 5 of saudi s population preliminary results of census of 2004 09 15 but known as strict religious wahhabi heartland of saudi arabia senior judges will only allow like minded graduates of select religious institutes to join judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments reforms and developments 2008 2018 saudi system of justice has been criticized for being slow arcane lacking in some of safeguards of justice and unable to deal with modern world in 2007 king abdullah issued royal decrees with aim of reforming judiciary and creating a new court system with launch of labor courts on november 25 2018 reforms have been completed including creation of supreme court and transfer of board of grievances commercial and criminal jurisdictions to general court system specialist first instance courts now comprise general criminal personal status commercial and labor courts sharia courts have therefore lost their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and work load of government s administrative tribunals have been transferred to new courts another important change is establishment of appeal courts for each province it has been claimed that reforms will establish a system for codifying sharia and incorporating principle of judicial precedent into court practice thumb left 200px king abdullah ordered a number of

to sentences of 5 30 years on 22 november 2011 in 2009 king made a number of significant changes to judiciary s personnel at most senior level by bringing in a younger generation for example as well as appointing a new minister of justice a new chairman of supreme judicial council was appointed outgoing chairman was known to oppose codification of sharia king also appointed a new head of board of grievances and abdulrahman al as first chief justice of new supreme court as of january 2013 royal decree supreme judicial council will be headed by justice minister chief justice of supreme court

detention and arrest of violators criticism of mutawa by saudis has grown since 2002 when 15 schoolgirls died in a fire at their school in mecca after mutawa allegedly prevented male rescuers from entering because girls were not veiled on 13 april 2016 a new regulation issued by saudi cabinet stripped mutawa of their authority for pursuit capture interrogation or detainment of suspects instead

absolute monarchy and has no legally binding written constitution however in 1992 basic law of saudi arabia was adopted by royal decree basic law outlines responsibilities and processes of governing institutions but is insufficiently specific to be considered a constitution it declares that king must comply with sharia that is islamic law and that quran and sunna traditions of muhammad are country s constitution interpretation of quran and sunna remains necessary and this is carried out by ulema saudi religious establishment basic law further states monarchy is system of rule in kingdom of saudi arabia rulers of country shall be from amongst sons of founder king abdulaziz bin abdulrahman al faisal al saud and their descendants most upright among them shall receive allegiance according to almighty god s book and his messenger s sunna traditions government in kingdom of saudi arabia derives its authority from book of god and sunna of prophet which are ultimate sources of reference for this law and other laws of state governance in kingdom of saudi arabia is based on justice shura consultation and equality according to islamic sharia criminal law saudi arabia uses bench trial system its courts observe few formalities country s first criminal procedure code was introduced in 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from egyptian and french law human rights watch in a 2008 report noted that judges were either ignorant of criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored code criminal law is governed by sharia and comprises three categories hudud fixed quranic punishments for specific crimes qisas eye for an eye retaliatory punishments and tazir a general category hudud crimes are most serious and include theft robbery blasphemy apostasy adultery sodomy and fornication qisas crimes include murder or any crime involving bodily harm tazir represents most cases many of which are defined by national regulations such as bribery trafficking and drug abuse most common punishment for a tazir offence is lashing a conviction requires proof in one of three ways first is an confession alternatively testimony of two male witnesses can convict four in case of adultery unless it is a hudud crime in which case a confession is also required women s evidence normally carries half weight of men in sharia courts however in criminal trials women s testimony is not allowed at all testimony from non muslims or muslims whose doctrines are considered unacceptable for example shia may be discounted lastly an affirmation or denial by muslim oath has no prescribed form except that it must begin by god it is not necessary to place hand on qur an although this is often done see can be required giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as saudi arabia s and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction thumb left 300px square central riyadh known locally as chop chop square it is location of public beheadings saudi courts impose a number of severe physical punishments death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder rape armed robbery repeated drug use apostasy adultery witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword stoning or firing squad followed by crucifixion 345 reported executions between 2007 and 2010 were all carried out by public beheading u s state department annual human rights reports for saudi arabia 2007 2010 two executions for witchcraft and sorcery were carried out in 2011 there were no reports of stoning between 2007 and 2010 stoning has however occurred relatively recently and for example between 1981 and 1992 there were four cases of execution by stoning reported although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of right hand and aggravated theft by cross amputation of a hand and a foot only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010 homosexual acts are punishable by flogging imprisonment or death lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations retaliatory punishments or qisas are practised for instance an eye can be surgically removed at insistence of a victim who lost his own eye this occurred in a case reported in 2000 families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya or blood money by perpetrator there has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood money demands for example a sum of 11 million was reported as being recently demanded saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that practise of diyya has become corrupted family law laws relating to marriage divorce children and inheritance are not codified and fall within general jurisdiction of sharia courts polygamy is permitted for men but is limited to four wives at any one time there is evidence that its practice has increased particularly among educated hejazi elite as a result of oil wealth government has promoted polygamy as part of a return to islamic values program in 2001 grand mufti highest religious authority issued a fatwa or opinion calling upon saudi women to accept polygamy as part of islamic package and declaring that polygamy was necessary to fight against growing epidemic of there is no minimum age for marriage in saudi arabia and grand mufti reportedly said in 2009 that girls of age of 10 or 12 were marriageable men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives talaq without needing any legal justification divorce is effective immediately husband s obligation is then to provide financial support for divorced wife for a period of four months and ten days a woman can only obtain a divorce with consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her in practice it is very difficult for a saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce divorce rate is high with 50 of marriages being dissolved in event of divorce fathers have automatic custody of sons from age of 7 and daughters from age of 9 right for men to marry up to four wives combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause can translate to unlimited polygamy king abdul aziz founder of country reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women however his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by saudi arabian standards with regard to law of inheritance quran specifies that fixed portions of deceased s estate must be left to so called quranic heirs generally female heirs receive half portion of male heirs a sunni muslim can bequeath a maximum of a third of his property to non quranic heirs residue is divided between agnatic heirs commercial and contract law business and commerce are governed by sharia commercial jurisdiction rests with board of grievances composed of sharia trained judges but special tribunals tasked with finding ways to circumnavigate more restrictive aspects of shariah law have been established for foreign investors uncertainties around content of commercial law because of sharia aspect constitutes a disincentive to invest in saudi arabia as it is governed by sharia contract law is not codified within general limitations of sharia it allows considerable freedom for parties to agree contract terms however contracts involving speculation or payment of interest are prohibited and are not enforceable if a contract is breached saudi courts will only award compensation for proven direct damage claims for loss of profit or opportunity will not be allowed as these would constitute speculation which is not permitted under sharia as of at least 2003 non sharia special tribunals or special committees hear most commercial law cases ranging from breach of contract suits to trade mark infringement and labour disputes tribunals enforce nizam decrees issued by king specific modern aspects of commercial law for example commercial paper and securities intellectual property and corporate law are governed by modern regulations and specialist government tribunals deal with related disputes government recently revised its intellectual property laws to meet world trade organization standards as part of its admission to wto in 2004 because of a lack of resources when new patent law went into effect in 2004 saudi patent office had only registered 90 patents since 1989 with a backlog of 9 000 applications it is believed backlog has now been reduced saudi government is also putting greater resources into combating unauthorized distribution of software printed material recordings and videos however illegally copied material is still widely available enforcement efforts have been supported by a fatwa or religious ruling that copyright infringement of software is forbidden under islam saudi arabia had been on special 301 watchlist u s s running log of countries considered to inadequately regulate or enforce intellectual property rights but was removed in 2010 saudi law recognizes only corporate

liable for it under sharia corporations can take a number of forms but most common in saudi arabia is where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise in addition company law which is based on egyptian company law identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures and limited liability partnerships labor law employers have a number of obligations including at least 21 days paid holiday after a year s employment and will be 30 days after five years of continuous service ref name ref terminated employees must receive an end of

harim land is a protective buffer between owned land and undeveloped land and is defined in case of a town as area that can be reached and returned from in a day for purposes of collecting fuel and

when it was launched in 1948 now only saudi arabia remains openly opposed to declaration in response to continuing criticism of its human rights record saudi government points to special islamic character of country and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order rule of law because sharia as applied by saudi courts is uncodified and because judges are not bound by judicial precedent scope and content of law is uncertain a study published by albert shanker institute and freedom house has criticized a number of aspects of administration of justice in saudi arabia
