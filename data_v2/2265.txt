willamette river is a major tributary of columbia river accounting for 12 to 15 percent of columbia s flow willamette s main stem is long lying entirely in northwestern oregon in united states flowing northward between oregon coast range and cascade range river and its tributaries form willamette valley a basin that contains two thirds of oregon s population including state capital salem and state s largest city portland which surrounds willamette s mouth at columbia originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion river s drainage basin was significantly modified by missoula floods at end of most recent ice age humans began living in watershed over 10 000 years ago there were once many tribal villages along lower river and in area around its mouth on columbia indigenous peoples lived throughout upper reaches of basin as well rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on western side of cascades willamette valley is one of most fertile agricultural regions in north america and was thus destination of many 19th century pioneers traveling west along oregon trail river was an important transportation route in 19th century although willamette falls just upstream from portland was a major barrier to boat traffic in 21st century major highways follow river and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges since 1900 more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in willamette s drainage basin 13 of which are operated by u s army corps of engineers usace dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity to maintain reservoirs for recreation and to prevent flooding river and its tributaries support 60 fish species including many species of salmon and trout this is
