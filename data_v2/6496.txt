are force and a lightsaber developers treated main character s lightsaber like another force power and wanted to ensure something visceral and cool happened with each button push game has a combo system for stringing lightsaber attacks and for combining lightsaber attacks with force powers experience points earned by killing enemies and finding artifacts can be used to increase starkiller s powers and traits gameplay is intended to be easy to learn development team included horrible gamers to help ensure game s accessibility players can casually run and gun through game but game rewards those who take a stealthy more tactical approach game includes enemies that are easy to overcome game difficulty arises from presenting these enemies in large numbers that can wear down player s character additionally enemies learn from player s character s attacks using same attack on different characters can sometimes lead to player s character doing less damage enemies which number over 50 have various strengths and weaknesses developers faced difficulty of effectively placing them throughout game s varied environments nintendo versions of game exclusively allow players to use motion controls to control starkiller s attacks and participate in multiplayer battles wii version uses wii remote to execute lightsaber attacks and nunchuk to wield force powers and allows two players to fight each other as any of various jedi and sith from star wars universe in one on one multiplayer duels nintendo ds version utilizes touchscreen to execute attacks where single actions can be executed by tapping a certain region of screen with each region corresponding to a particular action such as jumping or force pushing while more advanced attacks can be performed by dragging stylus across neighboring regions of screen its multiplayer mode allows up to four players who have copies of game to fight each other plot set between films revenge of sith and a new hope game begins with darth vader being sent by emperor palpatine his sith master and ruler of galactic empire to hunt down a jedi named kento marek who survived great jedi purge and is hiding on wookiee homeworld of kashyyyk throughout first level player assumes role of vader as he fights his way through wookiees in search for marek after defeating marek in battle and killing him vader discovers his child galen marek who is strong with force and raises him to become his apprentice unbeknownst to emperor years later upon reaching adulthood galen now known as starkiller and player character completes his training and vader sends him to kill remaining jedi through galaxy as a final test before his ultimate goal assassinating emperor so that vader and starkiller can rule galaxy together starkiller travels between missions aboard his personal ship rogue shadow developing a close relationship with his crew consisting of lightsaber training droid proxy and imperial pilot juno eclipse starkiller s first target is an aging jedi master named rahm kota a former general in clone wars and leader of his own military force kota and his troops attack a tie fighter shipyard in space in order to lure vader but are surprised when starkiller arrives instead fighting his way through both kota s men and imperial stormtroopers who do not know of starkiller s existence and thus attack him to reach command center where kota is located during their fight kota sees various visions of starkiller s future before being blinded by starkiller s lightsaber and falling to planet nar shaddaa below starkiller is next sent to kill an insane jedi master named kazdan paratus on raxus prime who has animated pieces of metal to create a legion of droids and uses them to guard his own replica of jedi council which paratus believes to be true and seeks to protect at all costs after fighting his way through both paratus droids and scavengers starkiller eventually battles paratus inside jedi council room and succeeds in killing him starkiller s final target is former jedi master and member of jedi council shaak ti who is hiding on felucia shaak ti mesmerizes force sensitive felucians and influences local fauna to attack starkiller at his arrival but he ultimately battles her at a sarlacc pit defeated ti warns starkiller that sith always betray one another and then jumps into sarlacc killing herself and becoming one with force his mission to hunt down jedi complete starkiller returns to vader to fulfill their ultimate goal and kill emperor however once emperor arrives vader betrays starkiller just as shaak ti predicted and kills him to prove his loyalty to his master but later secretly dispatches droids to retrieve and revive him believing that starkiller still has his uses after starkiller recovers vader sends him to foster a rebellion among those who resist empire distracting emperor so that vader can make his move despite being ordered by vader to sever all ties to his past starkiller rescues juno who has been arrested and branded a traitor to empire and they both escape aboard rogue shadow alongside proxy looking for allies to recruit into rebellion starkiller arrives on nar shaddaa and proceeds to convince rahm kota to join him who survived his earlier duel with starkiller and fall but is now a blind alcoholic after escaping from imperial forces looking for them as well as defeating for first time a force sensitive imperial guard armed with a lightsaber staff called shadow guard starkiller and kota begin their quest to recruit various senators into rebellion starting with princess leia organa on kashyyyk now occupied by imperial forces who have enslaved wookiees while on kashyyyk starkiller has a vision of his father s ghost in his old home and proceeds to fight imperial forces in area eventually killing their commander and thus liberating wookiees and convincing princess leia to join alliance starkiller next heads to felucia to leia s adoptive father senator bail organa from ti s former apprentice maris brood who has succumbed to corruption by dark side after her master s death alongside rest of planet s inhabitants felucia is also consumed by a war between felucians and imperial forces bent on exploiting planet s resources especially sarlacc making his way through conflict starkiller eventually confronts brood killing her pet rancor and defeating her in battle although he refuses to kill her after brood departs starkiller rescues organa and convinces him to join rebellion as well during this time learns about way of jedi from kota which is why he chose to spare brood s life and juno discovers that starkiller is still working for darth vader but after berating him agrees not to say anything with most important senators recruited to rebellion s cause darth vader later suggests starkiller to perform a major strike against empire to rally emperor s enemies and prove that empire is vulnerable starkiller infiltrates a star destroyer facility on raxus prime which has also been occupied by imperial forces following kazdan paratus s death and proceeds to fight his way through numerous imperials to reach facility s computer core near core starkiller is ambushed by proxy who claims that this is best moment to fulfill his programming by killing starkiller and then takes shape of various opponents to fight him including darth maul however starkiller is able to defeat proxy and then destroy facility even pulling a massive star destroyer out of sky with force eventually senators bail organa mon and garm bel iblis meet on corellia to plan a rebellion against empire but are interrupted when darth vader arrives and arrests them and kota vader attacks starkiller and reveals that his plans to overthrow emperor never included him and that starkiller was merely emperor s tool to expose his enemies vader defeats starkiller but proxy sacrifices himself to distract vader and allow him to escape after returning to rogue shadow with juno his only ally left starkiller uses force to ascertain senators and kota s location death star upon arrival starkiller shares a kiss with juno before bidding her goodbye inside space station starkiller fights his way through imperial forces to reach vader emperor and senators in throne room emperor sends vader to kill starkiller but he is able to defeat his former master and then confronts emperor who goads starkiller into killing vader while emperor is distracted kota steals his lightsaber and tries to attack him but is incapacitated by emperor s force lightning thus starkiller is left with two options rescue kota from emperor or finish off vader if player chooses light side starkiller fights and defeats emperor palpatine but kota prevents him from killing palpatine in hatred emperor renews his attack and starkiller while absorbing it sacrifices himself by opening his body to force while kota and senators escape on rogue shadow emperor and vader look over starkiller s corpse concerned that he has become a martyr to inspire newly formed rebel alliance on senator organa and others agree to proceed with their rebellion and leia decides to use starkiller s family crest as rebellion s symbol outside juno talks to kota who tells her that among starkiller s dark thoughts juno herself was one bright spot that he held onto right until his death this ending was considered canon one as it is depicted in game s novelization and follows continuity of films until it was later made part of expanded universe rebranded as star wars legends following lucasfilm s by disney in 2012 if player chooses dark side starkiller kills darth vader and is then offered by emperor to replace him if he proves himself by killing kota starkiller instead attacks emperor who effortlessly crushes starkiller with rogue shadow severely injuring him and killing kota juno and senators story ends with starkiller s broken body being grafted with armor so he can serve as emperor s assassin though palpatine assures starkiller that he like vader will be left behind when he finds a new apprentice infinities expansion content builds on this ending though george lucas confirmed at time that this ending was non canon downloadable content jedi temple mission shortly before mission on kashyyyk to recruit princess leia into rebellion starkiller feels compelled by force to make a stop on coruscant and explore now ruined jedi temple located there after fighting his way through imperial forces guarding temple starkiller reaches old council chambers where ghost of his father has him pass several jedi trials after defeating spirit of a mysterious sith warrior revealed to be a dark version of himself starkiller finds a with a message from his father who reveals his true identity to him and claims that it is not too late to return to light side afterwards starkiller returns to his ship and continues his mission having learned more about his past tatooine mission continuing on from dark side ending of game and taking place during events of a new hope starkiller now known as lord starkiller emperor s personal apprentice is sent to tatooine to gain information regarding stolen death star plans after carving his way through numerous and tusken raiders starkiller arrives at jabba hutt s palace to ask him about plans and learns that they are held by two droids currently located at mos eisley spaceport jabba then forces starkiller to fight his pet rancor but he is able to kill it and after carving his way through many of jabba s guards as well as an encounter with a hobbled proxy reaches palace hangar only to be attacked by boba fett who is looking to collect bounty on his head after killing fett starkiller arrives at mos eisley just as droids board falcon but is forced to fight obi wan kenobi starkiller manages to kill kenobi and then vanquish his force spirit but falcon takes off although starkiller is able to plant a tracking device on it hoth mission continuing on from tatooine mission and taking place during events of empire strikes back starkiller is tasked with infiltrating rebels base during battle of hoth and capture luke skywalker making his way through ice caverns swarming with numerous deadly starkiller eventually infiltrates base where he proceeds to carve through rebel soldiers in search for luke as empire emerges victorious in battle destroying rebels shield array that is protecting their base starkiller finds and duels luke but he manages to escape starkiller later confronts luke once again inside hangar and overpowers him enraging luke and causing him to fall to dark side sith lord is able to defeat luke severing his right hand just as millennium falcon attempts to escape starkiller seizes it causing luke to use force lighting to attack him and allow his friends to escape as falcon leaves starkiller congratulates luke for embracing dark side calling him his apprentice cast and characters sam witwer as galen marek starkiller child of two jedi starkiller becomes darth vader s secret apprentice and is dispatched by his master to kill jedi who survived palpatine s jedi purge although acting as a villain starkiller is really just a damaged kid developers decided not to give starkiller a name in game but novelization gives his name as galen marek although starkiller starts as vader s apprentice a focus of game is to allow character to evolve into something more heroic something greater audio director david collins saw a resemblance between starkiller concept art and his friend witwer collins asked for witwer s headshot and an audition reel and a few weeks later witwer sat for a 45 minute audition witwer secured role by demonstrating to developers his deep understanding of character in portraying starkiller witwer brought many new ideas about character and imbued him with a sense of humanity developers tried not to make starkiller so evil that players would have difficulty connecting to him force unleashed s character s name is an homage to anakin starkiller original name of character that eventually became luke skywalker matt sloan as darth vader starkiller s master who discovers starkiller as a child and trains him in addition to dispatching starkiller to kill remaining jedi vader also presents plans to unite with starkiller to overthrow emperor although there are twists and turns in this scheme events depicted in force unleashed are pivotal to darth vader s history and development nathalie cox as juno eclipse rogue shadow s pilot and starkiller s love interest eclipse was not originally part of game early concepts had apprentice as an older character who develops a connection with a young princess leia star wars creator george lucas uncomfortable with this idea encouraged developers to create a love interest apprentice who has had limited interaction with women when game begins does not at first know how to act around her her introduction early in game allows relationship with starkiller to develop and her inclusion helps recapture that rich ensemble feel of original star wars according to sean williams who wrote novelization romantic storyline is key to force unleashed name juno eclipse was originally proposed as a name for character eventually called ventress it was rejected for ventress as insufficiently villainous force unleashed project lead haden blackman brought name back for mythic quality of name juno and duality suggested by an eclipse cox in addition to strongly resembling character s concept art had integrity and poise appropriate to juno eclipse that helped actor secure role cully fredricksen as general rahm kota a jedi master who provides starkiller with additional insight into force developers realized early that starkiller would require insight into force from someone other than darth vader after rejecting idea of this coming from spirit of qui gon jinn or some version of darth they decided to fill this role with one of starkiller s jedi opponents character was conceived as a tough as nails contrast to jinn and obi wan kenobi senior concept artist amy beth christianson drew upon samurai influences for kota s appearance character changed little after being conceived fredricksen s own traits made character tougher fredricksen was first actor cast for project adrienne wilkinson as maris brood a survivor of jedi purge and shaak ti s apprentice character was originally conceived to become a pirate captain and christianson s early art included brood s lightsaber wilkinson brought strength to her performance leading to an expansion of role with more dialogue david w collins as proxy starkiller s droid sidekick collins said proxy has c 3po s innocence but also is really dangerous companion trade paperback describes conflict between proxy s primary programming to kill starkiller and its self imposed desire to help him proxy is eager to please starkiller but does not know how dangerous it can be or that there is a conflict between its programming and starkiller s wishes trying to avoid having proxy s dialogue become too reminiscent of either c 3po or villainous hk 47 of knights of old republic developers focused on proxy s friendly naivety jimmy smits as bail organa emmy award winning smits voices character he played in star wars prequels a galactic senator from and leia organa s adoptive father other performances came from larry drake as kazdan paratus susan eisenberg as shaak ti and catherine taber as princess leia organa in addition to voicing starkiller witwer also provided voice of emperor palpatine r2 d2 also makes an appearance in game alongside leia development concept thumb right first visualization of force unleashed was in this concept art by greg knight which shows a stormtrooper being force pushed game planning began in summer 2004 initially about six developers started with a clean slate to conceptualize a new star wars game small group of engineers artists and designers spent more than a year brainstorming ideas for what might make a good game over 100 initial concepts were whittled down to 20 to 25 that included making game third entry in knights of old republic series or having protagonist be a wookiee superhero darth maul a bounty hunter a smuggler a mercenary or last member of skywalker family decision to focus on largely unexplored period between revenge of sith and a new hope helped energize design team consumer feedback helped developers narrow in on seven concepts and elements from those seven went into force unleasheds overall concept production was greatly aided by concept art which was intended to visually bridge two star wars trilogies convey impression of a lived in universe show how galaxy changes under imperial rule and to seem familiar yet new an off hand comment about force in game being powerful enough to pull a star destroyer out of sky inspired an image by senior concept artist amy beth christenson that became an important part of developers idea pitches and evolved into a major moment in game these illustrations also inspired creation of dozens of simple three dimensional animations eventually a one minute previsualization video highlighting idea of kicking someone s ass with force helped convince designers that force unleashed would be a great game george lucas upon seeing one minute video told designers to go make that game once concept was solidified development team grew from ten to twenty people idea of reimagining force as amped up in force unleashed aligned with lucasarts overall goal of harnessing power of latest video game consoles to dramatically change gaming specifically through use of simulation based gameplay story in april 2005 after several months of planning lucasarts team received lucas encouragement to create a game centered on darth vader s secret apprentice in largely unexplored period between revenge of sith and a new hope drawing two trilogies together lucasarts spent six months developing story lucas spent hours discussing with developers relationship between darth vader and emperor palpatine and provided feedback on what vader would want out of and how he would motivate an apprentice lucas licensing reviewed many game details to ensure they fit into canon focus group feedback indicated that while hunting down jedi at vader s order would be fun character should be redeemed in keeping with a major star wars motif although game introduces new characters developers felt presence of characters already part of star wars would help anchor game within official continuity before game s release lucasfilm claimed it would unveil new revelations about star wars galaxy with a redemption motif story progresses through a combination of scripted events in game cinematics cutscenes and dialogue technology thumb left a euphoria coded soldier grasps a havok coded crate before both are flung through a digital molecular matter coded display during pre production about 30 people were on project team lucasarts spent several years developing tools and technology to create force unleashed prototyping level construction marketing and public relations took about a year until late 2006 production team was ascertaining how many polygons lights and characters next generation platforms supported a year of full production began in early 2007 a series of quickly produced play blast videos helped developers focus on mechanics user interface and finishing moves development of xbox 360 version came first playstation 3 development started when production team had enough development kits making game run on both playstation 3 and xbox 360 was a monumental task game is based on lucasarts proprietary ronin game engine but also integrates third party technology havok for rigid body physics entertainment s digital molecular matter dmm for dynamically destructible objects and s euphoria for realistic non player character artificial intelligence lucasarts programmers had to overcome technical hurdles to get havok dmm and euphoria coded components to interact developers also had to strike a balance between realistic and entertaining physics lucasarts initially opted not to release a personal computer version of force unleashed stating that doing game well would be too processor intensive for typical pcs and that scaling down game s procedural physics for pc platform would fundamentally change force unleasheds gameplay however lucasarts later announced windows and mac versions of game developed in conjunction with aspyr media for release in fall 2009 lacking havok euphoria and dmm krome s wii version relies on company s in house physics engine some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset in developing game krome tried to blur distinction between two lighting system in wii version is more advanced than that in ps2 version which krome also built ps2 includes more graphic details than their psp version ilm collaboration and cast performance force unleashed is intended to make players think they are actually finally in a star wars movie it is first game on which lucasarts and industrial light magic ilm collaborated since they both relocated to letterman digital arts center in san francisco california this collaboration allowed companies to co develop tools to make film quality effects lucasarts worked with ilm s zeno tool framework and helped ilm build its zed game editor accessible via game info production diaries lucas said having two companies working together in same building was a great collaboration it took senior manager of voice and audio darragh o farrell four months to cast force unleashed ilm s face and motion capture clonecam technology recorded actors voice and physical performances this led to a change in lucasarts casting process for first time actors needed to match characters age and gender actors performed their lines together rather than in isolation to better get sense of their characters interacting with each other consequently script s dialogue was reduced while reliance on characters expressions captured through clonecam increased clonecam technology had previously been used in producing pirates of caribbean movies music lucasarts music supervisor jesse harlin said music matches game s motif of redemption and goal of bridging gap between revenge of sith and a new hope game s soundtrack includes material composed by john williams for films in addition to material created specifically for force unleashed jesse harlin composed game s main theme while mark griskey composed score griskey made use of several motifs from film scores as well as harlin s main theme 90 minute soundtrack was recorded by skywalker symphony orchestra and mixed at skywalker sound in lucas valley in september and october 2007 during gameplay a proprietary engine combines musical elements according to pace plot and environment of game at any given moment resulting in a unique musical experience a promotional soundtrack album was made available online through tracksounds com in 2008 expansion two weeks after game s release lucasarts announced development on two downloadable expansion packs for playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions of game first expansion added skins that allow player s character to appear as star wars figures other than starkiller such as obi wan kenobi anakin skywalker qui gon jinn jango fett c 3po luke skywalker darth maul darth sion mace plo koon kit and ki adi mundi skins chosen to be part of expansion were based in part on fans feedback second expansion pack added a new mission that expands on starkiller s background although a moment in game s main story was considered as a jumping off point for expansion lucasarts decided instead to make new mission instantly accessible to players mission s location jedi temple on coruscant appears in wii playstation 2 and playstation portable versions of force unleashed but was cut during planning from ps3 and xbox 360 platforms tatooine downloadable content released august 27 2009 is first of two expansions that occur in an infinities storyline an alternate history in which starkiller kills vader and becomes palpatine s assassin second infinities expansion which takes place on hoth was originally only available as part of ultimate sith edition which also includes all previous downloadable content however hoth expansion was later made available for download on playstation network and xbox live

unleashed was both fastest selling star wars game and lucasarts fastest selling game force unleashed won a writers guild of america award for best video game writing playstation 3 xbox 360 and pc force unleashed received mixed to fairly positive reviews electronic gaming monthly said game is ambitious yet however gamespot said game gets more right than it does wrong ps3 review identical to xbox 360 review gamespot said pc port of game retained all of game s strengths and weaknesses but that port failed to take advantage of pc platform gamespot called game s story more intimate and more powerful than star wars franchise s prequel trilogy x play identified game s story as one of game s few bright spots and said game s visuals successfully convey star wars classic used universe feel gamepro and gamespot praised game s art and physics and gamepro also commended starkiller s cool powers ps3 review pg 2 identical to xbox360 review pg 2 ign praised game s voice acting particularly witwer s performance as starkiller washington times identified mark griskey s soundtrack as another star of game and tracksounds called it most entertaining star wars score since return of jedi time called force unleashed seventh best video game of 2008 game received gamespot s 2008 award for best use of a creative license and was nominated for best voice acting gaming target selected game as one of their 40 games we ll still be playing from 2008 conversely entertainment weekly called force unleashed second worst game of 2008 and gametrailers called it most disappointing game that year it was also a nominee for gamespot s most disappointing game recognition official xbox magazine cited game s linear gameplay and lack of multiplayer as reasons game falls short of being an all engrossing star wars experience gamestm suggested that allowing players to take a hack and slash approach means many will never view title s full potential ign and x play criticized some boss battles and enemies behavior gamepro also faulted disappointing boss battles and game s uneven combat rather than feeling more powerful as game progresses gamepro felt that increases in starkiller s powers were dampened by increasingly difficult enemy abilities and positions x play commented that despite a good level up system starkiller and his enemies are pretty much on even ground most of time wired com x play and gamespot criticized game s third person camera and sequence that requires player to make starkiller pull a star destroyer out of sky wired com speculated that lucasarts could have recognized frustration of star destroyer sequence and removed it but left it in because they hyped sequence before game s release wired com and gamespot further criticized load times and abrupt gameplay cinematic transitions gamespot also faulted loose targeting and some visual and audio glitches ign which also identified problems with targeting speculated that dmm s processor limited its use throughout game detracting from players ability to feel immersed gametrailers and ign were disappointed with lack of variety within and between levels x play pointing to default text as bonus objective description in xbox 360 version s final mission and other glitches said it seems developers one day just stopped working on game gamespot cited port s lack of visual options and poor framerate as evidence pc edition had been rushed ign described jedi academy expansion as pretty decent gamespot said lucasarts seems to have acknowledged some of game s criticisms in developing tatooine expansion but ign called level s boss fights a joke in light of player s high force powers ign found level design in ultimate sith editions hoth scenario uninteresting and called boss fight against luke skywalker tough but not nearly as fun as it could have been demo was fourth most played xbox live game during week of august 25 trailing grand theft auto iv halo 3 and call of duty 4 modern warfare it was ninth most played xbox live title throughout all of 2008 week it was released force unleashed was sixth most played game on xbox live and it rose to fifth following week in its first week on sale in australia ps3 and xbox 360 versions of force unleashed were top and second best sellers respectively in united states playstation 3 and xbox 360 version sold 325 000 and 610 000 copies respectively in september 2008 that month xbox 360 version was best selling game and playstation 3 version was fifth best selling game for their respective consoles other platforms nintendo power praised story and number of lightsaber combos but criticized game s easiness and hack and slash gameplay it also praised wii version for its story and force powers but criticized game s lightsaber controls and linear gameplay gamespot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from wii version s mature and exciting story adding that reduced number of force objects helps mitigate targeting problems experienced on other platforms referring to wii remote and nunchuck controls gamespot also speculated that force unleashed is possibly most waggle heavy wii game zero punctuation criticized wii version s graphics and compared lightsaber combat to trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills ability to upgrade starkiller s abilities in ps2 version according to ign is not as robust as it should be and game s targeting system is sometimes frustrating ign said ps2 s real time cutscene rendering made starkiller seem emotionless and that pre rendered cutscenes would have been better gamespot found ds version s plot interesting but storytelling itself lackluster while ds version is easy with starkiller killing enemies like a hot knife through butter gamespot said player s sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom gamespot called psp version s camera unwieldy but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms wii version was a nominee for multiple wii specific awards from ign in its 2008 video game awards including best story and best voice acting in week of its release wii version was sixth bestselling game in australia and was second to wii fit among games for that platform ps2 version was eighth bestseller in
