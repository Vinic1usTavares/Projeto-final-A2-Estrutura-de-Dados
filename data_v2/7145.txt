in his 13 year career was in his rookie season of 1975 playing style payton s motto was never die easy which is also title of his posthumously published autobiography payton attributed this motto to bob hill his coach at jackson state in practice this meant that payton refused to deliberately run out of bounds and always delivered some punishment to his tacklers before being forced off field or forced down one of payton s signature maneuvers was stutter step a high stepping irregularly paced run he developed this as a way to distract his pursuers during long runs saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners in his autobiography he likened stutter step to a kind of option play when he was stutter stepping defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether they thought he would accelerate after stutter step or cut he would read this angle and do opposite of what defender had committed to he re invented practice of stiff arming his tacklers which had gone out of favor among running backs in 1970s at times he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents landing on his head in end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against buffalo bills his running gait was somewhat unusual as his knees were minimally bent and motion was largely powered from hip this may have given his knees a football player s most vulnerable joints some protection although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983 he referred to this procedure as an 11 000 yard checkup after scoring touchdowns payton declined to celebrate instead he would often hand ball to his teammates or official he disapproved of growing practice of touchdown celebrations he preferred post game antics such as rushing into locker room and locking his teammates out in cold while taking a long shower although payton would have won respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone he retired
