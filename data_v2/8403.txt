crystallized remains of a powerful race known as entelexeia blastia are powered using a mystical substance known as aer and were used to provide resources and protection to major cities in ancient times misuse of blastia by krytia prompted entelexeia to absorb excess aer generated by blastia abuses consuming too much aer to handle a group of entelexeia transformed into a monster known as adephagos which would consume every living thing on planet by converting it into aer and absorbing it judith krytia stewards of wisdom founders of mighty and ancient sages our misbegotten wisdom has sown only seeds of ruin blastia we created granted us blessings but also corrupted aer lifeblood of this world estelle then rita was right there were disturbances in aer in past yuri you think this is showing a disturbance in aer karol it looks more like aer is trying to eat planet elder hmm it is said that a great mass of aer threatened to swallow very planet whole judith blight grew ever stronger and brought forth a cataclysm in our terror we gave a name to cataclysm adephagos world united challenge adephagos and banish loathsome power which created it undine you yuri undine what happened to him undine even entelexeia cannot ingest limitless amounts of aer those who ingest more than they can endure change and rita no undine become adaphagos themselves sacrificing humans with innate ability to convert aer into magical energy known as children of full moon they created a barrier to seal away adephagos remaining children of full moon and entelexeia decided on new arrangement of world in future times an unnamed empire rules over large portions of terca lumireis with children s descendants being its ruling family yuri leaders of ancients possessed an innate power and were called children of full moon shrine of zaude received their lives and power it sealed adaphagos away saving world so shrine of zaude was powered by lives of children of full moon duke humans brought for adaphagos and lead it consider it atonement few remaining children of full moon together with entelexeia decided how world would be imperial family are their descendants yuri so that s how empire started ten years prior to events of vesperia a new form of blastia was developed that could seriously damage terca lumireis ecosystem and potentially release adephagos entelexeia attempted to warn humanity in vain and when they attempted to destroy new blastia they were defeated in a war one of veterans of great war duke is utterly disillusioned with humanity after his entelexeia companion elucifer is seen as a potential threat and killed sylph great war was between humans who broke an ancient prohibition and entelexeia who opposed them raven and war ended when hero duke won victory for humans sylph humans alone could not have won that war elucifer leader of entelexeia advocating living with humans fought alongside them and granted them victory raven are you serious even i never heard that but what does this have to do with duke not trusting humans sylph elucifer was duke s friend duke fought with elucifer against leader of ones who opposed humans and defeated him however once war ended empire feared elucifer s power they assaulted injured elucifer and took his life he had promised duke that he would merely watch but i didn t matter in present former imperial knight yuri lowell goes on a mission to retrieve his neighborhood s blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails while on his mission he encounters a noble woman called estelle and flees with her from capital in pursuit of blastia thief on their journey they also meet karol a trainee hunter separated from his guild a blastia researcher named rita raven a great war veteran judith a krytia who seeks to destroy blastia harming aer balance and exclusive to ps3 version only seemingly descendant of a legendary pirate named patty fleur together group recover stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to yuri s friend and former fellow knight flynn yuri and karol then decide to form an independent guild called brave vesperia shortly after this estelle is attacked by an entelexeia called phaeroh who accuses her of poisoning planet after investigating and meeting a second time with phaeroh brave vesperia learn that estelle is a child of full moon capable of converting aer into magic without aid of a blastia core and that her actions are causing aer krene sources of aer to overproduce aer with deadly results phaeroh power of child of full moon stimulates aer krene more than any blastia yuri huh rita blastia convert aer into energy by way of a formula so if estelle can use her healing artes without aid of any blastia she must possess a formula in her very being that lets her convert aer into energy judith was looking for blastia that used a particular kind of formula so this special formula estelle has must also consume massive amounts of aer which causes aer krene to become more active and pump out more aer than they should phaeroh it is as she has said with each use of her power child of full moon uses far more aer than blastia in so doing imbalance of aer in this world is furthered for planet such an existence can only be called a poison alongside these events yuri sees that imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to abuses these acts put a strain on his friendship with flynn yuri laws have always been tools of whoever happens to hold all chips flynn just saying that doesn t make it right for individuals to judge right from wrong or for you to operate your own private court of law if laws are at fault then fixing those laws comes first it s for that very reason that i m still with imperial knights yuri but you can t deny that lives were saved because those bastards were put down you d rather tell those people sorry you have to die today i promise we ll change things soon flynn that s not what i m saying at all yuri they re out there you know people so bad they ll just go on hurting others what can average person do but be victimized by people like that you know it was same way with our people in lower quarter flynn even so yuri what you re doing isn t right do you intend to rain your justice down on all villains of world that s behavior of a common criminal yuri i recognize it for what it is and i ve made my choices murder is a crime flynn and even knowing that you intend to dirty your hands after this estelle is kidnapped by raven revealed to be an agent of commandant alexei leader of knights and mastermind behind blastia thefts alexei intends to use estelle s power and replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called enduring shrine of zaude and remake world erasing harmful blastia after raven decides to remain with brave vesperia after helping estelle to escape with them group travel to zaude to stop alexei they fail and as zaude is activated it is revealed to be a barrier generator which kept adephagos sealed off from world raven adephagos did you use that much aer alexei no this catastrophe has always waited there karol wh what do you mean judith adephagos was never eliminated it was just sealed off far from sight rita you mean zaude has been holding it back this entire time as adephagos is released alexei is killed as zaude collapses and yuri is separated from group after one of flynn s subordinates attempts to kill him without flynn s knowledge rescued by duke yuri decides to stop adaphagos during his absence rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits which can process aer into a less dangerous alternate energy called mana stabilizing aer krene and keeping estelle s powers in check in turn mana could power a weapon capable of destroying adephagos after receiving permission from world s leaders to carry out their plan brave vesperia must confront duke aboard city sized weapon duke intends to convert all of human life including himself into energy to power weapon and destroy adephagos returning world to a more primal state of being yuri duke we have four elemental spirits their power can counter adaphagos estelle there s no need to use people to destroy adaphagos duke and will world return to its former state will aer be controlled by entelexeia will all life be returned to a time when nature ruled rita no duke you are changing this world our terca lumireis for what for convenience of humans nothing more while they share some goals they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods duke we are in contradiction however our feelings for world are no different how odd yuri no it s not future we chose what we saw for future is different after defeating duke yuri attempts to use converted blastia energy against adaphagos but it proves insufficient moved by brave vesperia s efforts duke provides extra power and adaphagos is destroyed entelexeia that formed adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize planet estelle spirits karol you mean all of them awesome rita all entelexeia who became adaphagos they all transformed into these spirits raven so adaphagos was also a part of this world unbelievable a post credits scene shows brave vesperia continuing their adventures and helping world adjust to life without blastia development preliminary work for tales of vesperia began in 2005 during later development stages of tales of abyss which released that year due to success of abyss vesperia was initially planned as a title for playstation 2 however upon seeing projected lifespan of sixth generation consoles executives at namco bandai informed team that abyss would be last tales title of that generation in addition to this team felt limited by previous generation s hardware in response they decided to make next flagship installment on next generation hardware at time when a platform was chosen playstation 3 had yet to be shown to company and xbox 360 was highly popular in west so they settled on latter being on that platform team were also able to make use of xbox live enabling achievements and online ranking implementation during areas of development team were in communication with microsoft about how to best utilize platform full development began in may 2006 taking approximately two years to complete development team dubbed team symphonia was same group that developed abyss and 2003 entry tales of symphonia while designing battle system team drew inspiration from version used in abyss during early production phases team was torn between a cel shaded anime or realistic style of art direction they eventually settled on an anime style and production went fairly smoothly from there on shaders for characters were designed using game s drawing engine as opposed to hand drawn shaders of characters in abyss game s director yoshito higuchi originally wanted a realistic feel after cartoon like styling and shader techniques of abyss and wii spin off title tales of symphonia dawn of new world one of challenges this presented for background designers was adjusting for advent of lcd televisions positive aspect of this was that more colors could be displayed than on cathode ray tubes in hindsight it was felt that final effect lacked desired polish anime cutscenes were created by production i g with number and length increasing from previous titles scenario was written by takashi hasegawa who had written for multiple series entries since tales of eternia koki matsumoto who had written scenario of tales of hideo baba who had previously done work on tales of rebirth and takaaki okuda a newcomer to series game s title meant to be indicative of games theme of justice was derived from vesper a name referring to planet venus its general meaning was to depict protagonists and their ship as a newly born star shining on land similar to venus in evening sky logo was also design to convey this and term vesperia was used in game for party s airship game s main protagonist yuri lowell was created to be a more mature evolved protagonist than kyle dunamis in tales of destiny 2 or luke fon fabre in abyss his role was to facilitate growth of other characters and to have a sense of justice that did not take account of law veteran tales character designer kosuke fujishima was brought in to design main characters fujishima found designing yuri difficult while flynn proved one of easiest designs one of intentions for flynn and yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other a main character not designed by fujishima was who was designed by art director daigo okumura music music was composed by motoi sakuraba who had composed for nearly all previous tales games and his regular partner shinji tamura latter working under alias hibiki aoyama while creating soundtrack sakuraba was caught in transition between sequenced to prerecorded streamed music latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid production sequenced music had been used up to abyss so it was first time in series that sakuraba used this method although he had done so for all his other projects at time for some tracks a heavy piano element was used with sakuraba playing instrument tamura worked with sakuraba to create different feelings for various tracks character themes were melodic dungeon themes were given a simple and minimalist mood while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches in addition to original tracks three remixed tracks from other namco bandai games were included game s theme song ring a bell was sung by japanese singer songwriter bonnie pink and was first theme song to be shared by both japanese and western versions of a tales game song s subject matter inspired by game s story and themes focused on deep friendship between men and by extension love between men and women bonnie pink was chosen by producers after a long period of internal consultation they contacted warner music japan bonnie park s label company fairly early in game s production and discussed theme song s connection to story at great length bonnie pink was also chosen as part of team s plans for an international release as they wanted to create an english version of song for western release bonnie both wrote original lyrics and translated them into english arrangements of ring a bell are used in some tracks in main soundtrack but song itself is not included on soundtrack album namco tales studio tales of vesperia original soundtrack liner notes in japanese pp 10 13 warner music japan 20 august 2008 4 scans retrieved on 1 november 2015 release vesperia was first announced in december 2007 at that year s jump festa for a 2008 release in japan although its planned platform was not revealed game s characteristic genre name a recurring feature for series representative of game s theme is it represents yuri s feelings and personal goals it was announced for a 2008 overseas release on xbox 360 in february 2008 it was later confirmed that it would release for that platform in japan in a first for series team wanted to have a simultaneous worldwide release for title and so were developing localized version alongside original this process proved exhausting team were able to make skits game s extra conversation pieces fully voice in western version which they were not able to do for abyss or symphonia because of time constraints translation was done by 8 4 and dubbed by cup of tea productions game released in japan on august 7 2008 alongside standard release game was packaged with an xbox 360 premium edition game released in north america on august 26

playable character in form of patty fleur development on port began in 2008 after release of original version speaking on why port was being developed a developer who worked on vampire rain said that companies like namco bandai first developed for xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to sony then ported to ps3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features that needed to be cut from original game port was released on september 17 2009 it was later re released as part of sony s budget series release on august 2 2012 speaking in january 2010 namco bandai announced that they had no plans to release port overseas later that year yuri s english voice actor troy baker said that he had been recording new english dialogue for ps3 port a report from a namco bandai employee sparked speculation that reason behind lack of a localization was due to a deal with microsoft to keep game as an xbox 360 exclusive in western territories later she retracted this statement apologizing for creating false impressions series producer hideo baba later said that main factor in this decision was strain put on team with simultaneous release of original meaning a japan exclusive release was chosen to lessen burden this also coincided with poor marketing feedback for series in western territories definitive edition a remastered version
