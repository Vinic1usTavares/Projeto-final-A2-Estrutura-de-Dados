and buckeystown turnpike ran from its co terminus with frederick and monocacy turnpike at evergreen point at what is today junction of md 85 and md 355 south to south of buckeystown when maryland state roads commission mdsrc designated highways to be improved as part of a state road system in 1909 frederick emmitsburg highway was included in new system mdsrc originally planned to build state road north from city of frederick along frederick and turnpike then turn east along hayward road to meet frederick and emmitsburg turnpike at harmony grove mdsrc purchased frederick and emmitsburg turnpike from its operating company in 1911 first section of turnpike to be rebuilt as a modern road was between tuscarora creek north of frederick and just north of sundays lane near hansonville in 1911 old turnpike was resurfaced as a macadam road from lewistown to thurmont in 1914 and from harmony grove to lewistown in 1915 gettysburg road from emmitsburg to pennsylvania state line was also paved in 1915 gaps between thurmont and emmitsburg and between city of frederick and harmony grove were resurfaced between 1915 and 1919 frederick harmony grove road followed turnpike right of way north from s mill rather than 1910 planned route via pike right of way of frederick and buckeystown turnpike was resurfaced with macadam by 1921 remainder of buckeystown pike was paved as a concrete road from south of buckeystown to around lily pons road in 1918 and 1919 and south of lily pons road to just north of modern md 28 junction in tuscarora by 1921 concrete highway was extended south

street with asphalt from city of frederick between south city limit at new design road now stadium drive to north city limit at 9th street commission also replaced buckeystown pike s covered bridge at

of city became a northward extension of md 355 section of buckeystown pike from freeway to evergreen point became a section of md 806 in 1960 us 15 from md 26 interchange to harmony grove was expanded to a divided highway frederick freeway gained exit numbers in 1965 same year highway s interchange with 7th street was added exit numbers ranged from 1 at freeway s interchange with md 144 east of frederick to 9 at highway s interchange with md 26 7th street interchange became exit 7a two lane section of freeway was expanded to its present four lane configuration in 1969 same year us 340 freeway was completed between jefferson and frederick us 15 s present alignment from point of rocks to us 340 was also under construction by 1969 when new highway opened in 1970 us 15 was moved to new highway and joined us 340 in a concurrency along jefferson national pike from jefferson to frederick freeway old section of us 15 from point of rocks to tuscarora became a westward extension of md 28 buckeystown pike from md 28 to washington national pike was designated md 85 which was extended north to md 355 following year u s highway s interchange with mt zion road opened in 1972 bypasses and expansion north of frederick thumb right us 15 northbound past md 140 in emmitsburg us 15 was widened from downtown thurmont north to owens creek starting in 1953 that same year highway was relocated as first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from owens creek to just south of intersection of us 15 with st anthony and orndorff roads south of mount st mary s university in 1956 construction began on thurmont bypass which was constructed as first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from south of catoctin furnace to just south of owens creek bypass which included an interchange with md 77 was completed in 1958 md 77 interchange originally consisted of one two way ramp in northeast quadrant of junction old alignment of us 15 through catoctin furnace and thurmont was designated md 806 by 1960 us 15 s interchange with md 550 was built in 1972 several other sections of us 15 were bypassed in 1960s highway bypassed lewistown in 1962 leaving behind its old alignment of bridge road and angleberger road which became a section of md 806 construction on u s highway s bypass of emmitsburg began in 1963 following year portion of us 15 from northern end of bypass to pennsylvania state line opened contemporaneously with us 15 s bypass of gettysburg emmitsburg bypass was completed in 1965 old road through town was designated us 15 business by 1967 md 140 s overpass of us 15 was

expanded to four lanes from md 355 at harmony grove to angleberger road in lewistown in 1973 four laning of us 15 continued in 1981 when highway was expanded from intersection with st anthony and orndorff roads south of mount st mary s university to just south of pennsylvania state line near emmitsburg this section of divided highway was extended south through md 550 interchange in 1983 as part of this project oblique intersection with md 806 on north side of thurmont was removed md 806 was moved onto albert staub road which was extended north over a new crossing of owens creek to its present terminus at roddy creek road where local traffic could access us 15 at a perpendicular intersection two lane highway between lewistown and md 550 was expanded to a four lane divided highway in 1985 md 77 interchange was completed with construction of southbound us 15 ramps in southwest quadrant of junction a third interchange was added on south side of thurmont as a connector between us 15 and md 806 in 1985 as well us 15 s expansion to a four lane divided highway north of frederick was completed in 1989 when piece of highway at pennsylvania state line was expanded to four lanes contemporaneous with four laning of gettysburg bypass recent and future projects us 15 in frederick is a subject of i 270 us 15 multi modal corridor study which encompasses corridor of two highways from i 270 s interchange with shady grove road in montgomery county to north of us 15 s intersection with biggs ford road north of frederick study was started by maryland state highway administration mdsha and maryland transportation authority in mid 1990s to examine upgrades to highway and transit infrastructure within corridor as part of another long term project initiated by i 70 corridor planning study jefferson national pike s interchange with i 70 which was constructed with two ramps in 1969 received two ramps from eastbound i 70 in 1997 that same year access from northbound us 15 and us 340 to westbound i 70 was added at frederick freeway interchange exit numbers on us 15 s portions of jefferson national pike and frederick freeway were changed to their present numbers in 2002 interchange between jefferson national pike and frederick freeway was transformed from a cloverleaf to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2004 access between us 15 and northern end of md 355 then named mill road was removed in 2006 same year a ramp was added from westbound md 26 to northbound us 15 roundabout at us 15 md 464 intersection in point of rocks was built in 2009 mdsha replaced motter avenue s bridge over us 15 because concrete deck of old bridge was deteriorating and four lane width of bridge was insufficient for traffic it carried new bridge has four through traffic lanes bike lanes and continuous left turn lanes replacement bridge is long enough to accommodate future widening of us 15 construction began in spring 2012 and was completed in spring of 2015 new bridge was built in two sections one half of bridge was constructed immediately to north of old bridge then traffic was moved to half bridge and old bridge removed and other half of new bridge was constructed in place of removed bridge in 2011 mdsha completed a study to examine constructing an interchange at monocacy boulevard on north side of frederick to replace present directional crossover intersection design work then occurred on a diamond interchange with municipal highway which serves as a circumferential arterial in northeastern part of city monocacy boulevard was extended west to north south thomas johnson drive and meet eastern end of christophers crossing which is a circumferential boulevard throughout northwestern frederick as part of this project us 15 s intersection with hayward road was removed resulting in northern end of us 15 s freeway section being extended from md 26 to tuscarora creek interchange with monocacy boulevard christophers crossing was completed in 2018 in 2015 an
