thumb upright 1 25 a coral outcrop on great barrier reef australia corals are marine invertebrates within class anthozoa of phylum cnidaria they typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps corals species include important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton a coral group is a colony of myriad genetically identical polyps each polyp is a sac like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in length a set of tentacles surround a central mouth opening an exoskeleton is excreted near base over many generations colony thus creates a large skeleton characteristic of species individual heads grow by asexual reproduction of polyps corals also breed sexually by spawning polyps of same species release gametes simultaneously over a period of one to several nights around a full moon although some corals are able to catch small fish and plankton using stinging cells on their tentacles most corals obtain majority of their energy and nutrients from photosynthetic unicellular dinoflagellates in genus symbiodinium that live within their tissues these are commonly known as zooxanthellae such corals require sunlight and grow in clear shallow water typically at depths less than corals are major contributors to physical structure of coral reefs that develop in tropical and subtropical waters such as great barrier reef off coast of queensland australia other corals do not rely on zooxanthellae and can live in much deeper water with cold water genus surviving as deep as some have been found as far north as darwin mounds northwest of cape wrath scotland and others off coast of washington state and aleutian islands taxonomy aristotle s pupil theophrastus described red coral in his book on stones implying it was a mineral but he described it as a deep sea plant in his enquiries on plants where he also mentions large stony plants that reveal bright flowers when under water in gulf of heroes pliny elder stated boldly that several sea creatures including sea nettles and sponges are neither animals nor plants but are possessed of a third nature tertius natura petrus gyllius copied pliny introducing term for this third group in his 1535 book on french and latin names of fishes of marseilles region it is popularly but wrongly supposed that aristotle created term gyllius further noted following aristotle how hard it was to define what was a plant and what was an animal persian polymath al biruni d 1048 classified sponges and corals as animals arguing that they respond to touch nevertheless people believed corals to be plants until eighteenth century when william herschel used a microscope to establish that coral had characteristic thin cell membranes of an animal light of reason 8 august 2006 02 00 bbc four presently corals are classified as certain species of animals within sub classes hexacorallia and octocorallia of class anthozoa in phylum cnidaria hexacorallia includes stony corals and these groups have polyps that generally have a 6 fold symmetry octocorallia includes blue coral and soft corals and species of octocorallia have polyps with an eightfold symmetry each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries fire corals are not true corals being in order sometimes known as of class hydrozoa anatomy thumb anatomy of a stony coral polyp corals are sessile animals and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle body unit of animal is a polyp most corals are colonial initial polyp budding to produce another and colony gradually developing from this small start in stony corals also known as hard corals polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect organism this is deposited by polyps and by coenosarc living tissue that connects them polyps sit in cup shaped depressions in skeleton known as corallites colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance a single species may adopt an encrusting plate like bushy columnar or massive solid structure various forms often being linked to different types of habitat with variations in light level and water movement being significant soft corals soft corals have no solid exoskeleton per se however their tissues are often reinforced by small supportive elements known as sclerites made of calcium carbonate soft corals vary considerably in form and most are colonial a few soft corals are but polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc def and in some species these sheets are thick and polyps deeply embedded in them some soft corals encrust other sea objects or form lobes others are tree like or whip like and chem a central axial skeleton embedded at its base in matrix of supporting branch these branches are composed either of a fibrous protein called or of a calcified material in both stony and soft corals polyps can be retracted with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence soft corals generally secrete toxins to ward off predators stony corals thumb montastraea cavernosa polyps with tentacles extended polyps of stony corals have six fold symmetry while those of soft corals have eight mouth of each polyp is surrounded by a ring of tentacles in stony corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules in some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle like appearance in most corals tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate corals supplementing their plankton diet with products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts polyps interconnect by a complex and well developed system of gastrovascular canals allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts coral skeletons are mineral organics ca carbonate in form of calcite or aragonite in scleractinian corals centers of calcification and fibers are clearly distinct structures differing with respect to both morphology and chemical compositions of crystalline units organic matrices extracted from diverse species are acidic and comprise proteins sugars and lipids they are species specific soluble organic matrices of skeletons allow to differentiate zooxanthellae and non zooxanthellae specimens ecology left thumb discharge mechanism of a stinging cell nematocyst feeding polyps feed on a variety of small organisms from microscopic zooplankton to small fish polyp s tentacles immobilize or kill prey using stinging cells called nematocysts these cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism a dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching trigger a flap operculum opens and its stinging apparatus fires barb into prey venom is injected through hollow filament to immobilise prey tentacles then manoeuvre prey into stomach once prey is digested stomach reopens allowing elimination of waste products and beginning of next hunting cycle intracellular symbionts many corals as well as other cnidarian groups such as sea anemones form a symbiotic relationship with a class of dinoflagellate algae zooxanthellae of genus symbiodinium which can form as much as 30 of tissue of a polyp typically each polyp harbors one species of alga and coral species show a preference for symbiodinium young corals are not born with zooxanthellae but acquire algae from surrounding environment including water column and local sediment main benefit of zooxanthellae is their ability to photosynthesize which supplies corals with products of photosynthesis including glucose glycerol and amino acids which corals can use for energy zooxanthellae also benefit corals by aiding in calcification for coral skeleton and waste removal in addition to soft tissue microbiomes are also found in coral s mucus and in stony corals skeleton with latter showing greatest microbial richness corals and their microbiomes evolved together penn state university zooxanthellae benefit from a safe place to live and consume polyp s carbon dioxide phosphate and nitrogenous waste due to strain algae can put on polyp stress on coral often drives them to eject algae mass ejections are known as coral bleaching because algae contribute to coral coloration some colors however are due to host coral pigments such as green fluorescent proteins ejection increases polyp s chance of surviving short term stress and if stress subsides they can regain algae possibly of a different species at a later time if stressful conditions persist polyp eventually dies zooxanthellae are located within coral cytoplasm and due to algae s photosynthetic activity internal ph of coral can be raised this behavior indicates that zooxanthellae are responsible to some extent for metabolism of their host corals reproduction corals can be both gonochoristic unisexual and hermaphroditic each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually reproduction also allows coral to settle in new areas reproduction is coordinated by chemical communication sexual thumb upright 1 75 life cycles of broadcasters and brooders corals predominantly reproduce sexually about 25 of hermatypic corals stony corals form single sex gonochoristic colonies while rest are hermaphroditic broadcasters about 75 of all hermatypic corals broadcast spawn by releasing gametes eggs and sperm into water to spread offspring gametes fuse during fertilization to form a microscopic larva called a planula typically pink and elliptical in shape a typical coral colony forms several thousand larvae per year to overcome odds against formation of a new colony thumb a male great star coral montastraea cavernosa releasing sperm into water synchronous spawning is very typical on coral reef and often even when multiple species are present all corals spawn on same night this synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet corals rely on environmental cues varying from species to species to determine proper time to release gametes into water cues involve temperature change lunar cycle day length and possibly chemical signalling synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation immediate cue is most often sunset which cues release spawning event can be visually dramatic clouding usually clear water with gametes brooders brooding species are most often ahermatypic not reef building in areas of high current or wave action brooders release only sperm which is negatively buoyant sinking on to waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks synchronous spawning events sometimes occur even with these species after fertilization corals release planula that are ready to settle thumb left generalized life cycle of corals via sexual reproduction planula larvae exhibit positive swimming towards light to reach surface waters where they drift and grow before descending to seek a hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony they also exhibit positive moving towards sounds that emanate from reef and away from open water high failure rates afflict many stages of this process and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony few new colonies form time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days but can be up to two months larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth asexual thumb right basal plates of annularis showing multiplication by budding small central plate and division large double plate within a coral head genetically identical polyps reproduce asexually either by budding or by dividing whether longitudinally or transversely budding involves splitting a smaller polyp from an adult as new polyp grows it forms its body parts distance between new and adult polyps grows and with it coenosarc common body of colony budding can be intratentacular from its oral discs producing same sized polyps within ring of tentacles or extratentacular from its base producing a smaller polyp division forms two polyps that each become as large as original longitudinal division begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron body effectively splitting along its length mouth divides and new tentacles form two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton transversal division occurs when polyps and exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts this means one has basal disc bottom and other has oral disc top new polyps must separately generate missing pieces asexual reproduction offers benefits of high reproductive rate delaying senescence and replacement of dead modules as well as geographical distribution colony division whole colonies can reproduce asexually forming two colonies with same genotype possible mechanisms include fission bailout and fragmentation fission occurs in some corals especially among family fungiidae where colony splits into two or more colonies during early developmental stages bailout occurs when a single polyp abandons colony and settles on a different substrate to create a new colony fragmentation involves individuals broken from colony during storms or other disruptions separated individuals can start new colonies reefs thumb upright 1 5 locations of coral reefs around world many corals in order scleractinia are hermatypic meaning that they are involved in building reefs most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in genus symbiodinium these are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight reef forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water they secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become framework of reef however not all reef building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae and some deep water species living at depths to which light cannot penetrate form reefs but do not harbour symbionts

coral from devonian era tabulate corals occur in limestones and calcareous shales of ordovician and silurian periods and often form low cushions or branching masses of calcite alongside rugose corals their numbers began to decline during middle of silurian period and they became extinct at end of permian period rugose or horn corals became dominant by middle of silurian period and became extinct early in triassic period rugose corals existed in solitary and colonial forms and were also composed of calcite scleractinian corals filled niche vacated by extinct rugose and tabulate species their fossils may be found in small numbers in rocks from triassic period and became common in jurassic and later periods scleractinian skeletons are composed of a form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite although they are geologically younger than tabulate and rugose corals aragonite of their skeletons is less readily preserved and their fossil record is accordingly less complete at certain times in geological past corals were very abundant like modern corals these ancestors built reefs some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks fossils of fellow reef dwellers algae

climate research annual growth bands in some corals such as deep sea bamboo corals isididae may be among first signs of effects of ocean acidification on marine life growth rings allow geologists to construct year by year chronologies a form of incremental dating which underlie high resolution records of past climatic and environmental changes using geochemical techniques certain species form communities called microatolls which are colonies whose top is dead and mostly above water line but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive average tide level limits their height by analyzing various growth morphologies microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change fossilized microatolls can also be dated using radiocarbon dating such methods can help to reconstruct holocene sea levels increasing sea temperatures in tropical regions 1 degree c last century have caused major coral bleaching death and therefore shrinking coral populations since although they are able to adapt and acclimate it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers though coral have large sexually reproducing populations their evolution can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction gene flow is variable among coral species according to biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot be counted on as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms also coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity however adaptation to climate change has been demonstrated in many cases these are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes these shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae scientists found that a certain scleractinian is becoming more common where sea temperature is high symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly implying an evolutionary trade off in gulf of mexico where sea temperatures are rising cold sensitive staghorn and elkhorn coral have shifted in location not only have symbionts and specific species been shown to shift but there seems to be a certain growth rate favorable to selection slower growing but more heat tolerant corals have become more common changes in temperature and acclimation are complex some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to disparity in environment even if eventually temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations this separation of populations by climatic barriers
