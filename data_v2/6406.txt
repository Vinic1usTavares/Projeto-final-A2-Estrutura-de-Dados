mythicomyces is a fungal genus in family mythicomycetaceae a monotypic genus it contains single species mythicomyces corneipes first described by elias fries in 1861 fungus produces fruit bodies with shiny yellowish orange to tawny caps that are in diameter these are supported by stems measuring long and 1 2 mm thick a rare to uncommon species it is found in northern temperate regions of north america and europe where it typically fruits in groups in wet areas of coniferous forests there are several species with which m corneipes might be confused due to a comparable appearance or similar range and habitat but microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish between them taxonomy genus mythicomyces was circumscribed in 1986 by mycologists scott redhead and alexander h smith to contain species originally named agaricus corneipes by elias magnus fries in 1861 fries described species from collections made in a fir forest near sweden it was subsequently recorded in north america northwestern usa by andrew price morgan in 1907 and several times by smith when listing synonyms of species redhead and smith cited publication year of fries s work as 1863 instead of correct 1861 which rendered their new combination invalid according to rules of international code of botanical nomenclature although generic name was valid binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011 in its taxonomic history species has also been placed in by lucien quelet in 1886 and psilocybe by petter karsten in 1879 psilocybe specialist gaston guzman excluded taxon from latter genus in his 1983 monograph based on its roughened spores that lacked a germ pore pale spore print stem texture and tawny basal mycelium guzman who examined smith s us collections suggested that material might be more appropriately considered a galerina but redhead and smith noted that several features of mythicomyces corneipes are inconsistent with placement in galerina including spore print color presence of metuloids stem texture and tawny basal mycelium redhead and smith placed genus in strophariaceae as biology of fruit bodies and spore print color fit broad concept of that family envisaged by robert kuhner in 1984 they noted however that genus did not fit well in a more restricted concept of family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls more recently taxonomic authorities have placed genus in family psathyrellaceae molecular analysis showed it to be most closely allied to this family where mythicomyces and stagnicola form a clade that is sister to rest of family in 2019 family mythicomycetaceae was recognized for two genera mythicomyces and stagnicola description thumb left a collection from washington usa cap is initially somewhat conical with margins rolled inward and expands to become bell shaped or broadly convex in maturity reaching a diameter of cap sometimes has an umbo which is rounded to conical color of cap ranges from dull to bright orange when young to yellowish brown tawny in maturity it is hygrophanous and color fades to yellowish buff cap surface is smooth and polished and somewhat translucent such that radial gill lines can be seen on margin gills are closely spaced and have two tiers of interspersed lamellulae short gills gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to stem although gills tend to secede separate from stem in maturity they are initially pallid to whitish in color before turning brownish when spores mature smooth stem measures long by 1 2 mm thick yellowish to pale orange near top and dark reddish brown below it has tawny mycelium at base in maturity stem turns black from base upward in 1907 morgan noted stipe to be remarkably similar to that of marasmius cohaerens mushroom flesh has an odor that ranges from indistinct to somewhat of geraniums while its taste is indistinct to faintly bitter edibility of mushroom is unknown thumb right mythicomyces corneipes jpg spores spore print is pale purplish brown spores are ovoid egg shaped to somewhat ellipsoidal binucleate visible when stained with acetocarmine solution often contain a single oil droplet and measure 6 8 5 by 4 5 5 um spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges and have a small plage basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped four spored and measure 24 26 by 6 8 5 um cystidia on gill face pleurocystidia are abundant they are spindle shaped with swollen middles and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals they have dimensions of 43 86 by 10 24 um with walls that are pale brown to translucent and up to 3 um thick cystidia on gill edge cheilocystidia are roughly same morphologically but shorter cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1 4 um in diameter clamp connections are present in hyphae similar species stagnicola perplexa is similar in appearance and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to mythicomyces corneipes s perplexa generally has a more faded coloration and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics as stagnicola has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses phaeocollybia attenuata might be confused with m corneipes phaeocollybia attenuata can readily be differentiated in field by long pseudorhiza extending below substrate and microscopically by much more heavily ornamented globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia other morphologically similar species include hypholoma and h but unlike m corneipes both of these agarics have smooth spores yellow chrysocystidia and lack metuloids lookalike galerina is found in washington michigan and sweden where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs it has distinct microscopic characteristics such as a wider range of widths 20 40 um and a lack of pleurocystidia habitat and distribution mythicomyces corneipes is a saprobic fungus and uses plant debris usually bits of wood as a substrate fruit bodies appear in autumn and grow in groups among mosses in moist habitats such as near edges of bogs or under conifers or birch in soil wet from spring flooding it has been recorded from north america where it is most common in pacific northwest region and europe where it is rare but widespread across northern part of continent in 1938 smith called species extremely rare references category fungi of europe category fungi of north america category monotypic agaricales genera
