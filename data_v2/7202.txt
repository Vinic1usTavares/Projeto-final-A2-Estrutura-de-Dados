algeciras campaign sometimes known as battle or battles of algeciras was an attempt by a french naval squadron from toulon under contre admiral charles linois to join a french and spanish fleet at cadiz during june and july 1801 during french revolutionary war prior to a planned operation against either egypt or portugal to reach cadiz french squadron had to pass british naval base at gibraltar which housed squadron tasked with blockading cadiz british squadron was commanded by rear admiral sir james saumarez after a successful voyage between toulon and gibraltar in which a number of british vessels were captured squadron anchored at algeciras a fortified port city within sight of gibraltar across gibraltar bay on 6 july 1801 saumarez attacked anchored squadron in first battle of algeciras although severe damage was inflicted on all three french ships of line none could be successfully captured and british were forced to withdraw without hms hannibal which had grounded and was subsequently seized by french in aftermath of first battle both sides set about making urgent repairs and calling up reinforcements on 9 july a fleet of five spanish and one french ship of line and several frigates arrived from cadiz to safely escort linois s squadron to cadiz and british at gibraltar redoubled their efforts to restore their squadron to fighting service in evening of 12 july french and spanish fleet sailed from algeciras and british force followed them catching trailing ships in second battle of algeciras and opening fire at 11 20 a confused night action followed in which british ship hms superb cut through disorganised allied rearguard followed by rest of saumarez s force in confusion one french ship was captured a spanish frigate sank and two huge 112 gun spanish first rates collided and exploded killing as many as 1 700 men following morning french ship formidable came under attack at rear of combined squadron but successfully drove off pursuit and reached cadiz safely ultimately french and spanish fleets were successful in their aim of uniting at cadiz albeit after heavy losses but they were still under blockade and in no position to realise either egyptian or portuguese plans two battles generally regarded as a single linked battle mostert p 408 proved decisive in cementing british control of mediterranean sea and condemning french army in egypt to defeat totally unsupported by reinforcements from french navy background on 1 august 1798 a british fleet surprised and almost completely destroyed french mediterranean fleet at battle of nile in aftermath of successful french invasion of egypt this immediately reversed strategic situation in mediterranean sea eliminating french fleet based at toulon as a significant threat and granting british and their allies in war of second coalition naval dominance in region gardiner p 58 over next three years british and allied squadrons enforced blockades against all significant french and spanish naval bases in region including alexandria corfu and malta but particularly significant harbours at toulon and cadiz this drastically limited movement of french troops and military materials across mediterranean with result that malta and corfu were captured and army in egypt was steadily reduced in size and effectiveness gardiner p 16 in january 1801 in an attempt to increase size of french mediterranean fleet and to reinforce beleaguered egyptian garrison first consul napoleon bonaparte ordered a squadron of seven ships of line to sail from brest on atlantic coast to mediterranean under rear admiral honore ganteaume james p 87 squadron made three unsuccessful attempts to reach egypt eventually retiring to toulon in late july 1801 during final effort ganteaume s squadron sailed from toulon on 27 april 1801 with instructions to briefly secure local naval supremacy around elba to allow a seabourne invasion to go ahead before travelling on into eastern mediterranean woodman p 158 during these operations ganteaume discovered that several ships in his force were dangerously undermanned and therefore decided to consolidate his crews and send three ships of line formidable indomptable and desaix and frigate creole back to toulon james p 93 presence of this force at toulon enabled french to plan a secondary operation using ganteaume s new arrivals a deal had been brokered earlier in year between bonaparte and charles iv of spain for spanish government to provide six ships of line from cadiz fleet to french navy orders were given that new squadron at cadiz was to be joined by three ships of line detached from ganteaume s squadron as well as frigate under overall command of rear admiral charles linois this force of nine french ships accompanied by six promised vessels from spanish fleet was then to fulfil one of two mooted plans first was a large scale attack on lisbon portugal and spain were engaged in war of oranges and lisbon was a major british trading port french admiral kerguelen had estimated some years earlier that an attack there could seize as much as 2 millions of british goods and shipping other planned operation adopted following end of war of oranges on 2 june was for force to resupply egypt using soldiers stationed at italian ports james p 112 to facilitate transfer of spanish ships to french control napoleon ordered contre admiral pierre dumanoir le pelley to sail to cadiz le pelley arrived at spanish port on 13 june in frigates libre and indienne with sailors to begin manning newly purchased ships and commodore julien le ray to command them his arrival was noted by british blockade squadron off cadiz under rear admiral sir james saumarez a veteran of battle of nile and one of lord nelson s famous band of brothers le pelley s ships were chased by hms superb and hms venerable but french admiral managed to evade his pursuers and reach cadiz safely james p 123 saumarez had been ordered to cadiz in may 1801 with orders not only to blockade spanish fleet but also specifically to watch for an attempt by a french squadron to link with spanish fleet at cadiz musteen p 33 linois s voyage thumb right a map of bay of gibraltar c 1750 showing algeciras left and gibraltar there is roughly of open water between them linois sailed from toulon on 13 june 1801 with three ships of line and one frigate carrying 1 560 soldiers under brigadier general devaux clowes p 458 ganteaume s earlier expedition was still in eastern mediterranean and so british blockade force under sir john borlase warren detailed to watch toulon was instead off malta hoping to intercept ganteaume on his return james p 113 therefore only british ships on hand when linois emerged from port were a few frigates which were easily chased away by larger warships of french squadron linois s passage was slow facing winds from southwest that delayed his squadron so that by 30 june they were only off cape de gata in alboran sea on 1 july they were spotted from gibraltar although only warship there was 14 gun hms calpe under captain george dundas which was unable to influence their advance instead captain dundas ordered lieutenant richard janvarin to take a boat and communicate with cadiz blockade force of seven ships of line under saumarez clowes p 459 linois passed gibraltar on 3 july and during night discovered 14 gun brig hms speedy a short distance ahead linois s squadron had captured a number of merchant vessels during their voyage but this was their first warship and although it was no match for size speedy was an infamous vessel under command of captain lord cochrane cochrane had spent last year raiding spanish coast with great success taking or destroying more than 50 ships including celebrated action of 6 may 1801 in which cochrane had attacked and captured far larger spanish privateer frigate off barcelona cochrane s initial belief that strange ships were spanish treasure vessels caused him to bring speedy closer to ships and by time he realised his error escape was impossible adkins p 92 rather than surrender however cochrane threw all of his guns and excessive weight overboard and manoeuvered his ship to avoid coming into range of french broadsides he then attempted to cut directly between approaching formidable and desaix small target avoiding concentrated fire of french ships and pulling into open water at this commodore jean anne christy palliere on desaix swung his ship about and pursued several shots damaging speedy s sails and rigging as speedy slowed desaix overtook small brig and fired a full broadside at close range harvey p 58 this was fired as french ship was on and therefore missed deck entirely and failed to cause a single casualty it did however tear away remaining rigging and sails leaving speedy unmanageable rather than suffer another broadside cochrane surrendered his ship and was taken aboard desaix where christy palliere acknowledged his brave defence by refusing to accept cochrane s surrendered sword with words i will not accept sword of an officer who has for so many hours struggled against impossibility harvey p 59 from cochrane linois learned of saumarez s presence ahead of him and knowing that his presence would have been reported by garrison at gibraltar musteen p 32 his squadron returned eastwards around cabrita point and came to anchor at algeciras a fortified spanish port which lay directly opposite and within sight of gibraltar across bay of gibraltar on 4 july woodman p 161 off cadiz squadron under saumarez was notified of linois s arrival by lieutenant janvarin at 02 00 on 5 july and immediately turned back towards gibraltar tacking against wind frigate hms thames was detached and sent westwards to mouth of guadalquivir river to collect hms superb under captain richard goodwin keats which was blockading river with small brig hms pasley clowes p 460 keats did follow saumarez back to algeciras and was in distantly in sight when battle commenced but on hearing an inaccurate report from an american merchant ship that linois had escaped bay and was at sea once more keats reasoned that french must be returning to toulon and that he would be in a better position returning to blockade of cadiz than attempting to join saumarez s chase james p 124 lugger hms plymouth was also detached to lisbon with despatches for admiralty informing them of saumarez s intentions british admiral knowing that linois was still anchored in bay intended to descend on algeciras immediately but was beset by a series of calm spells that prevented his squadron from doing more than slowly drifting eastwards away from superb and towards algeciras it was not until morning of 6 july therefore that saumarez was in a position to attack anchored french squadron mostert p 404 in anticipation of saumarez s arrival linois had formed his squadron into a strong defensive position three ships of line anchored in a line north to south across in shallow waters off mouth of algeciras harbour protected by spanish forts at either extremity and around town itself where was anchored in shallower water linois led line himself in formidable but despatched parties from crews of ships of line to augment spanish defences first battle of algeciras thumb upright 1 1 right algeciras 6 juillet 1802 alfred morel fatio alt at 07 00 saumarez ordered his squadron to advance into bay without delay and engage french directly attack to be led by captain samuel hood in hms venerable hood was delayed by light winds however and first ship into action was hms pompee under captain charles stirling which attacked anchored french ships in succession before anchoring close to formidable james p 115 pompee was followed by hms audacious saumarez s flagship hms caesar and hms hannibal with venerable and hms spencer participating at a greater distance due to unreliable wind clowes p 461 by 10 00 both squadrons were fully engaged except for pompee at head of british line which had been caught by a current and swung so that ship s bow was facing formidable s broadside allowing linois to rake british ship james p 116 seeing danger stirling was in saumarez ordered captain solomon ferris to take hannibal around head of french line and rake formidable in light wind ferris took almost an hour to reach head of lines but as he turned inshore hannibal grounded on a shoal directly under guns of spanish fort at torre de almirante clowes p 463 saumarez ordered his squadron s boats to assist hannibal and pompee both of which were trapped under heavy fire and unable to effectively respond as he did so linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into shallows away from becalmed british squadron formidable successfully completed manoeuvre but both desaix and indomptable grounded inshore where they were exposed to heavy fire from saumarez s ships which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents james p 117 at 13 35 however saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under fire of spanish batteries with squadron s boats either sunk or employed towing pompee back to gibraltar there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against spanish forts and saumarez reluctantly called attack off remainder of squadron retiring to but leaving stranded hannibal in bay of gibraltar gardiner p 89 hannibal had been exposed to combined french and spanish fire for four hours and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded in an effort to preserve lives of his crew ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks but at 14 00 fires broke out on ship and ferris isolated by saumarez s withdrawal surrendered his ship mostert p 405 french boarding parties extinguished fires and rehung struck ensign upside down to signify that hannibal had surrendered however in royal navy an inverted flag is a signal of distress and at least one british ship s boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to ferris before misunderstanding was realised clowes p 464 french victory had come at a heavy cost more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three french ships had been severely damaged among dead were captains of both formidable and indomptable although linois was unhurt clowes p 465 spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five gunboats had been destroyed batteries and town had also been badly damaged in fighting james p 119 british losses were also heavy with more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded most of which had been lost on hannibal and pompee in addition to loss of hannibal pompee was severely damaged and remainder of british squadron all required urgent repairs interlude immediately following battle linois used overland messengers to request assistance of spanish fleet at cadiz under admiral jose de mazzaredo gardiner p 91 linois and saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of action at gibraltar wounded were transferred to naval hospital and dead buried in gravesite later to be known as trafalgar cemetery musteen p 41 saumarez ordered that most damaged of surviving ships pompee and caesar be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible a situation made necessary in part due to seizure of many of gibraltar s shipwrights in bay of gibraltar when they were sent to aid hannibal in last stages of battle mostert p 406 entire squadron needed extensive repairs their requirements met by captain alexander ball naval commissioner at gibraltar musteen p 43 captain jahleel brenton of caesar protested this order and saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs caesar s crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout night for next week to ensure that when saumarez sailed again caesar sailed with him crew having replaced ship s damaged masts in just four days james p 125 saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to algeciras to arrange for repatriation under parole of ferris and his officers following a brief correspondence between linois and british admiral captured british officers including ferris and cochrane were sent to gibraltar later joined by wounded british sailors captured on hannibal james p 122 ferris was immediately sent to britain on hms plymouth with despatches to await court martial for loss of his ship musteen p 45 he and his officers were completely exonerated james p 123 linois also began a programme of refloating and making extensive repairs to his ships including captured hannibal which he renamed jury masts were set up on battered hulk although such extensive repairs were required that when linois sailed a week later ship was still only just seaworthy and was sent back to algeciras james p 126 in cadiz despite spanish hesitation messages from linois coupled with strong representations from le pelley prompted mazzaredo to order a squadron to sea on morning of 9 july commanded by vice admiral don and including two very large first rate ships of line real carlos and san hermenegildo each mustering 112 guns clowes p 466 remainder of squadron consisted of a 96 gun spanish ship an 80 gun spanish ship a 74 gun spanish ship as well as 74 gun ship saint antoine which a few days earlier had been spanish san antonio first of purchased ships of line to be commissioned into french navy saint antoine s crew was drawn from men brought to cadiz on frigates libre and indienne supplemented by a number of spanish sailors and commanded by commodore le ray accompanying squadron were frigates libre spanish sabina and french lugger vautour departure of this combined squadron was observed by captain keats on superb which after returning to cadiz had retained station off port with hms thames and hms pasley thames was inshore searching a seized american merchant ship and witnessed emergence of squadron retreating before four ships of line that approached british frigate superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of line and two frigates reconstituting his small squadron in wake of moreno s force musteen p 42 keats immediately sent pasley ahead to gibraltar to warn saumarez brig arriving at 15 00 closely followed by main body of combined squadron from which saint antoine had detached during departure from cadiz and was following behind shadowed by superb moreno s squadron anchored in bay of gibraltar out of reach of british batteries on gibraltar and waited there for linois to complete his repairs saint antoine joining squadron on morning of 10 july gardiner p 92 keats then brought his ships into gibraltar where efforts to repair squadron were increased with knowledge that moreno would soon be sailing to cadiz with linois squadron saumarez concerned by size of combined squadron sent urgent messages to mediterranean fleet under lord keith in eastern mediterranean requesting support in belief that moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to condition of linois s ships saumarez was wrong moreno planned to convoy battered squadron short distance to cadiz as soon as they were seaworthy second battle of algeciras thumb hms superb sails

combined french and spanish squadron put to sea followed closely by british squadron both sides took most of day to assemble hampered by light winds and damaged warships but at 19 00 moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards open ocean and cadiz saumarez followed but at 20 40 with night drawing in and wind picking up he instructed keats to take superb fastest ship in his squadron ahead and engage rearguard of moreno s force woodman p 161 at 23 20 keats discovered real carlos and pulled alongside firing three broadsides into spanish ship that started a severe fire superb then pushed on towards saint antoine while real carlos drifted in darkness and confusion encountering san hermenegildo spanish ships mistaking one another for an enemy and opening fire real carlos then drifted into san hermenegildo huge ships tangling together and fire spreading from one to another until both were blazing wrecks in darkness they both exploded at 00 15 on 13 july killing more than 1 700 men gardiner p 93 at some stage during night independently sailing spanish frigate perla sailed through battle and was fatally damaged in crossfire sinking next morning james p 354 keats meanwhile had engaged and defeated saint antoine forcing wounded commodore julien le ray to surrender following an action that had lasted just half an hour casualties on saint antoine were heavy although superb had just 15 men wounded rest of british squadron following up in darkness mistook saint antoine as being still active and all fired on ship as they passed intending to catch remainder of moreno s squadron as it sailed northwest along spanish coastline james p 128 at 04 00 formidable now under command of captain amable troude was seen to north in conil bay near cape trafalgar and saumarez sent venerable to chase french ship hood accompanied by thames under captain hollis at 05 15 venerable came within range and a close action soon followed hood ordering hollis to bring his ship close to troude s stern and open up a raking fire formidable had better of action however and at 06 45 with casualties mounting hood s mainmast collapsed over side clowes p 468 thumb beau fait d armes du capitaine troude alfred morel fatio alt taking advantage of disability to british ship troude pulled formidable ahead in light winds slowly rejoining main squadron under moreno which was holding station off cadiz harbour james p 129 as formidable moved away remaining masts on venerable collapsed and ship grounded off sancti petri there was concern in british squadron that moreno might counterattack disabled ship but arrival on horizon of audacious and superb persuaded spanish admiral to withdraw into cadiz hood was able to refloat venerable on 13 july and ship was towed back to gibraltar with prize saint antoine saumarez left three ships to maintain blockade at cadiz returning situation off port to that before battle james p 130 aftermath in france campaign was represented as a victory as linois genuine achievements at algeciras were followed by exaggerated reports of troude s defence in conil bay in which second battle was represented as a significant success against a more numerous british force troude had shown skill and bravery in engagement but his subsequent reputation was largely built on strength of a report sent to paris by dumanoir le pelley which was based on a letter written by captain troude in letter he claimed that he had fought not only venerable and thames but also caesar and spencer misidentified in report as superb james p 131 troude stated that he had not only driven all of these ships off but that he had also completely destroyed venerable by driving ship ashore troude was subsequently promoted and highly praised holding a number of important active commands in french navy clowes p 469 in spain outcome of campaign infuriated spanish government and contributed to souring of franco spanish alliance spanish demanded that spanish forces then stationed at brest on french atlantic coast return to spanish waters and spanish pressure on portugal was relaxed this weakening of franco spanish axis was a significant factor in treaty of amiens in early 1802 that brought french revolutionary wars to a close rodger p 472 saumarez was lauded in britain success of second action mitigating initial defeat he was awarded thanks of both houses of parliament and made a knight of bath with a pension of ps1 200 annually equivalent of ps as of nearly five decades later second battle although not first was among actions recognised by naval general service medal awarded upon application to all british participants still living in 1847 campaign later played a prominent part in novels master and commander by patrick o brian and touch and go by c northcote parkinson o brian patrick master and commander 1969 harper collins parkinson c northcote touch and go 1978 littlehampton books in british histories campaign is usually considered a single linked battle with overall outcome favourable to british force despite failure to prevent linois from linking with cadiz and loss of hannibal mostert p 408 severe losses inflicted on spanish fleet at cadiz and reinstatement of blockade meant that french plan to reinforce army trapped in egypt was a total failure garrison there surrendering in september after a hard fought campaign against british and ottoman forces mostert p 409 it also emphasised british dominance at sea by this stage of war reiterating that no force could sail from a french or allied port without detection and interception by royal navy clowes p 470 notes references bibliography category naval battles involving france category naval battles involving spain category naval
