russula densifolia commonly known as crowded russula or reddening russula is a species of agaric fungus in family russulaceae it was first described in 1833 and given its current name in 1876 a widespread species it is found in asia europe and north america where it fruits on ground in mixed and deciduous forests fruit bodies mushrooms are robust and squat with caps up to in diameter and stems that are long by thick mushrooms are characterized by red and then black color changes that occur in flesh when it is bruised and a relatively thick cap cuticle although mushroom is sold as an edible species in some areas of asia it is mild to moderately toxic and may cause gastrointestinal upset if consumed several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from mushroom taxonomy species was first described by louis secretan in 1833 as agaricus adustus var in 1876 claude casimir gillet transferred it to genus russula russula densifolia is classified in section of russula subgenus compactae which consists of species with robust squat fruit bodies that discolor to brown or black robert shaffer defined four forms of r densifolia in a 1962 monograph on section compactae differentiating them by spore print color fruiting pattern odor gill spacing and intensity of color change with bruising three forms are from pacific northwest region of north america form has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray form has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills form produces a light yellow spore print and has an two layered cap cuticle form found in eastern united states grows gregariously in jack pine and scotch pine forests nomenclatural database index fungorum lumps these forms as well as f published by patrick in 1996 together into synonymy other synonyms include rolf singer s 1931 variety caucasica roger heim s 1938 variety and c s 1999 variety specific epithet refers to closely spaced gills mushroom is commonly known as dense gilled brittlegill or reddening russula description thumb left young mushrooms are whitish and may slowly stain reddish where handled cap initially convex when young becomes almost flattened depressed or funnel shaped in maturity and reaches a diameter of smooth cap surface is sticky in moist young specimens but develops a polished look when dry it is initially white before turning brownish gray and eventually blackish in age cap margin is curved inward throughout most of life of fruit body cap cuticle can be peeled up to one half radius of cap flesh is white but slowly stains reddish then grayish black after being exposed to air this characteristic staining reaction can be slow to develop or may not develop at all especially in old fruit bodies where underlying tissue has already darkened flesh has no distinctive odor and a hot bitter taste gills are adnate squarely fused to slightly decurrent extending a short way down length of stem and interspersed with many tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not extend fully from cap edge to stem they are very crowded with about 7 12 gills per centimeter initially creamy white in color they will stain reddish then blackish where they have been injured or sometimes develop dirty reddish stains with age stem measures long by thick and is nearly equal in width throughout its length it is solid i e not hollow and hard initially white before aging to brownish black and has a smooth to slightly scaly dry surface thumb right spores range in shape from oval to elliptical to roughly spherical and have a diameter of less than 10 micrometers russula densifolia produces a white to pale yellow spore print spores are oval to elliptical to roughly spherical hyaline translucent amyloid and measure 7 6 9 5 by 6 7 7 5 um they have a rough reticulate surface marked by ridges and low isolated warts that are 0 2 0 5 mm high cystidia in hymenium are thin walled and hyaline with shapes ranging from club shaped with broad tips to somewhat fuse shaped with short and narrow appendages at tip cystidia have dimensions of 30 80 by 5 10 um under hymenium subhymenium is starkly differentiated there are abundant sphaerocysts fragile spherical cells common in russulaceae present in gill tissue and cap tissue has clusters of these cells cap cuticle typically 125 200 um thick is embedded in a gelatinous layer and is differentiated into two layers epicutis which consists of interwoven hyphae and underlying shaffer attempted to differentiated several forms of mushroom by differences in cap cuticle thickness and morphology although these forms are now not considered to have taxonomic significance edibility mushroom is mild to moderately toxic and may cause gastrointestinal upset if consumed david arora has noted that much of bitter taste can be removed with cooking but end product is insipid at best and indigestible or even poisonous at worst despite this however mushroom is sold as an edible species in province and chiang mai province in northern thailand it is also used in traditional chinese medicine for its purported activity similar species thumb right lookalike russula nigricans has a darker cap and more widely spaced gills than r densifolia another similarly colored russula is r nigricans which can be distinguished from r densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills another lookalike r has a dry cap surface and a mild taste r stains directly to black when injured and has a taste reminiscent of menthol r densifolia is often confused with r but latter s gills do not change color when bruised r found with conifers has a less acrid taste and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red ecology habitat and distribution russula densifolia is a mycorrhizal species descriptions have been published of morphology of ectomycorrhizae that it forms with european beech fagus sylvatica and norway spruce picea abies its mushrooms grow on ground singly scattered or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests and tend to appear in summer and autumn in spain it is common in dune pine forests fruit bodies can be parasitized by fungus widely distributed russula densifolia is known from asia including china india japan and thailand europe and north america in a study of chronological sequence of ectomycorrhizal fungi communities of pinus forests of eastern china r densifolia was shown to reach its peak abundance in 30 year old stands in another chinese study species was found to be one of six most common russula species associated with 1 2 year old seedlings of pinus in mexico they have been found with oak fungus is well adapted to live in cold climates as its mycelium has a relatively high tolerance to low temperatures although repeated freezing thawing cycles tend to slow growth of mycelium lethal temperature required for 50 of mycelium to die is research aqueous extracts of fruit bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory tests to be highly efficient at inhibiting infection by tobacco mosaic virus several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from mushroom including stearic acid 3 carboxylic acid 22e 3b 5 22 diene 3b hydroxy 5a 8a 6 ene 2 5 dione 3b hydroxy 5a 8a 6 22 diene palmitic acid uracil cis acid anhydride succinic acid 1 bd glycoside 2 2 b d glucose and b see also list
