opposed it mocking others who showed theirs deriding and denouncing god as a myth he came to believe that god had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him aitken pp 81 84 newton s conversion was not immediate but he contacted polly s family and announced his intentions to marry her her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous they knew he was profane but they allowed him to write to polly and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake martin 1950 pp 82 85 he sought a place on a slave ship bound for africa and newton and his crewmates participated in most of same activities he had written about before only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity after a severe illness his resolve was renewed yet he retained same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries newton continued in slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports and subsequently transported them to north america in between voyages he married polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her at beginning of each trip

friends suggested he become a priest in church of england he was turned down by john gilbert archbishop of york in 1758 ostensibly for having no university degree martin 1950 pp 166 188 although more likely reasons were his leanings toward evangelism and tendency to socialise with methodists aitken pp 153 154 newton continued his devotions and after being encouraged by a friend he wrote about his experiences in slave trade and his conversion william legge 2nd earl of dartmouth impressed with his story sponsored newton for ordination by john green bishop of lincoln and offered him curacy of

were poor aitken p 224 newton s preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from pulpit many clergy preached from a distance not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin he was involved in his parishioners lives and was much loved although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished martin 1950 pp 208 217 but his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful and he often said his mission was to break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart he struck a friendship with william cowper a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity attempting suicide several times cowper enjoyed olney and newton s company he was also new to olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to newton s together their effect on local congregation was impressive in 1768 they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet needs of an increasing number of parishioners they also began writing lessons for children turner p 76 partly from cowper s literary influence and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses newton began to try his hand at hymns which had become popular through language made plain for common people to understand several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in 18th century including isaac watts whose hymns newton had grown up p 28 and charles wesley with whom newton was familiar wesley s brother john eventual founder of methodist church had encouraged newton to go into clergy watts was a pioneer in english hymn writing basing his work after psalms

title of poem with first line amazing grace how sweet sound critical analysis general impact of olney hymns was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in britain for many years scholars appreciated cowper s poetry somewhat more than newton s plaintive and plain language expressing his forceful personality most prevalent themes in verses written by newton in olney hymns are faith in salvation wonder at god s grace his love for jesus and his cheerful exclamations of joy he found in his faith benson p 339 as a reflection of newton s connection to his parishioners he wrote many of hymns in first person admitting his own experience with sin bruce hindmarsh in sing them over again to me hymns and hymnbooks in america considers amazing grace an excellent example of newton s testimonial style afforded by use of this perspective noll and blumhofer p 6 several of newton s hymns were recognised as great work amazing grace was not among them while others seem to have been included to fill in when cowper was unable to write benson p 338 jonathan aitken calls newton specifically referring to amazing grace an unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation noting that only twenty one of nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable aitken p 226 william phipps in anglican theological review and author james basker have interpreted first stanza of amazing grace as evidence of newton s realisation that his participation in slave trade was his wretchedness perhaps representing a wider common understanding of newton s motivations phipps william summer 1990 amazing grace in s life anglican theological review 72 3 pp 306 313 newton joined forces with a young man named william wilberforce british member of parliament who led parliamentarian campaign to abolish slave trade in british empire culminating in slave trade act 1807 but newton did not become an ardent and outspoken abolitionist until after he left olney in 1780s he is not known to have connected writing hymn known as amazing grace to anti slavery sentiments aitken p 231 lyrics in olney hymns were arranged by their association to biblical verses that would be used by newton and cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective for newton beginning of year was a time to reflect on one s spiritual progress at same time he completed a diary which has since been lost that he had begun 17 years before two years after he quit sailing last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then aitken p 227 title ascribed to hymn 1 chronicles 17 16 17 refers to david s reaction to prophet nathan telling him that god intends to maintain his family line forever some christians interpret this as a prediction that jesus christ as a descendant of david was promised by god as salvation for all people noll and blumhofer p 8 newton s sermon on that january day in 1773 focused on necessity to express one s gratitude for god s guidance that god is involved in daily lives of christians though they may not be aware of it and that patience for deliverance from daily trials of life is warranted when glories of eternity await turner p 81 newton saw himself a sinner like david who had been chosen perhaps undeservedly and was humbled by it according to newton unconverted sinners were blinded by god of this world until mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by power of his grace new testament served as basis for many of lyrics of amazing grace first verse for example can be traced to story of prodigal son in gospel of luke father says for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found story of jesus healing a blind man who tells pharisees that he can now see is told in gospel of john newton used words i was blind but now i see and declared oh to grace how great a debtor in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752 aitken p 228 effect of lyrical arrangement according to bruce hindmarsh allows an instant release of energy in exclamation amazing grace to be followed by a qualifying reply in how sweet sound in an annotated anthology of hymns newton s use of an exclamation at beginning of his verse is called crude but effective in an overall composition that suggest s a forceful if simple statement of faith watson p 215 grace is recalled three times in following verse culminating in newton s most personal story of his conversion underscoring use of his personal testimony with his parishioners sermon preached by newton was his last of those that william cowper heard in olney since cowper s mental instability returned shortly thereafter steve turner author of amazing grace

sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people necessity of turning away from sin witnessing and testifying became an integral
