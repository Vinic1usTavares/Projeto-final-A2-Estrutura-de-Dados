thumb view from greenwater valley over tecopa ca to kingston range terrain in middle part of image was formerly covered by lake tecopa lake tecopa is a former lake in inyo county southern california it developed during miocene and pleistocene within a tectonic basin close to border with nevada fed by amargosa river and some neighbouring washes it eventually culminated to a surface area of around 186 000 years ago and left sediments afterwards amargosa river cut a gorge out of lake and into death valley with its lake manly draining lake present day towns of shoshone california and tecopa california lie within basin of former lake hydrology thumb present day course of amargosa river lake tecopa occupied tecopa valley a pear shaped valley east of southern death valley in inyo county california cities of barstow california and las vegas nevada lie close to lake basin lake itself had a roughly triangular shape with a northern a southwestern and a southeastern corner and at its highstand it covered about outcrops of lake sediments occupy a length of along amargosa river and are wide at their broadest its southern margin is not clear given that height of sill to china ranch basin is undetermined several islands existed in lake tecopa of these largest was close to tecopa california and two smaller ones were north of shoshone california shores of lake featured marshes and deltas where amargosa river or spring water entered lake as well as freshwater ponds where springs and streams flowed into lake tecopa at time of bishop tuff eruption lake tecopa was about deep waters of lake were salty and had a high ph inducing precipitation of calcite in northern part of lake where amargosa river flowed into it there is some indication that centre of lake was much more saline than its shores salt lakes generally form when a lake has no outlet so evaporation concentrates salts in lake water until lake contains saltwater thumb amargosa river at present day tecopa ca amargosa river flowed into lake tecopa which was river s terminal lake most of water in lake tecopa came from amargosa river and to a lesser degree from washes that drain chicago valley and greenwater valley total size of its catchment was about and most of its water originated in paiute mesa shoshone mountains timber mountains and yucca mountains catchment of amargosa river above tecopa california is presently about later after lake tecopa had disappeared river reached death valley and its lake manly dramatically increasing supply of water to later presently river is largely ephemeral except where it is fed by springs geography former lake basin is surrounded by various hills and mountain ranges formed by rocks of neoproterozoic to tertiary age clockwise from north they are resting spring range range sperry hills ibex hills greenwater valley and dublin hills together they enclose an area of about region belongs to basin and range province of western united states where short ranges of mountains lie between plains this geology consists of normal faults which separate grabens from horsts it was affected by extensive tectonic activity in past and may be still active in present presently towns of shoshone california tecopa hot springs california and tecopa california lie within former bed of lake tecopa california state route 127 and california state route 178 cross lake basin from southwest to north and from west to east respectively while furnace creek road traverses it from northwest to southeast terrain of region is characterized by badlands and rugged mountains with little vegetation away from springs a number of springs form oases in area including locations of three towns climate presently area of lake tecopa is a hot dry desert with most precipitation occurring during summer in shoshone california average temperatures are and often exceed with about of rainfall under present day climates evaporation is too high and precipitation too low to allow formation of lakes in area 180 000 years before present precipitation increased to and average temperatures decreased by lifting regional water tables sediments various sediments were emplaced in lake including clay gravel and zeolites some of these formed when ash or sediments were progressively altered sediments take form of calcareous sandy silty material or mudstone sediments have undergone increasing amounts of diagenesis closer they are to basin center among minerals found at various sites are calcite halite and after lake was breached these deposits were deeply eroded and exposed showing thicknesses exceeding mining for and took place from 1920s to 1950s tufa deposits are found within lake and partly embedded in its sediments they were generated from carbonate precipitation within lake a process facilitated by physical properties of lake water many of these tufa deposits occur where fault controlled springs discharged water into lake several tephra layers have been identified including 2 003 million years old huckleberry ridge tuff 706 000 years old bishop tuff and 602 000 years old lava creek tuff as well as 2 1 2 0 8 million years old glass mountain tuffs they form tuff layers which are very conspicuous in lake sediments biology a number of fossils were discovered in sediments including chara diatoms ostracods snails and vertebrates among mammals are camelops equus mammoth and muskrat footprints have been observed at edges of lake basin and foraminifera have been found in lake sediments including lobatula lobatula and a few other less widespread species foraminifera are mostly oceanic and since lake tecopa was never connected to ocean they were most likely transported there by birds history thumb pleistocene lakes in region note that lake tecopa s borders are incorrect lake tecopa existed during miocene and pleistocene basin of lake tecopa formed between 7 and 11 million years ago but was then tectonically stable during quaternary although tectonic or magmatic activity may be occurring north of shoshone from about 5 million years ago to about 186 000 years before present lake developed inside basin extensive faulting of lake deposits makes it difficult to reconstruct its history about 2 million years ago amargosa desert began to drain into lake tecopa and a shallow lake existed back then but between 1 6 and 0 9 million years ago lake often became a playa it is unlikely that lake was ephemeral however given presence of fossils in lake sediments of foraminifera which do not tolerate such drying probably owing to uplift of sierra nevada and expansion of catchment water levels at lake tecopa increased during pleistocene and reached highstands concurrently with other lakes in great basin highest shoreline occurs at about elevation subsequently tectonically deformed about 186 000 years before present it appears to coincide with highstand of lake lahontan and oxygen isotope stages 8 7 and 6 some doubts have been raised about this chronology however at some point after 579 000 years ago a large slump occurred at southwestern area of lake possibly triggered by an earthquake such earthquake activity is also responsible for formation of within lake sediments a number of faults criss cross area several of them follow borders of tecopa basin finally there is evidence of uplift in parts of southern basin about 200 000 150 000 years before present lake overflowed and disappeared several different dates have been given for time when lake breached its boundaries but it likely happened shortly after highstand a long gorge was formed by breaching event which was triggered either by a river capture like process or by overflow subsidence in death valley may be ultimately responsible for drainage change it is possible that lake tecopa briefly reformed later due to a temporary blockage of its outflow and that at times amargosa river was blocked upstream from lake tecopa existence of lake beds was described first by levi f noble in 1926 in 1931 eliot blackwelder identified these lakebeds as remnants of what he named lake tecopa area of former lake has been subject of numerous studies comprising various fields of geology but also biology and an important target for field studies and field trips research in paleoclimatic conditions of region has received impetus from yucca mountain
