august 2012 straphangers campaign rated c train worst of city s subway services for fourth straight year no other service has ranked worst for more than three years in a row group found that c performed worst in three of six categories in its annual state of subways report card amount of scheduled service interior cleanliness and breakdown rate it also ranked next to worst in car announcement quality after 7 but performed above average in regularity of service and crowding new york times called c least loved of new york city subway lines citing its fleet of r32s which were originally delivered in 1964 and were 45 years old when times reported on issue in 2011 as of 2019 they remain in service and are oldest cars in system at years old new york times has also stated that c train rattled and along deteriorating maze of tracks beneath city tin clad markers of years of neglect r32s have been criticized for their frequent breakdowns as compared to any fleet in system r32s averaged just 33 527 miles between failures compared to 400 000 miles for other subway cars in 2017 times referred to r32s on c train as world s oldest subway cars in continuous daily operation improvements in 2011 problems with r32s were at a peak as fleet s failure rate was rising steadily in 2012 money was directed to replace r32 with a new contract called r179 bombardier transportation won 600 million contract to build 300 new cars r179s were expected to replace r32s with some being allocated to c however delivery of r179s was delayed until 2017 and some r32s will remain in service after order is completed so stopgap measures had to be implemented most trains on c are only long due to lower ridership levels on this service compared to a ridership levels prompt long trains according to nyc transit s rapid transit loading guideline this contrasted to those on rest of b division except for eastern division and g train which are long for summers of 2011 and 2012 r46 trains ran on c while r32s were moved to a to save their older air conditioning units from having to work underground at all times since 2013 due to passenger complaints many r160a cars have operated on this service first during summer months then permanently most of r32s were transferred to east new york yard where they were used on mostly outdoor for same reason by may 2015 more than half of c train s fleet utilized after several failed proposals to permanently lengthen c trains as ridership increased some r46 trains were again assigned to c in december 2017 displacing some of route s r32s to a eight car r46 trains running on c were 600 feet long in november 2018 several 480 foot long r179 trains started running on c allowing for r160a trains to gradually be transferred back to east new york yard however by next month almost all r179 trains on c had to be briefly taken out of service due to manufacturing defects and hvac software bugs these have since been corrected and affected trains
