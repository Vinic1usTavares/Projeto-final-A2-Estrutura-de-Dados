thumb mt rainier from iss 2018 mount rainier pronounced also known as tahoma or tacoma is a large active stratovolcano in cascadia located south southeast of seattle in mount rainier national park with a summit elevation of it is highest mountain in u s state of washington and of cascade range of pacific northwest most topographically prominent mountain in contiguous united states and tallest in cascade volcanic arc mt rainier is considered one of most dangerous volcanoes in world and it is on decade volcano list because of its large amount of glacial ice mt rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten entire puyallup river valley about 80 000 people and their homes are at risk in mount rainier s lahar hazard zones name mount rainier was first known by local salishan speakers as tacoma or tahoma one hypothesis of word origin is mother of waters in lushootseed language spoken by puyallup people linguist william bright gives origin as snow covered mountain another hypothesis is that tacoma means larger than mount baker in lushootseed ta larger plus koma kulshan mount baker other names originally used include tahoma and current name was given by george vancouver who named it in honor of his friend rear admiral peter rainier map of lewis and clark expedition of 1804 1806 refers to it as mt although rainier had been considered official name of mountain theodore winthrop in his posthumously published 1862 travel book canoe and saddle referred to mountain as tacoma and for a time both names were used interchangeably although mt tacoma was preferred in nearby city of tacoma in 1890 united states board on geographic names declared that mountain would be known as rainier following this in 1897 pacific forest reserve became mount rainier forest reserve and national park was established three years later despite this there was still a movement to change mountain s name to tacoma and congress was still considering a resolution to change name as late as 1924 in lead up to super bowl xlviii washington state senate passed a resolution on friday january 31 2014 temporarily renaming mountain mount seattle seahawks until midnight after super bowl monday february 3 2014 in response to renaming of 53 mountains in colorado after 53 members of denver broncos by governor of colorado john hickenlooper after 2015 restoration of original name denali from mount mckinley in alaska debate over mount rainier s name intensified geographical setting thumb mount rainier as viewed from kerry park in seattle thumb mount rainier from an aircraft mount rainier is tallest mountain in washington and cascade range this peak is located just east of eatonville and just southeast of seattle and tacoma mount rainier is ranked third of 128 ultra prominent mountain peaks of united states mount rainier has a topographic prominence of which is greater than that of k2 world s second tallest mountain at on clear days it dominates southeastern horizon in most of seattle tacoma metropolitan area to such an extent that locals sometimes refer to it simply as mountain on days of exceptional clarity it can also be seen from as far away as corvallis oregon at marys peak and victoria british columbia with 26 major glaciers and of permanent snowfields and glaciers mount rainier is most heavily glaciated peak in lower 48 states summit is topped by two volcanic craters each more than in diameter with larger east crater overlapping west crater geothermal heat from volcano keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice and has formed world s largest volcanic glacier cave network within ice filled craters with nearly of passages a small crater lake about in size and deep highest in north america with a surface elevation of occupies lowest portion of west crater below more than of ice and is accessible only via caves carbon puyallup mowich nisqually and cowlitz rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of mount rainier sources of white river are winthrop emmons and fryingpan glaciers white carbon and mowich join puyallup river which discharges into commencement bay at tacoma nisqually empties into puget sound east of lacey and cowlitz joins columbia river between kelso and longview subsidiary peaks broad top of mount rainier contains three named summits highest is called columbia crest second highest summit is point success at southern edge of summit plateau atop ridge known as success cleaver it has a topographic prominence of about so it is not considered a separate peak lowest of three summits is liberty cap at northwestern edge which overlooks liberty ridge sunset amphitheater and dramatic willis wall liberty cap has a prominence of and so would qualify as a separate peak under most strictly prominence based rules a prominence cutoff of is commonly used in washington state high on eastern flank of mount rainier is a peak known as little tahoma peak an eroded remnant of earlier much higher mount rainier it has a prominence of and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with columbia crest so it is usually considered a separate peak if considered separately from mt rainier little tahoma peak would be third highest mountain peak in washington geology thumb mount rainier left upright thumb hazard map mount rainier is a stratovolcano in cascade volcanic arc that consists of lava flows debris flows and pyroclastic ejecta and flows its early volcanic deposits are estimated at more than 840 000 years old and are part of lily formation about 2 9 million to 840 000 years ago early deposits formed a proto rainier or an ancestral cone prior to present day cone present cone is more than 500 000 years old volcano is highly eroded with glaciers on its slopes and appears to be made mostly of andesite rainier likely once stood even higher than today at about before a major debris avalanche and resulting osceola mudflow approximately 5 000 years ago in past rainier has had large debris avalanches and has also produced enormous lahars volcanic mudflows due to large amount of glacial ice present its lahars have reached all way to puget sound a distance of more than around 5 000 years ago a large chunk of volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce massive osceola mudflow which went all way to site of present day tacoma and south seattle this massive avalanche of rock and ice removed top of rainier bringing its height down to around about 530 to 550 years ago occurred although this was not as large scale as osceola mudflow after major collapse approximately 5 000 years ago subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up modern summit cone until about as recently as 1 000 years ago as many as 11 holocene tephra layers have been found modern activity and current threat most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854 but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858 1870 1879 1882 and 1894 as well seismic monitors have been located in mount rainier national park and on mountain itself to monitor activity an eruption could be deadly for all living in areas within immediate vicinity of volcano and an eruption would also cause trouble from vancouver british columbia canada to san francisco california because of massive amounts of ash blasting out of volcano into atmosphere mount rainier is located in an area that itself is part of eastern rim of pacific ring of fire this includes mountains and calderas like mount shasta and lassen peak in california crater lake three sisters and mount hood in oregon mount saint helens mount adams glacier peak and mount baker in washington and mount cayley mount garibaldi silverthrone caldera and mount meager in british columbia all of above are dormant but could return to activity and scientists on both sides of border gather research of past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in future including mount rainier of these only two have erupted since beginning of twentieth century lassen in 1915 and st helens in 1980 and 2004 however past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub plinian eruptions or higher crater lake s last eruption as mount mazama was large enough to cause its cone to collapse and mt rainier s closest neighbor mount st helens produced largest eruption in continental united states when it erupted in 1980 statistics place likelihood of a major eruption in cascade range at 2 3 per century mount rainier is currently listed as a decade volcano or one of 16 volcanoes with greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes if mt rainier were to erupt as powerfully as mount st helens did in its may 18 1980 eruption effect would be cumulatively greater because of far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on volcano compared to mount st helens vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding rainier and simple fact that mt rainier is a much bigger volcano almost twice size of st helens lahars from rainier pose most risk to life and property as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits according to united states geological survey usgs about 150 000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of rainier not only is there much ice atop volcano volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity according to geoff clayton a geologist with a washington state geology firm rh2 engineering a repeat of 5000 year old osceola mudflow would destroy enumclaw orting kent auburn puyallup sumner and all of renton such a mudflow might also reach down estuary and destroy parts of downtown seattle and cause tsunami in puget sound and lake washington rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava thumb left upright one of many emergency evacuation route signs in case of volcanic eruption or lahar around mt rainier according to k scott a scientist with usgs a home built in any of probabilistically defined inundation areas on new maps is more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a lahar than by fire for example a home built in an area that would be inundated every 100 years on average is 27 times more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a flow than by fire people know danger of fire so they buy fire insurance and they have smoke alarms but most people are not aware of risks of lahars and few have applicable flood insurance volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in pierce county more populous king county is also in lahar area but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard more recently since 2001 funding from federal government for lahar protection in area has dried up leading local authorities in at risk cities like orting to fear a disaster similar to armero tragedy seismic background typically up to five earthquakes are recorded monthly near summit swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over two or three days take place from time to time predominantly in region of below summit these earthquakes are thought to be caused by circulation of hot fluids beneath mount rainier presumably hot springs and steam vents within mount rainier national park are generated by such fluids seismic swarms not initiated with a mainshock are common features at volcanoes and are rarely associated with eruptive activity rainier has had several such swarms there were days long swarms in 2002 2004 and 2007 two of which 2002 and 2004 included m 3 2 earthquakes a 2009 swarm produced largest number of events of any swarm at rainier since seismic monitoring began over two decades earlier yet another swarm was observed in 2011 glaciers thumb three dimensional representation of mount rainier thumb nisqually glacier is seen clearly from southeast of mountain glaciers are among most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on mount rainier they erode volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation together with perennial snow patches 29 named glacial features cover about of mountain s surface in 2015 and have an estimated volume of about glaciers flow under influence of gravity by combined action of sliding over rock on which they lie and by deformation gradual displacement between and within individual ice crystals maximum speeds occur near surface and along centerline of glacier during may 1970 nisqually glacier was measured moving as fast as per day flow rates are generally greater in summer than in winter probably due to presence of large quantities of meltwater at glacier base size of glaciers on mount rainier has fluctuated significantly in past for example during last ice age from about 25 000 to about 15 000 years ago glaciers covered most of area now within boundaries of mount rainier national park and extended to perimeter of present puget sound basin between 14th century and 1850 many of glaciers on mount rainier advanced to their farthest extent downvalley since last ice age many advances of this sort occurred worldwide during this time period known to geologists as little ice age during little ice age nisqually glacier advanced to a position downvalley from site of glacier bridge tahoma and south tahoma glaciers merged at base of glacier island and terminus of emmons glacier reached within of white river campground retreat of little ice age glaciers was slow until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid between height of little ice age and 1950 mount rainier s glaciers lost about one quarter of their length beginning in 1950 and continuing through early 1980s however many of major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of mid century carbon cowlitz emmons and nisqually glaciers advanced during late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during 1960s and 1970s since early 1980s however many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed glaciers on mount rainier can generate mudflows through glacial outburst floods not associated with any eruption south tahoma glacier generated 30 floods in 1980s and early 1990s and again in august 2015 human history at time of european contact river valleys and other areas near mountain were inhabited by indigenous people who hunted and gathered animals and plants in mount rainier s forests and high elevation meadows modern descendants of these people are represented by members of modern tribes that surround mountain including nisqually indian tribe cowlitz indian tribe confederated tribes and bands of yakama nation puyallup tribe of indians and muckleshoot indian tribe among others in area archaeological record of human use of mountain dates to over 8 500 years before present bp sites related to seasonal use of mount rainier and its landscapes are reflected in chipped stone tool remains and settings suggesting functionally varied uses including task specific sites travel stops and long term base camps their distribution on mountain suggest primary use of subalpine meadows and low alpine habitats that provided relatively high resource abundance during short summer season captain george vancouver reached puget sound in early may 1792 and became first european to see mountain in 1833 dr william fraser tolmie explored area looking for medicinal plants hazard stevens and p b van trump received a hero s welcome in streets of olympia after their successful summit climb in 1870 first female ascent was made in 1890 by fay fuller accompanied by van trump and three other teammates descending from summit in 1883 james longmire discovered a mineral spring this ultimately led to his establishment of a spa and hotel drawing other visitors to area to seek benefits of spring later headquarters of national park would be established at longmire until flooding caused them to be relocated to ashford area also became site of features like a museum a post office and a gas station with additions like a library and a gift shop soon following many of these buildings were ultimately nominated to national historic register of historic places longmire remains second most popular place in park in 1924 a publication from park described area thumb mount rainier sunset a feature at longmire springs of great interest to everyone is group of mineral springs in little flat to west of national park inn there are some forty distinct springs a half dozen of which are easily reached from road an analysis of waters show that they all contain about sic mineral salts but in slightly differing proportions all water is highly carbonated and would be classed as extremely hard certain springs contain larger amounts of soda iron and sulphur giving them a distinct taste and color john muir climbed mount rainier in 1888 and although he enjoyed view he conceded that it was best appreciated from below muir was one of many who advocated protecting mountain in 1893 area was set aside as part of pacific forest reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources primarily timber and watersheds citing need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment railroads and local businesses urged creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism on march 2 1899 president william mckinley established mount rainier national park as america s fifth national park congress dedicated new park for benefit and enjoyment of people and for preservation from injury or of all timber mineral deposits natural curiosities or wonders within said park and their retention in their natural condition on 24 june 1947 kenneth arnold reported seeing a formation of nine unidentified flying objects over mount rainier his description led to term flying saucers in 1998 united states geological survey began putting together mount rainier volcano lahar warning system to assist in emergency evacuation of puyallup river valley in event of a catastrophic debris flow it is now run by pierce county department of emergency management tacoma at mouth of puyallup is only west of rainier and moderately sized towns such as puyallup and orting are only away respectively thumb right upright 5 washington state quarter mt rainier appears on four distinct united states postage stamp issues in 1934 it was 3 cent issue in a series of national park stamps and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention following year in 1935 both of these were reprinted by postmaster general james a farley as special issues given to officials and friends because of complaints by public farley s follies were reproduced in large numbers second stamp issue is easy to tell from original because it is imperforate both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available washington state quarter which was released on april 11 2007 features mount rainier and a salmon climbing thumb right upright climbers on ingraham glacier above little tahoma mountain climbing on mount rainier is difficult involving traversing largest glaciers in u s south of alaska most climbers require two to three days to reach summit with a success rate of approximately 50 with weather and physical conditioning of climbers being most common reasons for failure about 8 000 to 13 000 people attempt climb each year about 90 via routes from camp muir on southeast flank and most of rest ascend emmons glacier via camp schurman on northeast climbing teams require experience in glacier travel self rescue and wilderness travel all climbers who plan to climb above high camps camp muir and camp schurman are required to purchase a mount rainier climbing pass and register for their climb additionally solo climbers must fill out a solo climbing request form and receive written permission from superintendent before attempting to climb climbing routes thumb camp muir is commonly used by those attempting to summit mount rainier all climbing routes on mount rainier require climbers to possess some level of technical climbing skill this includes ascending and descending mountain with use of technical climbing equipment such as crampons ice axes harnesses and ropes difficulty and technical challenge of climbing mount rainier can vary widely between climbing routes routes are graded in alpine climbing format normal route to summit of mount rainier is disappointment cleaver route yds grade ii iii as climbers on this route have access to permanently established camp muir it sees significant majority of climbing traffic on mountain this route is also most common commercially guided route term cleaver is used in context of a rock ridge that separates two glaciers reason for naming this cleaver a disappointment is unrecorded but it is thought to be due to climbers reaching it only to recognize their inability to reach summit an alternative route to disappointment cleaver is ingraham glacier direct route grade ii and is often used when disappointment cleaver route cannot be climbed due to poor route conditions emmons glacier route grade ii is an alternative to disappointment cleaver route and poses a lower technical challenge to climbers climbers on route can make use of camp schurman 9 500 ft a glacial camp site camp schurman is equipped with a solar toilet and a ranger hut liberty ridge route grade iv is a considerably more challenging and objectively dangerous route than normal route to summit it runs up center of north face of mount rainier and crosses very active carbon glacier first climbed by ome arnie campbell and jim burrow in 1935 it is listed as one of fifty classic climbs of north america by steve roper and allen steck this route only accounts for approximately 2 of climbers on mountain but approximately 25 of its deaths dangers and accidents about two mountaineering deaths each year occur because of rock and ice fall avalanche falls and hypothermia these incidents are often associated with exposure to very high altitude fatigue dehydration and or poor weather 58 deaths have been reported since and including 1981 accident through 2010 per american alpine club accidents in north american mountaineering and national park service willi who reached summit of mount everest in 1963 was killed along with an evergreen college student in an avalanche on mount rainier in 1979 he had climbed mountain over 200 times worst mountaineering accident on mount rainier occurred in 1981 when eleven clients and their guides lost their lives in an avalanche ice fall on ingraham glacier this was largest number of fatalities on mount rainier in a single incident since 32 people were killed in a 1946 plane crash on south tahoma glacier in one of worst disasters on mountain in over thirty years six climbers two guides and four clients last heard from on may 28 2014 were presumed dead on may 31 2014 when low flying search helicopters pinged signals from avalanche beacons worn by climbers officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after climbers fell 3 300 feet 1 000 m while attempting or returning from summit via liberty ridge climbing route searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on carbon glacier at possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in vicinity where team went missing though exact cause of accident is unknown bodies of three of client climbers were spotted on august 7 2014 during a training flight and subsequently recovered on august 19 2014 bodies of fourth client climber and two guides have not been located outdoor recreation in addition to climbing hiking backcountry skiing photography and camping are popular activities in park hiking trails including wonderland trail a circumnavigation of peak provide access to backcountry popular for winter sports include snowshoeing and cross country skiing climate summit of mount rainier has an ice cap climate koppen climate classification ef ecology thumb reflection lake is a popular place to view mount rainier mount rainier s protected status as a national park protects its primeval cascade ecosystem providing a stable habitat for many species in region including endemic flora and fauna that are unique to area such as cascade red fox and mount rainier lousewort ecosystem on mountain is very diverse owing to climate found at different elevations scientists track distinct species found in forest zone subalpine zone and alpine zone they have discovered more than one thousand species of plants and fungi mountain is also home to 65 species of mammals 5 reptile 182 bird 14 amphibians and 14 of native fish in addition to an innumerable amount of invertebrates flora thumb subalpine wildflower meadow in paradise region of mount rainier mount rainier has regularly been described as one best places in world to view wildflowers in subalpine region of mountain snow often stays on ground until summer begins limiting plants to a much shorter growing season this produces dramatic blooms in areas like paradise in 1924 flowers were described by naturalist floyd w mount rainier national park is perhaps better known world over for these wonderful flowers than for any one feature mountains glaciers cascading streams and forests may be equalled if one looks far away enough but no park has been so favored in way of wild flowers forests on mountain span from as young as 100 years old to sections of old growth forest that are calculated to be 1000 years or more in age lower elevation consists mainly of western red cedar douglas fir and western hemlock pacific silver fir western white pine alaska yellow cedar and noble fir are found further up mountain in alpine level alaskan yellow cedar subalpine fir and mountain hemlock grow fauna thumb a cascade red fox active during paradise s long winter mountain supports a wide variety of animal life including several species that are protected on state or federal level like northern spotted owl efforts are also being made to reintroduce native species that had locally been hunted to extinction like pacific fisher there are sixty five types of mammals living on mountain including cougars mountain goats marmots and elk common reptiles and amphibians include garter snakes frogs and salamanders there are many types of birds found throughout different elevations on mountain but while some live there all year many are migratory salmon and trout species use rivers formed by glaciers and though lakes stopped being stocked in 1972 thirty lakes still have reproducing populations see also mount rainier national park mount rainier wilderness
