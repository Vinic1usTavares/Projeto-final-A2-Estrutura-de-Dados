abilities which he uses to fight millennium earl who created an army of akuma to destroy world and his superhuman followers noah family allen learns he is connected to noah and might become one of them hoshino based allen s characterization on robin shorter haired female protagonist of one shot comic zone she designed allen s clothing to resemble that of nineteenth century giving him a ribbon

pieces has been offered in addition to character s appearances in anime series d gray man and its sequel d gray man hallow he has appeared in three light novels two video games and several crossover fighting games concept and creation manga creator katsura hoshino originally had no plans to create allen s character in d gray man she wanted millennium earl to be story s protagonist hoshino found earl unsuitable for use as a main character in a manga magazine aimed at teenagers so she created allen hoshino thought a mature design would be better although she believed his final design looked best clothed with a black order uniform she wondered whether it should be more masculine hoshino said she did not know how allen originated she likes her main characters to be rambunctious rude idiots she said general idea for his design was an energetic youth with messy fly a way hair but when he was drawn with uniform of black order group allen joins she sensed a lack of coordination to make a bigger impact with allen s arrival to black order hoshino gave him nickname destroyer of time which has no relevance to story hoshino based allen on robin protagonist of her one shot comic zone comparing two she called allen a different kind of boy according to hoshino s first editor allen was originally going to be a modified akuma who looked like a boy her editor advised her to make allen more vulnerable by depicting him crying which led to allen s gender being male to make a bigger impact with readers as manga continued hoshino called him a comrade and found a relationship between herself and character although hoshino still admired millennium earl while creating character hoshino was afraid readers might dislike allen because she wrote him as a hypocrite even though allen is a human he has sympathy for his enemies souls trapped inside akumas and noah clan hoshino did not like allen because of his negative actions despite his caring words she also wondered whether readers would care for a protagonist who is friendly with both his friends and his enemies despite her worries hoshino s editor said it would be positive if allen remained as a hypocrite until ending despite difficulties in writing him hoshino liked challenge of writing allen expecting that future manga protagonists also provide authors with this problem allen was introduced as a gentleman but his characterization changed to point that hoshino wrote an interview between character and herself in interview she complained to allen about his change from pure and innocent to a corrupted character calling him dark allen allen replied that change must be due to series dark setting she demonstrated allen s dark side when character struck his master cross marian in anger at his inability to learn how he would become 14th noah descendant nea d campbell according to hoshino cross marian was angry with allen for attack but enjoyed seeing this side of his student while allen became a darker character hoshino also wanted to symbolize his own fear in way his persona became afraid his late guardian mana walker did not love him as a result hoshino made a minor design change and rearranged scar mana s akuma placed on his forehead in a berserker state by having scar show more clearly allen s disturbance about his love for mana was more clearly expressed for arc involving third exorcists hoshino s editors advised her to draw allen as a fighter for sake of manga s characters yu kanda and alma karma who are heavily featured in saga design hoshino drew allen with hair longer than robin s and found it difficult to decide on a hairstyle she parted his hair in center to emphasize his facial expressions because he is an exorcist she wanted him to have a very scary looking image and added scar on his left forehead scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram since hoshino wanted order and its enemies to have visual contrast she gave allen and exorcists black cloaks to convey a gloomy impression allen s clothing is drawn from hoshino s general impression of late 19th century his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a gentlemanly image according to hoshino later in series allen s hairstyle becomes similar to that of a super saiyan a transformation in dragon ball series in which character s hair becomes spiky hoshino said that early in d gray mans publication allen was one of most difficult characters to draw by tenth volume she said character was more difficult to draw than yu kanda in manga s first chapters allen s eyes have had different colors red and light blue due to a discussion between hoshino and her editor it was later decided to give him silver eyes series title d gray man is intended to have several meanings most referring to state of allen and other main characters during a story arc in which allen tries to save a former exorcist named suman dark allen s own innocence his deformed arm cross is destroyed in a confrontation because allen trains in a sub branch of black order to regain his innocence hoshino wanted to show allen s real powers hoshino said she experienced a lack of inspiration in what it would be its true form to point of feeling allen s frustration at not being able to fight again eventually hoshino was inspired to draw allen s real innocence crowned clown which is based on italian pierrot she was satisfied with allen s dialogue that he would fight for both humans and akumas symbolized by his two hands and drew this scene carefully by series beginning hoshino intended allen s weaponry to evolve because she started feeling that allen s first weapon cross might be appealing to readers crown clown was created to be a more stylish and cooler weapon for allen because allen hides his identity from order but still claims to be an exorcist in a later arc hoshino conceived a new design for him that represents his self proclamation of being one development and voice actors allen leaves black order because previous story arc had too many characters and required too much effort hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of allen s valediction to comrade lenalee lee because it connotes character s maturation she noted that allen had grown taller early in series he and lenalee are depicted at same height hoshino said although allen s departure fits series tragic theme he would always have comrades allen and kanda despite their frequent arguments part on good terms hoshino said kanda would assist allen in next story allen s withdrawal from order had been planned since he encountered enemy road because allen s nature conflicts with those of other exorcists who unlike him do not wish to save akumas thumb 150px todd haberkorn voiced allen walker in english dub of series alt a black haired adult smiling when allen left order hoshino said character had become difficult to write allen is a philanthropist hoshino said she was not equally kind because jump square manga s host magazine at time was aimed at a young male audience hoshino said she wanted to characterize allen as a cheerful person rather than a troubled teenager she found this depiction difficult because his life became more complicated as series progressed hoshino tries to balance allen between strength and sorrow and has required occasional hiatuses she said most challenging part of allen s face to draw is his smile he often smiles sometimes when he is lying or unhappy after allen left order hoshino told readers his life might be arduous and that he would cheat at gambling which learns while training with cross marian as plot progressed hoshino still found difficulties in writing him because he is suffering while remaining cheerful chapter 222 proved more challenging for hoshino because allen s life was becoming difficult during these moments allen s mind starts being erased from his body because he is being possessed by noah nea d campbell in an inner world allen feels he wishes to be erased and freed of pain while interacting with an illusion of cross marian he remembers his beliefs and smiles at cross illusion despite crying at same time in first animated version of
