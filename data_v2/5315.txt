connected body of salty water that covers over 70 of earth s surface with a total volume of roughly it moderates earth s climate and has important roles in water cycle carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle it has been travelled and explored since ancient times while scientific study of sea oceanography dates broadly from voyages of captain james cook to explore pacific ocean between 1768 and 1779 word sea is also used to denote smaller partly landlocked sections of ocean and certain large entirely landlocked saltwater lakes such as caspian sea and dead sea most abundant solid dissolved in sea water is sodium chloride water also contains salts of magnesium calcium and potassium amongst many other elements some in minute concentrations salinity varies widely being lower near surface and mouths of large rivers and higher in depths of ocean however relative proportions of dissolved salts varies little across oceans winds blowing over surface of sea produce waves which break when they enter shallow water winds also create surface currents through friction setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout oceans directions of circulation are governed by factors including shapes of continents and earth s rotation coriolis effect deep sea currents known as global conveyor belt carry cold water from near poles to every ocean tides generally twice daily rise and fall of sea levels are caused by earth s rotation and gravitational effects of orbiting moon and to a lesser extent of sun tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis as can volcanoes huge landslides or impact of large meteorites a wide variety of organisms including bacteria protists algae plants fungi and animals live in sea which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems ranging vertically from sunlit surface and shoreline to great depths and pressures of cold dark abyssal zone and in latitude from cold waters under polar ice caps to colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions many of major groups of organisms evolved in sea and life may have started there sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans mainly fish but also shellfish mammals and seaweed whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater other human uses of sea include trade travel mineral extraction power generation warfare and leisure activities such as swimming sailing and scuba diving many of these activities create marine pollution sea is important in human culture with major appearances in literature at least since homer s odyssey in marine art in cinema in theatre and in classical music symbolically sea appears as monsters such as scylla in mythology and represents unconscious mind in dream interpretation definition thumb upright 1 25 animated map exhibiting world s oceanic waters a continuous body of water encircling earth world ocean is divided into a number of principal areas with relatively uninhibited interchange among them five oceanic divisions are usually defined pacific atlantic indian arctic and southern last two listed are sometimes consolidated into first three sea is interconnected system of all earth s oceanic waters including atlantic pacific indian southern and arctic oceans however word sea can also be used for many specific much smaller bodies of seawater such as north sea or red sea there is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans though generally seas are smaller and are often partly as marginal seas or wholly as inland seas bordered by land however sargasso sea has no coastline and lies within a circular current north atlantic gyre seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water but sea of galilee

from earth s volcanoes starting 4 billion years ago released by degassing from molten rock more recent work suggests much of earth s water may come from comets a characteristic of seawater is that it is salty salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand 0 or per mil and open ocean has about solids per litre a salinity of 35 0 mediterranean sea is slightly higher at 38 0 while salinity of northern red sea can reach 41 0 constituents of table salt sodium and chloride make up about 85 percent of solids in solution there are also other metal ions such as magnesium and calcium and negative ions including sulphate carbonate and bromide despite variations in levels of salinity in different seas relative composition of dissolved salts is stable throughout world s oceans seawater is too

constant within scale of millions of years various factors affect salinity of a body of water evaporation and by product of ice formation known as brine rejection increase salinity whereas precipitation sea ice melt and runoff from land reduce it baltic sea for example has many rivers flowing into it and thus sea could be considered as brackish meanwhile red sea is very salty due to its high evaporation rate noaa 11 jan 2013 drinking seawater can be deadly to humans sea temperature depends on amount of solar radiation falling on its surface in tropics with sun nearly overhead temperature of surface layers can rise to over while near poles temperature in equilibrium with sea ice is about there is a continuous circulation of water in oceans warm surface currents cool as they move away from tropics and water becomes denser and sinks cold water moves back towards equator as a deep sea current driven by changes in temperature and density of water before eventually welling up again towards surface deep seawater has a temperature between and in all parts of globe seawater with a typical salinity of 35 0 has a freezing point of about 1 8 degc 28 8 degf when its temperature becomes low enough ice crystals form on surface these break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil in calm conditions this freezes into a thin flat sheet known as nilas which thickens as new ice forms on its underside in more turbulent seas frazil crystals join together into flat discs known as pancakes these slide under each other and coalesce to form floes in process of freezing salt water and air are trapped between ice crystals nilas may have a salinity of 12 15 0 but by time sea ice is one year old this falls to 4 6 0 amount of oxygen found in seawater depends primarily on plants growing in it these are mainly algae including phytoplankton with some vascular plants such as seagrasses in daylight photosynthetic activity of these plants produces oxygen which dissolves in seawater and is used by marine animals at night photosynthesis stops and amount of dissolved oxygen declines in deep sea where insufficient light penetrates for plants to grow there is very little dissolved oxygen in its absence organic material is broken down by anaerobic bacteria producing hydrogen sulphide global warming is likely to reduce levels of oxygen in surface waters since solubility of oxygen in water falls at higher temperatures amount of light that penetrates sea depends on angle of sun weather conditions and turbidity of water much light gets reflected at surface and red light gets absorbed in top few metres yellow and green light reach greater depths and blue and violet light may penetrate as deep as there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and plant growth beyond a depth of about waves thumb alt diagram showing movement of molecules as waves pass movement of molecules as waves pass thumb alt diagram showing wave approaching shore when wave enters shallow water it slows down and its amplitude height increases wind blowing over surface of a body of water forms waves that are perpendicular to direction of wind friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form a strong blow over ocean causes larger waves as moving air pushes against raised ridges of water waves reach their maximum height when rate at which they are travelling nearly matches speed of wind in open water when wind blows continuously as happens in southern hemisphere in roaring forties long organised masses of water called swell roll across ocean if wind dies down wave formation is reduced but already formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land size of waves depends on fetch distance that wind has blown over water and strength and duration of that wind when waves meet others coming from different directions interference between two can produce broken irregular seas constructive interference can cause individual unexpected rogue waves much higher than normal garrison tom 2012 essentials of oceanography 6th ed pp 204 ff brooks cole belmont most waves are less than high and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height national meteorological library and archive 2010 fact sheet 6 beaufort scale met office devon offshore

design of maritime structures pp 421 22 world scientific rogue waves however have been documented at heights above laird anne 2006 observed statistics of extreme waves naval postgraduate school monterey top of a wave is known as crest lowest point between waves is trough and distance between crests is wavelength wave is pushed across surface of sea by wind but this represents a transfer of energy and not a horizontal movement of water as waves approach land and move into shallow water they change their behavior if approaching at an angle waves may bend refraction or wrap rocks and headlands diffraction when wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of water contact seabed they begin to slow down this pulls crests closer together and increases waves height which is called wave shoaling when ratio of wave s height to water depth increases above a certain limit it breaks toppling over in a mass of foaming water this rushes in a sheet up beach before retreating into sea under influence of gravity tsunami a tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide a meteorite impact a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into sea these events can temporarily lift or lower surface of sea in affected area usually by a few feet potential energy of displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy creating a shallow wave a tsunami radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to square root of depth of water and which therefore travels much faster in open ocean than on a continental shelf in deep open sea tsunamis have wavelengths of around travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour 970 km hr and usually have a height of less than three feet so they often pass unnoticed at this stage in contrast ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet travel at up to and are up to high a trigger event on continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across ocean energy of wave is dissipated only gradually but is spread out over wave front so as wave radiates away from source front gets longer and average energy reduces so distant shores will on average be hit by weaker waves however as speed of wave is controlled by water depth it does not travel at same speed in all directions and this affects direction of wave front an effect known as refraction which can focus strength of advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography thumb left alt tsunami in thailand 2004 tsunami in thailand as a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously behaving in same way as a wind generated wave in shallow water but on a vastly greater scale either trough or crest of a tsunami can arrive at coast first in former case sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to shore exposed which provides a useful warning for people on land when crest arrives it does not usually break but rushes inland flooding all in its path much of destruction may be caused by flood water draining back into sea after tsunami has struck dragging debris and people with it often several tsunami are caused by a single geological event and arrive at intervals of between eight minutes and two hours first wave to arrive on shore may not be biggest or most destructive occasionally a tsunami may transform into a bore typically in a shallow bay or an estuary currents thumb upright 1 35 alt map showing surface currents surface currents red warm blue cold wind blowing over surface of sea causes friction at interface between air and sea not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes surface seawater move in same direction as wind although winds are variable in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed westerly winds are most frequent in mid latitudes while easterlies dominate tropics when water moves in this way other water flows in to fill gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed there are five main gyres in world s oceans two in pacific two in atlantic and one in indian ocean other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around antarctica these gyres have followed same routes for millennia guided by topography of land wind direction and coriolis effect surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in northern hemisphere and anticlockwise in southern hemisphere water moving away from equator is warm and that flowing in reverse direction has lost most of its heat these currents tend to moderate earth s climate cooling equatorial region and warming regions at higher latitudes global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by world ocean so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as atmosphere land surfaces aerosols and sea ice ocean models make use of a branch of physics geophysical fluid dynamics that describes large scale flow of fluids such as seawater thumb right upright 1 35 alt map showing global conveyor belt global conveyor belt shown in blue with warmer surface currents in red surface currents only affect top few hundred metres yards of sea but there are also large scale flows in ocean depths caused by movement of deep water masses a main deep ocean current flows through all world s oceans and is known as thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt this movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of water caused by variations in salinity and temperature at high latitudes water is chilled by low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out both these factors make it denser and water sinks from deep sea near greenland such water flows southwards between continental landmasses on either side of atlantic when it reaches antarctic it is joined by further masses of cold sinking water and flows eastwards it then splits into two streams that move northwards into indian and pacific oceans here it is gradually warmed becomes less dense rises towards surface and loops back on itself some flows back into atlantic it takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed besides gyres there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions when waves meet a shore at an angle a longshore current is created as water is pushed along parallel to coastline water swirls up onto beach at right angles to approaching waves but drains away straight down slope under effect of gravity larger breaking waves longer beach and more oblique wave approach stronger is longshore current these currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles create spits and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up a rip current can occur when water piles up near shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in seabed it may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man made structure such as a groyne these strong currents can have a velocity of per second can form at different places at different stages of tide and can carry away unwary bathers temporary upwelling currents occur when wind pushes water away from land and deeper water rises to replace it this cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in productivity of sea tides thumb left upright alt diagram showing how sun and moon cause tides high tides blue at nearest and furthest points of earth from moon tides are regular rise and fall in water level experienced by seas and oceans in response to gravitational influences of moon and sun and effects of earth s rotation during each tidal cycle at any given place water rises to a maximum height known as high tide before ebbing away again to minimum low tide level as water recedes it uncovers more and more of foreshore also known as intertidal zone difference in height between high tide and low tide is known as tidal range or tidal amplitude most places experience two high tides each day occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes this is half 24 hours and 50 minute period that it takes for earth to make a complete revolution and return moon to its previous position relative to an observer moon s mass is some 27 million times smaller than sun but it is 400 times closer to earth tidal force or tide raising force decreases rapidly with distance so moon has more than twice as great an effect on tides as sun a bulge is formed in ocean at place where earth is closest to moon because it is also where effect of moon s gravity is stronger on opposite side of earth lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form as moon rotates around earth so do these ocean bulges move around earth gravitational attraction of sun is also working on seas but its effect on tides is less powerful than that of moon and when sun moon and earth are all aligned full moon and new moon combined effect results in high spring tides in contrast when sun is at 90deg from moon as viewed from earth combined gravitational effect on tides is less causing lower neap tides tidal flows of seawater are resisted by water s inertia and can be affected by land masses in places like gulf of mexico where land constrains movement of bulges only one set of tides may occur each day inshore from an island there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides island straits at chalkis on euboea experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when moon and sun are 90 degrees apart see also commentary about this explanation in where there is a funnel shaped bay or estuary tidal range can be magnified bay of fundy is classic example of this and can experience spring tides of although tides are regular and predictable height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds high pressure at centre of an anticyclones pushes down on water and is associated with abnormally low tides while low pressure areas may cause extremely high tides a storm surge can occur when high winds pile water up against coast in a shallow area and this coupled with a low pressure system can raise surface of sea at high tide dramatically in 1900 galveston texas experienced a surge during a hurricane that overwhelmed city killing over 3 500 people and destroying 3 636 homes ocean basins thumb right 300px three types of plate boundary earth is composed of a magnetic central core a mostly liquid mantle and a hard rigid outer shell or lithosphere which is composed of earth s rocky crust and deeper mostly solid outer layer of mantle on land crust is known as continental crust while under sea it is known as oceanic crust latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres three to six miles thick relatively thin lithosphere floats on weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates in mid ocean magma is constantly being thrust through seabed between adjoining plates to form mid oceanic ridges and here convection currents within mantle tend to drive two plates apart parallel to these ridges and nearer coasts one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction deep trenches are formed here and process is accompanied by friction as plates grind together movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes heat is produced and magma is forced up creating underwater mountains some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches near some of boundaries between land and sea slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed as they grate together continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity earth s deepest trench is mariana trench which extends for about across seabed it is near mariana islands a volcanic archipelago in west pacific and though it averages just wide its deepest point is 10 994 kilometres nearly 7 miles below surface of sea an even longer trench runs alongside coast of peru and chile reaching a depth of and extending for approximately it occurs where oceanic nazca plate slides under continental south american plate and is associated with and volcanic activity of andes coasts thumb right 200px praia da marinha in algarve portugal zone where land meets sea is known as coast and part between lowest spring tides and upper limit reached by splashing waves is shore a beach is accumulation of sand or shingle on shore a headland is a point of land jutting out into sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape indentation of a coastline especially between two headlands is a bay a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay may be referred to as a gulf coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including strength of waves arriving on shore gradient of land margin composition and hardness of coastal rock inclination of off shore slope and changes of level of land due to local uplift or submergence normally waves roll towards shore at rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up beach and have little erosive effect storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as swash moves beach material seawards under their influence sand and shingle on beach is ground together and abraded around high tide power of a storm wave impacting on foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure at same time sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against rocks this tends to undercut cliff and normal weathering processes such as action of frost follows causing further destruction gradually a wave cut platform develops at foot of cliff and this has a protective effect reducing further wave erosion material worn from margins of land eventually ends up in sea here it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin sediment carried to sea by rivers settles on seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries all these materials move back and forth under influence of waves tides and currents dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on coastline governments make efforts to prevent flooding of land by building of breakwaters seawalls dykes and levees and other sea defences for instance thames barrier is designed to protect london from a storm surge while failure of dykes and levees around new orleans during hurricane katrina created a humanitarian crisis in united states land reclamation in hong kong also permitted construction of hong kong international airport through leveling and expansion of two smaller islands sea level over most of geologic time sea level has been higher than it is today main factor affecting sea level over time is result of changes in oceanic crust with a downward trend expected to continue in very long term at last glacial maximum some 20 000 years ago sea level was below its present day level for at least last 100 years sea level has been rising at an average rate of about per year most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in temperature of sea and resulting slight thermal expansion of upper of water additional contributions as much as one quarter of total come from water sources on land such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least end of 21st century water cycle sea plays a part in water or hydrological cycle in which water evaporates from ocean travels through atmosphere as vapour condenses falls as rain or snow thereby sustaining life on land and largely returns to sea even in atacama desert where little rain ever falls dense clouds of fog known as blow in from sea and support plant life in central asia and other large land masses there are endorheic basins which have no outlet to sea separated from ocean by mountains or other natural geologic features that prevent water draining away caspian sea is largest one of these its main inflow is from river volga there is no outflow and evaporation of water makes it saline as dissolved minerals accumulate aral sea in kazakhstan and uzbekistan and pyramid lake in western united states are further examples of large inland saline water bodies without drainage some endorheic lakes are less salty but all are sensitive to variations in quality of water carbon cycle oceans contain greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in world and are second only to lithosphere in amount of carbon they store oceans surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with atmosphere deep layer s concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers carbon enters ocean as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves in surface layers and is converted into carbonic acid carbonate and bicarbonate co2 gas co2 aq co2 aq h2o h2co3 h2co3 hco3 h hco3 2 h it can also enter through rivers as dissolved organic carbon and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon this can either be exchanged throughout food chain or precipitated into deeper more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate it circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation acidification seawater is slightly alkaline and had an average ph of about 8 2 over past 300 million years more recently anthropogenic activities have steadily increased carbon dioxide content of atmosphere about 30 40 of added co2 is absorbed by oceans forming carbonic acid and lowering ph now below 8 1 through a process called ocean acidification ph is expected to reach 7 7 representing a 3 fold increase in hydrogen ion concentration by year 2100 which is a significant change in a century one important element for formation of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower ph so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells such as oysters clams sea urchins and corals because their ability to form shells will be reduced and carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to sea surface affected planktonic organisms will include snail like molluscs known as and single celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera all of these are important parts of food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences in tropical regions corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers current rate of ocean chemistry change appears to be without precedent in earth s geological history making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will be able to adapt to shifting conditions of near future of particular concern is manner in which combination of acidification with expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact seas life in sea right upright thumb coral reefs are among most biodiverse habitats in world oceans are home to a diverse collection of life forms that use it as a habitat since sunlight illuminates only upper layers major part of ocean exists in permanent darkness as different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life marine habitats range from surface water to deepest oceanic trenches including coral reefs kelp forests seagrass meadows muddy sandy and rocky seabeds and open pelagic zone organisms living in sea range from whales 30 metres 100 ft long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton fungi and bacteria marine life plays an important part in carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food life may have originated in sea and all major groups of animals are represented there scientists differ as to precisely where in sea life arose miller urey experiments suggested a dilute chemical soup in open water but more recent suggestions include volcanic hot springs fine grained clay sediments or deep sea black smoker vents all of which would have provided protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation which was not blocked by early earth s atmosphere marine habitats marine habitats can be divided horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats coastal habitats extend from shoreline to edge of continental shelf most marine life is found in coastal habitats even though shelf area occupies only 7 percent of total ocean area open ocean habitats are found in deep ocean beyond edge of continental shelf alternatively marine habitats can be divided vertically into pelagic open water demersal just above seabed and benthic sea bottom habitats a third division is by latitude from polar seas with ice shelves sea ice and icebergs to temperate and tropical waters coral reefs so called rainforests of sea occupy less than 0 1 percent of world s ocean surface yet their ecosystems include 25 percent of all marine species best known are tropical coral reefs such as australia s great barrier reef but cold water reefs harbour a wide array of species including corals only six of which contribute to reef formation algae and plants marine primary producers plants and microscopic organisms in plankton are widespread and very essential for

contributed by diatoms much larger algae commonly known as seaweeds are important locally sargassum forms floating drifts while kelp form seabed forests flowering plants in form of seagrasses grow in meadows in sandy shallows mangroves line coast in tropical and subtropical regions and salt tolerant plants thrive in regularly inundated salt marshes all of these habitats are able to sequester large quantities of carbon and support a biodiverse range of larger and smaller animal life light is only able to penetrate top so this is only part of sea where plants can grow surface layers are often deficient in biologically active nitrogen compounds marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include fixation of nitrogen its assimilation nitrification and some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters and also near estuaries where land sourced nutrients are present plant growth is higher this means that most productive areas rich in plankton and therefore also in fish are mainly coastal animals and other marine life thumb right 200px a there is a broader spectrum of higher animal taxa in sea than on land many marine species have yet to be discovered and number known to science is expanding annually some vertebrates such as seabirds seals and sea turtles return to land to breed but fish cetaceans and sea snakes have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate phyla are entirely marine in fact oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats one of these is surface film which even though tossed about by movement of waves provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria fungi microalgae protozoa fish eggs and various larvae pelagic zone contains macro and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with currents most of smallest organisms are larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of complex food chain that extends through variously sized fish and other organisms to large squid sharks porpoises dolphins and whales some marine creatures make large migrations either to other regions of ocean on a seasonal basis or vertical migrations daily often ascending to feed at night and descending to safety by day ships can introduce or spread invasive species through discharge of ballast water or transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of fouling community on hulls of vessels demersal zone supports many animals that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators and seabed provides a range of habitats on or under surface of substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles molluscs and crustaceans neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish here among algal encrusted rocks live sponges echinoderms polychaete worms sea anemones and other invertebrates corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of seabed these provide a biodiverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms there is less sea life on floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from depths where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed close to seabed live demersal fish that feed largely on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates exploration of deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on seabed that scientists had not previously known to exist some like rely on organic material falling to ocean floor others cluster round deep sea hydrothermal vents where mineral rich flows of water emerge from seabed supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide oxidising chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialised bivalves sea anemones barnacles crabs worms and fish often found nowhere else a dead whale

latitude an angle which ranges from 0deg at equator to 90deg at poles was determined by measuring angle between sun moon or a specific star and horizon by use of an astrolabe jacob s staff or sextant longitude a line on globe joining two poles could only be calculated with an accurate chronometer to show exact time difference between ship and a fixed point such as greenwich meridian in 1759 john

showing relative density of commercial shipping around world maritime trade has existed for millennia ptolemaic dynasty had developed trade with india using red sea ports and in first millennium bc arabs phoenicians israelites and indians traded in luxury goods such as spices gold and precious stones phoenicians were noted sea traders and under greeks and romans commerce continued to thrive with collapse of roman empire european trade dwindled but it continued to flourish among kingdoms of africa middle east india china and southeastern asia from 16th to 19th centuries about 13 million people were shipped across atlantic to be sold as slaves in americas nowadays large quantities of goods are transported by sea especially across atlantic and around pacific rim a major trade route passes through pillars of hercules across mediterranean and suez canal to indian ocean and through straits of malacca much trade also passes through english channel shipping lanes are routes on open sea used by cargo vessels traditionally making use of trade winds and currents over 60 percent of world s container traffic is conveyed on top twenty trade routes increased melting of arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel northwest passage for some weeks in summertime avoiding longer routes via suez canal or panama canal shipping is supplemented by air freight a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes seaborne trade carries more than us 4 trillion worth of goods each year there are two main kinds of freight bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo most of which is now transported in containers commodities in form of liquids powder or particles are carried loose in holds of bulk carriers and include oil grain coal ore scrap metal sand and gravel break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages often stacked on pallets before arrival of in 1950s these goods were loaded transported and unloaded piecemeal use of containers has greatly increased efficiency and decreased cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized lockable containers loaded on purpose built container ships at

are among most important sources of protein and other nutrients that are essential for a balanced diet and good health in 2009 16 6 of world s intake of animal protein and 6 5 of all protein consumed came from fish in order to fulfill this need coastal countries have exploited marine resources in their exclusive economic zone although fishing vessels are increasingly venturing further afield to exploit stocks in international waters in 2011 total world production of fish including aquaculture was estimated to be 154 million tonnes of which most was for human consumption harvesting of wild fish accounted for 90 4 million tonnes while annually increasing aquaculture contributes rest north west pacific is by far most productive area with 20 9 million tonnes 27 percent of global marine catch in 2010 in addition number of fishing vessels in 2010 reached 4 36 million whereas number of people employed in primary sector of fish production in same year amounted to 54 8 million modern

great quantities of fish equipment used to capture fish may be purse seines other seines trawls dredges gillnets and long lines and fish species most frequently targeted are herring cod anchovy tuna flounder mullet squid and salmon overexploitation itself has become a serious concern it does not only cause depletion of fish stocks but also substantially reduce population of predatory fish populations myers estimated that industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80 within 15 years of exploitation in order to avoid overexploitation many countries have introduced quotas in their own waters however recovery efforts often entail substantial costs to local economies or food provision nonetheless research published in nature in april 2018 found that aggressive effort of indonesian minister of maritime affairs and fisheries of indonesia susi to curtail illegal fishing has reduced total fishing effort by at least 25 potentially generate a 14 increase in catch and a 12 increase in profit therefore paper concluded that many nations can recover their fisheries while avoiding these short term costs by sharply addressing illegal unreported and unregulated

plants and animals were cultured some for use in seeding wild populations animals raised included finfish aquatic reptiles crustaceans molluscs sea cucumbers sea urchins sea squirts and jellyfish integrated has advantage that there is a readily available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally various methods are employed mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in open seas cages can be used in more sheltered waters or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to open sea ropes can be hung in water to grow algae oysters and mussels oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes sea cucumbers can be ranched on seabed captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in maine at least 145 species of seaweed red green and brown algae are eaten worldwide and some have long been farmed in japan and other asian countries there is great potential for additional few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire which is eaten both raw and cooked a major difficulty for aquaculture

shallows and many people take pleasure in bathing and relaxing on beach this was not always case with sea bathing becoming vogue in europe in 18th century after dr william buchan advocated practice for health reasons surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer with or without a surfboard other marine water sports include kite surfing where a power kite propels a manned board across water windsurfing where power is provided by a fixed manoeuvrable sail and water skiing where a powerboat is used to pull a skier beneath surface freediving is necessarily restricted to shallow descents pearl divers have traditionally greased their skins put cotton in their ears and clips on their noses and dived to with baskets to collect oysters human eyes are not adapted for use underwater but vision can be improved by wearing a diving mask other useful equipment includes fins and snorkels and scuba equipment allows underwater breathing and hence a longer time can be spent beneath surface depths that can be reached by divers and length of time they can stay underwater is limited by increase of pressure they experience as they descend and need to prevent decompression sickness as they return to surface recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of beyond which danger of nitrogen narcosis increases deeper dives can be made with specialised equipment and training power generation sea offers a very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity differences and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to generate

affordable and reliable wave machines problematic to develop a small 2 mw commercial wave power plant osprey was built in northern scotland in 1995 about 300 metres 1000 ft offshore it was soon damaged by waves then destroyed by a storm marine current power could provide populated areas close to sea with a significant part of their energy needs in principle it could be harnessed by open flow turbines sea bed systems are available but limited to a depth of about offshore wind power is captured by wind turbines placed out at sea it has advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore first offshore wind farm was installed in denmark in 1991 and installed capacity of european offshore wind farms reached 3 gw in 2010 electricity power stations are often located on coast or beside an estuary so that sea can be used as a heat sink a colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation which is important for expensive nuclear power plants in particular extractive industries seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging this has advantages over land based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides tendency for excavations to silt up and washing away of spoil heaps there is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage thumb left alt minerals from hydrothermal vent minerals precipitated near a hydrothermal vent seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver gold copper lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in 1960s they form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as black smokers ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract small scale mining of deep sea floor is being developed off coast of papua new guinea using robotic techniques but obstacles are formidable there are large deposits of petroleum as oil and natural gas in rocks beneath seabed offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract oil or gas and store it for transport to land offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to remote harsh environment drilling for oil in sea has environmental impacts animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits probably causing beaching of whales toxic substances such as mercury lead and arsenic may be released infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt large quantities of methane clathrate exist on seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around and these are of interest as a potential energy source some estimates put amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres 0 24 to 1 2 million cubic miles also on seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron manganese and other hydroxides around a core in pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of deep ocean floor minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly their commercial extraction for nickel was investigated in 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources in suitable locations diamonds are gathered from seafloor using suction hoses to bring gravel ashore in deeper waters mobile seafloor crawlers are used and deposits are pumped to a vessel above in namibia more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land thumb upright alt desalination plant reverse osmosis desalination plant sea holds enormous quantities of valuable dissolved minerals most important salt for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times bromine accumulated after being leached from land is economically recovered from dead sea where it occurs at 55 000 parts per million ppm desalination is technique of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation two main processing methods vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis use large quantities of energy desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful as in excess heat generated by power stations brine produced as a by product contains some toxic materials and is returned to sea marine pollution many substances enter sea as a result of human activities combustion products are transported in air and deposited into sea by precipitation industrial outflows and sewage contribute heavy metals pesticides pcbs disinfectants household cleaning products and other synthetic chemicals these become concentrated in surface film and in marine sediment especially estuarine mud result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of large number of substances involved and lack of information on their biological effects heavy metals of greatest concern are copper lead mercury cadmium and zinc which may be bio accumulated by marine invertebrates they are cumulative toxins and are passed up food chain much floating plastic rubbish does not biodegrade instead disintegrating over time and eventually breaking down to molecular level rigid plastics may float for years in centre of pacific gyre there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in atlantic foraging sea birds such as albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs may sink threatening filter feeders on seabed most oil pollution in sea comes from cities and industry oil is dangerous for marine animals it can clog feathers of sea birds reducing their insulating effect and birds buoyancy and be ingested when they preen themselves in an attempt to remove contaminant marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through removal of their insulation blinded dehydrated or poisoned benthic invertebrates are swamped when oil sinks fish are poisoned and food chain is disrupted in short term oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced leisure activities being affected and livelihoods of people dependant on sea being devastated marine environment has self cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from sea in gulf of mexico where oil eating bacteria are already present they take only a few days to consume spilt oil run off of fertilisers from agricultural land is a major source of pollution in some areas and discharge of raw sewage has a similar effect extra nutrients provided by these sources can cause excessive plant growth nitrogen is often limiting factor in marine systems and with added nitrogen algal blooms and red tides can lower oxygen level of water and kill marine animals such events have created dead zones in baltic sea and gulf of mexico some algal blooms are caused by cyanobacteria that make shellfish that filter feed on them toxic harming animals like sea otters nuclear facilities too can pollute irish sea was
