century when early chinese settlers in 1995 p 156 experimented in cash crop plantations with various types of crops including pepper gambier and clove plantations were abandoned by late 18th century as penang experienced wars from buginese seafarers that resulted in many gambier plantations being destroyed contributing to decline in plantations was growing popularity of spice trade that reaped much greater profits hussin 2007 p 119 at beginning of 19th century these chinese settlers began to look south to malacca and singapore where gambier and pepper plantations had also been established in late 1820s chinese settlers from singapore also began to look towards johor for gambier and pepper cultivation at encouragement of temenggong abdul rahman and his successor daeng ibrahim gambe 2000

affairs upon kangchu hooker 2003 p 108 he began issuing official permits known as surat sungai transliterated as river documents in malay to kangchu leaders of settlers which permitted them to establish these plantations along river banks in turn kangchu were required to pay taxes from profits generated by gambier and pepper farms and surat sungai which had to be renewed after a specified

of conflicting economic interests from late 1850s onwards kangchu began to exert political influence in state affairs by establishing close ties with temenggong abu bakar in 1865 abu bakar granted official recognition to teochew dominated johor branch of ngee heng kongsi after a kangchu tan kee soon raised a small army to subdue sultan ali s forces from whom abu bakar was facing considerable dissent but was unable to raise an organised army ahmad liok 2003 p 308 abu bakar nevertheless called for ngee heng kongsi to accept chinese settlers of other dialect groups to prevent possible communal warfare as a result of conflicting economic interests left thumb chinese junks sailing in straits of johor in 1879 crop produce from these plantations were generally exported to other countries from singapore with assistance of chinese merchants based in that city from 1860s onwards many of these kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates kongsi in teochew based in singapore who were known to locals as tuan sungai literally masters of river kangchu then were often hired as supervisors or managers by merchants to keep watch on day to day operations of gambier and pepper plantations temenggong abu bakar began to issue contract style letters of recognition to these kangchu letters were known by their malay name surat ahmad liok 2003 p 311 as gambier and pepper plantations expanded in 1870s more established kangchu were entrusted with larger blocks of farms and made contracts with chinese merchants from singapore profits generated from harvests of these plantations formed bulk of johor s economy and financed development of johor s infrastructure abu bakar s relationship with chinese leaders was excellent and he appointed many of them to political positions in state of particular note abu bakar appointed two chinese leaders to johor state council a kangchu from tan nee and a contractor from taishan wong ah fook who also owned gambier and pepper farms in mersing in 1880s ahmad liok 2003 p 313 as land along river banks in southern johor was already taken by earlier waves of

19th century johor s economy began to diversify from gambier and pepper plantations to other agricultural crops starting with coffee in 1881 ahmad liok 2003 p 316 crops such as tapioca tea pineapple and rubber were introduced into state coffee and tapioca was quickly abandoned in 1890s when value of these crops experienced a drop while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in johor as world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910 andaya 1984 p 214 prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906 and many kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber jackson 1968 p 49 further decline in number of gambier and pepper plantations was fuelled by colonial government s suppression of traditional farming methods employed by kangchu for planting gambier and pepper these method led to soil exhaustion and a depletion of forests which was used as firewood in small factories andaya 1984 p 211 2 a few years before kangchu system was abolished exports for both gambier and pepper plunged by a further 60 between 1912 and 1917 tate 1971 p 198 british had long frowned upon kangchu because of their links with secret societies in singapore as well as their indulgence in social vices such as gambling and opium smoking activities which british had been actively suppressing in singapore and federated malay states as early as 1890 governor of straits settlements cecil clementi smith had lobbied abu bakar to adopt societies ordinance and ban ngee heng kongsi but was promptly turned down ahmad liok 2003 pp 316 7 shortly after british appointed an

state government which was by then effectively administered by british colonial government role of kangchu temenggong of johor later sultan of johor conferred upon kangchu with a large degree of administrative autonomy within plot of land which each was granted these included right to collect taxes on behalf for temenggong as well as for welfare needs among chinese coolies living within plot of land kangchu generally granted tax exemption for basic consumption by workers within settlement some coolies took on new jobs such as shopkeepers and traders to serve needs of other coolies within settlement and kangchu granted tax exemptions to these shopkeepers and traders on sale of pork opium and alcohol as well lim 2002 p 79 kangchu reserved a portion of land for construction of a settlement for coolies from which small towns were formed and became administrative centre of kangchu these administrative centres were generally established within coolie settlements located at foot of river and were known as literally foot of river chinese gang jiao pinyin gang jiao teochew kaang6 trocki 1979 p 90 kangchu acted as middleman in bulk purchase of settlement s commodities through suppliers based in singapore in particular opium was highly popular among coolies although frowned upon by british who took strong measures to suppress its distribution kangchu formed illegal opium syndicates which had links to chinese leaders from singapore and other malay states in north particularly selangor british contempt for kangchu was also fuelled by coolies preference for gambling and prostitution both of which were seen as social vices by british colonial government kangchu maintained friendly relations with temenggong later sultan and worked closely with ngee heng kongsi in administrative matters in particular state government attempted to forge close relations with kangchu by appointment of a malay official who was conversant in teochew and literate in chinese characters mohamed salleh bin perang as liaison officer between temenggong and kangchu several years later in early 1870s state government worked closely with ngee heng kongsi to draft kanun kangchu

chinese coolies at river base of jurong river in 1860 gambier and pepper plantation is in picture background chinese settlers began migrating from riau islands to singapore in 19th century shortly before founding of singapore by sir stamford raffles in 1819 native malays joined chinese in growing gambier although they cultivated it for subsistence rather than for commercial purposes yan 1986 p 120 number of gambier and pepper farms expanded greatly between 1819 and 1840 fuelled by increasing demand for gambier by chinese traders from china as well as pepper by european traders ownby heidhues 1993 p 101 as land nearer to town in south was quickly used up in 1820s kangchu began to establish farms near northern parts of singapore particularly stretches of land across straits of johor from jurong to west of punggol in northeast corfield corfield 2006 p 206 by 1851 there were about 800 gambier and pepper farms which covered 75 of singapore s land surface of which was dedicated to gambier while 2 614 was dedicated to pepper in 1850s and 1860s many kangchu abandoned their plantations in singapore as gambier produce declined due to over farming of soil and began to establish new gambier and pepper plantations in neighbouring johor havinden meredith 1996 pp 40 1 nevertheless many of these kangchu settled down as merchants in singapore and managed gambier and pepper farms by proxy mainly through liaison body of ngee heng kongsi which had members in singapore and johor some of these merchants purchased property rights of gambier and pepper farms from kangchu in johor who would then assume managerial tasks to ensure smooth operation of plantation and settlement ownby heidhues 1993 p 99 unlike its counterpart in johor ngee heng kongsi also called ghi hin kongsi in hokkien was recognised as an illegal society in singapore and its activities were actively suppressed by colonial government ownby heidhues 1993 p 90 factionalism appeared within ngee heng kongsi in singapore by 1850s as business leaders from various dialect groups were unable to agree upon key issues in particular relations between teochews and hokkiens were hostile partly because some hokkien merchants competed with teochew merchants in gambier and pepper trade most of whom had established their bases in boat quay area along singapore river trocki 2006 pp 90 1 existence of kangchu was not recognised by british colonial government even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in johor nevertheless kangchu in singapore had easy access to forested land in singapore compared to their counterparts in johor as british colonial government adopted a laissez faire attitude to kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities however british were wary of fact that many kangchu in singapore were members of ngee heng kongsi which was illegal in singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over regional opium trade british appointed a chinese official among kangchu to oversee social and economic affairs of gambier and pepper plantations in singapore and to act as intermediary ownby heidhues 1993 p 102 riau islands first gambier and pepper plantations appeared in riau islands in 1730s royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland 1975 p 133 after buginese warrior and second yamtuan muda of riau brought chinese coolies from malaya to riau for purpose of gambier cultivation which was then widely used for medication among locals another exodus of chinese migrated to riau in 1740 following unrest which erupted in batavia during which many chinese were massacred chinese settlement in riau continued into 18th century majority of them coming from area in guangdong province along with a sizeable minority from southern parts of fujian province andaya 1984 p 94 gambier and pepper farming were mainly confined to bintan formerly spelled as and galang islands trocki 1979 p 113 similar to kangchu system in johor gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by yamtuan muda of riau who would issue land permits surat sungai to kangchu who would direct operations of plantation and workers within settlement in early and middle 19th century many chinese settlers and merchants from riau relocated their businesses to singapore and established trading links between riau and singapore these settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with riau as kangchu from riau often shipped their produce to singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by dutch colonial government ownby heidhues 1993 p 98 like singapore competition for gambier and pepper trade between teochews and hokkiens in riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in riau during 1840s and 1850s in early 20th century chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices as worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing archipelago gerber 2006 p 176 sarawak first chinese immigrants settled along coastal regions of sarawak in significant numbers from 18th century onwards and were engaged in metal mining industry mainly for gold and bauxite as supply of gold became exhausted from 1820s onwards chinese miners gradually turned to trade and agriculture chinese of teochew and hakka heritage established gambier and pepper plantations in 1870s and 1880s gerber 2006 p 173 and white rajah of sarawak began to organise an administrative system for these plantations similar to kangchu system in johor kangchu of each plantation was appointed by charles brooke then white rajah each kangchu was given responsibilities to oversee operations of plantations under his jurisdiction and welfare of coolies living there in 1875 british promulgated a set of laws which defined roles and responsibilities of kangchu they were modelled very closely to kanun kangchu that was introduced by sultan abu bakar of johor in 1873 swets zeitlinger 1971 p 210 charles brooke encouraged immigration of chinese coolies beginning in 1860s to expand state s gambier and pepper industry chinese settlers in neighbouring sabah and pontianak also established gambier and pepper plantations although they existed as independent fiefdoms these plantations rose to become one of state s major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went up during 1880s and 1890s in 20th century as worldwide gambier prices took a dive kangchu channelled their efforts into pepper and opium cultivation in state tate 1971 p 264 sarawak s kangchu system fell into obscurity in 1920s as opium trade with hong kong steadily declined during course of decade legacy kangchu system facilitated growth of gambier and pepper plantations and developed johor s and singapore s economies in 19th century development of johor s inland towns were attributed to efforts by various kangchu who were responsible for drawing settlement plan for coolies living within plantation they were working on from which new towns were formed tregonning 1964 p 140 chinese immigrant population in johor and singapore grew in size during this period riau also experienced a similar growth during 18th century as a result of mass immigration by chinese into johor chinese quickly outnumbered malays in state although many chinese coolies relocated to singapore or other parts of malaya as gambier and pepper industry declined in 20th century several towns and other places in johor and singapore built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations are named after former features of kangchu system and are largely populated by ethnic chinese blythe 1969 p 41 teochew dialect became lingua franca among chinese in many parts of johor and riau as majority of chinese from these areas were of teochew origin many of whom were descended from chinese coolies who had worked in gambier and pepper plantations pan 1999 pp 173 4
