manhattan other is ny 25 in northern westchester county ny 9a follows briarcliff peekskill parkway origins of ny 9a date back to 1920s when an alternate route of then ny 6 from yonkers to tarrytown was designated as ny 6a ny 6 was redesignated as us 9 in 1927 however ny 6a was not renumbered to ny 9a until 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york ny 9a was extended south into new york city in 1934 and north to ossining in late 1930s in 1933 briarcliff peekskill parkway opened as ny 404 all of ny 404 was incorporated into an extended ny 9a on january 1 1949 ny 9a was extended northward to peekskill in 1967 following completion of croton expressway and southward to brooklyn battery tunnel in mid 1990s route description thumb left ny 9a northbound at 52nd street in manhattan ny 9a

manor ny 9a separates from us 9 along ashburton avenue and heads north as saw mill river road it parallels saw mill river parkway through ardsley and elmsford to west side of hawthorne route meets southbound new york state thruway i 87 at a partial interchange and later meets i 287 cross westchester expressway at a full interchange that provides a route to northbound thruway i 87 ny 100 merges with ny 9a to form a concurrency carrying names saw mill river road and briarcliff peekskill parkway parallel to taconic state parkway ny 9a exits off this highway along briarcliff peekskill parkway while ny 100 continues straight as saw mill river road ny 9a merges to form a brief concurrency with us 9 as croton expressway in ossining just south of croton river second concurrency between us 9 and ny 9a runs for 1 10 miles with ny 9a leaving croton expressway at ny 129 in croton on hudson highway heads north along riverside avenue and eventually joins old albany post road after crossing us 9 once more in cortlandt ny 9a ends at avenue interchange in southern peekskill history origins prior to establishment of u s highway system us 9 was designated as ny 6 an alternate route from yonkers to tarrytown was assigned ny 6a designation by 1926 this ran along present alignment of ny 9a from yonkers to north of elmsford where it turned west on old saw mill river road road county house road and bedford road to end at ny 6 in tarrytown ny 6 was redesignated as us 9 when u s highways were first posted in new york in 1927 however ny 6a was not renumbered at this time this edition shows u s routes as they were first officially signed in 1927 it was finally renumbered to ny 9a as part of 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york automobile legal association ala automobile green book 1930 31 and 1931 32 editions scarborough motor guide co boston 1930 and 1931 1930 31 edition shows new york state routes prior to 1930 renumbering thumb right tarrytown including us 9 and ny 9a in 1938 new york city initially did not mark numbered routes within its limits in 1932 new york automobile club drafted a plan establishing alignments for several routes through city in this plan ny 9a went south through bronx and into manhattan on broadway while us 9 used riverdale avenue north of 230th street as a result two routes would have had a short concurrency across spuyten duyvil creek ny 9a would have split to south on tenth avenue at 218th street in order to join harlem river drive via nagle avenue and dyckman street from there it would head west on 155th street to amsterdam avenue where it would head south to 79th street heading west there to rejoin us 9 at riverside drive us 9 would have continued south through lower manhattan to staten island via staten island ferry however it is unclear whether ny 9a would have continued south with us 9 to lower manhattan new york automobile club released another plan in 1933 this plan made no changes to ny 9a however us 9 was changed to use broadway all way through bronx and to travel to new jersey by way of holland tunnel in final plan implemented in mid december 1934 no route was assigned to harlem river drive amsterdam avenue corridor instead ny 9a used what had been planned as us 9 splitting at broadway and dyckman street ny 9a ran south along west side of manhattan on riverside drive and west side elevated highway detouring around an unfinished section via 57th street eleventh avenue and 48th street to end at entrance and exit plazas of holland tunnel us 9 was shifted northward to enter new jersey via george washington bridge westchester county in westchester county saw mill river road originally followed saw mill river parkway corridor from to hawthorne this section of saw mill river road gained a number becoming part of ny 142 a route that began at ny 100 on greenburgh mount pleasant town line and followed grasslands road ny 9a and saw mill river road north to hawthorne where it rejoined ny 100 route went unchanged until it was removed its former routing was split into two routes an extended ny 141 north of ny 9a and new ny 100c along grasslands road by 1940 ny 9a was extended northward from tarrytown to a small hamlet midway between tarrytown and ossining by way of sleepy hollow road farther north a new highway was built around ossining from saw mill river road ny 100 in briarcliff manor to us 9 north of ossining highway known as briarcliff peekskill parkway was completed and initially designated as ny 404 on january 1 1949 ny 9a was altered to continue north along a slightly realigned saw mill river road from ny 100c near elmsford to south end of briarcliff peekskill parkway in briarcliff manor at this point ny 9a left saw mill river road and followed parkway to its end at us 9 supplanting ny 404 realignment created a overlap between ny 9a and ny 100 from hawthorne to briarcliff manor and resulted in truncation of ny 141 back to its previous terminus in hawthorne thumb left 1974 photo of collapsed section of west side elevated highway at 14th street construction on croton expressway only piece of failed hudson river expressway project that was ever built began in mid 1960s it became part of a realigned us 9 when it was completed by 1967 former surface routing of us 9 along albany post road between croton on hudson and buchanan became a northward extension of ny 9a which reached old alignment by way of an overlap with us 9 from north end of briarcliff peekskill parkway to croton on hudson new york city thumb ny 9a end sign approaching its southern terminus at battery place in battery park city as henry hudson parkway replaced riverside drive in mid 1930s ny 9a was moved onto it eventually using new parkway to where it crossed us 9 broadway in bronx here ny 9a exited parkway and ran concurrent with us 9 to split in yonkers brooklyn battery tunnel connecting manhattan s battery park to brooklyn was completed in 1950 by 1960 an extension of west side elevated highway south to manhattan tunnel portal became part of ny 27a which had ended in brooklyn prior to construction of tunnel on january 1 1970 ny 27a was truncated on its western end to eastern nassau county while ny 27 was extended northward over ny 27a s former routing through battery tunnel and west side elevated highway however by 1973 ny 27 had been cut back to its interchange with gowanus expressway in brooklyn while unsigned i 478 was assigned to both battery tunnel and all of west side elevated highway south of lincoln tunnel ny 9a was cut back to lincoln tunnel as a result extension of i 478 into manhattan was eliminated following collapse of part of elevated highway in 1973 an event which led to demolition of highway south of 59th street demolition was completed in 1989 ny 9a was shifted onto 12th avenue one of surface streets that elevated highway had run atop of but was otherwise unaffected as route s south end was initially kept at lincoln tunnel in mid 1990s ny 9a was extended south to battery tunnel by way of 12th avenue and two other streets elevated highway had previously run atop of west street and 11th avenue construction began in early 1996 on a project to convert section of ny 9a south of 59th street into west side highway a six lane urban boulevard with a parkway style median and decorative lightposts first of project s seven segments between clarkson and horatio streets in greenwich village neighborhood was completed in 1998 completion of project was originally set for october 2001 however it was delayed for years due to damage caused by september 11 attacks it was finished by 2014 major intersections all exits on briarcliff peeksill parkway and croton expressway are unnumbered see also u s route 9 business now
