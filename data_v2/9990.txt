james poniewozik of time magazine concluded that it showed stakes behind its characters paper pushing lives in a way it hasn t since michael scott left scranton he called first half a wacky ensemble show but said that last part featured elements that allowed audience to all but hear old machinery of earlier episodes waking up and sliding into place poniewozik stated that jim and pam s fight was believable in its arc and its parameters and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable ally serrigran of hollywood com wrote that episode was one worth tuning in for she felt that for fans of show who had left when steve carell departed customer loyalty was right episode for them to come back to series she called fight between jim and pam jarring in and of itself mark perigard of boston herald commented on fight between jim and pam writing that it felt just like kind of argument that two real people would have brett harrison davinger of california literary review wrote that episode was fine and was composed of several small storylines all of which worked davinger called ending odd but effective michael tedder of vulture wrote positively of episode and awarded it four out of five stars he called final fight between pam and jim ugly and real and one in which writers didn t flinch in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable tedder complimented both fischer and krasinski and wrote that krasinski doesn t try to make jim look charming in this fight just terrified and exhausted he called nellie s subplot best use of this new version of nellie but wrote that dwight and darryl s subplot was undeveloped rick porter of zap2it felt that while episode was up and down he wrote that dwight and darryl s subplot was flat but that erin and pete s yielded several humorous lines final confrontation between jim and pam was a big dose of reality and that it was not a contrived fight david wilcox of citizen wrote that fight between pam and jim was welcome because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had hooked up and started living their perfect little lives together wilcox praised way in which fight was written and wrote that he couldn t help smiling not because fight wasn t wrenching to watch but because it was cindy white of ign awarded episode a 7 8 out of 10 denoting a good episode she reasoned that while episode was funny but largely forgettable final scene made it worth watching not all reviews were as positive erik adams of a v club awarded episode a c and called it a middle of road table setting episode of office with a tacked on coda adams wrote that episode was not really a story at all because it was dragged down by elements that are necessary for episode to play as a standalone piece even though it s not meant to be taken as one adams was complimentary towards episode s cold open but wrote that there aren t a whole lot of quality laughs in customer loyalty nick campbell of tv com felt that erin and pete relationship was not constructed properly nor was conclusion satisfying furthermore he felt that ending fight was petty many reviews commented on reveal of documentary crew e online named reveal one of best tv moments of week verne gay of newsday called scene a historic moment for show serrigran wrote that between jim and pam fighting and cameramen making an appearance scene was a lot to take in however she felt that scene was properly done jason hughes of huffington post called reveal a huge and shocking moment tedder called reveal something that we ve never seen before on office he admitted that last five minutes of this episode genuinely startled me which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season porter called shots with brian good because it reaffirmed that camera crew was a character one that had been an integral part of show wilcox wrote that brian s appearance was a weird turn and that it was kind of funny that first time a member of camera crew intervened with characters was when pam needed comforting and not one of dwight or michael s dozens of near death experiences poniewozik enjoyed reveal of documentary crew however he wrote that i don t know if i m going to like idea of making brian an actual player in events if indeed that s where show is going adams on other hand said that reveal of cameramen was a big moment for office but it has a hollow ring to it because cameramen had never before interacted with members of office before campbell wrote that show played its documentary crew trump card way too early and noted that crew had never intervened in past events that were on same level as pam crying references external links customer loyalty at nbc com category 2013 american
