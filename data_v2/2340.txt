hurricane omar was a powerful tropical cyclone that took an unusual southwest to northeast track through eastern caribbean sea during mid october 2008 forming out of a tropical disturbance on october 13 omar initially moved slowly in eastern caribbean sea by october 15 omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around center of circulation later that day an eye developed and storm began to accelerate to northeast early on october 16 omar reached its peak intensity with maximum winds of 130 mph 215 km h and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar hpa 28 29 inhg shortly after hurricane rapidly weakened to category 1 intensity after slightly re strengthening next day omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non convective low pressure area remnants of omar persisted until october 21 at which time they dissipated to west of azores throughout eastern caribbean omar affected numerous islands most of which only recorded minor impacts large swells and heavy rains impacted abc islands antigua and barbuda sustained 54 million in damages mainly on antigua as nine homes were destroyed several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters one person died in puerto rico after suffering a stress induced cardiac arrest united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage costing roughly 6 million numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped total losses from storm were estimated at 79 million meteorological history on september 30 a well developed tropical wave moved off eastern coast of africa and entered atlantic ocean deep convection formed around a prominent mid level circulation as it moved towards west however convection diminished on october 2 before entering caribbean sea a week later upon entering caribbean sea shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around low continued development followed and low was designated as tropical depression fifteen at 0600 utc on october 13 while located about 190 miles 305 kilometres south of southeastern tip of dominican republic previous steady westward motion that system took across atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two as structure of storm improved it was upgraded to a tropical storm and national hurricane center nhc gave it name omar located to southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to west of a low to mid level ridge omar took a counter clockwise turn on october 14 upon becoming a tropical storm omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around center of circulation wind shear around storm which was previously inhibiting quick development weakened allowing for further strengthening later that day an 11 5 to 17 2 mi 18 5 to 27 7 km wide eye formed as storm began to turn towards northeast due to trough with formation of an eye dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75 mph 120 km h signifying that omar had intensified into a hurricane intensification briefly stalled as eyewall eroded and center of storm became slightly elliptical however deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as storm neared puerto rico shortly after eye quickly became well defined and appeared on visible satellite images an indication storm was intensifying chances of rapid intensification were good as storm featured well developed outflow and prominent banding features with very warm sea surface temperatures high ocean heat content low wind shear and a moist air mass omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on october 16 as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph 215 km h during intensification phase forward motion of hurricane increased to 20 mph 32 km h once in atlantic ocean omar began to rapidly weaken with winds decreasing by 50 mph 85 km h in 12 hours visible satellite images depicted an exposed low level circulation with convection displaced to east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air by october 17 most of deep convection associated with system dissipated however a brief decrease in wind shear allowed omar to re strengthen to its secondary peak with winds of 85 mph 140 km h during this phase convection redeveloped around center and an eye reformed later that day trough that caused rapid northeastern motion bypassed omar leading to decreasing movement right thumb hurricane omar at its secondary peak with winds of 85 mph 140 km h a weakening storm omar continued towards northeast due to a mid to upper level ridge located south of system and mid latitude westerlies to north late on october 17 wind shear increased once more as omar tracked over waters below around 0000 utc on october 18 omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated twelve hours later while still producing tropical storm force winds storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area remnants of omar persisted until 0600 utc on october 21 when they dissipated about 805 mi 1 295 km west of azores preparations thumb left infrared satellite loop of hurricane omar from

infrared satellite on october 15 governor of united states virgin islands announced final preparations for hurricane omar as he signed a state of emergency declaration for territory public schools would be closed on october 16 all non essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a m local time at 6 p m curfew was put in place for same day only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after curfew was put in place that same day a hurricane warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane force winds and torrential rains from omar american red cross planned to open shelters throughout islands before hurricane struck sandbags were also being distributed in st croix a large oil refinery which produces was shut down and only necessary workers remained at refinery on sint maarten officials advised residents to start all necessary actions to prepare for a hurricane residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture that could become airborne during storm place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes and mariners should find a safe haven a curfew from 10 00 p m on october 15 to 10 00 a m on october 16 was put in place due to possibility of flash flooding residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until all clear was given owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas as a precaution water supply would be shut down from 8 00 p m october 15 to 8 00 a m october 16 four public areas st peters community center dutch quarter community center genevieve de school and salvation army building would be used as emergency shelters all public activities flights and schools were either closed or canceled on puerto rico eighteen shelters were open on eastern part of island also on anguilla residents in sandy ground valley

amounted to 25 million in puerto rico a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home as a tropical wave precedent to omar produced heavy rains over island causing minor flooding after passing by puerto rico a second time omar produced locally heavy rains which caused minor street flooding on st croix waves up to from omar sank about 47 boats leading to a large oil spill around islands about 400 ships broke lose from docks 200 of which lost their anchors omar produced upwards of of rain on island within a 24 hour span although st croix was
