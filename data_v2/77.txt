nevado de longavi is a volcano in andes of central chile high volcano lies in linares province which is part of maule region it features a summit crater and several parasitic vents volcano is constructed principally from lava flows two collapses of edifice have carved collapse scars into volcano one on eastern slope known as lomas limpias and another on southwestern slope known as los volcano features a glacier and achibueno and blanco rivers originate on mountain oldest volcanic activity occurred one million years ago after a first phase characterized by production of basaltic andesite bulk of edifice was constructed by andesitic lava flows volcanic rock that makes up nevado de longavi features an unusual magma chemistry that resembles adakite having geochemical characteristics of magma thought to have formed by partial melting of altered basalt that is subducted below volcanic arcs it may be consequence of magma being unusually water rich which may occur because mocha fracture zone subducts beneath volcano nevado de longavi was active during holocene 6 835 65 or 7 500 years before present an explosive eruption deposited pumice more than away from volcano a lava flow was then erupted over pumice last eruption occurred about 5 700 years ago and formed a lava dome volcano has no historic eruptions but fumarolic activity is ongoing nevado de longavi is monitored by national geology and mining service of chile geography nevado de longavi lies in longavi commune of linares province maule region regional thumb nevado de longavi seen from chile nevado de longavi lies in andean mountain range s southern volcanic zone which extends between 33 and 46 degrees southern latitude it is one among 60 volcanoes in chile and argentina that lie within southern volcanic zone among largest volcanic eruptions in this area were 1932 quizapu and 1991 cerro hudson eruptions nevado de longavi is usually put into transitional southern volcanic zone one of four segments which southern volcanic zone is subdivided into they are characterized by different thicknesses of crust that volcanoes are constructed on and by differences in volcanic rocks farther east lie tatara san pedro and laguna del maule volcanoes geology volcanism in southern volcanic zone is caused by subduction of nazca plate beneath south american plate in peru chile trench at a pace of southern volcanic zone is one among several volcanic belts in andean volcanic belt areas without volcanic activity separate it from central volcanic zone in north and austral volcanic zone in south these gaps appear to coincide where juan fernandez ridge and chile rise respectively subduct in peru chile trench in volcanic gaps subducting slab seems to be attached to overriding plate without an asthenosphere in between suppressing production of magma there is a strong gradient among volcanoes of southern volcanic zone northernmost volcanoes are highest and lie on thicker crust which causes their magmas to have a stronger crustal contribution output of northernmost volcanoes is dominated by andesitic and more evolved magmas and they have highest quantity of incompatible elements in their magmas southern volcanoes are lower tend to erupt mafic magmas and are located west of continental divide volcanism in areas of subduction is caused by release of slab fluids from subducting slab into asthenospheric mantle injection of such fluids triggers and formation of magmas conversely descending slab itself is usually not considered a major contributor to magma genesis such exceptional magmas are often referred to as adakites but magmas with such a chemistry can also originate by other processes local nevado de longavi lies within a small mountain chain it was formerly considered or high accepted elevation is volcano has a summit crater and many adventive craters on its slopes summit crater is heavily degraded by erosion lava flows extend radially away from summit crater and form bulk of volcano adventive craters are also associated with lava flows these lava flows are accompanied by breccia and reach thicknesses of lahar deposits are found on eastern slopes scarps on flanks resulted from sector collapses of volcano this collapse is known as lomas limpias and its scar has a surface area of collapse scar was later filled with products from explosive eruptions another collapse occurred on flank forming los bueyes collapse and terrace deposits nevado de longavi is a relatively small volcano with a diameter of a basal surface area of and a height above base level of nevado de longavi has a volume of about basement beneath volcano is formed by volcaniclastic cura mallin formation of eocene miocene age miocene plutons and lavic breccia pliocene pleistocene cola de zorro formation this last formation was identified as forming a deeply eroded volcano in cordon de villalobos south of nevado de longavi this volcano south of nevado de longavi is known as villalobos emplacement of this formation was facilitated by a decrease in compressional stress that had affected region prior to pliocene some isolated monogenetic volcanic centres can be found southeast of nevado de longavi aside from villalobos this includes resago and loma blanca first and last are of pleistocene age based on their preservation resago is post glacial last two centres appear to be related to a geological lineament that flanks eastern slopes of nevado de longavi thumb rivers in maule 300px a glacier is found on southern slope between 1989 and 2017 glacier cover has decreased by over 95 with less than of glacier cover remaining previous glaciation is also supported by presence of glacial striations on lava flows and of lahar deposits rio blanco originates on southeastern slope of nevado de longavi within collapse scar it turns south and west around volcano in a fishhook pattern estero martinez and quebrada los bueyes rivers also originate on nevado de longavi on western and southern flank respectively they are both tributaries of rio blanco achibueno river also originates on eastern flank of nevado de longavi in a lake of same name it flows first northeastward and then turns around volcano composition nevado de longavi has chiefly erupted andesite which forms about 80 of volcano smaller amounts of basalt and dacite were also erupted by volcano former in early stages of activity and as basaltic andesite inclusions latter during holocene early stage rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene olivine and plagioclase mainstage rocks in addition contain amphibole and orthopyroxene in holocene rocks apatite iron and titanium oxides and sulfides have been found aside from minerals gabbro and mafic rocks form enclaves granite xenoliths are also found unlike these granites gabbros appear to be cumulates considering their chemical similarity to nevado de longavi rocks chemistry of nevado de longavi s magmas is unusual among volcanoes of south volcanic zone for example potassium content is unusually low likewise incompatible elements are underrepresented modal amphibole is much more prevalent nevado de longavi s magmas have been referred to as adakitic only magmas of such chemistry in southern volcanic zone but this classification has been contested fractional crystallization of amphibole has been invoked to explain some of compositional patterns on basis of their rubidium content nevado de longavi s magmas have been classified in two groups rubidium rich group resembles that of other volcanoes in southern volcanic zone rubidium poor group conversely is unusual one differences appear to reflect both different parental magmas and different magma evolution there is a temporal pattern of magmas becoming more rubidium poor over time unusual chemical patterns appear to reflect that magmas erupted from nevado de longavi were extremely rich in water such a pattern has also been noted at mocho and all these volcanoes are located above points where fracture zones intersect peru chile trench and it has been proposed that these fracture zones channel water into mantle in case of nevado de longavi mocha fracture zone is subducting beneath volcano eruptive history early stage basaltic andesite lava flows crop out on northern and southwestern slopes of nevado de longavi they originated at a site below present day summit and reach thicknesses of individual flows are about thick these volcanic rocks are up to one million years old during main growth stage volcanic activity was approximately constant considering homogeneous structure of lava flows temporary periods of dormancy however occurred causing formation of erosion valleys on northern slope that were then filled by younger lava flows these younger lava flows were themselves subject to glaciation holocene last activity occurred during holocene and included explosive activity it was centered in eastern collapse scar and on summit region in eastern collapse scar possibly subglacial activity formed a thick sequence including clasts lava flows and silt 6 835 65 or 7 500 years before present a large explosive eruption occurred it deposited dacitic pumice more than southeast from volcano maximum thickness of deposits is it is also known as rio blanco fall deposit in eastern collapse scar pumice was later buried by an andesitic lava flow which is undated and carries name castillo andesite last eruption formed a lava dome within collapse scar and summit area this eruption occurred about 5 700 years ago a secondary collapse of lava dome formed a large block and ash flow that descended eastern slopes and covers a surface area of about there is no reported historical volcanic activity but fumarolic activity has been reported and remote sensing has found thermal anomalies on a scale of about volcano together with lomas blancas has been prospected for potential of obtaining geothermal energy estimated capacities are 248 megawatts hazards volcano is ranked 22 on chile s national volcano hazard scale towns closest to volcano are cerro los la balsa la las and rincon valdes renewed eruptions could result in debris flows eruption columns lava flows and pyroclastic flows on volcano and surrounding valleys mendoza province in argentina could also be potentially affected by activity at nevado de longavi first recorded ascent occurred in 1965 by s and w foerster but evidence reported during that ascent implies that humans had reached mountain earlier otherwise nevado de longavi is one of
