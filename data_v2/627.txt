1990 91 south pacific cyclone season was one of least active tropical cyclone season s on record with only two tropical cyclones occurring within south pacific basin to east of 160dege season officially ran from november 1 1990 to april 30 1991 with first disturbance of season forming on november 23 1990 before last disturbance dissipated during may 19 1991 during season there was no deaths recorded from any of tropical cyclones while they were within basin however six people were killed by cyclone joy when it made landfall on australia as a result of impacts caused by joy and sina names were retired from tropical cyclone naming lists during season tropical cyclones were monitored by fiji meteorological service and new zealand metservice while other meteorological services such as australian bureau of meteorology meteo france as well as united states joint typhoon warning center and naval western oceanography center nwoc also monitored basin jtwc issued warnings between 160dege and international date line while nwoc issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between international date line and coasts of americas both jtwc and nwoc designated tropical cyclones with a number and either a p suffix with numbers assigned in order to tropical cyclones developing within whole of southern hemisphere fms metservice and bom all used australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and estimate wind speeds over a ten minute period while jtwc estimated sustained winds over a one minute period which are subsequently compared to saffir simpson hurricane wind scale sshws toc seasonal summary as a result of south pacific convergence zone being both weaker and located further to north than in previous seasons and madden julian oscillations being weaker and less regular defined than in previous tropical cyclone seasons as a result only three tropical cyclones occurred within south pacific basin between 160dege and 120degw which made season one of least active on record first tropical cyclone was first noted as a shallow depression on november 20 before it was named sina on november 24 after it had intensified into a tropical cyclone after peaking as a category three severe tropical cyclone on australian tropical cyclone intensity scale sina affected fiji tonga niue and southern cook islands with total damage estimated at over before it was last noted on december 4 as it was absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50degs during december 15 precursor tropical low to cyclone joy developed near solomon islands over next two days system moved westwards before it moved into australian region during december 17 system was subsequently named joy on december 19 before it made landfall on queensland during december 26 basin then remained quiet until march when three significant tropical depressions including 15 and 16p were observed within coral sea australian region which did not develop into tropical cyclones but were subject to gale warnings 15p was first noted on march 3 while it was located about to east of solomon islands and over next couple of days subsequently moved south westwards and out of south pacific basin during next day 16p was first noted on march 14 while located about to southeast of honiara in solomon islands figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to nearest 5 units miles or kilometers following convention used in fiji meteorological service s operational products for each storm all other units are rounded to nearest digit over next couple of days system moved towards south east before jtwc designated system 16p and initiated advisories on it during march 18 after it had moved into south pacific basin over next couple of days system moved towards south southeast before it turned towards southwest and passed over new caledonia on march 20 before it was last noted during next day moving out of basin final tropical cyclone of season lisa moved into southern pacific on may 11 at its peak intensity of 110 km h 75 mph during next day as storm moved towards subtropical jet lisa rapidly weakened into a tropical depression before passing over anatom island without causing any significant damage after season both names sina and joy were retired from naming lists for region while it was determined that a weak gale force tropical cyclone had affected tonga between december 14 17 systems severe tropical cyclone sina on november 20 fms started to monitor a shallow tropical depression that had developed within south pacific convergence zone to west of wallis island over next three days system moved towards west northwest and fijian dependency of rotuma before jtwc initiated advisories and classified depression as tropical cyclone 03p during november 24 tcwc nadi subsequently named system sina after depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on australian scale while it was located about to northwest of rotuma during next day cyclone continued to intensify and developed an eye as it moved erratically towards west southwest and performed a small clockwise loop during that day sina s eye became very distinct on satellite imagery as it intensified and upper level steering flow which resulted in sina moving erratically towards southeast and fiji later that day tcwc nadi reported that system had peaked as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone with 10 minute sustained wind speeds of jtwc subsequently reported early next day that sina had peaked with 1 minute sustained wind speeds of which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on sshws sina remained at its peak intensity for most of that day before it started to gradually weaken as it passed about to south of viti levu before it passed over island groups of and moala and southern lau islands during november 28 early on november 29 sina weakened into a category two tropical cyclone on australian scale just before it passed to north of tongatapu in tonga during that day system moved eastwards towards southern cook islands and gradually weakened further early next day system passed about to south of niue before it recurved sharply towards south southeast later that day as it approached southern cook islands system subsequently rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone under influence of strong vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures over next couple of days sina s extratropical remnants maintained a southeastward track before it was absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50degs on december 4 cyclone caused no deaths and over in damages as it affected fiji tonga niue and southern cook islands ahead of system affecting fiji hundreds of holiday makers were evacuated from fiji s outer island resorts to hotels on mainland high winds and heavy rain forced closure of several local airports and main nadi international airport as sina moved through archipelago system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees system also washed away a railway bridge on vanua levu that was used to take sugar cane to s mills growers had no choice but to go through village of however workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through village after methodists from local church attacked a group of growers for working on sundays in defiance of fiji s sunday observance decree within tonga only minor damage to weak structures trees banana plantations electric and telephone lines was recorded within both niue and southern cook islands only minor damage to crops and structures was reported tropical cyclone lisa tropical cyclone lisa moved into south pacific from australian region during may 11 while it was a category 2 tropical cyclone with sustained wind speeds of 110 km h 75 mph over next couple of days lisa moved south eastwards and passed in between vanuatuan islands of tanna and anatom as it gradually weakened and lost its tropical cyclone characteristics lisa s remnants subsequently started to deepen during may 14 under influence of an upper level mid latitude trough and reached a secondary peak intensity of 100 km h 65 mph over next few days system continued to move towards southeast while slowly weakening until it was last noted dissipating about to east of wellington new zealand there were no reports of any significant damage associated with lisa in papua new guinea vanuatu or solomon islands other systems on december 15 in response to formation of typhoon russ in north western pacific ocean a tropical low developed about to south east of honiara in solomon islands over next two days moved westwards before it moved into australian basin during december 17 where it was later named joy a weak gale force tropical cyclone affected tonga between december 14 17 during march three significant tropical depressions including 15 and 16p were observed within coral sea australian region which did not become tropical cyclones on australian scale but were subject to gale warnings 15p was first noted on march 3 while it was located about to east of solomon islands and over next couple of days subsequently moved south westwards and out of south pacific basin during next day 16p was first noted on march 14 while located about to southeast of honiara in solomon islands over next couple of days system moved towards south east before jtwc designated system 16p and initiated advisories on it during march 18 after it had moved into south pacific basin over next couple of days system moved towards south southeast before it turned towards southwest and passed over new caledonia on march 20 before it was last noted during next day as it moved back into australian region season effects this table lists all storms that developed in south pacific to east of longitude 160dege during 1990 91 season it includes their
