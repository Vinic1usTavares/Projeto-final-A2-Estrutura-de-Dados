swartzwelder and directed by jeffrey lynch executive producer david mirkin loved that whole situation of bart seeing waiter injure himself and not telling truth ties together with homer plot in that it causes homer to get jury duty and then only caring about going to hotel mirkin thought it worked really well new character freddy was voiced by simpsons cast member dan castellaneta who also provides voice of mayor quimby freddy was given same type of cheekbones and nose as quimby to make them resemble each other when bart is fleeing from skinner a shot of bart running down a hill from season four episode kamp krusty was re used at release of season five on dvd a review described image as possibly best series has ever looked on dvd however boy who knew too much was one of few episodes in which technical issues still remained for example bart and lisa s image was fuzzy toward beginning and episode featured for last time some of hand drawn dimensions that would be eliminated once show switched over to digital compositing and desktop cartoon creation cultural references 200px thumb actor arnold schwarzenegger and his ex wife maria shriver are parodied in episode while riding on prison bus bart looks out window and has a dream that features him huckleberry finn and abraham lincoln on a raft going down a river in springfield mirkin said swartzwelder had always enjoyed putting presidents into his jokes and this was only one of his many references to lincoln scene of skinner chasing bart borrows heavily from film westworld especially scene with skinner walking across river simpsons director david silverman said lynch and his fellow director brad bird took a long hard look at westworld to make sure animation in scenes resembled film as much as possible mirkin said of westworld parody again to show you what a collaboration this is we had animators looking at westworld and making sure of animation and then we made sure that simpsons composer alf clausen got brilliant soundtrack from film he put in a lot of touches that really made soundtracks identical bart s claim to film star and recurring character on simpsons rainier wolfcastle a parody of arnold schwarzenegger that his last movie really sucked and chief wiggum s subsequent claim of magic ticket my ass are in reference to last action hero a schwarzenegger film featuring magic tickets that was panned by critics additionally wolfcastle s wife is named maria schwarzenegger s wife at time was maria shriver simpsons creator matt groening appears in a cameo as court illustrator

1 equivalent to approximately 9 5 million viewing households it was fifth highest rated show on fox network that week following married with children living single melrose place and beverly hills 90210 since airing episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood praised episode for containing a memorable guest character in french waiter monsieur lacosse two great slapstick sequences involving same and displays principal skinner pursuing bart across mountains like a non giving up school guy and confessing that in some ways he s a small man a petty small man in particularly fine form dvd movie guide s colin jacobson thought freddy quimby may well be most unpleasant character to grace series in an amusing way though freddy s edginess makes him less amusing than his uncle it s rather startling to see skinner so rapidly resume his dislike of bart after last episode though it s fun to see his superhuman powers in pursuit of bart and mystery aspects of show help make it a very good one add to that homer on jury duty for even more entertainment patrick bromley of dvd verdict gave episode a grade of a for its excellent bits thrown together to make this one joke for joke one of season s funniest in 2007 patrick enright of msnbc called it his tenth favorite episode of show he said it was a perfect example of show s hilarious randomness because of jokes such as homer singing meow mix cat food jingle and scene in which homer discovers that if jury s deadlocked they will be sequestered in a luxury hotel homer justifies his decision to be lone dissenting voice by saying i m only doing what i think is right i believe freddy quimby should walk out of here a free hotel when he should have said a free man entertainment ie named it among 10 greatest simpsons episodes of all time references external links boy who knew too
