lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol lr formerly lw and atomic number 103 it is named in honor of ernest lawrence inventor of cyclotron a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements a radioactive metal lawrencium is eleventh transuranic element and is also final member of actinide series like all elements with atomic number over 100 lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles thirteen isotopes of lawrencium are currently known most stable is 266lr with a half life of 11 hours but shorter lived 260lr half life 2 7 minutes is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in periodic table and is a trivalent element it thus could also be classified as first of 7th period transition metals however its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in periodic table having an s2p configuration instead of s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium this means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead in 1950s 1960s and 1970s many claims of synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in soviet union and united states priority of discovery and therefore naming of element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and while international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac initially established lawrencium as official name for element and gave american team credit for discovery this was reevaluated in 1997 giving both teams shared credit for discovery but not changing element s name history thumb left albert ghiorso updating periodic table in april 1961 inscribing symbol lw in position for element 103 as latimer sikkeland and larsh left to right look on approvingly in 1958 scientists at lawrence berkeley national laboratory claimed discovery of element 102 now called nobelium at same time they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding same curium target used with nitrogen 14 ions a follow up on this experiment was not performed as target was destroyed eighteen tracks were noted with decay energy around and half life around s berkeley team noted that while cause could be production of an isotope of element 103 other possibilities could not be ruled out while data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257lr alpha decay energy 8 87 mev half life 0 6 s evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of strength required to conclusively demonstrate synthesis of element 103 note for part i see pure appl chem vol 63 no 6 pp 879 886 1991 later in 1960 lawrence berkeley laboratory attempted to synthesize element by bombarding 252cf with 10b and 11b results of this experiment were not conclusive first important work on element 103 was carried out at berkeley by nuclear physics team of albert ghiorso torbjorn sikkeland almon larsh robert m latimer and their co workers on february 14 1961 first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three milligram target consisting of three isotopes of element californium with boron 10 and boron 11 nuclei from heavy ion linear accelerator hilac berkeley team reported that isotope 257103 was detected in this manner and that it decayed by emitting an 8 6 mev alpha particle with a half life of this identification was later corrected to be 258103 as later work proved that 257lr did not have properties detected but 258lr did this was considered at time to be convincing proof of synthesis of element 103 while mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken it did not affect arguments in favor of element 103 having been synthesized scientists at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna then in soviet union raised several criticisms all but one were answered adequately exception was that 252cf was most common isotope in target and in reactions with 10b 258lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five this would lead to a narrow yield curve not broad one reported by berkeley team a possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103 this was an important intermediate step to unquestioned discovery of element 103 although evidence was not completely convincing berkeley team proposed name lawrencium with symbol lw after ernest orlando lawrence inventor of cyclotron iupac commission on nomenclature of inorganic chemistry accepted name but changed symbol to lr this acceptance of discovery was later characterized as being hasty by dubna team 5 first work at dubna on element 103 came in 1965 when they reported to have created 256103 in 1965 by bombarding 243am with 18o identifying it indirectly from its granddaughter fermium 252 half life they reported was somewhat too high possibly due to background events later 1967 work on same reaction identified two decay energies in ranges 8 35 8 50 mev and 8 50 8 60 mev these were assigned to 256103 and 257103 despite repeated attempts they were unable to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half life of eight seconds to 257103 translated in russians proposed name rutherfordium for new element in 1967 this name was later used for element 104 5 further experiments in 1969 at dubna and in 1970 at berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry for new element so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is last actinide in 1970 dubna group reported synthesis of with half life 20 s and alpha decay energy 8 38 mev however it was not until 1971 when nuclear physics team at university of california at berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring nuclear decay properties of lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260 silva pp 1641 2 that all previous results from berkeley and dubna were confirmed apart from berkeley s group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of probably correct 258103 all final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when energies of x rays emitted from 258103 were measured thumb upright 0 9 right element was named after ernest lawrence in 1971 iupac granted discovery of lawrencium to lawrence berkeley laboratory even though they did not have ideal data for element s existence however in 1992 iupac trans fermium working group twg officially recognized nuclear physics teams at dubna and berkeley as co discoverers of lawrencium concluding that while 1961 berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrencium s discovery they were not yet completely convincing and while 1965 1968 and 1970 dubna experiments came very close to needed level of confidence taken together only 1971 berkeley experiments which clarified and confirmed previous observations finally resulted in complete confidence in discovery of element 103 because name lawrencium had been in use for a long time by this point it was retained by iupac and in august 1997 international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ratified name lawrencium and symbol lr during a meeting in geneva characteristics physical lawrencium is final member of actinide series and is sometimes considered to be a group 3 element along with scandium yttrium and lutetium as its filled f shell is expected to make it resemble 7th period transition metals in periodic table it is located to right of actinide nobelium to left of 6d transition metal rutherfordium and under lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close packed crystal structure c a 1 58 similar to its lighter congener lutetium though this is not yet known experimentally enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352 kj mol close to value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with 7s and 6d electrons delocalized a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of values of heat of vaporization bulk modulus and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium silva p 1644 specifically lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent silvery metal easily oxidized by air steam and acids and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171 pm it is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15 6 to 16 6 g cm3 it is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900 k 1627 degc not far from value for lutetium 1925 k chemical thumb right upright 1 4 elution sequence of late trivalent lanthanides and actinides with ammonium a hib as eluant broken curve for lawrencium is a prediction in 1949 glenn t seaborg who devised actinide concept that elements 89 to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71 predicted that element 103 lawrencium should be its final member and that lr3 ion should be about as stable as lu3 in aqueous solution it was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed silva pp 1644 7 1969 studies on element showed that lawrencium reacted with chlorine to form a product that was most likely trichloride lrcl3 its volatility was found to be similar to that of chlorides of curium fermium and nobelium and much less than that of rutherfordium chloride in 1970 chemical studies were performed on 1500 atoms of isotope 256lr comparing it with divalent no ba ra trivalent fm cf cm am ac and tetravalent th pu elements it was found that lawrencium with trivalent ions but short half life of 256lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of md3 in elution sequence lawrencium occurs as trivalent lr3 ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of other trivalent actinides for example lawrencium iii fluoride and hydroxide lr oh 3 should both be insoluble in water due to actinide contraction ionic radius of lr3 should be smaller than that of md3 and it should elute ahead of md3 when ammonium a ammonium a hib is used as an eluant later 1987 experiments on longer lived isotope 260lr confirmed lawrencium s and that it eluted in roughly same place as erbium and found that lawrencium s ionic radius was larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of it was also pointed out that actinide contraction at end of actinide series was larger than analogous lanthanide contraction with exception of last actinide lawrencium cause was speculated to be relativistic effects it has been speculated that 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized so that in reducing conditions only 7p1 2 electron would be ionized leading to monovalent lr ion however all experiments to reduce lr3 to lr2 or lr in aqueous solution were unsuccessful similarly to lutetium on basis of this standard electrode potential of edeg lr3 lr couple was calculated to be less than 1 56 v indicating that existence of lr ions in aqueous solution was unlikely upper limit for edeg lr3 lr2 couple was predicted to be 0 44 v values for edeg lr3 lr and edeg lr3 are predicted to be 2 06 v and 7 9 v stability of group oxidation state in 6d transition series decreases as rfiv and lawrencium continues trend with being more stable than rfiv in molecule lawrencium dihydride lrh2 which is predicted to be bent 6d orbital of lawrencium is not expected to play a role in bonding unlike that of lanthanum dihydride lah2 lah2 has la h bond distances of 2 158 a while lrh2 should have shorter lr h bond distances of 2 042 a due to relativistic contraction and stabilization of 7s and 7p orbitals involved in bonding in contrast to core like 5f subshell and mostly uninvolved 6d subshell in general molecular lrh2 and lrh are expected to resemble corresponding thallium species thallium having a valence configuration in gas phase like lawrencium s more than corresponding lanthanide species electron configurations of lr and lr2 are expected to be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively unlike lanthanides which tend to be as however in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally lr3 cation lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and heavier congener of lutetium especially because first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium hence unlike thallium but like lutetium lawrencium would prefer to form than lrh and is expected to be similar to also unknown both metals having a valence configuration of in their respective pp dp bond is expected to be observed in lrcl3 just as it is for lucl3 and more generally all and complex anion lr 3 is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners with a configuration of for lawrencium this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital atomic a lawrencium atom has 103 electrons of which three can act as valence electrons in 1970 it was predicted that ground state electron configuration of lawrencium was rn 5f146d17s2 ground state term symbol 2 following aufbau principle and conforming to xe 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium s lighter homolog lutetium silva pp 1643 4 however next year calculations were published that questioned this prediction instead expecting an anomalous rn configuration though early calculations gave conflicting results more recent studies and calculations confirm s2p suggestion 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that energy difference between two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was ground state later 1995 calculations concluded that s2p configuration should be energetically favored because spherical s and p1 2 orbitals are nearest to atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly in 1988 a team of scientists led by eichler calculated that lawrencium s enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium s electron configuration s2p configuration was expected to be more volatile than s2d configuration and be more similar to that of p block element lead no evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and lower limit for enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than estimated value for s2p configuration in 2015 first ionization energy of lawrencium was measured using isotope 256lr measured value agreed very well with relativistic theoretical prediction of 4 963 15 ev and also provided a first step into measuring first ionization energies of transactinides this value is lowest among all lanthanides and actinides and supports s2p configuration as 7p1 2 electron is expected to be only weakly bound this suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to d block elements and hence being true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium instead of lanthanum and actinium and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways given that s2p configuration is correct then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under iupac definition an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub shell or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub shell unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and group 3 elements with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified it is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium which has an rn configuration and show expected rn 5f146d17s2 configuration which is supported by earlier volatility experiments isotopes thirteen isotopes of lawrencium are known with mass numbers 251 262 and 266 all are radioactive silva p 1642 additionally one nuclear isomer is known with mass number 253 longest lived lawrencium isotope 266lr has a half life of ten hours and is one of longest lived superheavy isotopes known to date suggesting that it is perhaps on shore of island of stability of superheavy nuclei however shorter lived isotopes are usually used in chemical experiments because 266lr currently can only be produced as a final decay product of even heavier and harder to synthesize elements it was discovered in 2014 in decay chain of 294ts isotope 256lr half life 27 seconds was used in first chemical studies on lawrencium currently slightly longer lived isotope 260lr half life 2 7 minutes is usually used for this purpose after 266lr longest lived lawrencium isotopes are 262lr 3 6 h 44 min 260lr 2 7 min 256lr 27 s and 255lr 22 s all other known lawrencium isotopes have half lives under 20 seconds and shortest lived of them 251lr has a half life of 27 milliseconds undiscovered isotopes with mass numbers 263 to 265 are expected to have longer half lives 5 h and 10 h half lives of lawrencium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 251lr to 266lr with a dip from 257lr to preparation and purification while lightest to and heaviest 266lr lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium z 105 isotopes middle isotopes 255lr to 262lr can all be produced by bombarding actinide americium to einsteinium targets with light ions from boron to neon two most important isotopes 256lr and 260lr are both in this range 256lr can be produced by bombarding californium 249 with 70 mev boron 11 ions producing lawrencium 256 and four neutrons while 260lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium 249 with oxygen 18 producing lawrencium 260 an alpha particle and three neutrons silva pp 1642 3 both 256lr and 260lr have half lives too short to allow a complete chemical purification process early experiments with 256lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction with chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone tta dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone as organic phase and with aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions ions of different charge 2 3 or 4 will then extract into organic phase under different ph ranges but this method will not separate trivalent actinides and thus 256lr must be identified by its emitted 8 24 mev alpha particles more recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with a hib to take place in enough time to separate out longer lived isotope 260lr which can be removed from catcher foil with 0 05 m hydrochloric acid see also references bibliography external links los alamos national
