450px thumb official tropical cyclone basins traditionally areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins these include north atlantic ocean eastern and western parts of northern pacific ocean southwestern pacific southwestern and southeastern indian oceans and northern indian ocean arabian sea and bay of bengal western pacific is most active and north indian least active an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide with 47 reaching hurricane typhoon strength and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones super typhoons or major hurricanes at least of category 3 intensity toc overview tropical cyclone basins and official warning centre basin warning center area of responsibility hemisphere north pacific united states national

and gulf of mexico tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year ranging from one to over twenty five per year most atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between june 1 and november 30 united states national hurricane center nhc monitors basin and issues reports watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for atlantic basin as one of regional specialized meteorological centres for tropical cyclones as defined by world meteorological organization on average 11 named storms of tropical storm or higher strength occur each season with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes climatological peak of activity is around september 10 each season united states atlantic coast and gulf coast mexico central america caribbean islands and bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin venezuela 4 provinces of atlantic canada and atlantic macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected many of more intense atlantic storms are cape verde type hurricanes which form off west coast of africa near cape verde islands occasionally a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western europe including hurricane gordon which spread high winds across spain and british isles in september 2006 hurricane vince which made landfall on southwestern coast of spain as a tropical depression in october 2005 is only known system to impact mainland europe as a tropical cyclone in nhc study period commencing in 1851 it is believed a hurricane made landfall in spain in 1842 northeastern pacific

central pacific hurricane center s watch from northeastern pacific basin under national hurricane center s area of responsibility northeastern pacific is second most active basin and has highest number of storms per unit area hurricane season runs between may 15 and november 30 each year and encompasses vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in region in 1971 2005 period there were an average of 15 16 tropical storms 9 hurricanes and 4 5 major hurricanes storms of category 3 intensity or greater annually in basin storms that form here often affect western mexico and less commonly continental united states in particular california or northern central america no hurricane included in modern database has made landfall in california however historical records from 1858 speak of a storm that brought san diego winds over marginal hurricane force though it is not known if storm actually made landfall tropical storms in 1939 1976 and 1997 brought gale force winds to california central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility aor begins at boundary with national hurricane center aor at 140 and ends at international date line where northwestern pacific begins hurricane season in north central pacific runs annually from june 1 to november 30 central pacific hurricane center monitors storms that develop or move into defined area of responsibility cphc previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in basin was originally known as joint hurricane warning center today it is called joint typhoon warning center central pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually as there are no large contiguous landmasses in basin direct hits and landfalls are rare however they occur occasionally as with hurricane iniki in 1992 which made landfall on hawaii and hurricane ioke in 2006 which made a direct hit on johnston atoll northwestern pacific ocean thumb 200px tracks of all tropical cyclones in northwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 vertical line to right is international date line northwest pacific ocean is most active basin on planet accounting for one third of all tropical cyclone activity annually an average of 25 7 tropical cyclones in basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater also an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during 1968 1989 period basin occupies all territory north of equator and west of international date line including south china sea basin sees activity year round however tropical activity is at its minimum in february and march tropical storms in this region often affect china hong kong macau japan korea philippines taiwan and vietnam plus numerous oceanian islands such as guam northern marianas and palau sometimes tropical storms in this region affect laos thailand cambodia and even singapore malaysia and indonesia coast of china sees most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide philippines receives an average of 6 7 tropical cyclone landfalls per year with super typhoon haiyan being strongest and most powerful to date since its landfall in november 8 2013 north indian ocean thumb left 200px tracks of all tropical cyclones in northern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 this basin is divided into two areas bay of bengal and arabian sea with bay of bengal dominating 5 to 6 times more activity still this basin is least active worldwide with only 4 to 6 storms per year this basin s season has a double peak one in april and may before onset of monsoon and another in october and november just after this double peak occurs because powerful vertical wind shear in between surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones simon tropical climatology an introduction to climates of low latitudes p 82 high shear explains why no cyclones can form in red sea which possesses necessary depth vorticity and surface temperatures year round rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect arabian peninsula or somalia however cyclone gonu caused heavy damage in oman on peninsula in 2007 although north indian ocean is a relatively inactive basin extremely high population densities in ganges and ayeyarwady deltas mean that deadliest tropical cyclones in world have formed here including 1970 bhola cyclone which killed 500 000 people nations affected include india bangladesh sri lanka thailand myanmar and pakistan mediterranean sea right thumb image of january 1995 system on rare occasions tropical like systems that can reach intensity of hurricanes occur over mediterranean sea such a phenomenon is called a mediterranean hurricane although geographical dimensions of tropical oceans and mediterranean sea are clearly different precursor mechanisms of these perturbations based on air sea thermodynamic imbalance are similar cataloguing criteria and exploration of meteorological environments www tethys cat their origins are typically non tropical and develop over open waters under strong initially cold core cyclones similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in atlantic basin like karl 1980 vince 2005 grace 2009 chris 2012 or ophelia 2017 sea surface temperatures in late august and early september are quite high over basin 24 28 degc or 75 82 degf though research indicates water temperatures of 20 degc 68 degf are normally required for development microsoft word plinius ii doc meteorological literature document that such systems occurred in september 1947 september 1969 january 1982 september 1983 january 1995 october 1996 september 2006 november 2011 november 2014 and november 2017 1995 system developed a well defined eye and a ship recorded 85 mph 140 km h winds along with an atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar although it had structure of a tropical cyclone it occurred over water temperatures suggesting it could have been a polar low dr jack beven s images of mediterranean hurricane 1995 www com southern hemisphere within southern hemisphere tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between african coast and middle of south pacific tropical and subtropical cyclones have also been noted occurring in southern atlantic ocean at times for various reasons including where tropical cyclones form there are several different ways to split area between american and african coasts for instance world meteorological organization define three different basins for tracking and warning of tropical cyclones these are south west indian ocean between african coast and 90dege australian region between 90dege and 160dege and south pacific between 160dege and 120degw united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors whole region but splits it at into south pacific and southern indian ocean south west indian ocean thumb 200px tracks of all tropical cyclones in southwestern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 south west indian ocean is located within southern hemisphere between africa s east coast and 90dege and is primarily monitored by meteo france s la reunion rsmc while mauritian australian indonesian and malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it until start of 1985 86 tropical cyclone season basin only extended to 80dege with 10 degrees between 80 and 90e considered to be a part of australian region on average about 9 cyclones per year develop into tropical storms while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of various indian ocean island nations and or various countries along africa s east coast australian region thumb 200px left tracks of all tropical cyclones in southeastern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 through middle of 1985 this basin extended westward to since then its western boundary has been 90e tropical activity in this region affects australia and indonesia according to australian bureau of meteorology most frequently hit portion of australia is between exmouth and broome in western australia basin sees an average of about seven cyclones each year although more can form or come in from other basins such as south pacific tropical cyclone cyclone vance in 1999 produced highest recorded speed winds in an australian town or city at around south pacific ocean thumb 200px tracks of all tropical cyclones in southwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 south pacific ocean basin runs between 160dege and 120degw with tropical cyclones developing in it officially monitored by fiji meteorological service and new zealand s metservice tropical cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to west of dateline though during years of warm phase of el nino southern oscillation cyclones have been known to develop to east of dateline near french polynesia on average basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones south atlantic ocean thumb hurricane catarina is currently only known tropical cyclone in south atlantic ocean to have actually reached hurricane intensity cyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in south atlantic and only full blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004 s hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil and 2010 s tropical storm anita which formed off coast of rio grande do sul south atlantic ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by world meteorological organization and does not have a designated regional specialized meteorological center rsmc however beginning in 2011 brazilian navy hydrographic center started to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin when they have sustained wind speeds of at least see also regional specialized
