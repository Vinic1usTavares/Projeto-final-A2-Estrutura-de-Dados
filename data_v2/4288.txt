from occupation duties in japan a few months earlier was converted to a tank unit formation occurred following renaming of a reserve unit of citizens military forces cmf of same name which subsequently became 1st royal new south wales lancers and its battle honours and history perpetuated by this unit in order to reallocate name to tank regiment that was to be established in new australian regular army at first only one squadron strong planning commenced to expand to full strength as soon as possible under command of major cecil ives formal affiliation with royal tank regiment rtr was recognised two years later and regiment adopted their regimental colours of brown red and green which date back to battle of cambrai during first world war in 1917 these same colours had also been used by australian tank corps prior to second world war initially new regiment was equipped with churchill tanks although this was only a temporary measure until centurion tanks could be acquired however due to perceived unsuitability of churchill and late arrival of new platform regiment was not deployed as part of australia s commitment to korean war although a number of officers served on exchange with british and us formations and unit provided machine gunners and to australian infantry battalions as reinforcements first centurions finally began arriving in june 1952 with regiment receiving 39 tanks with numbers of regular personnel steadily growing it was possible to raise regimental headquarters headquarters squadron and b squadron and regiment was fully raised by 8 september 1952 under command of lieutenant colonel stuart graham meanwhile in september 1952 another tank squadron was raised this was known as nucleus squadron and based in holsworthy new south wales with purpose of forming basis of a second tank unit which was to be named 2nd armoured regiment in 1954 regiment received it first ferret mk 1 scout car enabling raising of reconnaissance troop following year 1st armoured regiment received saracen armoured personnel carrier and it was at this time that intention to form another tank unit was abandoned and nucleus squadron subsequently returned to regiment as its third squadron designated c squadron on 6 february 1956 then governor general field marshal sir william slim presented regiment with its guidon at a regimental parade held in puckapunyal also in 1956 regiment was equipped with centurion armoured recovery vehicle allowing retirement of churchill recovery vehicle following expansion of royal australian armoured corps raac in 1960 a squadron was disbanded reducing regiment to two squadrons and majority of its personnel formed regular squadrons in 4th 19th prince of wales light horse and 2nd 14th light horse queensland mounted infantry which were predominantly cmf formations these squadrons subsequently became part of 1st cavalry regiment which was later redesignated 2nd cavalry regiment and in turn provided nucleus for newly raised 3rd cavalry regiment vietnam war 220px thumb right soldiers of 1st armoured regiment are briefed while sitting in front of their centurion tanks at vung tau in south vietnam during 1968 during 1964 65 regiment provided most of men for 1 troop a squadron 4th 19th prince of wales light horse which was subsequently equipped with new m113a1 armoured personnel carrier and was deployed on active service to south vietnam in may 1965 in october 1967 australian government announced it would increase size of 1st australian task force 1 atf at nui dat in phuoc tuy province from two to three infantry battalions while additional supporting arms including a tank squadron would also be added to force as such in february 1968 c squadron was sent to vietnam with a total strength of 20 centurion tanks which would work closely with m113s of 3rd cavalry regiment however two of four tank troops were initially held back until centurions had proved themselves capable of operating in conditions tank squadron reached full strength on 5 september 1968 meanwhile in may regiment had again reached full strength with a squadron re raised in order to meet ongoing operational commitment over next four years all three of regiment s operational squadrons eventually served in vietnam providing invaluable close support to infantry particularly during clearance of viet cong bunker systems although their value in vietnam was originally questioned by some they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties centurions were able to move through countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti tank weapons and mines their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on battlefield in late may 1968 tanks played a significant role in battle of coral balmoral occupying blocking positions in an attempt to thwart an impending communist offensive aimed at influencing peace talks 1atf deployed two battalions away from its base in phuoc tuy subsequently developing fire support base coral north east of saigon just east of lai khe on 12 may following several regimental sized assaults on coral which were successfully repelled by australians with heavy casualties on both sides 1atf moved to establish fire support base balmoral on 24 25 may north of coral infantry were this time supported by centurion tanks which had been called forward by road from nui dat and had arrived just hours before balmoral was subjected to a two battalion attack following a very accurate rocket and mortar barrage at 03 45 hours on 26 may base was assaulted by north vietnamese infantry attack was repelled with heavy casualties by combined firepower of tanks and infantry next day australians at coral assaulted a number of bunkers located just outside base with a troop of centurions supported by infantry destroying bunkers and their occupants without loss a second attack again of regimental strength was made against balmoral at 02 30 hours on 28 may but was called off after only 30 minutes north vietnamese were soundly defeated again by supporting fires of tanks artillery and mortars leaving 55 dead and resulted in six prisoners australian losses were one killed and six wounded this performance demonstrated advantage of using armour in vietnam and whereas before battle some infantry had doubted usefulness or necessity of centurions after battle infantry did not like working without them for its involvement in fighting at coral balmoral c squadron was awarded a unit citation for gallantry in 2018 in february 1969 c squadron was relieved by b squadron on 6 7 june b squadron was involved in a fierce action during battle of binh ba a village north of nui dat attack began on morning of 6 june when australian tanks and apcs advanced with infantry from d company 5th battalion royal australian regiment 5 rar towards village which was being occupied by viet cong and north vietnamese as battle continued b company 5 rar took up a blocking position to prevent them from escaping during fierce urban fighting infantry were forced to clear each house while communist troops occupying houses fired on them from windows and doorways before retreating into tunnels as australians passed each time infantry were fired on tanks would blast a hole in wall of building through which small teams could then enter and clear structure of any opposition fighting continued throughout afternoon and resumed next day before australians successfully cleared village bulk of which was destroyed one australian was killed and 10 wounded while communist losses included at least 107 killed six wounded and eight captured in december 1969 b squadron was re designated a squadron while in december 1970 a squadron was in turn re designated c squadron by late 1970 australia was beginning to reduce its commitment to war and size of 1atf was again reduced from three infantry battalions to two tanks however continued operations and were involved in heavy fighting at long khanh on 6 7 june 1971 as well as numerous smaller actions last elements of regiment were subsequently withdrawn from vietnam in september 1971 a total of 58 centurions had served in vietnam 42 had suffered battle damage of which six were beyond repair while two crewmen had been killed in action post vietnam to present 220px thumb left a leopard as1 mbt of 1st armoured regiment during an exercise in queensland in 2005 following years were traumatic for regiment and for
