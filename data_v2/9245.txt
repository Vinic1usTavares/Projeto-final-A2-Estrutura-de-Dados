raised some issues nick roberts described them as smooth and slick but stated that they were a mite sketchy roberts also stated colour is used very well paul sumner stated there are some animated and coloured graphics robin candy said they are game s greatest asset reviewers held differing opinions on game s setting and themes sumner stated game is dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay roberts described game as sick adding i only recommend soft cuddly to those of you who cut your toenails with a carving knife douglas was critical of game s themes he described playing soft cuddly as watching very large and unpleasant graphics up and down like a box of offal tony lee of your sinclair was more positive stating this is a very sick game indeed but fortunately i have a very sick sense of humour overall game received a more positive reception from lee and microhobby magazine s reviewer as opposed to reviewers from crash and sinclair user microhobby s reviewer called soft cuddly a typical arcade adventure with a performance worthy of a horror movie douglas stated actual playing of game is unfortunately a rather tiresome business he criticized game for consisting of character movement coupled with occasional item gathering douglas described game s enemies as being bog standard cannon fodder aliens saying they drift around being annoying and sapping your energy candy stated that it s very easy to get into but boring he added that exploration is best part of game but becomes repetitive sumner stated all there is to soft cuddly is graphics gameplay is repetitive lee said that game is fun i love this one see also list of horror video games references external links category 1987 video games category action adventure games category europe
