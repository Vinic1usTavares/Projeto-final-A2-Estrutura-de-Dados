damaged road walla walla city government suggested several unmade changes to ssh 3e in 1950s and 1960s including rerouting of its approach to city to use north 9th avenue and a western bypass to directly link to milton freewater highway in college place during 1964 state highway renumbering ssh 3e was split between two new state routes sr 124 which would be combined ssh 3d to form a continuous route from burbank to waitsburg and sr 125 which would use psh 3 branch to oregon state line and remainder of ssh 3e during routing debate for interstate 82 in late 1960s sr 125 and or 11 corridor was considered as a potential option but was rejected in favor of umatilla bridge compromise state governments of oregon and washington began considering expansion and modernization of two lane highway carrying sr 125 and or 11 in mid 1960s following over 400 collisions and 15 deaths in less than a decade four lane limited access highway with a wide median and signalized intersections would also include a western bypass of downtown walla walla for sr 125 and a direct connection to a proposed east west freeway carrying us 12 successor to both us 410 and psh 3 three principal routes were presented for public consideration in 1967 each with varying levels of opposition due to potential costs impacts to homes and businesses and taking of protected lands near fort walla walla park rejection of several new options presented by state highway department contributed to project being delayed into mid 1970s along with inflation and ongoing oil crisis us 12 freeway was completed in october 1973 without a direct connection to sr 125 which would use 13th avenue underpass state legislature delayed funding for sr 125 project while new state department of transportation re evaluated fort walla walla park plan an abridged version of project consisting solely of four lane highway expansion without western bypass was approved for construction in 1985 and its 4 2 million cost was fully funded using a new state gas tax construction began in august 1987 to build divided highway which would smooth out curves include a frontage road and use a concrete median barrier instead of a center turn lane like expanded or 11 four lane section of sr 125 was completed and opened to traffic in august 1988 widening project did not relieve highway of major collisions however due to merging of traffic from side streets into fast moving mainline lanes with a posted speed limit of state government approved 2 3 million to equip five intersections with traffic signals in 1999 due to increased traffic and development along sr 125 western bypass was ultimately built by college place city government in november 2008 as an extension of myra road which was connected to us 12 with a new interchange that opened in 2010 intersection of sr 125 and plaza way is busiest in walla walla area and is slated to be replaced by a roundabout in 2021 to improve traffic flow and safety spur
