drummer keyboard player vocalist yoshimi p we is featured on most boredoms recordings history formation and early years boredoms were formed in early 1986 by yamantaka eye who at time acted as front man for infamous and highly controversial noise performance art act hanatarash locally notorious for its extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on stage destruction and complete disregard for audience s safety antics of hanatarash would later be highly influential on earliest incarnation of boredoms which was formed by remaining members of a band eye started with hanatarash drummer ikuo taketani as well as guitarist tabata mitsuru known as tabata mara bassist hosoi hisato and vocalist makki sasarato called acid makki combi and zombie band s sound was characterized by violent noisy punk rock no wave they recorded a single track u s a for a compilation tape shortly after release of their first song taketani was replaced on drums by yoshikawa toyohito a friend of eye s band officially changed their name to boredoms after hira replaced hosoi on bass and sasarato left band due to creative differences band s name comes from buzzcocks song boredom with band finally

doom band corrupted and then by kazuya nishimura known by his stage name atari band s sound from this period was marked by harsh dissonant punk edited extensively by eye in studio citing sonic youth and funkadelic as influences among others this style was seen by some as pointlessly abrasive without any underlying motive making boredoms absolute music according to some critics however strangeness of record increased band s popularity in musical underground growing popularity in 1988 and 1989 eye found himself making friends with sonic youth and also worked extensively with john zorn s polystylistic naked city project serving as guest vocalist after release of boredoms album soul discharge in united states band was able to parlay their growing popularity into long term record deals

ep and full length super ae band started to break sharply from their earlier atonal noise rock japanoise sound by introducing many elements of sweeping electronica effects and thoroughly constructed psychedelic rock jams into their music perceived analogies with music of can became common during this period described as tumultuous space sludge super ae has most often been compared to defining elements of 1970s krautrock soon after its initial release in japan super ae was met with a considerable amount of acclaim from international music press recognized as a modern day avant garde artifact and progressive masterpiece notably super ae was considered one of best albums of 1990s by pitchfork media in 1999 band released vision creation newsun in japan this album saw an evolution in their sound combining evolving space rock themes explored in their super roots eps and preceding album super ae with a much more earthly primal primitively worshipful inspiration it features psychedelic and cosmic synths complex tribal drumming cathartic celebrations of noise and eye s unique power electronic and stylings album is often considered band s greatest achievement thus far and has been described by critics as blending manic high speed cut up form punk rock of their earlier albums with a new sound that is just as intense and exhilarating but more beautiful and more expansive
