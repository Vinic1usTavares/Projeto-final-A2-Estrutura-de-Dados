thumb upright 1 3420 electric fire engine left next to a typical 19th century steam pumper fire engine of equal capacity c 1895 electric fire engine was proposed to replace steam pumper fire engines used for fighting and extinguishing fires in 19th century fire engine s water pump used to distribute water to put out a fire would be operated by an electric motor instead of steam electric motor was claimed to be simpler cleaner and faster in operation and would save money and require less maintenance than steam fire engine there are a few modern battery operated models although environs in which they are used are limited background of design considerations when conceived in nineteenth century electric fire engine was proposed to replace steam fire engine in use at time it was to be constructed in such a way that it would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points this would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light trolleys and other power users of time it was thought that wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district these outlets would supply necessary current to fire engine s electric motor vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor powered water pump permanently mounted atop there would be cables from motor that would connect to outlet post to obtain required supply of electrical current advantages thumb upright 1 0 nineteenth century steam fire engine in mackinaw island museum electric fire engine would have several advantages over steam fire engine one was that an electric fire engine could be brought to full power immediately whereas a steam fire engine took time it was necessary to keep fire going all time to boil water on a steam pump vehicle with workmen furnishing coal for it this was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting water to boil to produce steam to run water pump to extinguish fire in case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump its operation was basically instantaneous since motor was running at full power capacity when switch was turned on advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall i e no coal or extensive maintenance and simplicity of operation other advantages of using an electric fire engine were that it would not produce loud noises smoke dust cinders and ashes as steam fire engines did also cost of an electric fire engine would be about one third that of a steam boiler fire engine a typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of same capacity disadvantages there were experimental test operations set up to see if idea was feasible however technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in nineteenth century to operate such a system another disadvantage was possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures which often happened during storms nineteenth century idea to replace existing steam fire engines with electric ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward portable electric fire engine would be efficient and practical only if a supply of electricity was available in a city for this purpose an argument against high cost of such an electrical installation was that cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways same current supply could be used for electric fire engine system schuyler wheeler invention thumb upright 1 0 wheeler 1885 fire engine invention american inventor schuyler wheeler patented an electric fire engine system in united states in 1885 he filed his invention in 1882 and patent was issued in 1885 system included electrical infrastructure with electric motor driven water pumps on a horse drawn vehicle fire engine vehicle was designed with same general equipment as a regular steam fire engine of time but used electrically operated equipment instead of steam power it was designed with an electrical regulator and a switch for main electric motor that drove water pump that pushed water through fire hoses used to put out fire electric motor was equipped with several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to fire box would be located next to water plugs throughout city districts in manner previously mentioned when engine was tested it gave very good results and is now in use at factory of crocker wheeler electric company in ampere new jersey company claimed that an electric fire engine of same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient joseph sachs invention joseph sachs had also invented an electric fire engine vehicle consisting of a wagon on which a spring supported platform held an electric motor which operated two rotary water pumps motor was supplied with a reel of electric cable and it could be regulated from either side of vehicle american experiments thumb upright 0 75 there were various experimental illustrations showing what an electrical fire engine could do better than a steam fire engine if complete system was put into operation one set up demonstration was at crystal palace electrical exhibition of 1892 electric fire engine company of seneca falls new york was formed on june 25 1890 to manufacture fire engine apparatus and associated equipment electric fire engine company of america was formed december 1899 in des moines iowa it was to manufacture self propelled automobile electric fire engines and general equipment for fire departments springfield massachusetts city fire department purchased an electric fire truck with an automatic extending ladder that was operated by electricity in 1910 aerial ladder was long and electrically raised instead of being hand cranked by firemen to use it other city fire departments in state were watching its tests as they considered whether or not to purchase it for their firemen cincinnati fire department implemented use of battery powered electrical fire engines which were claimed to be much more effective than horse drawn engines european experiments thumb upright 1 0 left siemens electric fire engine circa 1891 experimental electric fire engines were made for testing in france germany and england starting in latter part of nineteenth century siemens brothers company of london built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891 it was shown at royal naval exhibition in england in 1892 paris fire department experimented with a self propelled electric fire engine in 1899 french electric fire engine known to them as automobile pump was first exhibited at 1900 world s fair in paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation it was demonstrated that this electric fire engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine fire engine was self propelled by on board batteries and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at site of fire hoses were then connected to city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire in 1901 paris fire department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook and ladder wagon it had an electric motor driven water pump to which hoses were attached for firemen to use modern battery operated models in twentieth century some manufacturers have designed storage battery operated self propelled models which they claim are a better cleaner and greener alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel fire trucks these are said to be better suited for particular types of environments e g hotels and resorts manufacturing facilities harnessing battery power is an old idea going back to nineteen hundreds it joins an increasingly longer list of production battery operated vehicles in 2002 french car manufacturer peugeot designed an electric fire engine with a futuristic appearance it is a fuel cell battery vehicle that is designed halfway between a twenty first century automobile and an ordinary gasoline fire engine front part carries two firemen and rear is a large water tank with a ladder on top state of art vehicle makes its own hydrogen and oxygen needed to supply fuel cell battery that operates vehicle water pump smoke extractors and electronic equipment in 2017 introduced a concept electric fire truck it would be powered by four electric motors one at each wheel of all wheel drive fire engine it would also have a diesel powered auxiliary engine that can recharge batteries in 15 minutes see also alexander bonner latta charles a cheever references sources external links category
