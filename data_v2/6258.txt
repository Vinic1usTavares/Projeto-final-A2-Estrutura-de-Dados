proxima centauri b also called proxima b or alpha centauri cb is an exoplanet orbiting in habitable zone of red dwarf star proxima centauri which is closest star to sun and part of a triple star system it is located about 4 2 light years 1 3 parsecs 40 trillion km or 25 trillion miles from earth in constellation of centaurus making it closest known exoplanet to solar system proxima centauri b orbits star at a distance of roughly with an orbital period of approximately 11 2 earth days and has an estimated mass of at least 1 3 times that of earth its habitability has not been established though it is unlikely to be habitable since planet is subject to stellar wind pressures of more than 2 000 times those experienced by earth from solar wind discovery of planet was announced in august 2016 by european southern observatory planet was found using radial velocity method where periodic doppler shifts of spectral lines of host star suggest an orbiting object from these readings radial velocity of parent star relative to earth is varying with an amplitude of about 1 4 metres 4 5 feet per second according to guillem anglada escude its proximity to earth offers an opportunity for robotic exploration of planet with starshot project or at least in coming centuries without inclination of its orbit known exact mass of proxima centauri b is unknown if its orbit is nearly edge on it would have a mass of earth masses statistically there is a roughly 90 chance that planet s mass is less than earth masses in may 2019 a paper presenting recent spitzer space telescope data concluded that proxima centauri b does not transit its sun relative to earth and attributed previous transit detections to correlated noise physical characteristics mass radius and temperature apparent inclination of proxima centauri b s orbit has not yet been measured minimum mass of proxima b is which would be actual mass if its orbit were seen edge on from earth once its orbital inclination is known mass will be calculable more tilted orientations imply a higher mass with 90 of possible orientations implying a mass below planet s exact radius is unknown if it has a rocky composition and a density equal to that of earth then its radius is at least it could be larger if it has a lower density than earth or a mass higher than minimum mass like many super earth sized planets proxima centauri b might have an icy composition like neptune with a thick layer of hydrogen on its surface likelihood that this is case has been calculated to be greater than 10 planet has an equilibrium temperature of host star planet orbits an m type red dwarf named proxima centauri star has a mass of and a radius of it has a surface temperature of k and is 4 85 billion years old in comparison sun is 4 6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 k proxima centauri rotates once roughly every 83 days and has a luminosity about like two larger stars in triple star system proxima centauri is rich in metals compared with sun something not normally found in low mass stars like proxima its metallicity fe h is 0 21 or 1 62 times amount found in sun s atmosphere taken from 100 21 which gives 1 62 times metallicity of sun even though proxima centauri is closest star to sun it is not visible to unaided eye from earth because of its low luminosity average apparent magnitude of 11 13 proxima centauri is a flare star this means that it undergoes occasional dramatic increases in brightness and high energy emissions because of magnetic activity that would create large solar storms on 18 march 2016 a was observed with an energy of 10 33 5 erg march 2016 flare reached about 68 times usual level thus a little brighter than sun surface irradiation was estimated to be 100 times what is required to kill even uv hardy microorganisms based on rate of observed flares total ozone depletion of an earth like atmosphere would occur within several hundred thousand years orbit proxima centauri b orbits its host star every 11 186 days at a semi major axis distance of approximately which means distance from exoplanet to its host star is one twentieth of distance from earth to sun comparatively mercury closest planet to sun has a semi major axis distance of 0 39 au proxima centauri b receives about 65 of amount of radiative flux from its host star that earth receives from sun for comparison mars receives about 43 most of radiative flux from proxima centauri is in infrared spectrum in visible spectrum exoplanet receives only 3 of par 400 700 nm of earth irradiance for comparison jupiter receives 3 7 and saturn 1 1 so it would usually not get much brighter than twilight anywhere on proxima centauri b s surface maximum illumination of horizontal ground by twilight at sunrise is about 400 lux while illumination of proxima b is about 2700 lux with quiet proxima proxima also has flares brightest flare observed until 2016 had increased visual brightness of proxima about 8 times which would be a large change from previous level but at about 17 illumination of earth not very strong sunlight from knowing absolute visual magnitude of proxima centauri and absolute visual magnitude of sun visual luminosity of proxima centauri can be calculated 4 5 proxima centauri b orbits at 0 au and so therefore through use of inverse square law visual luminosity intensity at planet s distance can be calculated however because of its tight orbit proxima centauri b receives about 400 times more x ray radiation than earth does habitability thumb left upright 1 25 artist s conception of surface of proxima centauri b alpha centauri binary system can be seen in background to upper right of proxima habitability of proxima centauri b has not been established but planet is subject to stellar wind pressures of more than 2 000 times those experienced by earth from solar wind this radiation and stellar winds would likely blow any atmosphere away leaving undersurface as only potentially habitable location on that planet exoplanet is orbiting within habitable zone of proxima centauri region where with correct planetary conditions and atmospheric properties liquid water may exist on surface of planet host star with about an eighth of mass of sun has a habitable zone between 0 0 0816 au in october 2016 researchers at france s cnrs research institute stated that there is a considerable chance of planet harboring surface oceans and having a thin atmosphere however unless planet transits in front of its star from perspective of earth it is difficult to test these hypotheses even though proxima centauri b is in habitable zone planet s habitability has been questioned because of several potentially hazardous physical conditions exoplanet is close enough to its host star that it might be tidally locked in this case it is expected that any habitable areas would be confined to border region between two extreme sides generally referred to as terminator line since it is only here that temperatures might be suitable for liquid water to exist if planet s orbital eccentricity is 0 this could result in synchronous rotation with one hot side permanently facing towards star while opposite side is in permanent darkness and freezing cold however proxima centauri b s orbital eccentricity is not known with certainty only that it is below 0 35 potentially high enough for it to have a significant chance of being captured into a 3 2 spin orbit resonance similar to that of mercury where proxima b would rotate around its axis approximately every 7 5 earth days with about 22 4 earth days elapsing between one sunrise and next resonances as high as 2 1 are also possible another problem is that flares released by proxima centauri could have eroded atmosphere of exoplanet however according to exoplanets channel if proxima b had a strong magnetic field flare activity of its parent star would not be a problem 2017 from european southern observatory estimates that if water and an atmosphere are present a far more hospitable environment would result assuming an atmospheric n2 pressure of 1 bar and 0 01 bar of co2 in a world including oceans with average temperatures similar to those on earth a wide equatorial belt non synchronous rotation or majority of sunlit side synchronous rotation would be permanently ice free a large portion of planet may be habitable if it has an atmosphere thick enough to transfer heat to side facing away from star if it has an atmosphere simulations suggest that planet could have lost about as much as amount of water that earth has due to early irradiation in first 100 200 million years after planet s formation liquid water may be present only in sunniest regions of planet s surface in pools either in an area in hemisphere of planet facing star or if planet is in a 3 2 resonance rotation diurnally in equatorial belt all in all astrophysicists consider ability of proxima centauri b to retain water from its formation as most crucial point in evaluating planet s present habitability planet may be within reach of telescopes and techniques that could reveal more about its composition and atmosphere if it has any view from proxima centauri b thumb upright 1 75 looking towards sky around orion from alpha centauri with sirius near betelgeuse procyon in gemini and sun between perseus and cassiopeia generated by celestia viewed from near alpha centauri system sky would appear much as it does for an observer on earth except that centaurus would be missing its brightest star sun would be a yellow star of an apparent magnitude of 0 5 in eastern cassiopeia at point of alpha centauri s current right ascension and declination at 2000 this place is close to 3 4 magnitude star e cassiopeiae because of placement of sun an interstellar or alien observer would find of cassiopeia had become a coordinates of sun would be diametrically opposite alpha centauri ab at a d nearly in front of heart nebula in cassiopeia sirius lies less than a degree from betelgeuse in otherwise unmodified orion and with a magnitude of 1 2 is a little fainter than from earth but still brightest star in alpha centauri sky procyon is also displaced into middle of gemini outshining pollux whereas both vega and altair are shifted northwestward relative to deneb which barely moves due to its great distance giving summer triangle a more equilateral appearance from proxima centauri b alpha centauri ab would appear like two close bright stars with combined apparent magnitude of 6 8 depending on binary s orbital position bright stars would appear noticeably divisible to naked eye or occasionally but briefly as a single unresolved star based on calculated absolute magnitudes apparent magnitudes of alpha centauri a and b would be 6 5 and 5 2 respectively computed using in solar terms and luminosities 1 57 and 0 51 l sun magnitude 26 73 v 11 2 to 35 6 au orbit minimum luminosity adds planet s orbital radius to a b distance max conjunction maximum luminosity subtracts planet s orbital radius to a b distance min opposition formation it is unlikely that proxima centauri b originally formed in its current orbit since disk models for small stars like proxima centauri would contain less than one of matter within central one au at time of their formation this implies that either proxima centauri b was formed elsewhere in a manner still to be determined or current disc models for stellar formation are in need of revision discovery thumb upright 1 75 velocity of proxima centauri towards and away

measurements were done using two harps on eso 3 6 m telescope at la silla observatory and on 8 metre very large telescope peak radial velocity of host star combined with orbital period allowed for minimum mass of exoplanet to be calculated chance of a false positive detection is less than one in ten million observational complications of system still leave theoretical room for additional large planets to orbit proxima centauri calculations suggest that another super earth planet around star cannot be ruled out and that its presence would not destabilize orbit of proxima centauri b future
