shooter for game boy color on january 10 2001 shin en announced they would stop making games for color instead working on games exclusively for game boy advance iridion s executive producer was dan kitchen a former programmer for atari iridion 3d was shin en s first product to utilize gax sound engine which allowed real time decoding of song data in an extremely small file size this allowed more space on cartridge to be used for graphics although advertised as a 3d game iridion 3d uses solely 2d graphics for texture scrolling and sprites which depict explosions and enemies developers create illusion of 3d by looping background textures a graphically intensive technique for game boy advance graphical objects shrink or enlarge to depict position relative to player level environments feature changes such as progression from day to night kitchen majesco s vice president of handhelds wrote that by pushing graphics hardware of game boy advance to its technical limits iridion 3d provides a truly realistic 3d gaming experience he hoped that players will be amazed that such smooth environments and intense gameplay can now be achieved on a portable system by march 2001 gba version of iridion was shown in workable form ign saw early screens and declared that iridion was aiming to set standard of what gba shooters should be set standard with a hail of bullets they felt shin en was pushing game boy advance to its limits producing most stunning game seen at time for handheld system gamespot s ben stahl previewed iridion 3d on march 21 2001 shortly before release of game in united states he noted excellent graphics and high frame rate ending with at this point iridion 3d looks like it could be a great game for fans of genre reception despite praise for its graphics and sound iridion 3d was received mixed reviews from critics game received 53 and 57 ratings on review aggregate web sites metacritic and gamerankings respectively graphics were almost universally praised andrew bub of gamespy asserted that nintendo should have used iridion to advertise game boy advance as it took full advantage of system s power a year after its release techtv s miguel concepcion argued it was still best looking game for system miguel lopez of gamespot lauded graphics writing that while it s ultimately all smoke and mirrors iridions world is richly detailed has remarkable depth and is unbelievably fluid it s often hard to tell if game s backgrounds are composed of streaming full motion video or just some really fancy math powered 2d bitmaps in contrast to praise for iridions graphics its actual gameplay was generally panned ign s craig harris wrote that shin en s shooter for game boy advance will impress with all its effects but that s about it he noted that player is limited to shooting and dodging making gameplay repetitive harris and concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge player s ship is hit by bullets that appear to be in distance bub and game informers jay criticized craft placement as player s view was often obscured by their own ship lopez also gave iridion low marks warning that after initial wow wears off you ll be stuck with an empty experience edge observed that iridion is a sweet number that will entertain if only for a week or so allgame s skyler miller said iridion 3d was nothing more than a technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars a more positive review came from gamepro whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that if you re looking for some classic shooter action on your new gba iridion 3d will fit bill nicely without blowing you away positive comments were usually directed at sound com said that soundtrack is an instant classic maybe even one of best shooter scores ever concepcion noted that game s mood fitting high energy techno was an oddity coming from a german game company despite poor reviews shin en s manfred linzner felt that iridion 3d was
