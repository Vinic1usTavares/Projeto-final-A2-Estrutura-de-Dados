stefan lazarevic had to maintain serbian despotate in a delicate balance between ottomans and hungarians around 1403 he accepted hungarian vassalage from king sigismund and established new capital in belgrade which was ceded to him as an award after stefan s death in 1426 durad brankovic stefan s nephew and successor had to return belgrade to hungarians to compensate for this loss durad decided to build a new capital and choice fell to smederevo smederevo which had no prior settlement was chosen for several reasons in 1428 during ottoman empire s war with venice hungarians and ottomans agreed to recognize brankovic as an independent ruler of serbia thereby turning it into a buffer state a contract also established ottoman overlordship of serbia in conjunction with remaining a hungarian vassal between longer status with hungary and religious differences with ottomans hungary and serbia were christian as compared to muslim turks it was preferred that capital be closer to hungary than ottoman empire smederevo s location on danube between belgrade and golubac provided easy access to other points along river it also allowed control of danube traffic including blocking hungarian entry into morava valley which satisfied turks in fall of 1428 construction of capital began in 1430 first part of fortress including a palace and enough other buildings to form an inner city was completed work on a fortified suburb and additional fortifications continued until 1439 on april 20 1434 durad brankovic s youngest daughter katarina and ulrich ii of celje were wed in new fortress this marriage stressed friendly relations despot had with ottoman porte although ulrich s kinship with queen of hungary implied an increased serbo hungarian alliance as a result vizier mehmet pasha arrived in smederevo in mid 1434 with a message from edirne it stated that serbia s safety from ottoman empire could only be guaranteed through marriage of brankovic s older daughter to sultan murad ii after much deliberation council convoked at palace conceded and arrangements were made for mara to be engaged to sultan that autumn murad sent several of his most famous viziers to retrieve his fiancee on august 14 1435 a formal contract of brotherhood and friendship between serbia and republic of venice was signed in smederevo s audience hall from pod jerina in curia sine sic apud in sala this contract resulted in durad and his sons being counted as venetian citizens in early june 1439 peace with ottomans which had been gained through mara s marriage to sultan was broken led by murad ii 130

history mainly between 15th and 20th centuries providing a direct testimony for progress of medieval serbian state and corresponding orthodox church thumb left one of fortress double arched windows fortress was built by durad brankovic as new capital of serbia during construction brankovic s wife jerina was seen speaking with foreign overseers her brother george palaiologos kantakouzenos and his men which resulted in her being commonly associated with project among workers this association coupled with required long term labor and high taxes gained her nickname jerina damned jerina amount of effort exerted also produced a variety of exaggerations and stories such as epic poem starina novak i knez bogosav elder novak and count bogosav which stated that many people fled to woods and became hajduci in order to escape taxes and further work while there were in fact hajduci in area it is unclear whether they were actually related to fortress construction once first part was completed smederevo fortress quickly became an important connection between balkans and central europe shortly after it was built city reached its peak importance as a religious commercial and trade center at which point it was populated mainly by serbs and colonies of merchants primarily from dubrovnik around same time relics of saint luke evangelist who became patron saint of smederevo were brought and stored in church in fortress in relation to structure itself inner city is notable for audience hall which is an important representation of serbian medieval architecture high in stone wall on danube

remains smederevo fortress is a monumental complex built in byzantine tradition and modeled after constantinople fortress although its foundations were not intended to be submerged it is classed as a water fortress because it is completely surrounded by water after fortress completion there was a decline in its military importance and few structural changes were made as a result original architectural style has been preserved to this day fortress is encircled by 1 5 kilometers of crenelated walls over 2 meters thick and 25 towers which are each approximately 25 meters tall two sides were bordered by danube and jezava rivers though jezava has now been redirected away from wall third side had two moats added to defensive system one for inner city and one for suburb area south of outer walls was left open construction there were four main phases in construction of fortress work on first part a fortified manor for despot durad brankovic built at confluence of rivers began in autumn of 1428 under eye of george palaiologos kantakouzenos older brother of jerina brankovic lumber lime and enormous stones from former roman cities of mons aureus modern village of seone west of smederevo map near bottom shows seone to west of smederevo at mouth of great morava and viminacium were collected in spring of 1429 greek and ragusan workers began brickwork in 1430 elegant manor was completed it included a palace stretching along length of moat wall a throne hall against danube wall a keep donzon kula donjon tower in corner formed by walls a treasury in a high chamber and other auxiliary buildings creating an inner city thumb left a view to danube from an inner city tower throne hall where brankovic received his visitors was built with four double arched windows fashioned in a mixed gothic romanesque style donzon kula was intended to be final line of defense it was constructed with walls over 4 meters thick and housed nobility during turkish attacks hidden doors were built into jezava wall allowing for passage towards hungary next nine years were spent expanding fortifications to include a larger fortified suburb thereby finishing main fortress in suburb a sacral complex was built in phases from 15th century onwards and a turkish bath was added by ottomans in 17th century there was a ship gate in suburb s danube wall where sailors could enter fortress it is unclear whether any long term residential buildings were built between 1460 and 1480 while held by ottoman empire a larger defensive system was built including escarpments low walls and more towers during first half of 18th century fortified trenches were added current condition state of deterioration of fortress ranges widely from krstata kula which is still well preserved to sections of walls which have seen no repair work and have collapsed in some places thumb right 250px southwestern wall of fortified suburb first and most severe damage happened during world war ii on june 5 1941 ammunition stored in fortress exploded destroying not only a large part of southern wall but also decimating most of smederevo further damage was caused by allies bombing in 1944 a dam in iron gate completed in 1972 raised water level of lower danube basin and caused significant flooding between 1970 and 1980 a system was built to protect fortress and surrounding city from future high water however there was once again major flooding in 2006 a result of heavy rainfall and melting snow fortress has been focus of restoration and conservation efforts followed by archaeological and architectural research since at least 1970 majority of work so far was done between 1970 and 1995 while some parts were at least partially repaired others only received conservation work and are still in bad condition in inner city foundation is only part of palace which remains standing and audience hall has only an outline where base was what remains has been partially restored and is now stable though issues of vegetation growth and permanent maintenance remain surrounding towers also still need work as many have collapsed town s restoration was followed in 1994 1995 with an archaeological investigation thumb left 250px southeastern wall of fortified suburb fortified suburb is still in very bad condition parts of wall are missing and several towers are leaning or partially collapsed corner tower behind turkish inscription tower and stretch of wall along danube have seen conservation efforts and southern wall which has been restored several times as part of a levee is stable but conservation work is of poor quality much of time has instead been spent on archaeological excavations and research especially of remains of sacral complex and turkish bath escarpment along danube which had partially collapsed several times has seen restoration work and is now in good condition on other sides much of escarpment is gone or underground and overall condition is unknown ambiance and setting are also threatened though they remain best along danube other two sides are surrounded by modern development such as a marina on eastern side a railway to south and a variety of other urban structures planned final result of work is for full rehabilitation of both smederevo fortress and its immediate surroundings including relocating railroad though estimations of cost vary widely between 2003 and 2004 cost for just conservation work was estimated to be eur10 600 000 while total rehabilitation cost including conservation restoration and research reached as high as eur22 000 000 in 2005 combined cost for basic conservation and research dropped to eur4 000 000 ongoing risk factors despite conservation efforts fortress is still at risk of damage for reasons both natural and man made higher groundwater level resulting from dam in iron gate threatens its stability and has increased number of floods especially before coast was consolidated air pollution and vegetation growth are increasing rate of decay urban encroachment especially by railroad continues to threaten character of area surrounding fortress unrestricted visits by tourists combined with inadequate protection maintenance and support both administrative and financial also contribute to slow deterioration of fortress see also serbian despotate serbian empire history of serbia serbia in middle ages monuments
