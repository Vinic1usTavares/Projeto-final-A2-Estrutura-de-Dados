was lead ship of her class of battleships built for imperial japanese navy ijn shortly before world war ii she and her sister ship were heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed displacing 72 800 tonnes at full load and armed with nine type 94 main guns which were largest guns ever mounted on a warship named after ancient japanese yamato province yamato was designed to counter numerically superior battleship fleet of united states japan s main rival in pacific she was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after pearl harbor attack in late 1941 throughout 1942 she served as flagship of combined fleet and in june 1942 admiral isoroku yamamoto directed fleet from her bridge during battle of midway a disastrous defeat for japan musashi took over as combined fleet flagship in early 1943 and yamato spent rest of year and much of 1944 moving between major japanese naval bases of truk and kure in response to american threats although present at battle of philippine sea in june 1944 she played no part in battle only time yamato fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in october 1944 when she was sent to engage american forces invading philippines during battle of leyte gulf on verge of success japanese force turned back believing they were engaging an entire us carrier fleet rather than a light escort carrier group which was all that stood between battleship and vulnerable troop transports during 1944 balance of naval power in pacific decisively turned against japan and by early 1945 its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in home islands in a desperate attempt to slow allied advance yamato was dispatched on a one way mission to okinawa in april 1945 with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed thus protecting island task force was spotted south of kyushu by us submarines and aircraft and on 7 april 1945 she was sunk by american carrier based bombers and torpedo bombers with loss of most of her crew design and construction during 1930s japanese government adopted an ultranationalist militancy with a view to greatly expand japanese empire willmott 2000 p 32

1942 yamato became flagship of admiral isoroku yamamoto s combined fleet a veteran of japan s crushing victory over russia at battle of tsushima in russo japanese war pearl harbor victor was planning a decisive engagement with united states navy at midway island after participating in war games yamato departed hiroshima bay on 27 may for duty with yamamoto s main battleship group ballard 1999 p 36 us codebreakers were aware of yamamoto s intentions and battle of midway proved disastrous for japan s carrier force with four fleet carriers and 332 aircraft lost yamamoto exercised overall command from yamatos bridge but his battle plan had widely dispersed his forces to lure americans into a trap and battleship group was too far away to take part in engagement on 5 june yamamoto ordered remaining ships to return to japan so yamato withdrew with main battleship force to hashirajima before making her way back to kure yamato left kure for truk on 17 august 1942 after 11 days at sea she was sighted by american submarine which fired four torpedoes all of which missed yamato arrived safely at truk later that day she remained there throughout guadalcanal campaign because of a lack of 46 cm ammunition suitable for shore bombardment uncharted seas around guadalcanal and her high fuel consumption before year s end captain later rear admiral chiaki matsuda was assigned to command yamato on 11 february 1943 yamato was replaced by her sister ship musashi as flagship of combined fleet battleship spent only a single day away from truk between her arrival in august 1942 and her departure on 8 may 1943 whitley 1998 p 212 on that day she set sail for yokosuka and from there for kure arriving on 14 may she spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs and after sailing to japan s western inland sea she was again dry docked in late july for significant refitting and upgrades on 16 august yamato began her return to truk where she joined a large task force formed in response to american raids on tarawa and makin atolls she sortied in late september with nagato three carriers and smaller warships to intercept us task force 15 and again a month later with six battleships three carriers and eleven cruisers intelligence had reported that united states naval base at pearl harbor was nearly empty of ships which japanese interpreted to mean that an american naval force would strike at wake island but there were no radar contacts for six days and fleet returned to truk arriving on 26 october thumb left yamato and musashi anchored in waters off of truk islands in 1943 yamato escorted transport operation bo 1 from truk to yokosuka during 12 17 december subsequently because of their extensive storage capacity and thick armor protection yamato and musashi were pressed into service as transport vessels on 25 december while ferrying troops and equipment which were wanted as reinforcements for garrisons at kavieng and admiralty islands from yokosuka to truk yamato and her task group were intercepted by american submarine about out at sea whitley 1998 p 213 skate fired a spread of four torpedoes at yamato one struck battleship s starboard

arrived at kure for repairs of torpedo damage and was dry docked until 3 february during this time armor plate sloped at deg was fitted in area of damage to her hull it had been proposed that of steel be used to bolster ship s defense against flooding from torpedo hits outside armored citadel but this was rejected out of hand because additional weight would have increased yamatos displacement and draft too much while yamato was dry docked captain morishita former captain of battleship assumed command on 25 february yamato and musashi were reassigned from 1st battleship division to second fleet thumb upright 1 35 line drawing of yamato as she appeared in 1944 1945 specific configuration from 7 april 1945 yamato was again dry docked at kure for further upgrades to all her radar and anti

opportunity was taken to put in place emergency buoyancy keeping procedures these resulted in removal of almost every flammable item from battleship including linoleum bedding and mattresses in place of latter men slept on planks which could be used to repair damage flammable paints received a new silicon based overcoat and additional portable pumps and fire fighting apparatus were installed leaving japan on 8 july yamato accompanied by battleships musashi nagato and eleven cruisers and destroyers sailed south yamato and musashi headed for lingga islands arriving on 16 17 july by this

sustained only minor damage from a number of near misses and from one bomb that struck her bridge intervention of a squadron of kawanishi shiden fighters named george by allies flown by veteran japanese fighter instructors prevented raid from doing too much damage to base and assembled ships while yamatos ability to maneuver albeit slowly in channel benefited her as final step before their planned invasion of japanese mainland allied forces invaded okinawa on 1 april feifer 2001 p 7 imperial japanese navy s response was to organise a mission codenamed operation ten go that would see commitment of much of japan s remaining surface strength yamato and nine escorts cruiser and eight destroyers would sail to okinawa and in concert with kamikaze and okinawa based army units attack allied forces assembled on and around okinawa yamato would then be beached to act as an unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed in preparation for mission yamato had taken on

for japanese allies had intercepted and decoded their radio transmissions learning particulars of operation ten go further confirmation of japanese intentions came around 20 00 when surface special attack force navigating bungo strait was spotted by american submarines and both reported yamatos position to main american carrier strike force but neither could attack because of speed of japanese ships and their extreme zigzagging allied forces around okinawa braced for an assault admiral raymond spruance ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in sector to prepare for surface action against yamato these orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from admiral marc mitscher s aircraft carriers but as a contingency battleships together with seven cruisers and 21

in deck a third bomb then destroyed her radar room and starboard aft 127 mm mount at 12 46 another two bombs struck battleship s port side one slightly ahead of aft 155 mm centreline turret and other right on top of gun these caused a great deal of damage to turret and its magazines only one man survived at 12 45 a single torpedo struck yamato far forward on her port side sending shock waves throughout ship because many of ship s crew who didn t go down with vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in oily water details are uncertain but authors garzke and dulin record that little damage was caused shortly afterward up to three more torpedoes struck yamato two impacts on port side near engine room and on one of boiler rooms are confirmed third is disputed but is regarded by garzke and dulin as probable because it would explain reported flooding in yamatos auxiliary steering room attack ended around 12 47 leaving battleship listing deg to port counterflooding deliberately flooding compartments on other side of ship reduced list to deg one boiler room had been disabled slightly reducing yamatos top speed and strafing had incapacitated many of gun crews who

battleship s anti aircraft guns were ineffective and japanese tried desperate measures to break up attack yamatos main guns were loaded with beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing a mere from ship but these had little effect three or four torpedoes struck battleship on port side and one to starboard three hits close together on port side are confirmed one struck a fire room that had already been hit one impacted a different fire room and third hit hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room increasing water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations fourth hit unconfirmed may have struck aft of third garzke and dulin believe this would explain rapid flooding reported in that location garzke and dulin 1985 pp 62 63 this attack left yamato in a perilous position listing deg to port counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to deg but further correction would have required repairs or flooding starboard engine and fire rooms although battleship was not yet in danger of sinking list meant main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to garzke and dulin 1985 p 63 third and most damaging attack developed at about 13 40 at least four bombs hit ship s superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25 mm anti aircraft gun crews many near misses drove in her outer plating compromising her defense against torpedoes most serious were four more torpedo impacts three exploded on port side increasing water flow into port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and steering gear room with auxiliary steering room already under water ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn fourth torpedo most likely hit starboard outer engine room which along with three other rooms on starboard side was being counterflooded to reduce port list torpedo strike accelerated rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen garzke and dulin 1985 pp 64 65 thumb left upright alt a

surviving destroyers which withdrew to japan from first attack at 12 37 to explosion at 14 23 yamato was hit by at least 11 torpedoes and six bombs there may have been two more torpedo and bomb hits
