of his cruisers opened fire at light cruiser leading northern most column three minutes later o hara pp 210 211 abrupt maneuvers by japanese ships both to evade american torpedoes and to fire their own led to one collision and several near misses early in battle most of american cruisers were firing at heavy cruisers in center column by 03 05 and omori turned away in a 270 degree turn that cut across path of aganos column heavy cruiser rammed and crippled destroyer while heavy cruiser nearly struck destroyer incorrectly believing that he had sunk three of american cruisers omori ordered his
