country with condition precedent of offering a political and economic agreement to canada culmination of multiple years of debate and planning after failure of meech lake and charlottetown constitutional accords referendum was launched solely by provincial parti quebecois government of jacques parizeau despite initial predictions of a heavy sovereignist defeat an eventful and complex campaign followed with yes side flourishing after being taken over by bloc quebecois leader lucien bouchard fast rise of yes campaign and apparent inability of personalities of no campaign to counter their message created an atmosphere of great uncertainty both in federal government and across canada voting took place on 30th of october 1995 and featured largest voter turnout in quebec s history 93 52 no option carried by 54 288 votes 50 58 parizeau who announced his pending resignation as quebec premier following day would later state that he would have quickly proceeded with a unilateral declaration of independence had result been affirmative and negotiations failed or been refused latter of which was later revealed as federal position in event of a yes victory controversies over both provincial vote counting and direct federal financial involvement in final days of campaign reverberated in canadian politics for over a decade after referendum took place in aftermath of close result

series of constitutional amendments designed to address quebec s concerns in what became known as meech lake accord federal government and all provincial premiers agreed to a series of amendments that decentralized some powers and recognized quebec as forming a distinct society accord after fierce debate in english canada fell apart in dramatic fashion in summer of 1990 prompting outrage in quebec and a surge in support for sovereignty while accord was collapsing lucien bouchard a cabinet minister in mulroney s government led a coalition of progressive conservative and liberal members of parliament from quebec to form a new federal party devoted to quebec sovereignty bloc quebecois following these events bourassa proclaimed that a referendum would occur in 1992 with either sovereignty or a new constitutional agreement as subject this prompted a national referendum on charlottetown accord of 1992 a series of amendments that included proposals of meech lake as well as concerns of

quebec liberal party of canada and progressive conservative party of canada primary issue of debate within sovereignty movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before electorate parizeau long identified with wing of party was opposed to pq s general historical preference for an economic relationship with rest of canada to be offered alongside sovereignty as he thought this would encourage federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast project as doomed as had happened in 1980 as a practical matter parizeau believed that given emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary parizeau s stance created opposition in sovereignty movement which coalesced around bloc quebecois leader lucien bouchard a popular and charismatic figure bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg his recovery and subsequent

deputy premier bernard landry aroused ire by stating he would not want to be involved in a charge of light brigade during bloc s april conference after a speech demanding a change in direction bouchard expressed ambivalence to a radio show about participating if a partnership proposal was not included mario dumont leader of new action democratique du quebec also stated that he would only consider participation in referendum if a partnership was made part of question final findings of national commission issued april 19 included a statement that public generally desired an economic partnership with canada fearing bouchard and dumont would further dilute their position as referendum wore on parizeau agreed to negotiate a broader approach and would agree to a statement that included partnership with dumont and bouchard on june 12 1995 agreement contained details of partnership negotiation process and a general plan of seeking sovereignty while requiring an economic and social partnership offer be negotiated and presented to rest of canada most importantly for parizeau agreement also allowed government to declare immediate independence if negotiations were not successful or heard after a successful referendum bertrand v quebec looming referendum prompted a number of actions in quebec superior court which were consolidated under application of prominent lawyer guy bertrand bertrand asked for interim and permanent injunctions against holding of referendum federal attorney general declined to intervene and after failing in a motion to strike application quebec attorney general unilaterally withdrew from hearing quebec government moved september sitting of national assembly two days forward to be sure that parliamentary immunity would prevent from being summoned to testify justice lesage of court found that secession could only legally be performed by constitutional amendment pursuant to section v of constitution act 1982 and that a unilateral declaration of independence would be manifestly illegal lesage refused to issue an injunction to stop referendum as he believed that to do so could paralyze workings of government and cause more disorder than referendum being held court opted for declaratory relief declaring that sovereignty bill and referendum constituted a serious threat to bertrand s charter rights court specifically named sections 2 3 6 7 15 and 24 1 of charter 303 parizeau denounced decision as undemocratic stated that constitution act 1982 did not apply to quebec johnson william independence

was legal pursuant to international law daniel johnson announced following day that ruling would not change strategy of no campaign some federal officials questioned if their level of government could be involved after declaration but ultimately federal government decided to participate referendum question in a dramatic reading at grand theatre de quebec on september 6 final version of sovereignty bill was unveiled bill would be tabled in national assembly awaiting result of referendum question in 1980 referendum in an attempt to build a broad coalition had sought only authority to negotiate sovereignty with canadian government and promised a second referendum to ratify results of any negotiation parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage remainder of canada to use delaying tactics draft initial act featured a question only asking for authority to declare quebec sovereign are you in favour of act passed by national assembly declaring sovereignty of quebec draft bill respecting sovereignty of quebec pursuant to partnership agreement with bouchard and dumont referendum question was changed to incorporate partnership agreement it was presented on september 7 1995 to be voted on october 30 1995 in english question on ballot asked do you agree that quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to canada for a new economic and political partnership within scope of bill respecting future of quebec and of agreement signed on june 12 1995 in french vous que le quebec souverain apres avoir au canada un nouveau economique et politique dans le cadre du de loi sur l avenir du quebec et de l entente signee le 12 juin 1995 question came under immediate fire from federalists who had no input in drafting quebec liberal leader daniel johnson stated it was confusing and at very least should have contained word country prominent federalists argued that referendum question should not have mentioned partnership proposals because no canadian political leaders outside quebec had shown any interest in negotiating a possible partnership agreement with an independent quebec and arguably no entity capable of undertaking such negotiations actually existed other federalists argued that question erroneously implied an agreement had been reached between canada and quebec regarding a partnership on june 12 1995 parizeau would later express regret that agreement had to be cited in question but noted that june 12 1995 agreement had been sent to every registered voter in province campaign participants thumb 175px daniel

budget of 5 million campaign spending by any person or group other than official committees would be illegal after official beginning of referendum campaign after agreement of june 12 yes campaign would be headed by jacques parizeau official no campaign would be chaired by liberal leader daniel johnson jr making matters more complex especially for no camp was federal nature of canada governing liberal party of canada and its leader prime minister jean chretien were not strongly represented in province outside of montreal chretien s involvement in 1982 negotiations and his stance against meech lake accord made him unpopular with moderate francophone federalists and sovereignists who would be swing voters in referendum lucienne a nationalist former bourassa era cabinet minister would serve as federal liberal representative on no committee jean charest leader of federal progressive conservative party would be prominently featured as he and pcs had closely and productively cooperated with quebec liberals in meech lake negotiations fearing missteps by politicians not used to quebec that had occurred during meech lake and charlottetown debates johnson and campaign heavily controlled appearances by federal politicians including chretien johnson bluntly banned any appearance by reform party or its leader preston manning this would go unchallenged by ottawa for majority of campaign but created much frustration within governing liberals in ottawa prominent chretien adviser eddie goldenberg believed that no campaign at some points was more focused on future election position of quebec liberals rather than referendum itself early days campaign officially began on october 2 1995 with a televised address by both leaders parizeau emphasized that he believed this might be last opportunity for sovereignty for foreseeable future while johnson chose to forecast uncertainty that a yes vote could provoke johnson s campaign focused on practical problems created by sovereignty process emphasizing that an independent quebec would be in an uncertain position regarding north american free trade agreement nafta and not be able to control canadian dollar prominent business figures such as power corporation president paul desmarais and bombardier inc head laurent beaudoin spoke that they believed a yes victory could spell doom for their quebec business interests initial campaign for yes was led by parizeau with dumont campaigning separately in rural areas in addition to traditional themes of movement s appeal to quebec nationalism yes campaign attempted to highlight slim possibility of any future reform to canada s federal system parizeau bitterly attacked business leaders for intervening in referendum calling it a betrayal of their quebec customers and workers while parizeau s responses were highly popular with yes stalwarts it was generally seen that speeches against business leaders were only highlighting economic uncertainty that worried swing voters polls in first week were highly disappointing for yes camp as they showed them behind by 5 7 percentage points among decided voters with an even larger gap if undecided voters were weighed toward no side as would generally be expected parizeau a general fixture in quebec politics for decades whose strong views of sovereignty were well known among populace was under pressure to create a spark appointment of bouchard thumb left 150px lucien bouchard federal leader of opposition in an unannounced ceremony on october 7 at universite de montreal parizeau made a surprise announcement he appointed bouchard as chief negotiator for partnership talks following a yes vote move came as a dramatic surprise to campaign promoting popular bouchard to fore and simultaneously emphasizing partnership aspect of question according to mario dumont and parizeau planned to use referendum as a way to advocate for an new partnership between quebec and canada however bouchard advocated for separation so they followed bouchard s direction bouchard already popular became a sensation in addition to his medical struggles and charisma his more moderate approach and prominent involvement in meech lake accord while in ottawa reminded undecided nationalist voters of federal missteps from years past politicians on both sides described his appeal as messianic and almost impossible to personally attack in contrast to well worn figures on both sides of referendum no advisor john noted that at focus groups when presented with statements bouchard had made that they did not like participants would refuse to believe he meant them new polls eventually showed a majority of quebecers intending to vote yes no forces including johnson were shocked by development which required wholesale changes in strategy three weeks before vote unwilling to believe parizeau had given up his leadership role voluntarily most in no camp and ottawa had assumed a coup had taken place though manoeuvre had been planned and voluntary dramatic events prompted many federal politicians to lobby for similarly dramatic intervention from ottawa and federal government which were refused by no committee who believed that with bouchard s introduction margin for error was dramatically reduced no campaign continued to focus on economic benefits of federation bouchard s speeches asked quebecers to vote yes to give a clear mandate for change and that only clarity of a yes vote would provide a final solution to canada s long standing constitutional issues and a new partnership with english canada for betterment of both bouchard s popularity was such that his remarks that quebecois were white race with lowest rate of reproduction which threatened to cast project as focused on ethnic nationalism were traversed with ease bloc quebecois mp suzanne tremblay was less successful in this regard and apologized after answering journalist joyce napier s question of how minority francophones outside of quebec would be helped by independence by stating that napier s last name and lack of a quebecois accent made her ignorant of subject non quebecois accent sounds ignorant to mp

challenge to chretien to declare his position on distinct society recognition when presented with request chretien in new york for a united nations meeting responded no we re not talking about constitution we re talking about separation of quebec from rest of canada remarks in direct contradiction to johnson were portrayed in press as a blunt refusal chretien s position was far more difficult than johnson s part of 1993 liberal election platform had been moving country away from large scale constitutional debates provincial governments were also far more hostile to constitutional process than they had been in decade prior with even federal government s typical ally ontario being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation french president jacques chirac while answering a call from a viewer in montreal on cnn s larry king live declared that if yes side were successful fact that referendum had succeeded would be recognized by france at a federalist rally of about 12 500 people which was held at verdun auditorium on october 24 chretien introduced a focus on quebec s emotional attachment to canada promised reforms to give quebec more power and in a more startling announcement declared that he would support enshrinement of quebec as a distinct society and that he would support reforms to canadian constitution sudden reversal of chretien s long

saguenay lac saint jean gaspe centre du quebec and generally suburbs of quebec city and montreal while there was disappointment in results of montreal and beauce quebec city s soft support for yes was greatest surprise for yes side this prompted speculation that provincial civil servants did not want uncertainty a yes would bring especially after parizeau had promised to integrate displaced federal civil servants in a sovereign quebec heavily populated west island ridings of montreal home to a large anglophone population voted no by margins eclipsing 80 some polling stations even showed

quebec s premier and government yes supporters met at palais des congres de montreal on referendum night after result became known dumont and bouchard made speeches accepting result as part of movement s democratic convictions and expressing hope that a subsequent referendum would bring a yes victory jacques parizeau who had not prepared a concession speech rejected one prepared by jean francois and spoke without notes noting that 60 of french speakers had voted yes he stated that he would address french speaking quebecois as we and that they had spoken clearly in favour of yes he then stated that only thing that had stopped yes side was money and ethnic vote and that next referendum would be successful with only a few percentage more of french speakers onside remarks widely lambasted in canadian and international press as ethnocentric sparked surprise and anger in yes camp as movement had gone to great lengths to disown ethnic nationalism bernard landry confronted parizeau at a cabinet meeting next morning about remarks stating that movement had to hide its head in shame parizeau after canvassing opinions then told his cabinet that he would resign as premier and leader of parti quebecois it was later revealed that he had declared he would retire anyway if yes side lost in an embargoed interview with tva taped days before referendum five days after referendum andre dallaire a schizophrenic yes supporter upset at result broke into chretien s ottawa residence armed with a knife dallaire attempted to find chretien and kill prime minister in his bed before being discovered by aline chretien who barricaded bedroom door chretien was unharmed and dallaire would eventually be found not criminally responsible by reason of mental defect contingency preparation for a yes victory thumb 150px mario dumont leader of and member of yes side sovereignists sovereignists believed that a yes vote of 50 plus one vote was a binding result pursuant to referendum act and sovereignty bill as well as general international law principle of self determination in event of a yes victory parizeau had said he intended to return to national assembly of quebec within two days of result and seek support for a motion recognizing result of referendum in a speech he had prepared in event of a yes victory he said a sovereign quebec s first move would be to extend a hand to its canadian neighbour in partnership pursuant to wording of referendum parizeau s immediate plans after referendum relied upon what he felt would be general pressure from economic markets and business community in english canada to stabilize situation as quickly as possible which he believed would mitigate any catastrophic initial events such as blockades and prepare for negotiations despite prominent placement of bouchard in referendum campaign parizeau planned to retain all authority with regard to negotiations and to appoint most members of negotiation team if they were to occur parizeau also believed federalist quebecers such as chretien and charest would be quickly disregarded and replaced at negotiations by representatives from other nine provinces if federal government refused to negotiate or if negotiations were to exceed october 30 1996 parizeau stated that he would proceed with a unilateral declaration of independence udi for an independent quebec pursuant to section 26 of sovereignty bill parizeau s hopes for international recognition a practical requirement of statehood rested with france and francophonie he believed that if quebec declared independence in these circumstances president of french national assembly philippe seguin a powerful power broker who was sympathetic to sovereignty movement would pressure president chirac to recognize declaration he counted on a french recognition to spread quickly to francophonie and bring issue to a head benoit bouchard canada s ambassador at time believed that plan was irrational as he doubted seguin who was supposed to be a neutral figure in his role could bring sufficient pressure in country s semi presidential system in interviews conducted in 2014 bouchard and dumont both believed that negotiations would have resulted had yes side won and that quebec would have remained in canada with a more autonomous status bouchard while approving of parizeau s intention to unilaterally declare independence should negotiations be refused implied that he and dumont would have been able to control negotiations and offer a subsequent referendum on a new agreement dumont noted that international recognition would have been difficult had two of three leaders of yes campaign been against a udi and that he and bouchard were willing to slow process down if necessary for his part bernard landry believed that nothing short of a seat at united nations would have been accomplished had yes won federalists recognition as referendum was only of force and effect pursuant to a provincial law neither provincially sanctioned no committee nor federal government had any input on question of referendum federalists strongly differed on how or if a yes referendum result would be recognized no campaign head daniel johnson disputed yes side s position that a simple majority was sufficient to declare independence as he believed question was too vague and gave negotiators too broad a mandate given enormity of issue and uncertainty of negotiations jean chretien refused to publicly comment or consider contingencies regarding a possible yes victory and at no point stated referendum bound federal government to negotiations or permitted a unilateral declaration of independence his wording of speeches during referendum noted that parizeau would interpret a yes vote as a mandate to separate quebec from canada but never offered recognition that this was legal or recognizable a speech drafted for chretien in event of a yes vote stated that question was too ambiguous to be binding and that only dissatisfaction with status quo had been stated reform party leader preston manning a prominent proponent of direct democracy would have recognized any result with critics suspecting he preferred a yes vote for electoral gain jean charest recognized referendum s legitimacy although a draft post referendum speech had him interpreting a yes vote as a call for drastic reform of canadian federation instead of separation new democratic party s official position was that result had to be recognized negotiations little planning was made for possibility of a yes vote by canadian federal government with general consensus being that referendum would be easily won and that planning would spark panic or give referendum undeserved legitimacy some members of federal cabinet met to discuss several possible scenarios including referring issue of quebec s independence to supreme court senior civil servants met to consider impact of a vote for secession on issues such as territorial boundaries and federal debt a dispute arose as to whether jean chretien and many prominent members of cabinet who had been elected in quebec ridings could represent canada at a hypothetical partnership negotiation manning intended to immediately call for chretien s resignation and for a general election if referendum were successful even though liberals independently of their quebec seats had a sizable majority in house of commons there was also some doubt that chretien would be able to assure governor general that he retained enough support within his party to remain prime minister of canada seguin rheal ministers plotted to oust chretien if referendum was lost cbc says globe and mail september 9 2005 chretien s intention was whatever result to stay in office new brunswick premier frank mckenna later confirmed that he had been invited into a hypothetical national unity cabinet if yes side was victorious with a general understanding that former

relationships with other western provinces also seceding from canada or joining united states controversies post referendum rejected ballots when counting was completed approximately 86 000 ballots
