thumb right 300px golden toad of monteverde costa rica was among first casualties of amphibian declines formerly abundant it was last seen in 1989 decline in amphibian populations is an ongoing mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide since 1980s decreases in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinctions have been observed in locations all over world these declines are known as one of most critical threats to global biodiversity and several causes are believed to be involved including disease habitat destruction and modification exploitation pollution pesticide use introduced species and ultraviolet b radiation uv b however many of causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research calculations based on extinction rates suggest that current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than background extinction rate and estimate goes up to 25 000 45 000 times if endangered species are also included in computation although scientists began observing reduced populations of several european amphibian species already in 1950s awareness of phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern day mass extinction only dates from 1980s by 1993 more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline today phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus recognized as one of most severe examples of holocene extinction with severe implications for global biodiversity background in past three decades declines in populations of amphibians class of organisms that includes frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians have occurred worldwide in 2004 results were published of first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations global amphibian assessment this found that 32 of species were globally threatened at least 43 were experiencing some form of population decrease and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980 iucn red list which incorporates global amphibian assessment and subsequent updates lists 486 amphibian species as critically endangered despite high risk this group faces recent evidence suggests public is growing largely indifferent to this and other environmental problems posing serious problems for conservationists and environmental workers alike habitat loss disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for drastic decline in populations in recent years declines have been particularly intense in western united states central america south america eastern australia and fiji although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide while human activities are causing a loss of much of world s biodiversity amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism because amphibians generally have a two staged life cycle consisting of both aquatic larvae and terrestrial adult phases they are sensitive to both terrestrial and aquatic environmental effects because their skins are highly permeable they may be more susceptible to toxins in environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals science daily october 15 2004 amphibians in dramatic decline study finds nearly one third of species threatened with extinction sciencedaily com retrieved on september 18 2007 many scientists believe that amphibians serve as canaries in a coal mine and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in late 1980s when a large gathering of herpetologists reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across globe among these species golden toad bufo periglenes endemic to monteverde costa rica featured prominently it was subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989 other species at monteverde including monteverde harlequin frog atelopus varius also disappeared at same time because these species were located in pristine monteverde cloud forest reserve and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities they raised particular concern among biologists initial skepticism when amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in late 1980s some scientists remained unconvinced of reality and gravity of conservation issue some biologists argued that populations of most organisms amphibians included naturally vary through time they argued that lack of long term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth often limited time and money of conservation efforts however since this initial skepticism biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity this consensus emerged with an increase in number of studies that monitored amphibian populations direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature potential causes numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others many of causes of amphibian declines are well understood and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians these causes include habitat modification and fragmentation introduced predators or competitors introduced species pollution pesticide use or over harvesting however many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where above effects are not likely to occur causes of these declines are complex but many can be attributed to emerging diseases climate change increased ultraviolet b radiation or long distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within amphibian habitats eisenbeis g 2006 artificial night lighting and insects attraction of insects to in a rural setting in germany in c rich t eds ecological consequences of artificial night lighting island press 281 304 habitat modification habitat modification or destruction is one of most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide as amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive threats to either habitat can affect populations hence amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats preventing amphibians from spawning altogether habitat fragmentation habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to inbreeding genetic drift or extinction due to small fluctuations in environment pollution and chemical contaminants there is evidence of chemical pollutants causing frog developmental deformities extra limbs or malformed eyes pollutants have varying effects on frogs some alter central nervous system others like atrazine cause a disruption in production and secretion of hormones experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as glyphosate tradename roundup or insecticides such as malathion or carbaryl greatly increase mortality of tadpoles additional studies have indicated that terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non active ingredients in roundup particularly which is a surfactant atrazine has been shown to cause male tadpoles of african clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of both male and female organs such feminization has been reported in many parts of world in a study conducted in a laboratory at uppsala university in sweden more than 50 of frogs exposed to levels of estrogen like pollutants existing in natural bodies of water in europe and united states became females tadpoles exposed even to weakest concentration of estrogen were twice as likely to become females while almost all of control group given heaviest dose became female while most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture there is evidence from sierra nevada mountains of western united states that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas including yosemite national park in california some recent evidence points to ozone as a possible contributing factor to worldwide decline of amphibians ozone depletion ultraviolet radiation and cloud cover like many other organisms increasing ultraviolet b uvb radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion and other factors may harm dna of amphibians particularly their eggs amount of damage depends upon life stage species type and other environmental parameters salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase an enzyme that counteracts dna damage from uvb are more susceptible to effects of loss of ozone layer exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage more than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer reviewed journals representing authors from north america europe and australia experimental enclosure approaches to determine uvb effects on egg stages have been criticized for example egg masses were placed at water depths much shallower than is typical for natural oviposition sites while uvb radiation is an important stressor for amphibians its effect on egg stage may have been overstated anthropogenic climate change has likely exerted a major effect on amphibian declines for example in monteverde cloud forest a series of unusually warm years led to mass disappearances of monteverde harlequin frog and golden toad an increased level of cloud cover a result of geoengineering and global warming which has warmed nights and cooled daytime temperatures has been blamed for facilitating growth and proliferation of fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causative agent of fungal infection chytridiomycosis thumb an adult male in atlanta botanical garden a species ravaged by batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in its native habitat it was last known surviving member of its species and with its death on sept 28 2016 species is believed to be extinct although immediate cause of die offs was chytrid climate change played a pivotal role in extinctions researchers included this subtle connection in their inclusive climate linked epidemic hypothesis which acknowledged climatic change as a key factor in amphibian extinctions both in costa rica and elsewhere new evidence has shown global warming to also be capable of directly degrading toads body condition and survivorship additionally phenomenon often with landscape alteration pollution and species invasions to effect amphibian extinctions disease a number of diseases have been related to mass die offs or declines in populations of amphibians including red leg disease aeromonas ranavirus family and chytridiomycosis it is not entirely clear why these diseases have suddenly begun to affect amphibian populations but some evidence suggests that these diseases may have been spread by humans or may be more virulent when combined with other environmental factors trematodes thumb trematode cyst infected pacific tree frog hyla regilla with supernumerary limbs from la pine deschutes county oregon 1998 9 this category i deformity is believed to be caused by trematode cyst infection cartilage is stained blue and calcified bones in red there is considerable evidence that parasitic trematode a type of fluke have contributed to developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians in some regions these trematodes of genus ribeiroia have a complex life cycle with three host species first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails early larval stages of trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles where larvae in developing limb buds these life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post metamorphic frogs including additional or missing limbs these abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds final host of trematode thumb pacific tree frog with limb malformation induced by ribeiroia ondatrae a study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across north america study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in abundance of trematodes and that parasites subsequently form cysts in developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs chytridiomycosis thumb left a chytrid infected frog in 1998 following large scale frog deaths in australia and central america research teams in both areas came up with identical results a previously undescribed species of pathogenic fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis it is now clear that many recent extinctions of amphibians in australia and americas are linked to this fungus this fungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as that are not generally pathogenic disease caused by batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is called chytridiomycosis frogs infected by this disease generally show skin lesions and hyperkeratosis and it is believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance electrolyte homeostasis respiration and role as a barrier to infections time from infection to death has been found to be 1 2 weeks in experimental tests but infected animals can carry fungus as long as 220 days there are several hypotheses on transmission and vectors of fungus subsequent research has established that fungus has been present in australia since at least 1978 and present in north america since at least 1970s first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in african clawed frog xenopus laevis because xenopus are sold in pet shops and used in laboratories around world it is possible that chytrid fungus may have been exported from africa introduced predators non native predators and competitors have also been found to affect viability of frogs in their habitats mountain yellow legged frog which typically inhabits sierra nevada lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non native fish trout for recreational fishing developing tadpoles and fall prey to fish in large numbers this interference in frog s three year metamorphosis is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem increased noise levels frogs and toads are highly vocal and their reproductive behaviour often involves use of vocalizations there have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines in a study in thailand increased ambient noise levels were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others this has however not been shown to be a cause for widespread decline symptoms of stressed populations amphibian populations in beginning stages of decline often exude a number of signs which may potentially be used to identify at risk segments in conservation efforts one such sign is developmental instability which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress this environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis and thus lead to amphibian declines in a study conducted in queensland australia for example populations of two amphibian species litoria and litoria were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre decline years than in control years latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years learning to identify such signals in critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts conservation measures first response to reports of declining amphibian populations was formation of declining amphibian population task force daptf in 1990 led efforts for increased amphibian population monitoring in order to establish extent of problem and established

disappearing by starting captive breeding programmes areas with noticed frog extinctions like australia have few policies that have been created to prevent extinction of these species however local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving frogs in south america where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations there is no set policy to try to save frogs some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by a critical issue is how to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival conservation efforts through use of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because amphibians become inbred it is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments education of local people to protect amphibians is crucial along with legislation for local protection and limiting use of toxic chemicals
