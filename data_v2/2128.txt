arrived there he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own anyone who did not comply would receive a belting boys were issued no underwear and clothes were washed only once a week beatings were common and not just for punishment sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring other accounts claim there were beatings and repetitive rape

throughout complex at present orphanage has been heavily vandalised with surrounding residents regularly calling police because sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently small grass fires around building have also been reported restorations have been considered by goulburn city council council is holding ferrara accountable for allowing damage at orphanage while he has come up with many development projects for lot as a result city council has not issued ferrara any development permits until restoration work to orphanage is complete ferrara has proposed a number of redevelopments for orphanage itself and its surroundings in 2004 he proposed a plan to redevelop lot and building into 63 residential units proposed redevelopment was known as glebe gardens ferrara planned construction of gardens and pools on vacant grounds but front of complex would face no development although development application was approved by city council plans were dropped because costs to redevelop lot were too great in 2009 work began to revamp orphanage and convert it into a retirement village with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage he also stated that he was going to fix up orphanage once proposed townhouses were under construction in 2012 ferrara proposed a new project to build 76 units and homes in seven stages these stages would have spanned three to four years ferrara undertook a joint venture with peter madew who was to assist with funding and management needed for construction they also proposed restoration efforts to orphanage which included painting repairing holes in walls and replacing windows they also planned to restore front garden commence general landscaping construct a recreation area and build a number of units in orphanage itself an indoor swimming pool was proposed for construction in courtyard however madew claimed that restoration of orphanage would cost millions ferrara later announced that he would not go ahead with redevelopment but instead lodge a new plan this plan would foresee construction of 18 new dwellings on lot this was objected to by council should building remain in its current deteriorating state ferrara responded by stating he would commit funds from his profits towards building s restoration at a cost of least 1 5 million in late 2013 ferrara proposed another development on lot which would see construction of 15 residential units however goulburn mulwaree council has demanded that ferrara must schedule repairs to orphanage before any approval can be granted in response pledged to spend 250 000 on restoration works covering guttering and roof repairs as well as window replacements and external painting in november 2015 a fire believed to have been left unattended by squatters ignited roof just before 4 00p m it took approximately six hours to extinguish fire

has stated that he will try to preserve building and estimates damage costs at 4 million to 5 million in 2016 another fire occurred in a building at rear of main structure causing extensive damage building which was revealed to be old hall built in 1932 was deemed not salvageable it was subsequently scheduled for demolition following fire council ordered ferrara to secure both site and loose
