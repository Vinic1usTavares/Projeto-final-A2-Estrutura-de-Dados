eta carinae e carinae abbreviated to e car formerly known as eta argus is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity greater than five million times that of sun located around 7 500 light years 2 300 parsecs distant in constellation carina previously a 4th magnitude star it brightened in 1837 to become brighter than rigel marking start of great eruption eta carinae became second brightest star in sky between 11 and 14 march 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility after 1856 in a smaller eruption it reached 6th magnitude in 1892 before fading again it has brightened consistently since about 1940 becoming brighter than magnitude 4 5 by 2014 eta carinae is circumpolar from latitudes south of latitude 30degs and it is never visible north of about latitude 30degn two main stars of eta carinae system have an eccentric orbit with a period of 5 54 years primary is a peculiar star similar to a luminous blue variable lbv that was initially of which it has lost at least already and is expected to explode as a supernova in astronomically near future this is only star known to produce ultraviolet laser emission secondary star is hot and also highly luminous probably of spectral class o around 30 80 times as massive as sun system is heavily obscured by homunculus nebula material ejected from primary during great eruption it is a member of trumpler 16 open cluster within much larger carina nebula although unrelated to star and nebula weak eta carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to eta carinae observational history discovery and naming there is no reliable evidence of eta carinae being observed or recorded before 17th century although dutch navigator pieter keyser described a fourth magnitude star at approximately correct position around 1595 1596 which was copied onto celestial globes of petrus plancius and jodocus hondius and 1603 uranometria of johann bayer frederick de houtman s independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include eta carinae among other 4th magnitude stars in region earliest firm record was made by edmond halley in 1677 when he recorded star simply as i e following relative to another star within a new constellation robur carolinum his catalogus australium was published in 1679 star was also known by bayer designations eta caroli eta argus or eta navis in 1751 nicolas louis de lacaille gave stars of argo navis and robur carolinum a single set of greek letter bayer designations within his constellation argo and designated three areas within argo for purposes of using latin letter designations three times over eta fell within keel portion of ship which was later to become constellation carina it was not generally known as eta carinae until 1879 when stars of argo navis were finally given epithets of daughter constellations in uranometria argentina of gould upright 1 4 thumb left alt historical visual lightcurve for eta carinae from 1686 to 2015 lightcurve of eta carinae

century together with s carinae l centauri and l eta carinae forms asterism sea and mountain eta carinae has names she from chinese tian she mandarin heaven s altar and foramen it is also known as halley gave an approximate apparent magnitude of 4 at time of discovery which has been calculated as magnitude 3 3 on modern scale handful of possible earlier sightings suggest that eta carinae was not significantly brighter than this for much of 17th century further sporadic observations over next 70 years show that eta carinae was probably around 3rd magnitude or fainter until lacaille reliably recorded it at 2nd magnitude in 1751 it is unclear whether eta carinae varied significantly in brightness over next 50 years there are occasional observations such as william burchell s at 4th magnitude in 1815 but it is uncertain whether these are just re recordings of earlier observations great eruption in 1827 burchell specifically noted eta carinae s unusual brightness at 1st magnitude and was first to suspect that it varied in brightness john herschel who was in south africa at time made a detailed series of accurate measurements in 1830s showing that eta carinae consistently shone around magnitude 1 4 until november 1837 on evening of december 16 1837 herschel was astonished to see that it had brightened to slightly outshine rigel this event marked beginning of a roughly 18 year period known as great eruption eta carinae was brighter still on january 2 1838 equivalent to alpha centauri before fading slightly over following three months herschel did not observe star after this but received correspondence from reverend w s mackay in calcutta who wrote in 1843 to my great surprise i observed this march last 1843 that star eta argus had become a star of first magnitude fully as bright as canopus and in colour and size very like arcturus observations at cape of good hope indicated it peaked in brightness surpassing canopus over march 11 to 14 1843 before beginning to fade then brightened to between brightness of alpha centauri and canopus between march 24 and 28 before fading once again for much of 1844 brightness was midway between alpha centauri and beta centauri around magnitude 0 2 before brightening again at end of year at its brightest in 1843 it likely reached an apparent magnitude of 0 8 then 1 0 in 1845 peaks in 1827 1838 and 1843 are likely to have occurred at periastron passage point two stars are closest together of binary orbit from 1845 to 1856 brightness decreased by around 0 1 magnitudes per year but with possible

canopus or more accurately gala gala gurrk waa with onset of gurrk woman lost in in 2010 astronomers duane and david frew from macquarie university in sydney showed that this was eta carinae during its great eruption in 1840s from 1857 brightness decreased rapidly until it faded below naked eye visibility by 1886 this has been calculated to be due to condensation of dust in ejected material surrounding star rather than an intrinsic change in luminosity lesser eruption a new brightening started in 1887 peaked at about magnitude 6 2 in 1892 then at end of march 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude 7 5 although there are only visual records of 1890 eruption it has been calculated that eta carinae was suffering 4 3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to gas and dust ejected in great eruption an unobscured brightness would have been magnitude 1 5 1 9 significantly brighter than historical magnitude this appeared to be a smaller copy of great eruption expelling much less material twentieth century between 1900 and at least 1940 eta carinae appeared to have settled at a constant brightness at around magnitude 7 6 but in 1953 it was noted to have brightened again to magnitude 6 5 brightening continued steadily but with fairly regular variations of a few tenths of a magnitude thumb right upright 1 2 light curve for eta carinae between 1972 and 2019 in 1996 variations were first identified as having a 5 52 year period later measured more accurately at 5 54 years leading to idea of a binary system binary theory was confirmed by observations of radio optical and near infrared radial velocity and line profile changes referred to collectively as a spectroscopic event at predicted time of periastron passage in late 1997 and early 1998 at same time there was a complete collapse of x ray emission presumed to originate in a colliding wind zone confirmation of a luminous binary companion greatly modified understanding of physical properties of eta carinae system and its variability a sudden doubling of brightness was observed in 1998 99 bringing it back to naked eye visibility during 2014 spectroscopic event apparent visual magnitude became brighter than magnitude 4 5 brightness does not always vary consistently at different wavelengths and does not always exactly follow 5 5 year cycle radio infrared and space based observations have expanded coverage of eta carinae across all wavelengths and revealed ongoing changes in spectral energy distribution in july 2018 eta carinae was reported to have strongest colliding wind shock in solar neighbourhood observations with nustar satellite gave much higher resolution data than earlier fermi gamma ray space telescope using direct focussing observations of non thermal source in extremely hard x ray band that is spatially coincident with star they showed that source of non thermal x rays varies with orbital phase of binary star system and that photon index of emission is similar to

carinae and carina nebula in constellation of carina as a 4th magnitude star eta carinae is comfortably visible to naked eye in all but most light polluted skies in inner city areas according to scale its brightness has varied over a wide range from second brightest star in sky at one point in 19th century to well below naked eye visibility its location at around 60degs in far southern celestial hemisphere means it cannot be seen by observers in europe and much of north america located between canopus and southern cross eta carinae is easily pinpointed as brightest star within large naked eye

image of homunculus nebula hubble composite of eta carinae showing unusual emission spectrum near ir image spectrum from hst stis ccd strength and profile of lines in eta carinae spectrum are highly variable but there are a number of consistent distinctive features spectrum is dominated by emission lines usually broad although higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense ionised nebulosity especially weigelt blobs most lines show a p cygni profile but with absorption wing much weaker than emission broad p cygni lines are typical of strong stellar winds with very weak absorption in this case because central star is so heavily obscured electron scattering wings are present but relatively weak indicating a wind hydrogen lines are present and strong showing that eta carinae still retains much of its hydrogen envelope hei lines are much weaker than hydrogen lines and absence of lines provides an upper limit to possible temperature of primary star nii lines can be identified but are not strong while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak indicating core hydrogen burning via cno cycle with some mixing to surface perhaps most striking feature is rich feii emission in both permitted and forbidden lines with forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around star earliest analyses of star s spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869 of prominent emission lines c d b f and principal green nitrogen line absorption lines are explicitly described as not being visible letters refer to fraunhofer s spectral notation and correspond to ha hei d usually refers to sodium doublet but d or d3 was used for nearby helium line feii and hb it is assumed that final line is from feii very close to green line now known to be from photographic spectra from 1893 were described as similar to an f5 star but with a few weak emission lines analysis to modern spectral standards suggests an early f spectral type by 1895 spectrum again consisted mostly of strong emission lines with absorption lines present but largely obscured by emission this spectral transition from f supergiant to strong emission is characteristic of novae where ejected material initially radiates like a pseudo photosphere and then emission spectrum develops as it expands and thins emission line spectrum associated with dense stellar winds has persisted ever since late 19th century individual lines show widely varying widths profiles and doppler shifts often multiple velocity components within same line spectral lines also show variation over time most strongly with a 5 5 year period but also less dramatic changes over shorter and longer periods as well as ongoing secular development of entire spectrum spectrum of light reflected from weigelt blobs and assumed to originate mainly with primary is similar to extreme p cygni type star hde which has a spectral type of direct spectral observations did not begin until after great eruption but light echoes from eruption reflected from other parts of carina nebula were detected using u s national optical astronomy observatory s blanco 4 meter telescope at cerro inter american observatory analysis of reflected spectra indicated light was emitted when eta carinae had appearance of a 5 000 k g2 to g5 supergiant some 2 000 k cooler than expected from other supernova impostor events further light echo observations show that following peak brightness of great eruption spectrum developed prominent p cygni profiles and cn molecular bands although this is likely from material being ejected which may have been colliding with circumstellar material in a similar way to a type iin supernova in second half of 20th century much higher resolution visual spectra became available spectrum continued to show complex and baffling features with much of energy from central star being recycled into infrared by surrounding dust some reflection of light from star from dense localised objects in circumstellar material but with obvious high ionisation features indicative of very high temperatures line profiles are complex and variable indicating a number of absorption and emission features at various velocities relative to central star 5 5 year orbital cycle produces strong spectral changes at periastron that are known as spectroscopic events certain wavelengths of radiation suffer eclipses either due to actual occultation by one of stars or due to passage within opaque portions of complex stellar winds despite being ascribed to orbital rotation these events vary significantly from cycle to cycle these changes have become stronger since 2003 and it is generally believed that long term secular changes in stellar winds or previously ejected material may be culmination of a return to state of star before its great eruption ultraviolet thumb ultraviolet image of homunculus nebula taken by hubble ultraviolet spectrum of eta carinae system shows many emission lines of ionised metals such as feii and as well as lya and a continuum from a hot central source ionisation levels and continuum require existence of a source with a temperature at least 37 000 k certain feii uv lines are unusually strong these originate in weigelt blobs and are caused by a low gain lasing effect ionised hydrogen between a blob and central star generates intense lya emission which penetrates blob blob contains atomic hydrogen with a small admixture of other elements including iron photo ionised by radiation from central stars an accidental resonance where emission coincidentally has a suitable energy to pump excited state allows lya emission to pump fe ions to certain pseudo metastable states creating a population inversion that allows stimulated emission to take place this effect is similar to maser emission from dense pockets surrounding many cool supergiant stars but latter effect is much weaker at optical and uv wavelengths and eta carinae is only clear instance detected of an ultraviolet astrophysical laser a similar effect from pumping of metastable oi states by emission has also been confirmed as an astrophysical uv laser infrared thumb upright 1 2 alt array of images of ten stars similar to eta carinae in nearby galaxies stars similar to eta carinae in nearby galaxies infrared observations of eta carinae have become increasingly important vast majority of electromagnetic radiation from central stars is absorbed by surrounding dust then emitted as mid and far infrared appropriate to temperature of dust this allows almost entire energy output of system to be observed at wavelengths that are not strongly affected by interstellar extinction leading to estimates of luminosity that are more accurate than for other extremely luminous stars eta carinae is brightest source in night sky at mid infrared wavelengths far infrared observations show a large mass of dust at 100 150 k suggesting a total mass for homunculus of 20 solar masses or more this is much larger than previous estimates and is all thought to have been ejected in a few years during great eruption near infrared

2009 and 2014 have been intensively observed highest energy gamma rays above 100 mev detected by agile show strong variability while lower energy gamma rays observed by fermi show little variability radio emission radio emissions have been observed from eta carinae across microwave band it has been detected in 21 cm hi line but has been particularly closely studied in millimetre and centimetre bands hydrogen recombination lines from combining of an electron and proton to form a hydrogen atom have been detected in this range emission is concentrated in a small non point source less than 4

distribution over a 5 5 year cycle hii and recombination lines vary very strongly with continuum emission electromagnetic radiation across a broad band of wavelengths less affected this shows a dramatic reduction in ionisation level of hydrogen for a short period in each cycle coinciding with spectroscopic events at other wavelengths surroundings right upright 1 75 thumb alt a 50 light year

is known to be at same distance as carina nebula and its spectrum can be seen reflected off various star clouds in nebula appearance of carina nebula and particularly of keyhole region has changed significantly since it was described by john herschel over years ago this is thought to be due to reduction in ionising radiation from eta carinae since great eruption prior to great eruption eta

rear on either side of an actual image a 3d model of homunculus nebula eta carinae is enclosed by and lights up homunculus nebula a small emission and reflection nebula composed mainly of gas ejected during great eruption event in mid 19th century as well as dust that condensed from debris nebula consists of two polar lobes aligned with rotation axis of star plus an equatorial skirt whole being around long closer studies show many fine details a little homunculus within main nebula probably formed by 1890 eruption a jet fine streams and knots of material especially noticeable in skirt region and three weigelt blobs dense gas condensations very close to star itself lobes of homunculus are considered to be formed almost entirely due to initial eruption rather than shaped by or including previously ejected or interstellar material although scarcity of material near equatorial plane allows some later stellar wind and ejected material to mix therefore mass of lobes gives an accurate measure of scale of great eruption with estimates ranging from up to as high as results show that material from great eruption is strongly concentrated towards poles 75 of mass and 90 of kinetic energy were released above latitude 45deg a unique feature of homunculus is ability to measure spectrum of central object at different latitudes by reflected spectrum from different portions of lobes these clearly show a polar wind where stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards poles in contrast spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to equatorial plane by implication outer envelope of eta carinae a is not strongly convective as that would prevent gravity darkening current axis of rotation of star does not appear to exactly match alignment of homunculus this may be due to interaction with eta carinae b which also modifies observed stellar winds distance distance to eta carinae has been determined by several different methods resulting in a widely accepted value of 2 300 parsecs 7 800 light years with a margin of error around 100 parsecs 330 light years distance to eta carinae itself cannot be measured using parallax due to its surrounding nebulosity but other stars in trumpler 16 cluster are expected to be at a similar distance and are accessible to parallax gaia data release 2 has provided parallax for many stars considered to be members of trumpler 16 finding that four hottest o class stars in region have very similar parallaxes with a mean value of 0 383 0 017 milli arcseconds mas which translates to a distance of 2 600 100 parsecs this implies that eta carinae may be more distant than previously thought and also more luminous although it is still possible that it is not at same distance as cluster or that parallax measurements have large systematic errors distances to star clusters can be estimated by using a russell diagram or colour colour diagram to calibrate absolute magnitudes of stars for example fitting main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch and hence their distance from earth it is also necessary to know amount of interstellar extinction to cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as carina nebula a distance of 7 330 light years 2 250 parsecs has been determined from calibration of o type star luminosities in trumpler 16 after determining an abnormal reddening correction to extinction distance to both trumpler 14 and trumpler 16 has been measured at 9 500 1000 light years 2 900 300 parsecs known expansion rate of homunculus nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance assuming that two lobes of nebula are symmetrical projection of nebula onto sky depends on its distance values of 2 300 2 250 and 2 300 parsecs have been derived for homunculus and eta carinae is clearly at same distance properties thumb upright 1 6 alt eta carinae star system 3 views side by side x ray optical and infrared images of eta carinae august 26 2014 eta carinae star system is currently one of most massive that can be studied in great detail until recently eta carinae was thought to be most massive single star but system s binary nature was proposed by brazilian astronomer augusto in 1996 and confirmed in 2005 both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from eta carinae a and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred rapid changes to stellar wind in 21st century suggest that star itself may be revealed as dust from great eruption finally clears orbit upright 1 6 left thumb alt eta carinae b orbits in large ellipse and eta carinae a in a smaller elliptical orbit eta carinae orbit binary nature of eta carinae is clearly established although components have not been directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re excitation in surrounding nebulosity periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations prompted search for a companion and modelling of colliding winds and partial eclipses of some spectroscopic features have constrained possible orbits period of orbit is accurately known at 5 539 years although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion period between great eruption and smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5 52 years while before great eruption it may have been lower still possibly between 4 8 and 5 4 years orbital separation is only known approximately with a semi major axis of 15 16 au orbit is highly eccentric e 0 9 this means that separation of stars varies from around 1 6 au similar to distance of mars from sun to 30 au similar to distance of neptune perhaps most valuable use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate masses of stars this requires dimensions and inclination of orbit to be accurately known dimensions of eta carinae s orbit are only known approximately as stars cannot be directly and separately observed inclination has been modelled at 130 145 degrees but orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide masses of two components classification eta carinae a is classified as a luminous blue variable lbv due to distinctive spectral and brightness variations this type of variable star is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity lbvs in quiescent state lie on a narrow s doradus instability strip with more luminous stars being hotter in outburst all lbvs have about same temperature which is near 8 000 k lbvs in a normal outburst are visually brighter than when quiescent although bolometric luminosity is unchanged a great eruption event similar to eta carinae a s has only been observed in one other star in milky way p cygni and in a handful of other possible lbvs in external galaxies none of them seem to be quite as violent as eta carinae s it is unclear if this is something that only a very few of most massive lbvs undergo something that is caused by a close companion star or a very brief but common phase for massive stars some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors although this grouping may also include other types of non terminal transients that approach brightness of a supernova eta carinae a is not a typical lbv it is more luminous than any other lbv in milky way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies it does not currently lie on s doradus instability strip although it is unclear what temperature or spectral type of underlying star actually is and during its great eruption it was much cooler than a typical lbv outburst with a mid g spectral type 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of lbv eruptions with an early f spectral type and it has been estimated that star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo photosphere with a temperature of 9 000 k 10 000 k eta carinae b is a massive luminous hot star about which little else is known from certain high excitation spectral lines that ought not to be produced by primary eta carinae b is thought to be a young o type star most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant although a wolf rayet star cannot be ruled out mass masses of stars are difficult to measure except by determination of a binary orbit eta carinae is a binary system but certain key information about orbit is not known accurately mass can be strongly constrained to be greater than due to high luminosity standard models of system assume masses of and for primary and secondary respectively higher masses have been suggested to model energy output and mass transfer of great eruption with a combined system mass of over before great eruption eta carinae a has clearly lost a great deal of mass since it formed and it is expected that it was initially although it may have formed through binary merger masses of for primary and for secondary best fit one mass transfer model of great eruption event mass loss thumb left upright 1 4 alt carina nebula carina nebula eta carinae is brightest star on left side mass loss is one of most intensively studied aspects of massive star research put simply observed mass loss rates in best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce observed properties of evolved massive stars such as wolf number and types of core collapse supernovae or their progenitors to match those observations models require much higher mass loss rates eta carinae a has one of highest known mass loss rates currently around year and is an obvious candidate for study eta carinae a is losing a lot of mass due to its extreme luminosity and relatively low surface gravity its stellar wind is entirely opaque and appears as a pseudo photosphere this optically dense surface hides true physical surface of star during great eruption mass loss rate was a thousand times higher around year sustained for ten years or more total mass loss during eruption was at least with much of it now forming homunculus nebula smaller 1890 eruption produced little homunculus nebula much smaller and only about bulk of mass loss occurs in a wind with a terminal velocity of about 420 km s but some material is seen at higher velocities up to 3 200 km s possibly material blown from accretion disk by secondary star eta carinae b is presumably also losing mass via a thin fast stellar wind but this cannot be detected directly models of radiation observed from interactions between winds of two stars show a mass loss rate of order of year at speeds of 3 000 km s typical of a hot o class star for a portion of highly eccentric orbit it may actually gain material from primary via an accretion disk during great eruption of primary secondary could have accreted producing strong jets which formed bipolar shape of homunculus nebula luminosity stars of eta carinae system are completely obscured by dust and opaque stellar winds with much of ultraviolet and visual radiation shifted to infrared total electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths for both stars combined is several million solar luminosities best estimate for luminosity of primary is making it one of most luminous stars in galaxy luminosity of eta carinae b is particularly uncertain probably and almost certainly no more than most notable feature of eta carinae is its giant eruption or supernova impostor event which originated in primary star and was observed around 1843 in a few years it produced almost as much visible light as a faint supernova explosion but star survived it is estimated that at peak brightness luminosity was as high as other supernova impostors have been seen in other galaxies for example possible false supernova sn 1961v in ngc 1058 and sn 2006jc s pre explosion outburst in ugc 4904 following great eruption eta carinae became self obscured by ejected material resulting in dramatic reddening this has been estimated at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths meaning post eruption luminosity was comparable to luminosity when first identified eta carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths despite presumed hot stars behind nebulosity recent visual brightening is considered to be largely caused by a decrease in extinction due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss rather than an underlying change in luminosity temperature thumb left upright 1 2 alt homunculus nebula on left and a zoomed in infrared image on right hst image of homunculus nebula inset is a vlt naco infrared image of eta carinae until late in 20th century temperature of eta carinae was assumed to be over 30 000 k because of presence of high excitation spectral lines but other aspects of spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this it is now known that eta carinae system consists of at least two stars both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind wind wind collision or wwc zone embedded within a dusty nebula that 90 of electromagnetic radiation into mid and far infrared all of these features have different temperatures powerful stellar winds from two stars collide in a roughly conical wwc zone and produce temperatures as high as at apex between two stars this zone is source of hard x rays and gamma rays close to stars near periastron as secondary ploughs through ever denser regions of primary wind colliding wind zone becomes distorted into a spiral trailing behind eta carinae b wind wind collision cone separates winds of two stars for 55 75deg behind secondary there is a thin hot wind typical of o or wolf rayet stars this allows some radiation from eta carinae b to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that are unlikely to be produced by any other source although secondary star has never been directly observed there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37 000 k and 41 000 k in all other directions on other side of wind wind collision zone there is wind from eta carinae a cooler and around 100 times denser than eta carinae b s wind it is also optically dense completely obscuring anything resembling a true photosphere and rendering any definition of its temperature moot observable radiation originates from a pseudo photosphere where optical density of wind drops to near zero typically measured at a particular rossland opacity value such as this pseudo photosphere is observed to be elongated and hotter along presumed axis of rotation eta carinae a is likely to have appeared as an early b hypergiant with a temperature of between 20 000 k and 25 000 k at time of its discovery by halley an effective temperature determined for surface of a spherical optically thick wind at would be 9 400 15 000 k while temperature of a theoretical hydrostatic core at optical depth 150 would be 35 200 k effective temperature of visible outer edge of opaque primary wind is generally treated as being 15 000 k 25 000 k on basis of visual and ultraviolet spectral features assumed to be directly from wind or reflected via weigelt blobs during great eruption eta carinae a was much cooler at around 5 000 k homunculus contains dust at temperatures varying from 150 k to 400 k this is source of almost all infrared radiation that makes eta carinae such a bright object at those wavelengths further out expanding gases from great eruption collide with interstellar material and are heated to around producing less energetic x rays seen in a horseshoe or ring shape size size of two main stars in eta carinae system is difficult to determine precisely because neither star can be seen directly eta carinae b is likely to have a well defined photosphere and its radius can be estimated from assumed type of star an o supergiant of with a temperature of 37 200 k has an effective radius of size of eta carinae a is not even well defined it has an optically dense stellar wind so typical definition of a star s surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be one study calculated a radius of for a hot core of 35 000 k at optical depth 150 near sonic point or very approximately what might be called a physical surface at optical depth 0 67 radius would be indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind at peak of great eruption radius so far as such a thing is meaningful during such a violent expulsion of material would have been around comparable to largest known stars including vy canis majoris stellar sizes should be compared with their orbital separation which is only around at periastron accretion radius of secondary is around suggesting strong accretion near periastron leading to a collapse of secondary wind it has been proposed that initial brightening from 4th magnitude to 1st at relatively constant bolometric luminosity was a normal lbv outburst albeit from an extreme example of class then companion star passing through expanded photosphere of primary at periastron triggered further brightening increase in luminosity and extreme mass loss of great eruption rotation rotation rates of massive stars have a critical influence on their evolution and eventual death rotation rate of eta carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds but there are hints that both eta carinae a and b are fast up to 90 of critical velocity one or both could have been spun up by binary interaction for example accretion onto secondary and orbital dragging on primary eruptions thumb upright 1 2 right alt eta carinae hubble space telescope image showing bipolar homunculus nebula which surrounds eta carinae two eruptions have been observed from eta carinae great eruption of mid 19th century and lesser eruption of 1890 in addition studies of outlying nebulosity suggest at least one earlier eruption around ad 1250 a further eruption may have occurred around ad 1550 although it is possible that material indicating this eruption is actually from great eruption slowed down by colliding with older nebulosity mechanism producing these eruptions is unknown it is not even clear whether eruptions involve explosive events or so called super eddington winds an extreme form of stellar wind involving very high mass loss induced by an increase in luminosity of star energy source for explosions or luminosity increase is also unknown theories about various eruptions must account for repeating events at least three eruptions of various sizes ejecting or more without destroying star highly unusual shape and expansion rates of ejected material and light curve during eruptions involving a brightness increases of several magnitudes over a period of decades best studied event is great eruption as well as photometry during 19th century light echoes observed in 21st century give further information about progression of eruption showing a brightening with multiple peaks for approximately 20 years followed by a plateau period in 1850s light echoes show that outflow of material during plateau phase was much higher than before peak of eruption possible explanations for eruptions include a binary merger in what was then a triple system mass transfer from eta carinae b during periastron passages or a pair instability explosion evolution upright 1 4 left thumb alt multicolour graph from 1987 to 2015 showing a gradual increase from 1994 recent lightcurve of eta carinae with observations at standard wavelengths marked eta carinae is a unique object with no very close analogues currently known in any galaxy therefore its future evolution is highly uncertain but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova eta carinae a would have begun life as an extremely hot star on main sequence already a highly luminous object over exact properties would depend on initial mass which is expected to have been at least and possibly much higher a typical spectrum when first formed would be and star would be mostly or fully convective due to cno cycle fusion at very high core temperatures sufficiently massive or differentially rotating stars undergo such strong mixing that they remain chemically homogeneous during core hydrogen burning as core hydrogen burning progresses a very massive star would slowly expand and become more luminous becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an lbv while still fusing hydrogen in core when hydrogen at core is depleted after 2 2 5 million years hydrogen shell burning continues with further increases in size and luminosity although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since entire star would become depleted of hydrogen in late stages of hydrogen burning mass loss is extremely high due to high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen as hydrogen burning ends and core helium burning begins massive stars transition very rapidly to wolf rayet stage with little or no hydrogen increased temperatures and decreased luminosity they are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point it is unclear whether triple alpha helium fusion has started at core of eta carinae a elemental abundances at surface cannot be accurately measured but ejecta within homunculus are around 60 hydrogen and 40 helium with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels this is indicative of ongoing cno cycle hydrogen fusion models of evolution and death of single very massive stars predict an increase in temperature during helium core burning with outer layers of star being lost it becomes a wolf rayet star on nitrogen sequence moving from to as more of outer layers are lost possibly reaching wc or wo spectral class as carbon and oxygen from triple alpha process reach surface this process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops at which point core collapses and star is destroyed subtle differences in initial conditions in models themselves and most especially in rates of mass loss produce different predictions for final state of most massive stars they may survive to become a helium stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers lack of sufficiently luminous wn stars and discovery of apparent lbv supernova progenitors has also prompted suggestion that certain types of lbvs explode as a supernova without evolving further eta carinae is a close binary and this complicates evolution of both stars compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly than would occur in a single star so properties at core collapse can be very different in some scenarios secondary can accrue significant mass accelerating its evolution and in turn be stripped by now compact wolf rayet primary in case of eta carinae secondary is clearly causing additional instability in primary making it difficult to predict future developments potential supernova upright 1 6 thumb alt regions on two dimensional chart show what kind of supernovae or white dwarfs result from different stars supernovae types depending on initial mass and metallicity overwhelming probability is that next supernova observed in milky way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant very likely not even visible to naked eye nevertheless prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme nearby and well studied as eta carinae arouses great interest as a single star a star originally around 150 times as massive as sun would typically reach core collapse as a wolf rayet star within 3 million years at low metallicity many massive stars will collapse directly to a black hole with no visible explosion or a sub luminous supernova and a small fraction will produce a pair instability supernova but at solar metallicity and above there is expected to be sufficient mass loss before collapse to allow a visible supernova of type ib or ic if there is still a large amount of expelled material close to star shock formed by supernova explosion impacting circumstellar material can efficiently convert kinetic energy to radiation resulting in a superluminous supernova slsn or hypernova several times more luminous than a typical core collapse supernova and much longer lasting highly massive progenitors may also eject sufficient nickel to cause a slsn simply from radioactive decay resulting remnant would be a black hole since it is highly unlikely such a massive star could ever lose sufficient mass for its core not to exceed limit for a neutron star existence of a massive companion brings many other possibilities if eta carinae a was rapidly stripped of its outer layers it might be a less massive wc or wo type star when core collapse was reached this would result in a type ib or type ic supernova due to lack of hydrogen and possibly helium this supernova type is thought to be originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars several unusual supernovae and impostors have been compared to eta carinae as examples of its possible fate one of most compelling is sn a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to eta carinae s great eruption then an even brighter outburst in 2012 which is likely to have been a true supernova sn 2006jc some 77 million light years away in ugc 4904 in constellation lynx also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004 followed by a magnitude 13 8 type ib supernova first seen on 9 october 2006 eta carinae has also been compared to other possible supernova impostors such as sn 1961v and and to superluminous supernovae such as sn possible effects on earth thumb upright 1 1 right alt shells of progressive element burning hydrogen helium carbon oxygen nitrogen silicon magnesium neon and iron followed by collapse with gamma ray burst jets developing from poles one theory of eta carinae s ultimate fate is collapsing to form a black hole energy released as jets along axis of rotation forms gamma ray bursts a typical core collapse supernova at distance of eta carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around 4 similar to venus a slsn could be five magnitudes brighter potentially brightest supernova in recorded history currently sn 1006 at 7 500 light years from star it is unlikely to directly affect terrestrial lifeforms as they will be protected from gamma rays by atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by magnetosphere main damage would be restricted to upper atmosphere ozone layer spacecraft including satellites and any astronauts in space at least one paper has projected that complete loss of earth s ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova which would result in a significant increase in uv radiation reaching earth s surface from sun this would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light years from earth and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than eta carinae another analysis of possible impact discusses more subtle effects from unusual illumination such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression it concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than eta carinae to have any type of major impact on earth eta carinae is not expected to produce a gamma ray burst and its axis is not currently aimed near earth a gamma ray burst in any case would need to be within a few light years of earth to have significant effects earth s atmosphere protects its inhabitants from all radiation apart from uv light it is opaque to gamma rays which have to be observed using space telescopes main effect would result from damage to ozone layer eta carinae is too far away to do that even if it did produce a gamma ray burst notes references external links goddard media studios nasa missions take
