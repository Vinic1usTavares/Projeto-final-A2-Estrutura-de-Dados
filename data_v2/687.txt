soft parade is fourth studio album by american rock band doors released on july 18 1969 by elektra records most of album was recorded following a grueling tour during which band was left with little time to compose new material producer paul a rothchild recommended a total departure from doors first three albums develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by paul harris lead singer jim morrison who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry was less involved in songwriting process leaving guitarist robby krieger to increase his own creative output album peaked at number six on billboard 200 but it failed to retain audiences in uk and other european countries that their previous album waiting for sun had succeeded in engaging three preceding singles touch me wishful sinful and tell all people were included on soft parade with former becoming another top 10 hit for doors another single runnin blue also followed album s distribution upon release soft parade was denounced by both music critics and band s underground music scene followers who viewed album as doors trending into popular music over time historians have reassessed album and its critical standing has slightly improved but it is still widely considered group s weakest effort with morrison background by mid 1968 doors had established themselves as one of most popular groups in us band s third studio album waiting for sun released in july of same year became doors only number one hit on billboard 200 while also spawning their second single to peak at number one with hello i love you album was first commercial breakthrough for band in uk reaching number 16 on uk albums chart after release of waiting for sun doors commanded vast sums of money to perform before large crowds in arenas such as l a forum hollywood bowl and madison square garden additionally local los angeles top 40 radio stations particularly khj radio which had previously refused to play band s records began sponsoring doors live performances initial sessions for album occurred on 26 july 1968 when band recorded wild child and wishful sinful easy ride was a waiting for sun leftover captured on 3 march 1968 on september 2 1968 group played dates in europe along with jefferson airplane before ending their long grueling touring schedule with nine concerts back in us while 1968 tours managed to capitalize on chart success of waiting for sun it also left little time for doors to compose new songs for soft parade having already exhausted all material from morrison s songbooks morrison a self professed acid evangelist of rock had been fascinated with public media outlets and frequently coined buzzwords and phrases to generate attention for doors band s rise to stardom and publications drawing morrison as a sex symbol however drastically modified his outlook on pop culture throughout 1968 morrison s behavior became increasingly erratic he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions poetry and film making at time morrison was also struggling with anxiety and felt like he was on brink of a nervous breakdown he considered quitting doors but was persuaded by keyboardist ray manzarek to finish recording soft parade before making such a decision in november 1968 band entered newly established studio elektra sound west on la cienega boulevard to continue work on soft parade a process that was not complete until early 1969 without any album ready material to work with record producer paul a rothchild took control of recording sessions and insisted on numerous retakes of songs much to group s indignation it was like pulling teeth to get jim into it sound engineer bruce botnick recalled it was bizarre hardest i ever worked as a producer rothchild who by this time was addicted to cocaine and incredibly strict in his leadership caused severe strife in studio especially with his advisor jac holzman who argued drive for perfection was grinding them doors into ground album was by far most expensive by group costing us 80 000 to create in contrast to us 10 000 required for their debut music doors wanted to capitalize on experimental climate in popular music at time that brought about groundbreaking works like beatles white album and jimi hendrix s electric ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within rock medium looking for a new creative sound rothchild hired paul harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for los angeles philharmonic and local jazz horn players session musicians doug lubahn and harvey brooks also served as additional bass guitarists music on soft parade incorporated art rock blues rock jazz fusion and psychedelic rock styles drummer john densmore and manzarek who both had jazz backgrounds asserted they were receptive to rothchild s jazz concept we d densmore and manzarek always talk about using some jazz musicians let s put some horns and strings on man let s see what it would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section recalled manzarek although morrison was less involved in doors studio sessions at this point he demanded band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing krieger s lyric can t you see me growing get your guns on track tell all people as a result soft parade was first doors album to list band members separately rather than collectively as songs by doors krieger continued to hone his songwriting skills to fill void left by morrison s absence he wrote half of album s tracks while morrison is credited with other half they share co credits on do it ultimately creating an album that lacks unified musical stance found on doors early works krieger s songs written almost independently from rest of band most noticeably incorporated jazz influences that had been a part of prevailing trend of popular rock music only his tracks tell all people touch me runnin blue and wishful sinful were written to include string and horn arrangements morrison though not totally opposed to concept declined to go in direction densmore and manzarek championed touch me penned under working titles hit me and i m gonna love you was chosen as first single taken from soft parade becoming one of doors biggest hits band brought in saxophone player curtis amy to perform a solo instrumental on song which was influenced by works of john coltrane morrison s shaman s blues and title track were both examples of his penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights latter song a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a doors album was penned with help of rothchild who organized pieces of morrison s poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually introduced with a mock fiery sermon by morrison soft parade displays his southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher song s ambiance is heightened by striking imagery which outlines a need for sanctuary escape and pleasure critic doug noted that soft parade with its display of acid rock and sunshine pop influences is more diverse than any other morrison composition release and reception soft parade was released on july 18 1969 it peaked at number six on billboard 200 during a chart stay of 28 weeks but fared poorly in uk where album failed to reach charts album s front cover photograph was taken by joel brodsky who had also been responsible for cover of doors debut album and strange days three singles had already been released prior to album s distribution much more than usual for a doors album touch me single was released in december 1968 and became one of band s biggest hits reaching number three on billboard hot 100 two additional singles wishful sinful and tell all people were also distributed but fared less favorably peaking at numbers 44 and 57 respectively following release of soft parade doors earned another minor hit with runnin blue single charting at number 64 upon its release in august 1969 although album was a success at establishing doors in pop market it was rejected by group s original audience and underground scene particularly for album s use of horns and strings underground press was less than complimentary with david writing in new york s east village other stating album was badly messed up by syrupy arrangement of paul rothchild and could be renamed rothchild strings play doors another scathing review by miller francis jr of great speckled bird expressed disdain for doors attempt at art rock feeling soft parade comes on so pretentious like something written rather than something sung rob cline of northwest passage questioned why a band like doors needed to record with violins and trombones when group was best when getting it on straight and hard as witness to their first two albums in rolling stone alec dubro found much of songs to be pale shadows of their earlier works reviewing for village voice in january 1970 robert christgau wrote no one even thinks about doors any more such is fame but this is an acceptable record with predictable pretensions and two or three first rate songs touch me wild child nothing to get excited about either way writer richard riegel evaluated immediate impact of soft parade on doors reputation in magazine creem in 1981 if waiting for sun set a lot of older hippies to questioning their former perceptions of doors as avatars of avant garde then soft parade finished off their interest in group in a review for allmusic richie unterberger was slightly more positive writing that about half record is quite good especially huge hit touch me their most successful integration of orchestration however unterberger felt it is weakest studio album recorded with jim morrison as well as their weakest set of material low lights including filler like do it and runnin blue writer james riordan opined that compared to prior albums morrison s contributions to soft parade were lackluster putting his credibility as a serious poet and songwriter on line author danny in no one here gets out alive wrote overall lyric impact was less than it had been on previous albums horns by some of top local studio jazz musicians further blurred once lucid doors sound a notable exception in reviewing 40th anniversary remix for august
