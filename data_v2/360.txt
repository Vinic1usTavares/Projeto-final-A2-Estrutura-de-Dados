service track work cfm history thumb left ronald reagan washington national airport station planning for metro began with mass transportation survey in 1955 which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet needs of 1980 schrag at p 33 38 in 1959 study s final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown washington schrag at p 39 because plan called for extensive freeway construction within district of columbia alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through july 1 1962 schrag at p 42 national capital transportation agency s 1962 transportation in national capital region report anticipated much of present blue line route in virginia with route following railroad right of way inside arlington and alexandria to springfield schrag at p 55 it did not include a route in prince george s county route continued in rapid transit plans until formation of wmata with formation of wmata in october 1966 planning of system shifted from federal hands to a regional body with representatives of district maryland and virginia congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration schrag at p 104 instead routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance system schrag at p 108 virginia portion of blue line took much of its present form along richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad right of way to colchester as construction along existing right of way is least expensive way to build into suburbs schrag at p 110 11 a surface level section of blue line that parallels virginia state route 110 where passing arlington national cemetery and traveling between pentagon and rosslyn replaced a section of closed rosslyn connecting railroad a subsidiary of pennsylvania railroad 1 2 1942 map showing rosslyn connecting railroad planned route of virginia state route 110 below railroad pentagon

washington southern railway inside route of old alexandria canal within arlington reservation between potomac river and national cemetery in march 1968 wmata board approved its adopted regional system ars which included blue line from huntington to addison road with a possible extension to largo schrag at p 117 ars contained a blue line orange line station at oklahoma avenue between stadium armory and anacostia river bridge local residents objected to a proposed 1 000 car commuter parking lot at that station and traffic that it would generate in neighborhood in reaction to their lobbying dc government insisted that station be removed and that tunnel for line be extended through neighborhood schrag at p 161 this then made line only one to have a station canceled due to neighborhood opposition to be constructed as an above ground station in parking lot north of rfk stadium near oklahoma avenue station was canceled saving metro 12 million and alignment of line was shifted slightly to east to address neighbor concerns to better accommodate tourists a smithsonian station exit was added on mall and federal government requested in 1972 that arlington cemetery station be added to blue line federal government paid cost of both design changes schrag at p 254 thumb left addison road station service on blue line began on july 1 1977 on 18 stations between national airport in arlington and stadium armory in washington first link of metro to virginia line was extended by three stations to addison road on november 22 1980 service south of national airport began on june 15 1991 when van dorn street opened original plan for line was completed when this link was extended to franconia springfield on june 29 1997 two new stations in maryland morgan boulevard and largo town center opened on december 18 2004 from its opening on november 20 1978 until december 11 1979 orange line was co aligned with blue line from national airport to stadium armory with orange line continuing east from stadium armory to new carrollton beginning december 1 1979 orange line diverged westward from rosslyn to ballston blue and orange lines remain co aligned from rosslyn to stadium armory and silver line is co signed along same route as well thumb farragut west station blue line was originally planned to follow a slightly different route plan would have sent blue line trains to huntington with yellow line trains serving franconia springfield this was changed due to a shortage of rail cars at time of completion of line to huntington because fewer rail cars were required to operate yellow line service than would be required to run blue line service out to huntington due to yellow line s shorter route line designations were switched from 1999 to 2008 blue line operated to huntington on july 4 as part of metro s special independence day service pattern ars had blue line end at addison road however sports fans continually argued for a three mile 5 km extension to capital centre sports arena in largo maryland on february 27 1997 wmata board approved construction of extension by time extension opened in 2004 professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop gallery place station and capital centre was replaced with a shopping mall however extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is within walking distance of fedexfield football stadium extension cost 456 million in 1998 congress changed name of washington national airport to ronald reagan washington national airport with law specifying that no money be spent to implement name change as a result wmata did not change name of national airport station which never included full name of airport in response to repeated inquiries from republican congressmen that station be renamed wmata stated that stations are renamed only at request of local jurisdiction because both arlington county and district of columbia were controlled by democrats name change was blocked not until 2001 did congress make changing station s name a condition of further federal funding schrag at p 258 2002 transportation appropriations act public law 107 87 section 343 statutes at large 115 2001 833 in may 2018 metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across system to accommodate these platform reconstructions blue and yellow lines south of ronald reagan washington national airport would be closed from may to september 2019 in what would be longest line closure in metro s history route thumb left franconia springfield station southwestern

needs 23 six car trains 138 rail cars to run at peak capacity rush plus on june 18 2012 metro initiated its rush service plan which had been under consideration for some time this plan was intended to clear congestion at rosslyn station where blue and orange lines meet and ultimately prepare tracks to accommodate silver line under plan blue line trains continued on usual route but some yellow line trains originated at franconia springfield and were routed over fenwick bridge to greenbelt 1 2 3 during rush hour there were fewer blue line trains on tracks which could mean potentially increased wait times for regular blue line customers furthermore some orange line trains were routed to largo town center until silver line opened in 2014 1 2 future on november 16 1995 wmata and developer of potomac yard area of alexandria virginia signed an agreement to construct a new station between braddock road and national airport that will be financed by developer federal transit administration in cooperation with wmata national park service and city of alexandria government completed an environmental impact statement for project in june 2016 station would be complete by 2021 or 2022 a second improvement project involves building a pedestrian tunnel to interconnect gallery place station with metro center a july 2005 study proposed connecting eastern mezzanine of metro center with western mezzanine of gallery place that are only one block apart proposed connection would reduce number of passengers that use red line to transfer between yellow line and blue and orange lines at metro center as of 2011 project remained unfunded in addition a transportation planning group has proposed an extension of blue line that would reach potomac mills in prince william county stations
