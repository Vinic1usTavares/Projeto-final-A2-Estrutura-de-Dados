observed blood on dance floor is an uptempo jackson song in increasingly hysterical tradition of billie jean and smooth criminal with jackson huffing puffing and yelping through some nonsense about a stabbing over a fairly generic electronic dance track he was not complimentary of b sides that accompanied it stephen thomas erlewine also of allmusic had a negative reaction to record he described blood on dance floor as a bleak reworking of jam and scream music commentator nelson george compared song to material from dangerous such as critically acclaimed tracks jam and dangerous he described it as a pile driving song that explodes from radio speakers george p 48 50 a longtime commentator on jackson s public life j randy taraborrelli gave a retrospective analysis of album in biography magic madness taraborrelli thought that blood on dance floor was one of jackson s best songs a song that us fans don t even know exists taraborrelli p 610 611 in 2005 j t griffith of allmusic believed that in hindsight blood on dance floor was actually a good song he explained it is a second rate mixture of beat it and thriller but jackson s missteps are better than most pop music out there this track showcases all artist s trademarks grunts and funky basslines it is hard to hear blood on dance floor and not want to moonwalk or dance like a ghoul promotion thumb jackson and azur in music
