label used by marvel comics for their one shot comics marvel studios co president louis d esposito later stated that marvel was considering idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future one shots stating there s always a potential to introduce a character we have 8 000 of them and they can t all be at same level so maybe there are some that are not so popular and we introduce them with a short and they take off i could see that happening when asked whether a marvel superhero would ever appear in a one shot d esposito replied that we would love to but it s difficult because there s a cost to that if iron man is flying around doing something that is very costly and first of all what s story is it important that that superhero is in story during agent carter panel at 2013 san diego comic con international d esposito stated that bringing shorts to theaters to appear before features was being considered in may 2014

d esposito hernandez welliver and bradford on item 47 d esposito and atwell for agent carter and pearce and kingsley with all hail king collection was released on december 8 2015 reception cindy white of ign called consultant intriguing and said snappy dialogue seems to fit right in with what we expect from a joss whedon ized avengers movie scott chitwood of comingsoon net said considering a third of this is a rehash of an old bonus scene and other 2 3 is coulson sitting and having a chat this is a pretty big disappointment r l shaffer of ign called a funny thing happened on way to thor s hammer fun zachary scheer of cinema blend said short is as hackneyed as that title it s about four minutes of coulson being a badass if definition of badass is performing needless slow motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider like which donuts to buy andre dellamorte of collider called item 47 silly william bibbiani of crave online said short is largely a success maximiliano hernandez jesse bradford and lizzy caplan are all in fine form although titus welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue particularly in regards to coulson which doesn t entirely sell spencer terry of superhero hype said item 47 is easily best one they ve done and i think that can be attributed to its length seeing as it s three times longer than other one shots with a longer run time short film doesn t have to rush to show us everything that it wants to we get a clear understanding of both s h i e l d perspective of events and robbers point of view andy hunsaker of crave online said agent carter is a fun treat which could lead way for some female led marvel films and if nothing else it gives its title character send off she deserves scott collura of ign said atwell s carter is big screen female superhero we ve all been waiting for she kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb using not just brawn but also brains and it s all very clever and fun rosie fletcher of total film said atwell makes a perfect femme fatale come special agent and this 40s noir style short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments ign s cliff wheatley gave all hail king a 9 4 out of 10 he said that it s a return to loveable personality of hapless trevor and a step forward for larger marvel cinematic universe it has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of trevor slattery but it s approach that pearce takes with material from kung fu movie style credit sequences to light hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn kingsley once again shines in role of slattery aloof and ignorant but more than happy to slide back into mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans pearce does go for some of same jokes from iron man 3 in a sort of referential way but it s nothing too damaging andrew wheeler of comics alliance criticized way homosexuality was presented in short given it was marvel studios first attempt to bring lgbt concepts into mcu potential projects in may 2013 dmg entertainment stated they were considering creating a short film tentatively titled prologue centered on wang xueqi s character dr wu from iron man 3 who only appeared in 10 seconds of film outside of china xueqi appeared in three minutes of chinese release of film prologue would be composed of sequences shot during production of iron man 3 and would elaborate on wu with short set before events of iron man dmg added they were unsure of how they would release short saying rumors claiming prologue could possibly release on television or a future mcu home media release were speculations in july 2013 d esposito said he had considered making stand alone shorts for several characters including loki a young nick fury black panther ms marvel and black widow regarding loki d esposito said being on asgard is very difficult for us to do in a short it s just impossible for us cost wise short would be 30 seconds and it s over one shot of loki on asgard on fury and black panther he remarked it s very complicated to do who plays those characters and designing costume getting it going we tried we were there in development and we tried but they were very difficult for all reasons i gave and we don t want to do something that s half baked because it s not good for us and it s not good for our fans in february 2014 pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition including ones based on sin and crossbones jessica jones and damage control in may 2015 marvel studios head kevin feige stated that there were no active plans for one shots to return but added that studio was not opposed to continuing series and there was already a backlog of ideas for potential one shots in september 2015 feige provided further comments on return of one shots saying universe is big and we re moving up to three feature films a year this year i don t know how much beyond that we can go so we do talk about making more one shots a lot it s just about finding time and place in june 2017 spider man actor tom holland hinted that marvel was planning on creating more one shots that october pearson further hinted that marvel was interested in creating more adding he had a whole folder full of other one shots he had created taika waititi director of thor ragnarok also stated there had been discussions to resurrect one shots creating one centered on characters korg and from ragnarok feige also noted that one shot films could potentially morph into extra content that s created prior to a film s release instead of for its home entertainment release noting successful team thor mockumentary shorts directed by waititi which were great fun and are quite and in some parts helped redefine thor into what he s become in ragnarok in a fun way so there might be opportunities for more things like that in april 2018 d esposito noted that disney hoped marvel would continue with one shot films but admitted that studio was just so busy focusing on their increased feature film output references external links category 2010s short films category buena vista home entertainment direct
