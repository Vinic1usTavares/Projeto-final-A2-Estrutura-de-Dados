was a potent magnitude 6 6 mw intraplate aftershock that occurred at 17 16 jst 08 16 utc on 11 april in hamadori region of fukushima japan with a shallow focus of earthquake was centred inland about west of iwaki causing widespread strong to locally severe shaking it was one of many aftershocks to follow 11 march tohoku earthquake and strongest to have its epicentre located inland earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting to west of iwaki and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas a few fires broke out and 220 000 households lost electricity officials issued localised tsunami alerts though no significant waves were generated earthquake caused little structural damage but killed four people and injured ten others strong ground movements triggered reactivation of a nearby geological fault prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in region geology magnitude 6 6 mw fukushima hamadori earthquake occurred inland on 11 april 2011 at 08 16 utc at a focal depth of about west of iwaki fukushima or north northeast of tokyo to east of epicentre oceanic pacific plate is subducted beneath continental okhotsk plate on which much of honshu s tohoku region is situated building stress near resultant plate boundary has led to development of shallow inland faults through crustal deformation and folding along east coast of tohoku this intraplate earthquake occurred in vicinity of idosawa fault a shallow crustal fault in hamadori region near tabito town iwaki city that had previously been inactive surveys near epicentre revealed a surface rupture of about and numerous fault scarps with general vertical displacements of a maximum displacement of occurred at small village of shionohira localised right lateral slip of was observed at subsiding west side of rupture segments of idosawa fault associated with this surface feature were classified as shionohira fault in 2011 proximate yunodake fault a normal dip slip fault northeast of shionohira fault that had been dormant for 120 000 130 000 years also ruptured during quake these observations indicated that earthquake occurred as a result of normal dip slip faulting with some strike slip component although it was centred near a different fault zone earthquake was classified as an aftershock of 11 march tohoku earthquake which occurred offshore about to its northeast magnitude 9 0 mw earthquake triggered widespread seismic activity and its aftershock sequence includes well over 67 earthquakes of magnitude 6 0 mw or greater apart from fukushima hamadori earthquake four of aftershocks measured magnitude 7 0 mw or higher fukushima hamadori earthquake however was strongest of aftershocks to have its epicentre located inland early estimates placed strength of earthquake at a magnitude of 7 0 7 1 but united states geological survey usgs lowered magnitude to 6 6 japan meteorological agency jma assessed a magnitude of 7 0 mj and a depth of fukushima hamadori earthquake was succeeded by a number of smaller tremors that same day at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude 3 5 mj or higher were recorded near its epicentre of series strongest registered at a magnitude of 5 5 mj and occurred within 3 5 hours after initial quake a shallow magnitude 6 0 mw 6 4 mj earthquake and several smaller tremors struck region on 12 april effects thumb right usgs shake map earthquake struck in late afternoon near a moderately populated region of fukushima prefecture although most structures around epicentre were resistant to earthquake shaking focussed at an unusually shallow depth earthquake generated significant shaking throughout many adjacent prefectures strongest ground motion registered at severe mm viii in ishikawa town on mercalli intensity scale strong shaking mm vi spread through iwaki and with light tremors mm iv felt in areas up to several hundred kilometres from epicentre including tokyo and yokohama earthquake cut electricity to about 220 000 households with most of cuts reported in iwaki city workers at fukushima daiichi power plant distanced from epicentre evacuated to safety and external power to plant was cut outage briefly disrupted cooling water injections into three of reactors but services to plant were restored by 18 05 jst authorities at tokyo international airport closed all runways momentarily while ntt docomo restricted voice calls in 14 prefectures following quake east japan railway company temporarily suspended its services to restart four of five bullet train lines other shinkansen bullet trains in region were also halted earthquake sparked several fires in iwaki with one fire breaking out in town fire engines extinguished a blaze in a liquefied natural gas tank at daiichi s plant most of structural damage was due to scattered rock and landslides along hillsides in vicinity of iwaki a landslide crushed two vehicles and buried three homes in city trapping a number of inhabitants incident resulted in two immediate deaths four people were critically injured and taken to hospital one of them was later pronounced dead iwaki ibaraki route 14 interchange of expressway which runs from misato saitama to miyagi was cut off to traffic by a large landslide of in tabito town very close to epicentre a landslide resulted in formation of a quake lake a natural damming of a river by mass wasting with a water level of and a storage volume of 1 000 2 500 m3 35 000 90 000 cu ft significant land deformation with traces of uplift was observed in and around town affecting local roads but largely sparing its structures a total of seven people from other regions near epicentre including southern ibaraki tochigi and kanagawa prefectures suffered minor injuries another person was injured during magnitude 6 0 mw aftershock of 12 april in a report from july 2011 fire and disaster management agency confirmed a death toll of four from earthquake response earthquake early warning system was activated upon detection of primary waves seismic waves that forego an earthquake s perceivable ground motions giving residents 6 8 seconds to seek cover before main shock at risk of a tsunami which reach their destructive wave heights near shallow coastal waters local fishing boats along coastlines were shown heading out to sea on national news broadcasts a warning for a localised tsunami of up to was issued by japan meteorological agency however no significant waves were recorded and warning was cancelled soon thereafter in response to earthquake fire department dispatched search and rescue teams and emergency crews for relief efforts and damage assessments throughout affected area six medical crews in pairs of two were also sent to kanagawa chiba and gunma prefectures former prime minister naoto kan postponed a press conference scheduled for 17 50 jst marking one month anniversary of catastrophic tohoku earthquake and tsunami fukushima hamadori earthquake occurred in a region with historically low levels of seismicity studies showed that recent activity near fault zone had been triggered by tohoku earthquake ever since earthquake triggered their reactivation shionohira and yunodake faults have provided essential data for local geological surveys on regional land deformation sedimentary rock distribution and landslide vulnerability in earthquake s aftermath professor yagi hiroshi from faculty of education art and science noted that a possibility exists for widespread aftershocks of same size to occur in near future see also list of earthquakes
