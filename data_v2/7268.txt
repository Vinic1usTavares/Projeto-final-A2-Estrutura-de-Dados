rockist critics including morley term was not generally used beyond music press until mid 2000s partly due to increasing number of bloggers who used it more seriously in analytical debate in 2000s a critical reassessment of pop music was underway and by next decade poptimism supplanted rockism as prevailing ideology in popular music criticism while poptimism was envisioned as a corrective to

rockism rockism was coined in 1981 when english rock musician pete wylie announced his race against rockism campaign an inversion of rock against racism term was immediately repurposed as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism paul morley recalled there is no widespread consensus for definition of rockism during 1990s to be a rockist was defined as demanding a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed in 2004 music critic kelefa sanneh offered a definition of rockists s who reduces rock n roll to a caricature then uses that caricature as a weapon rockism means idolizing authentic old legend or underground hero while mocking latest pop star punk while barely tolerating disco loving live show and hating music video extolling growling performer while hating lip he further accused rockists of projecting a sexist racist and homophobic point of view seattle weeklys douglas wolk acknowledged loose definition of rockism and proposed rockism let s say is treating rock as normative in rockist view rock is standard state of popular music kind to which everything else is compared explicitly or implicitly popmatters robert loss wrote that traditionalism describes policing of present with past making it a better word for rockism design critic and indie pop musician nick currie aka compared rockism to international art movement which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists poptimism poptimism also called popism is a mode of discourse which holds that pop music deserves same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest it positions itself as an antidote to rockism and developed following carl wilson s book about celine dion s album let s talk about love and sanneh s 2004 essay against rockism in new york times in article sanneh asks music listeners to stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever as if anything could and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable as if that were necessarily a bad thing van morrison s into music was released same year as sugarhill gang s rapper s delight which do you hear more often loss cited sanneh s article as a sort of ur text on poptimism elaborating after sanneh published his 2004 article an argument about rockism developed in various web circles in 2006 music journalist jody rosen noted growing backlash against rock s traditional critical acclaim and new poptimism ideology by 2015 washington post writer chris richards wrote that after a decade of righteously vanquishing rockism s nagging falsehood poptimism had become prevailing ideology for today s most influential music critics few would drop this word in conversation at a house party or a nightclub but in music circles idea of poptimism itself is holy writ criticism of poptimists overlap with rockism upright thumb paul morley left a longtime critic of rockism argued that many of poptimism s traits were indistinguishable from rockism in 2006 morley derided seriousness of contemporary music writers many of self proclaimed american anti rockists or or poptimists or pop pricks actually write with a kind of fussy self important rockist sheen and for all their studious over analysis any definition of rockism is same today as it s always been that same year rosen spoke positively of new movement but forewarned of possible excesses that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored a week later popmatters rob horning responded to rosen s writing with a more negative view of poptimism writing that it is sad to think sharpest critics drowning in self importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing opposite you can make case for your own importance this is not optimism it s reaction writing for quietus in 2017 michael hann argued that poptimists are just as as rockists and listed following as a few poptimist sacred cows which are beyond challenge solo release by member of a manufactured group is no longer sad addendum to imperial years it is a profound statement of artistic integrity surprise release by big name act is in itself a revolutionary act to not care about taylor swift or beyonce or lady gaga or zayn malik is in itself questionable it reveals not your taste in music but your prejudices in worst case scenario you may be revealing your unconscious racism and sexism at best you re trolling commercial success in and of itself should be taken as at least one of markers of quality after all 50m elvis fans can t be wrong just as authenticity is worthless as a symbol of a music s worth so contrivance and cynicism might be elevated and celebrated as evidence of maker s awareness of game they are playing according to loss rockism and poptimism are ultimately same thing and both rockists and poptimists treat music as a social commodity while mystifying conditions in which music occurs he adds that as is common in a culture wherein history isn t valued much poptimism neglects its historical precedents as it presents itself as a radical break in discourse of popular culture older rock critics and journalists are usually depicted as a bunch of bricklayers for foundations of rock and roll hall of fame a notion that loss disputes like film studies rock criticism of late 60s and 70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study it was poptimism before its day it s somehow become generally accepted that rock criticism before new millennium was overwhelmingly rockist commercial bias after 2000s effects of poptimism attracted a belief that once a pop star reaches a certain level of stardom many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews richards argued that poptimism already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent new york times magazines saul austerlitz called poptimism a product of click driven internet journalism that aspired to lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism he further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted types of music lauded by poptimists with literature and film praised by book and film critics loss agreed with austerlitz s text when he wrote that m criticism s former priority telling consumers what to purchase has been rendered null and void for most fans in its stead i believe many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars i imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying don t tell them that we like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism but austerlitz gives away that it never was in first place he also noted a minuscule number of lowly rated albums in publications such as rolling stone pitchfork and popmatters and that telling consumers what to purchase is still point of a lot of music criticism hann says that when writers deal with upmarket readership they need to be able to justify your coverage and that means hailing cultural significance of new pop stars and once you ve decided these subjects matter it s hard to turn round and say actually you know what this isn t much cop he recalls his experience as music editor for guardian where he has been commissioning those pieces knowing they will be read if no one wanted to read about taylor swift you would never see another about her instead we enter an arms race of hyperbole as we credit her with forcing apple to change its streaming terms dismantling musical patriarchy creating new paradigms in music and society in other elisabeth said that literary criticism needs a poptimist revolution in order to understand current literary phenomena such as fifty shades of grey and better connect with reading audience in 2015 salon published an article subtitled book criticism needs a poptimist revolution to take down genre snobs in which rachel kramer bussell argued that book critics ignore often very good work and alienate readers by focusing only on genres considered literary writing for salon in 2016 scott timberg commented on critics giving
