edward elder c 874 17 july 924 was king of anglo saxons from 899 until his death he was elder son of alfred great and his wife ealhswith when edward succeeded to throne he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin aethelwold who had a strong claim to throne as son of alfred s elder brother and predecessor aethelred alfred had succeeded aethelred as king of wessex in 871 and almost faced defeat against danish vikings until his decisive victory at battle of edington in 878 after battle vikings still ruled northumbria east anglia and eastern mercia leaving only wessex and western mercia under anglo saxon control in early 880s aethelred lord of mercians ruler of western mercia accepted alfred s lordship and married his daughter aethelflaed and around 886 alfred adopted new title king of anglo saxons as ruler of all anglo saxons not subject to danish rule in 910 a mercian and west saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading northumbrian army ending threat from northern vikings in 910s edward conquered viking ruled southern england in partnership with his sister aethelflaed who had succeeded as lady of mercians following death of her husband in 911 historians dispute how far mercia was dominated by wessex during this period and after aethelflaed s death in june 918 her daughter aelfwynn briefly became second lady of mercians but in december edward took her into wessex and imposed direct rule on mercia by end of 910s he ruled wessex mercia and east anglia and only northumbria remained under viking rule in 924 he faced a mercian and welsh revolt at chester and after putting it down he died at farndon in cheshire on 17 july 924 he was succeeded by his eldest son aethelstan edward was admired by medieval chroniclers and in view of william of malmesbury he was much inferior to his father in cultivation of letters but incomparably more glorious in power of his rule he was largely ignored by modern historians until 1990s and nick higham described him as perhaps most neglected of english kings partly because few primary sources for his reign survive his reputation rose in late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying power of vikings in southern england while laying foundations for a south centred united english kingdom background mercia was dominant kingdom in southern england in eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by wessex at battle of in 825 thereafter two kingdoms became allies which was to be an important factor in english resistance to vikings in 865 danish viking great heathen army landed in east anglia and used this as a starting point for an invasion east anglians were forced to pay off vikings who invaded northumbria following year they appointed a puppet king in 867 and then moved on mercia where they spent winter of 867 868 king burgred of mercia was joined by king aethelred of wessex and his brother future king alfred for a combined attack on vikings who refused an engagement in end mercians bought peace with them following year danes conquered east anglia and in 874 they expelled king burgred and with their support ceolwulf became last king of mercia in 877 vikings partitioned mercia taking eastern regions for themselves and allowing ceolwulf to keep western ones in early 878 they invaded wessex and many west saxons submitted to them alfred who was now king was reduced to a remote base in isle of athelney in somerset but situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at battle of edington he was thus able to prevent vikings from taking wessex and western mercia although they still occupied northumbria east anglia and eastern mercia childhood thumb a page from will of alfred great which left bulk of his estate to edward edward s parents alfred and ealhswith married in 868 her father was aethelred mucel ealdorman of and her mother eadburh was a member of mercian royal family alfred and ealhswith had five children who survived childhood oldest was aethelflaed who married aethelred lord of mercians and ruled as lady of mercians after his death edward was next and second daughter became abbess of shaftesbury third daughter aelfthryth married baldwin count of flanders and younger son aethelweard was given a scholarly education including learning latin this would usually suggest that he was intended for church but it is unlikely in aethelweard s case as he later had sons there were also an unknown number of children who died young neither part of edward s name which means protector of wealth had been used previously by west saxon royal house and barbara yorke suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother eadburh reflecting west saxon policy of strengthening links with mercia historians estimate that edward was probably born in mid 870s his eldest sister aethelflaed was probably born about a year after her parents marriage and edward was brought up with his youngest sister aelfthryth yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to aelfthryth than aethelflaed edward led troops in battle in 893 and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son aethelstan was born about 894 according to asser in his life of king alfred edward and aelfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors and read ecclesiastical and secular works in english such as psalms and old english poems they were taught courtly qualities of gentleness and humility and asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors this is only known case of an anglo saxon prince and princess receiving same upbringing aetheling thumb upright 0 9 map of britain in 886 as a son of a king edward was an aetheling a prince of royal house who was eligible for kingship even though he had advantage of being eldest son of reigning king his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to throne aethelhelm and aethelwold were sons of aethelred alfred s older brother and predecessor as king but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died asser gives more information about edward s childhood and youth than is known about other anglo saxon princes providing details about training of a prince in a period of carolingian influence and yorke suggest that we may know so much due to alfred s efforts to portray his son as most aetheling aethelhelm is only recorded in alfred s will of mid 880s and probably died at some time in next decade but aethelwold is listed above edward in only charter where he appears probably indicating a higher status aethelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen whereas edward s mother ealhswith never had a higher status than king s wife however alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages in his will he left only a handful of estates to his brother s sons and bulk of his property to edward including all his land vested in a charter which could be alienated by holder as opposed to folkland which had to pass to heirs of body in kent alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession such as his brother in law a mercian ealdorman called aethelwulf and his son in law aethelred edward witnessed several of his father s charters and often accompanied him on royal in a kentish charter of 898 edward witnessed as rex saxonum suggesting that alfred may have followed strategy adopted by his grandfather egbert of strengthening his son s claim to succeed to west saxon throne by making him sub king of kent once edward grew up alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration english defeated renewed viking attacks in 893 to 896 and in richard abels view glory belonged to aethelred and edward rather than alfred himself in 893 edward defeated vikings in battle of farnham although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops period of service had expired and he had to release them situation was saved by arrival of troops from london led by aethelred yorke argues that although alfred packed witan with members whose interests lay in continuation of alfred s line that may not have been sufficient to ensure edward s accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship in about 893 edward probably married ecgwynn who bore him two children future king aethelstan and a daughter who married sitric a viking king of york twelfth century chronicler william of malmesbury described ecgwynn as an illustris femina noble lady and stated that edward chose aethelstan as his heir as king she may have been related to st dunstan aristocratic tenth century archbishop of canterbury but william of malmesbury also stated that aethelstan s accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth suggestion that ecgwynn was edward s mistress is accepted by some historians such as simon keynes and richard abels but yorke and aethelstan s biographer sarah foot disagree arguing that allegations should be seen in context of disputed succession in 924 and were not an issue in 890s ecgwynn probably died by 899 as around time of alfred s death edward married aelfflaed daughter of ealdorman aethelhelm probably of wiltshire janet nelson suggests that there was conflict between alfred and edward in 890s she points out that contemporary anglo saxon chronicle produced under court auspices in 890s does not mention edward s military successes these are known only from late tenth century chronicle of aethelweard such as his account of battle of farnham in which in nelson s view edward s military prowess and popularity with a following of young warriors are highlighted towards end of his life alfred invested his young grandson aethelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to kingship nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by edward to support accession of his own son on other hand it may have been intended by alfred as part of a scheme to divide kingdom between his son and grandson aethelstan was sent to be brought up in mercia by aethelflaed and aethelred but it is not known whether this was alfred s idea or edward s alfred s wife ealhswith was ignored in anglo saxon chronicle in her husband s lifetime but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded this may be because she supported her son against her husband aethelwold s revolt thumb 240px coin of edward elder alfred died on 26 october 899 and edward succeeded to throne but aethelwold disputed succession he seized royal estates of wimborne symbolically important as place where his father was buried and christchurch both in dorset edward marched with his army to nearby iron age hillfort at badbury rings aethelwold declared that he would live or die at wimborne but then left in night and rode to northumbria where danes accepted him as king edward was crowned on 8june 900 at kingston upon thames in 901 aethelwold came with a fleet to essex and following year he persuaded east anglian danes to invade english mercia and northern wessex where his army looted and then returned home edward retaliated by ravaging east anglia but when he retreated men of kent disobeyed order to retire and were intercepted by danish army two sides met at battle of holme perhaps holme in huntingdonshire on 13 december 902 according to anglo saxon chronicle danes kept place of slaughter meaning that they won battle but they suffered heavy losses including aethelwold and a king eohric possibly of east anglian danes kentish losses included sigehelm ealdorman of kent and father of edward s third wife eadgifu aethelwold s death ended threat to edward s throne king of anglo saxons in london in 886 alfred had received formal submission of all english people that were not under subjection to danes and thereafter he adopted title anglorum saxonum rex king of anglo saxons which is used in his later charters and all but two of edward s this is seen by keynes as invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity covering both west saxons and mercians which was inherited by edward with support of mercians at west saxon court of whom most important was plegmund archbishop of canterbury in 903 edward issued several charters concerning land in mercia three of them are witnessed by mercian leaders and their daughter aelfwynn and they all contain a statement that aethelred and aethelflaed then held rulership and power over race of mercians under aforesaid king other charters were issued by mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of edward s authority but they did not issue their own coinage this view of edward s status is accepted by martin ryan who states that aethelred and aethelflaed had a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority in english mercia other historians disagree pauline stafford describes aethelflaed as last mercian queen while in charles insley s view mercia kept its independence until aethelflaed s death in 918 michael davidson contrasts 903 charters with one of 901 in which mercian rulers were by grace of god holding governing and defending monarchy of mercians davidson comments that evidence for mercian subordination is decidedly mixed ultimately ideology of kingdom of anglo saxons may have been less successful in achieving absorption of mercia and more something which i would see as a murky political coup anglo saxon chronicle was compiled at west saxon court from 890s and entries for late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting west saxon viewpoint davidson observes that alfred and edward possessed skilled spin doctors some versions of chronicle incorporate part of a lost mercian register which gives a mercian perspective and details of aethelflaed s campaign against vikings in late ninth and early tenth centuries connection by marriage with west saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers in mid 890s alfred had married his daughter aelfthryth to baldwin ii of flanders and in 919 edward married his daughter eadgifu to charles simple king of west francia in 925 after edward s death another daughter eadgyth married otto future king of germany and after eadgyth s death holy roman emperor conquest of southern danelaw no battles are recorded between anglo saxons and danish vikings for several years after battle of holme but in 906 edward agreed peace with east anglian and northumbrian danes suggesting that there had been conflict according to one version of anglo saxon chronicle he made peace of necessity which implies that he was forced to buy them off he encouraged englishmen to purchase land in danish territory and two charters survive relating to estates in bedfordshire and derbyshire in 909 edward sent a combined west saxon and mercian army which harassed northumbrian danes and seized bones of northumbrian royal saint oswald from bardney abbey in lincolnshire oswald was translated to a new mercian minster established by aethelred and aethelflaed in gloucester and danes were compelled to accept peace on edward s terms in following year northumbrian danes retaliated by raiding mercia but on their way home they were met by a combined mercian and west saxon army at battle of tettenhall where vikings suffered a disastrous defeat after that northumbrian danes never ventured south of river humber and edward and his mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering southern danelaw in east anglia and five boroughs of viking east mercia derby leicester lincoln nottingham and stamford in 911 aethelred lord of mercians died and edward took control of mercian lands around london and oxford aethelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow aethelflaed as lady of mercians and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as aethelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life edward and aethelflaed then began construction of fortresses to guard against viking attacks and protect territory captured from them in november 911 he constructed a fort on north bank of river lea at hertford to guard against attack by danes of bedford and cambridge in 912 he marched with his army to maldon in essex and ordered building of a fort at witham and a second fort at hertford which protected london from attack and encouraged many english living under danish rule in essex to submit to him in 913 there was a pause in his activities although aethelflaed continued her fortress building in mercia in 914 a viking army sailed from brittany and ravaged severn estuary it then attacked in south east wales now in herefordshire and captured bishop edward ransomed him for large sum of forty pounds of silver vikings were defeated by armies of hereford and gloucester and gave hostages and oaths to keep peace edward kept an army on south side of estuary in case vikings broke their promises and he twice had to repel attacks in autumn vikings moved on to ireland episode suggests that south east wales fell within west saxon sphere of power unlike brycheiniog just to north where mercia was dominant in late 914 edward built two forts at buckingham and earl thurketil leader of danish army at bedford submitted to him following year he occupied bedford and constructed another fortification on south bank of river great ouse against a viking one on north bank in 916 edward returned to essex and built a fort at maldon to bolster defence of witham he also helped earl thurketil and his followers to leave england reducing number of viking armies in midlands decisive year in war was 917 in april edward built a fort at towcester as a defence against danes of northampton and another at an unidentified place called wigingamere danes launched unsuccessful attacks on towcester bedford and wigingamere while aethelflaed captured derby showing value of english defensive measures which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among viking armies danes had built their own fortress at in bedfordshire but at end of summer english stormed it and killed last danish king of east anglia english then took colchester although they did not try to hold it danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to maldon but garrison held out until it was relieved and retreating army was heavily defeated edward then returned to towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall and danes of nearby northampton submitted to him armies of cambridge and east anglia also submitted and by end of year only danish armies still holding out were those of four of five boroughs leicester stamford nottingham and lincoln in early 918 aethelflaed secured submission of leicester without a fight and danes of northumbrian york offered her their allegiance probably for protection against norse norwegian vikings who had invaded northumbria from ireland but she died on 12 june before she could take up proposal same offer is not known to have been made to edward and norse vikings took york in 919 according to main west saxon version of anglo saxon chronicle after aethelflaed s death mercians submitted to edward but mercian version mercian register states that in december 918 her daughter aelfwynn was deprived of all authority in mercia and taken into wessex mercia may have made a bid for continued semi independence which was suppressed by edward and it then came under his direct rule stamford had surrendered to edward before aethelflaed s death and nottingham did same shortly afterwards according to anglo saxon chronicle for 918 all people who had settled in mercia both danish and english submitted to him this would mean that he ruled all england south of humber but it is not clear whether lincoln was an exception as coins of viking york in early 920s were probably minted at lincoln some danish jarls were allowed to keep their estates although edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land and some he kept in his own hands coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in east midlands than in east anglia three welsh kings hywel dda and idwal foel who had previously been subject to aethelflaed now gave their allegiance to edward thumb penny of edward elder alt penny of edward elder coinage principal currency in later anglo saxon england was silver penny and some coins carried a stylised portrait of king edward s coins had rex on obverse and name of moneyer on reverse places of issue were not shown in his reign but they were in that of his son aethelstan allowing location of many moneyers of edward s reign to be established there were mints in bath canterbury chester chichester derby exeter hereford london oxford shaftesbury shrewsbury southampton stafford wallingford wareham winchester and probably other towns no coins were struck in name of aethelred or aethelflaed but from around 910 mints in english mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on reverse this ceased before 920 and probably represents aethelflaed s way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother there was also a minor issue of coins in name of plegmund archbishop of canterbury there was a dramatic increase in number of moneyers over edward s reign fewer than 25 in south in first ten years rising to 67 in last ten years around five in english mercia rising to 23 plus 27 in conquered danelaw church in 908 plegmund conveyed alms of english king and people to pope first visit to rome by an archbishop of canterbury for almost a century and journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re organisation of west saxon sees when edward came to throne wessex had two dioceses winchester held by denewulf and sherborne held by asser in 908 denewulf died and was replaced following year by frithestan soon afterwards winchester was divided into two sees with creation of diocese of ramsbury covering wiltshire and berkshire while winchester was left with hampshire and surrey forged charters date division to 909 but this may not be correct asser died in same year and at some date between 909 and 918 sherborne was divided into three sees crediton covering devon and cornwall and wells covering somerset leaving sherborne with dorset effect of changes was to strengthen status of canterbury compared with winchester and sherborne but division may have been related to a change in secular functions of west saxon bishops to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts at beginning of edward s reign his mother ealhswith founded abbey of st mary for nuns known as nunnaminster in winchester edward s daughter eadburh became a nun there and she was venerated as a saint and subject of a hagiography by osbert of clare in twelfth century in 901 edward started building a major religious community for men possibly in accordance with his father s wishes monastery was next to winchester cathedral which became known as old minster while edward s foundation was called new minster it was much larger than old minster and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum it acquired relics of breton saint which probably arrived in england from ponthieu in 901 and body of one of alfred s closest advisers who died in same year and who was soon venerated as a saint edward s mother died in 902 and he buried her and alfred there moving his father s body from old minster burials in early 920s included edward himself his brother aethelweard and his son aelfweard on other hand when aethelstan became king in 924 he did not show any favour to his father s foundation probably because winchester sided against him when throne was disputed after edward s death only other king buried at new minster was eadwig in 959 edward s decision not to expand old minster but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building suggests animosity towards bishop denewulf and this was compounded by forcing old minster to cede both land for new site and an estate of 70 hides at beddington to provide an income for new minster edward was remembered by new minster as a benefactor but at old minster as rex greedy king he may have built new church because he did not think that old minster was grand enough to be royal mausoleum for kings of anglo saxons not just west saxons like their predecessors alan thacker comments edward s method of endowing new minster was of a piece with his ecclesiastical policy in general like his father he gave little to church indeed judging by dearth of charters for much of his reign he seems to have given away little at all more than any other edward s kingship seems to epitomise new hard nosed monarchy of wessex determined to exploit all its resources lay and ecclesiastical for its own benefit patrick wormald observes thought occurs that neither alfred nor edward was greatly beloved at winchester cathedral and one reason for edward s moving his father s body into new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there learning and culture standard of anglo saxon learning declined severely in ninth century particularly in wessex and mercian scholars such as plegmund played a major part in revival of learning initiated by alfred mercians were prominent at courts of alfred and edward and mercian dialect and scholarship commanded west saxon respect it is uncertain how far alfred s programmes continued during his son s reign english translations of works in latin made during alfred s reign continued to be copied but few original works are known script known as anglo saxon square minuscule reached maturity in 930s and its earliest phases date to edward s reign main scholarly and centres were cathedral centres of canterbury winchester and worcester monasteries did not make a significant contribution until aethelstan s reign very little survives of manuscript production of edward s reign only surviving large scale embroideries which were certainly made in anglo saxon england date to edward s reign they are a stole a maniple and a possible girdle removed from coffin of st cuthbert in durham cathedral in nineteenth century they were donated to shrine by aethelstan in 934 but inscriptions on embroideries show that they were commissioned by edward s second wife aelfflaed as a gift to frithestan bishop of winchester they probably did not reach their intended destination because aethelstan was on bad terms with winchester law and administration almost all surviving charters from edward s reign are later copies and only surviving original is not a charter of edward himself but a grant by aethelred and aethelflaed in 901 in same year a meeting at southampton was attended by his brother and sons his household thegns and nearly all bishops but no ealdormen it was on this occasion that king acquired land from bishop of winchester for foundation of new minster winchester no charters survive for period from 910 to king s death in 924 much to puzzlement and distress of historians charters were usually issued when king made grants of land and it is possible that edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against vikings charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to church and were preserved in their archives and another possibility is that edward was making grants of property only on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of royal house such charters would not be found in church archives clause 3 of law code called i edward provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath but only by ordeal this is start of continuous history in england of trial by ordeal it is probably mentioned in laws of king ine 688 to 726 but not in later codes such as those of alfred administrative and legal system in edward s reign may have depended extensively on written records almost none of which survive edward was one of few anglo saxon kings to issue laws about bookland there was increasing confusion in period as to what was really bookland edward urged prompt settlement in bookland and folkland disputes and his legislation established that jurisdiction belonged to king and his officers later life according to anglo saxon chronicle there was a general submission of rulers in britain to edward in 920 then edward went from there into peak district to bakewell and ordered a borough to be built in neighbourhood and manned and then king of scots and all people of scots and and sons of eadwulf and all who live in northumbria both english and danish norsemen and others and also king of strathclyde welsh and all strathclyde welsh chose him as father and lord this passage was regarded as a straightforward report by most historians until late twentieth century and frank stenton observed that each of rulers named in this list had something definite to gain from an acknowledgement of edward s overlordship since 1980s this submission has been viewed with increasing scepticism particularly as passage in chronicle is only evidence for it unlike other submissions such as that one in 927 to aethelstan for which there is independent support from literary sources and coins alfred p smyth points out that edward was not in a position to impose same conditions on scots and northumbrians as he could on conquered vikings and argues that chronicle presented a treaty between kings as a submission to wessex stafford observes that rulers had met at bakewell on border between mercia and northumbria and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side davidson points out that wording chosen as father and lord applied to conquered army groups and burhs not relations with other kings in his view idea that this meeting represented a submission while it must remain a possibility does however seem unlikely textual context of chronicler s passage makes his interpretation of meeting suspect and ultimately edward was in no position to force subordination of or dictate terms to his fellow kings in britain edward continued aethelflaed s policy of founding burhs in north west at thelwall and manchester in 919 and rhuddlan at mouth of river clwyd in north wales in 921 nothing is known of his relations with mercians between 919 and last year of his life when he put down a mercian and welsh revolt at chester mercia and eastern danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in tenth century ignoring traditional boundaries and historians such as sean miller and david griffiths suggest that edward s imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored mercian sensibilities resentment at changes at imposition of rule by distant wessex and at fiscal demands by edward s reeves may have provoked revolt at chester he died at royal estate of farndon twelve miles south of chester on 24 july 924 shortly after putting down revolt and was buried in new minster winchester in 1109 new minster was moved outside city walls to become hyde abbey and following year remains of edward and his parents were translated to new church reputation according to william of malmesbury edward was much inferior to his father in cultivation of letters but incomparably more glorious in power of his rule other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning but superior in military success john of worcester described him as most invincible king edward elder however even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like alfred s at edington and aethelstan s at brunanburh and william of malmesbury qualified his praise of edward by saying that chief prize of victory in my judgment is due to his father edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers admiration for his highly regarded sister aethelflaed a principal reason for neglect of edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive whereas there are many for alfred he was largely ignored by historians until late twentieth century but he is now highly regarded he is described by keynes as far more than bellicose bit between alfred and aethelstan and according to nick higham edward elder is perhaps most neglected of english kings he ruled an expanding realm for twenty five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single south centred anglo saxon kingdom yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten in 1999 a conference on his reign was held at university of manchester and papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001 prior to this conference no monographs had been published on edward s reign whereas his father has been subject of numerous biographies and other studies in view of f t wainwright without detracting from achievements of alfred it is well to remember that it was edward who reconquered danish midlands and gave england nearly a century of respite from serious danish attacks higham summarises edward s legacy as follows under edward s leadership scale of alternative centres of power diminished markedly separate court of mercia was dissolved danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled welsh princes were constrained from aggression of borders and even west saxon bishoprics divided late anglo saxon england is often described as most centralised polity in western europe at time with its shires its shire reeves and its systems of regional courts and royal taxation if so and matter remains debatable much of that centrality derives from edward s activities and he has as good a claim as any other to be considered architect of medieval england edward s cognomen elder was first used in wulfstan s life of st aethelwold at end of tenth century to distinguish him from king edward martyr marriages and children edward had about fourteen children from
