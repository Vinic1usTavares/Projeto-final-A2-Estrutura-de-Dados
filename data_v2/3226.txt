silicon knights and has appeared in all subsequent legacy of kain games under direction of developer crystal dynamics between games he serves as either central playable character or as an antagonist but in all his depictions he has consistently been described as an antihero drawing inspiration from morally ambiguous character of william munny from clint eastwood s 1992 film unforgiven silicon knights conceived kain as a nobleman murdered and revived as a vampire to take revenge on his assassins he gradually embraces his new existence and learns of his birthright to maintain balance in nosgoth fictional setting of series crystal dynamics later portrayed kain as an oedipus like figure seeking to thwart fate determined for him before his birth beyond his role in series kain has also featured in tie in comics and in crystal dynamics lara croft and guardian of light in all of his voiced appearances he has been played by actor simon templeman he has been favorably received by video game critics and enthusiasts with praise attributed to his antagonistic role in legacy of kain soul reaver and his status as a strong example of a memorable nuanced antihero in medium concept and creation kain s character was originally conceived circa 1993 by silicon knights president denis dyack as protagonist of pillars of nosgoth an initial video game concept for what would become 1996 s blood omen legacy of kain he was modeled in part on william munny protagonist of clint eastwood s 1992 western film unforgiven developers set out to craft an antihero to suit a game where player is put in position where everyone believes you are evil feeling that industry required a story addressing issues of moral ambiguity and wondering how players would react when everyone in world was your enemy including yourself where you had to kill innocents to survive and you are ultimate pawn other influences which helped to define kain s character arc included wheel of time and cover art from pillars of earth in comparison to count dracula dyack commented in an interview that he believed kain would kick his ass in a fight he and writer ken mcculloch considered simon templeman s voiceover for character superlative despite initial apprehensions that actors they had hired might not be able to convey game s complicated dialogue after a legal dispute with silicon knights blood omen publisher crystal dynamics obtained rights to legacy of kain intellectual property with amy hennig directing kain s characterization for sequel 1999 s legacy of kain soul reaver in this game which built upon blood omen ending in which he world kain adopted role of antagonist with new character raziel serving as lead hennig justified this choice believing that it would prove interesting to see what his decision had engendered after a few millennia she emphasized though that she did not consider him a monster or mustache twirling villain remarking that in many ways he s a more complex and sympathetic character than raziel himself sources which helped to formulate his role in plot ranged from biblical lore to eastern myth and mysticism thumb upright clint eastwood s character in unforgiven inspired moral ambiguity represented in kain s portrayal in interviews preceding release of 2001 s soul reaver 2 hennig said that crystal dynamics had a huge investment in kain as a character his portrayal in this game extrapolated further from blood omens story and was influenced by joseph campbell s ideals no longer acting as a pure villain kain was intended to function as a steadfast character coming to story from a position of knowledge in contrast to raziel s relative ignorance hennig expressed that by soul reaver 2 her personal perception of kain s character had changed over years and that she now considered him a somewhat more attractive and interesting individual than raziel due to his complexity she dubbed him a tragic hero screwed by his own character flaws and argued that this added to his depth since joining naughty dog when asked whether raziel or kain is closest to her heart hennig has said that while raziel is a sympathetic protagonist she probably prefers kain as a character for 2002 s blood omen 2 developed by a different team within crystal dynamics kain returned as playable protagonist development staff chose to focus on his rise to power as a younger vampire combining aspects of his blood omen and soul reaver incarnations he was marketed as a more powerful and ruthless character than traditional video game heroes with lead designer mike ellis inviting comparison to final fantasy vi s kefka palazzo and revolver ocelot of metal gear series design issues raised by wealth of abilities and equipment he accumulated in blood omen prompted team to add to his backstory and convincingly deprive him of these powers producer sam newman described him as a very unique character who doesn t fit to generic character molds you find in many other games books and movies not good he s not necessarily evil kain does as kain believes legacy of kain defiance released in 2003 returned to aged elder kain from soul reaver and soul reaver 2 now controllable alongside raziel prospect of making this incarnation of kain playable left development team very excited and was agreed upon very early in pre production recognizing that he is most important character in series designer kyle named several parallels and influences concerning his development up to that point citing neo and john murdoch protagonists of matrix and dark city respectively archetypal fisher king of arthurian legend story of oedipus and gnostic myth as inspirations with both latter sources being reaffirmed as strong influences by hennig in a later interview spells he obtains over course of his levels were intended to pay homage to original blood omen characteristics kain s appearance undergoes pretty dramatic changes throughout games as he ages but core personality attributes cited by developers include his intelligence and cynicism arrogance and regality and his defiant nature in series fictional universe he is described as guardian of balance a being responsible for preserving health and integrity of nosgoth games setting but left incapable of realizing this duty due to spiritual corruption that he inherited at birth character s transformation into a vampire and visceral nature this trait lends series was derived from william shakespeare s classical models for drunken commoners in front rows he would insert dirty jokes to keep them entertained but for aristocracy in balconies he would write very cerebral metaphors according to silicon knights graphic violence and vampirism in blood omen served as their dirty jokes supplemented by a complex story as story progresses kain evolves from a directionless young nobleman to a lithe and devious vampire to a craggy figure as a playable character he frequently narrates his thoughts through dramatic device of soliloquy in blood omen and defiance his battle cry and catchphrase is vae victis a latin phrase attributed to brennus meaning woe to conquered appearances debut thumb upright story of oedipus significantly influenced kain s development in later games in a rather than freudian sense in blood omen legacy of kain kain is introduced as a young human noble in game s prologue he is murdered by assassins and resurrected as a vampire by mortanius a necromancer kain vae victis suffering to conquered ironic that now i was one suffering not anything as pedestrian as physical pain rather cruel jab of impotent anger hunger for revenge i didn t care if i was in heaven or hell all i wanted was to kill my assassins sometimes you get what you wish for necromancer mortanius offered me a chance for vengeance and like a fool i jumped at his offer without considering cost nothing is free not even revenge he is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore nine pillars of nosgoth edifices whose state dictates vitality of world nine guardians who symbiotically represent pillars were corrupted prior to his birth and must be killed before land can recover kain i seek only a cure ariel there is no cure for death only release you must destroy sorcery that is now poisoning nosgoth only then will you realize peace nine of protectors of hope were sworn to use their powers to preserve our world now these pillars have been corrupted by a traitor my murder at hands of this beast drove my love nupraptor mad now he spreads misery and pain among circle crumbling very foundation of nosgoth you must restore balance you must right pillars of nosgoth during his quest he meets ancient vampire vorador who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism kain gift pah vorador thought my curse a blessing that we were gods and that mortals offered their blood as sacrifice so that we could enjoy our supernatural powers and somewhere deep inside my new self i knew he was right that mortal dreams were prayers prayers to us begging for our power and discovers soul reaver a legendary soul devouring sword kain time fades even legend and origin of soul reaver has been lost long ago but its purpose remains to feed on souls of any creature it strikes kindred this blade and i using reaver he tries to alter course of nosgoth s history to prevent nemesis a tyrant king from coming to power kain stronghold of william just twas time for me to pay a visit to he who would become nemesis and force nosgoth on its knees tricked by moebius guardian of time kain succeeds in destroying nemesis but temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction kain is left last surviving vampire in nosgoth kain in my youth i witnessed william s rise to power and his transformation into nemesis who laid waste to nosgoth raziel keep your distance kain kain years later i stumble upon a chance to journey back in history unaware that entire affair has been carefully orchestrated by moebius in my wisdom i seize this opportunity to murder young king before he can ravage nosgoth and thereby provide catalyst moebius needs to ignite a genocidal war against our race raziel i warn you no further kain this one reckless act unravels skein of history nemesis never becomes nemesis william dies a martyred saint i vampire assassin become author of my own species extinction and moebius profits from it all i destroyed a tyrant only to create one far worse after systematically tracking down and killing most of guardians he confronts mortanius revealed as guardian of death and orchestrator of kain s assassination you betrayed us mortanius you had kain killed and turned him into a monster you set him upon us mortanius it had to be nupraptor s insanity poisoned all of our minds circle had failed in its sworn duties it had to be destroyed after killing mortanius a malevolent mysterious being known as dark entity emerges from mortanius s body where he tells kain that he is one who orchestrated murder of ariel by possessing mortanius and entire affair in nosgoth while mortanius attempted to save nosgoth and fight mentally against him before succumbing kain confronts dark entity in final battle by slaying him after battle kain realizes that he himself is final guardian and that cure to his curse entails his own destruction kain i am last pillar only survivor of circle of nine at my whim world will be healed or damned at my whim faced with obligation of self sacrifice thereby restoring world but ensuring annihilation of vampire race or alternative of destroying pillars to rule over world in its state kain thirty years hence i am presented with a dilemma let s call it a two sided coin if coin falls one way i sacrifice myself and thus restore pillars but as last surviving vampire in nosgoth this would mean annihilation of our species moebius made sure of that if coin lands on reverse i refuse sacrifice and thus doom pillars to an eternity of collapse either way game is rigged although both options are available to player canon established in sequels proves that kain opts for latter choice embracing vampirism as a blessing as pillars collapse kain once i embraced my powers i realized that vorador was correct we are gods dark gods and it is our duty to thin herd elder god this world is wracked with cataclysms earth strains to shrug off pestilence of kain s parasitic empire fate of this world was preordained in an instant by a solitary man unwilling to martyr himself to restore nosgoth s balance kain condemned world to decay you see in that moment unraveling began now it is nearly played out nosgoth teeters on brink of collapse its fragile balance cannot hold soul reaver of kain soul reaver features kain as main antagonist and a recurring boss character narratively following him centuries after his decision since first game kain has revived vampire race and has become despotic ruler of land raziel kain is deified clans tell tales of him few know truth he was mortal once as were we all however his contempt for humanity drove him to create me and my brethren when game s protagonist his lieutenant raziel surpasses kain raziel is executed for his transgression raziel i am raziel first born of his lieutenants i stood with kain and my brethren at dawn of empire i have served him a millennium over time we became less human and more divine kain would enter state of change and emerge with a new gift some years after master our evolution would follow until i had honor of surpassing my lord for my transgression i earned a new kind of reward agony there was only one possible outcome my eternal damnation i raziel was to suffer fate of traitors and to burn forever in bowels of lake of dead resurrected by elder god raziel returns to destroy his former brethren and kain elder god you are reborn birth of one of kain s abominations traps essence of life it is this soul that animates corpse you lived in and that raziel is demise of nosgoth there is no balance souls of dead remain trapped i can not spin them in wheel of fate they can not complete their destinies redeem yourself or if you prefer avenge yourself settle your dispute with kain destroy him and your brethren free their souls and let wheel of fate churn again use your hatred to their souls i can make it possible become my soul reaver my angel of death and eventually confronts kain at ruins of pillars kain attacks raziel with soul reaver raziel soul reaver kain s ancient blade older than any of us and a thousand times more deadly legends claimed that blade was possessed and thrived by devouring souls of its victims for all our bravado we knew what it meant when kain drew soul reaver in anger it meant you were dead but blade shatters when it strikes him and kain escapes strangely satisfied kain blade is vanquished so it unfolds and we are a step closer to our destinies raziel discovers to his horror that kain created him and his other lieutenants from corpses of sarafan an ancient order of vampire hunters raziel these crypts defiled caskets of sarafan saints bearing my brothers names and my own irony of kain s blasphemous act rushed in on me with crushing force of revelation were my hands not as bloody as these worse i had spilled blood of my brothers these very comrades whose tombs lay ravaged before me elder god yes raziel you were sarafan born of same force that all but destroyed your race before dawn of empire you were chosen kain nosgoth s solitary self declared monarch plundered this tomb and raised you from these crypts breathing his vampiric gift into your defiled corpses he resurrected you as his favored sons he fights kain a second time in moebius s abandoned time machine chronoplast where kain explains nature of free will and rationalizes his actions kain as long as a single one of us stands we are legion that is why when i must sacrifice my children to void i can do so with a clear heart raziel very poetic kain but in end you offer no more than a convenient rationalization for your crimes kain these chambers offer insight for those patient enough to look in your haste to find me perhaps you have not gazed deeply enough our futures are predestined moebius foretold mine a millennium ago we each play out parts fate has written for us we are compelled down pre ordained paths free will is an illusion raziel i have been to tomb of sarafan kain your dirty secret is exposed how could you transform a sarafan priest into a vampire kain how could i not one must keep his friends close raziel and his enemies even closer can you grasp absurd beauty of paradox we are same sarafan and vampire with our holy wars our obsession with nosgoth s domination who better to serve me than those whose passion transcends all notions of good and evil raziel i will not applaud your clever blasphemy sarafan were saviors defending nosgoth from corruption that we represent my eyes are opened kain i find no nobility in you rudely forced on my unwilling corpse kain you may have uncovered your past but you know nothing of it you think sarafan were noble altruistic don t be simple their agenda was same as ours raziel you are lost in a maze of moral relativism kain these apparitions and portents what game are you playing now kain destiny is a game is it not and now you await my latest move narrowly escaping kain activates chronoplast and travels into past with raziel pursuing him as game ends kain you nearly had me raziel but this is not where or how it ends fate promises more twists before this drama unfolds completely elder god be warned raziel once you cross this threshold you are beyond my influence moebius raziel redeemer and destroyer pawn and messiah welcome time spanned soul welcome to your destiny in soul reaver 2 kain acts as a non player character encountered by raziel in several cutscenes as game s plot progresses his agenda and motives become clearer he seeks a third option to dilemma prescribed for him at end of blood omen hoping to both restore nosgoth and return pillars to vampire control raziel we agree then that pillars are crucial and must be restored kain yes raziel that s why we ve come full circle to this place raziel so after all this you make my case for me to end this stalemate you must die so that new guardians can be born kain pillars don t belong to them raziel they belong to us raziel your arrogance is boundless kain kain there s a third option a monumental secret hidden in your very presence here but it s a secret you have to discover for yourself unearth your destiny raziel it s all laid out for you here having viewed he learned that history is predestined kain when i first stole into this chamber centuries ago i did not fathom true power of knowledge to know future raziel to see its paths and streams tracing out into infinite as a man i could never have contained such forbidden truths but each of us is so much more than we once were gazing out across planes of possibility do you not feel with all your soul how we have become like gods and as such are we not indivisible and seeks to change his fate by triggering more temporal paradoxes kain this isn t a chase raziel we are merely passengers on wheel of destiny describing a perfect circle to this point we have been brought here for a reason i have seen beginning and end of our story however and tale is crude and ill conceived we must rewrite ending of it you and i kain if you truly believe in free will raziel now is time to prove it kill me now and we both become pawns of history dragged down path of an artificial destiny i was ordained to assume role of balance guardian in nosgoth while you were destined to be its savior but map of my fate was redrawn by moebius and so in turn was yours an objective which demanded raziel s temporary destruction it is revealed that raziel is destined to be consumed by soul reaver thus becoming soul devouring entity trapped within weapon raziel with all other foes exhausted conjoined blades turned themselves on me and i realized finally why i had sensed nothing when janos offered me blade reaver was never forged to be a soul stealing weapon ravenous soul devouring entity trapped in blade was and always had been me this is why blade was destroyed when kain tried to strike me down reaver could not devour its own soul paradox shattered blade so this was my terrible destiny to play out this purgatorial cycle for all eternity i could not bear it despair overwhelmed me with raziel s help kain is able to defy history and prevent his own pre ordained death kain history abhors a paradox raziel even now time stream strains to divert itself finding its old course blocked by your refusal to destroy me future is reshuffling itself to accommodate your monumental decision and in return he saves raziel from being consumed by reaver at story s climax however this alteration putatively changes history for worse leading into events of blood omen 2 and legacy of kain defiance raziel behind kain s eyes i could see new memories blooming and dying as history labored to reshuffle itself around this monumental obstruction and i could see by dawning horror on his face that perhaps we had strained history too far this time that by trying to alter my fate he may have introduced a fatal paradox blood omen 2 and omen 2 pursues a younger kain during his early conquests of nosgoth in altered timeline triggered by changes to raziel s destiny at end of soul reaver 2 legacy of kain defiance takes place in same altered timeline periodically switching between characters of elder kain and raziel from soul reaver 2 with both acting as playable protagonists over course of game moebius manipulates kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy raziel kain here no doubt was evidence moebius wished me to have for vampires had prophesied not one but two champions one destined to be nosgoth s redeemer other its destroyer vampires hero wielded reaver forged for this very purpose his opponent was clearly hero of their adversaries and brandished a flaming sword foretold outcome was unambiguous vampire hero would fall culminating in a final battle between two characters which raziel wins raziel and will that knowledge sustain you you too are going to your death moebius for a true servant of one god death is never bitter i will go again at peace with knowledge that i have played my small part in our master s plans kain is at last destroyed and you have carried out deed which hero do you think you are now vampire savior or other one have you realized yet that it didn t matter to us which one either of you thought you were so long as result was same in end and now kain is dead really i cannot thank you enough it is discovered that elder god is malevolent and he and moebius his servant had conspired against kain from outset of series considering vampires an abomination kain this history in part i knew already how as vampires began to die out pillars summoned human guardians to fulfill their roles it seemed ancient vampires had adopted and when necessary abducted human guardians and made vampires of them when they came of age until humans rebelled against their masters and here i made a surprising discovery it was moebius time streamer and mortanius guardian of death who led bloody revolt now i understood why moebius hated me so intensely i was first vampire guardian in all these centuries and he knew what my coming signified or perhaps i reminded him of all he had forsaken raziel i had seen this symbol throughout these ruins i should have realized what it was they worshiped now there was no question for this scene depicted ancient vampires torment and despair as their curse cast them from wheel of fate so this was god whose abandonment had driven them to madness and suicide finally i understood it was not their bloodthirst but their immortality that was true nature of their enemies curse wisest strongest most noble race by voice of that old parasite but i had seen him and whatever he was he was no god kain after being presumed dead returns moebius master my apologies a momentary oversight somehow kain still lives and has unexpectedly dispatched me make use of your good servant and and reconciles with raziel who willingly enters soul reaver raziel soul reaver pure of all corruption this is what it is for this is what i am for two become one both soul reavers together and scion of balance is healed and i am not your enemy not your destroyer i am as before your right hand your sword kain no raziel this can t be way raziel and now you will see true enemy as he does so he uses his powers to cleanse kain of corruption he inherited at birth as a pillar guardian armed with ancient sword once again kain is able to see and battle elder god for first time but is unable to destroy him elder god you cannot destroy me kain i am engine of life itself wheel will turn plague of your kind will be purged from this world and on that inevitable day your wretched stagnant soul will finally be mine kain in meantime you d best burrow deep story ends as he looks out at nosgoth landscape though uncertain that he can ever restore world he contemplates raziel s sacrifice and first bitter taste of hope it has given him kain now at last masks had fallen away strings of puppets had become visible and hands of prime mover exposed most ironic of all was last gift that raziel had given me more powerful than sword that now held his soul more acute even than vision his sacrifice had accorded me first bitter taste of that terrible illusion hope cultural impact merchandise and promotion several action figures and figurines of kain have been created by blue box interactive and national entertainment collectibles association in partnership with eidos he featured extensively in marketing for legacy of kain series including a 1 million advertising campaign for soul reaver beyond games he also appeared in top cow s promotional comics for soul reaver and defiance and was included alongside raziel as a playable character in downloadable content for 2010 s lara croft and guardian of light reception opinion on kain s character has been largely positive in critical reviews of legacy of kain games praise has frequently been directed towards simon templeman s voice acting with ign game revolution and adrenaline vault citing kain s soliloquies as both gruesome and entertaining best part of game s audio and one of best stints of voice acting ever recorded respectively in their assessments of his debut in original blood omen for blood omen 2 although critics expressed disappointment with game itself they praised kain s character nevertheless gamespot s greg kasavin branded him a very intriguing protagonist and as memorable of a main character as they come while ign s douglass c perry felt he was incredibly likeable and in a very true sense a great videogame character gamezone s michael knutson opined that he was a wicked cool character and game revolution s johnny liu named him a great anti hero kasavin again praised him in a review for defiance writing that it s rare enough to find a truly memorable main character in a game let alone two and that game s ensemble cast to some extent superseded problems in gameplay ian dransfield of play has stated that we totally and completely fell in love with kain and highlighted him as a character who needs to be revived kain has also appeared in contention on several lists comparing video game characters both critical and user decided a 2000 gamespot readers choice poll to determine top ten video game villains ranked him at 10 and same site s 2010 all time greatest game villain contest included him as one of 64 candidates he featured in ign s 2005 battle of badasses surviving to elite eight stage before being eliminated a 2008 ign reader s choice poll determined that he ranked among ten heroes most desired to appear in a soulcalibur game and he appeared in an ign list of gaming s most notorious anti heroes sharing both honors with raziel he ranked as 34 in ign s top 100 videogame villains list was showcased as 2 on a 1up com list of top five videogame characters named kain kane and ranked as 4 on latter site s list of top ten vampires gamedaily ranked him as 17 out of their top 25 anti heroes and gamingbolt listed him as one of 35 characters we want to see in sony s super smash bros joystick division included him as 2 on their list of top ten best vampires in video game history while diehard gamefan named him 8 on theirs gamesradar praised kain s role as an antagonist putting him in their 2013 list of best villains in video game history at 59 but noted that he lives in more of a grey area than most of villains on this list some reviewers were less enthusiastic about aspects of character with ign s perry commenting that his soul reaver 2 dialogue was haughty and overwritten and ivan sulic considering his blood omen 2 incarnation nothing more than an arrogant jerk with little to latch on to and care about while expressing preference for raziel also relating to blood omen 2 ign s aaron boulding regarded his pompous nature as his one personality trait and considered it comedic while matt casamassina felt kain was cool but decried his visual design as flamboyant to point of being comical see also list of legacy of kain characters references external links kain at legacy of kain dark chronicle category action adventure game characters category
