several parts dissidia 012 has been well received with publications calling it one of best playstation portable games gameplay gameplay is largely reminiscent of dissidia final fantasy along with a few changes game consists primarily of one on one battles taking place on what is known as a battle map where two characters duel players are able to perform two types of attacks a bravery attack and an hp attack both characters start with a set amount of bravery points number of bravery points being equivalent to amount of damage dealt by an hp attack thus player must perform several bravery attacks to steal bravery points from opponent so as to increase power of their hp attack as bravery attacks do not cause any damage additional mechanics mechanics of battle system include ex revenge and assist ex mode functions exactly same as first game by collecting ex cores around battle map to fill up ex gauge and transform character into a more powerful state which allows players to perform a powerful ex burst attack should an hp attack land during ex mode assist system is a new element to game which allows player to summon an additional ally into battle to either assist in attacking enemy or defend from an oncoming attack it is performed using assist gauge which is built up by using bravery attacks both modes are supposed to balance each other because when an ex burst is executed opponent s assist gauge is reduced to zero three main countering systems are assist breaks ex breaks and ex revenge an assist break is performed by attacking opponent s assist character while player is in ex mode causing him her to be unable to call out assist character for a brief period this also passes stage s bravery points to character an ex break is performed by stopping an opponent s ex mode through use of an assist attack which forces opponent out of ex mode additionally passing stage s bravery points to player lastly ex revenge occurs when trying to activate ex mode while being attacked while in first game it would simply halt opponent s attack it now slows down time allowing player to pummel opponent instead though it sacrifices player s ability to use an ex burst as it uses up entire ex gauge single player mode thumb left a screenshot showing single player mode of game game s world map with new characters lightning kain and tifa as three member party biggest
