thumb 400px roman painting from house of giuseppe ii pompeii early 1st century ad most likely depicting cleopatra vii wearing her royal diadem consuming poison in an act of suicide while her son caesarion also wearing a royal diadem stands behind her death of cleopatra vii last ruler of ptolemaic egypt occurred on either 10 or 12 august 30 bc in alexandria when she was 39 years old according to popular belief cleopatra committed suicide by allowing an asp egyptian cobra to bite her according to greek and roman historians cleopatra poisoned herself using either a toxic ointment or sharp implement such as a hairpin primary source accounts are derived mainly from works of ancient roman historians strabo plutarch and cassius dio modern scholars debate validity of ancient reports involving snakebites as cause of death and if she was murdered or not some academics hypothesize that her roman political rival octavian forced her to commit suicide in manner of her choosing location of cleopatra s tomb is unknown it was recorded that octavian allowed for her and her husband roman politician and general mark antony who stabbed himself with a sword to be buried together properly cleopatra s death effectively ended final war of roman republic between triumvirs octavian and antony in which cleopatra aligned herself with antony father to three of her children antony and cleopatra fled to egypt following their loss at 31 bc battle of actium in roman greece after which octavian invaded egypt and defeated their forces committing suicide allowed her to avoid humiliation of being paraded as a prisoner in a roman triumph celebrating military victories of octavian who would become rome s first emperor in 27 bc and be known as augustus octavian had cleopatra s son caesarion also known as ptolemy xv rival heir of julius caesar killed in egypt but spared her children with antony and brought them to rome cleopatra s death marked end of hellenistic period and ptolemaic rule of egypt as well as beginning of roman egypt which became a province of roman empire notes that hellenistic period beginning with reign of alexander great 336 323 bc came to an end with death of cleopatra in 30 bc michael grant stresses that hellenistic greeks were viewed by contemporary romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since age of classical greece an attitude that has continued even into works of modern historiography in regards to hellenistic egypt grant argues that cleopatra vii looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time was not likely to make same mistake but she and her contemporaries of first century bc had another peculiar problem of their own could hellenistic age which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time still be said to exist at all could any greek age now that romans were dominant power this was a question never far from cleopatra s mind but it is quite certain that she considered greek epoch to be by no means finished and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation death of cleopatra has been depicted in various works of art throughout history these include visual literary and performance arts ranging from sculptures and paintings to poetry and plays as well as modern films cleopatra featured prominently in prose and poetry of ancient latin literature while surviving ancient roman depictions of her death in visual arts are rare medieval renaissance baroque and modern works are numerous ancient greco roman sculptures such as esquiline venus and sleeping ariadne served as inspirations for later artworks portraying her death universally involving snakebite of an asp cleopatra s death has evoked themes of eroticism and sexuality in works that include paintings plays and films especially from victorian era modern works depicting cleopatra s death include neoclassical sculpture orientalist painting and cinema prelude thumb 300px cleopatra and mark antony on obverse and reverse respectively of a silver tetradrachm struck at antioch mint in 36 bc following first triumvirate and assassination of julius caesar in 44 bc roman statesmen octavian mark antony and aemilius lepidus were elected as triumvirs to bring caesar s assassins to justice forming second triumvirate with lepidus marginalized in africa and eventually placed under house arrest by octavian two remaining triumvirs divided control over roman world between greek east and latin west antony taking former and octavian latter cleopatra vii of ptolemaic egypt a pharaoh of macedonian greek descent who ruled from alexandria had an extramarital affair with julius caesar that produced a son and eventual ptolemaic co ruler caesarion after caesar s death she developed a relationship with antony with encouragement from cleopatra antony officially divorced octavian s sister octavia minor in 32 bc it is likely he had already married cleopatra during donations of alexandria in 34 bc says that it is unclear if antony and cleopatra were ever truly married says that marriage publicly sealed antony s alliance with cleopatra and in defiance of octavian he would divorce octavia in 32 bc coins of antony and cleopatra depict them in typical manner of a hellenistic royal couple as explained by antony s divorce from octavia octavian s public revelation of antony s will outlining cleopatra s ambitions for roman territory in donations of alexandria and her continued illegal military support for a roman citizen currently without an elected office convinced roman senate now under octavian s control to declare war on cleopatra following their defeat in naval battle of actium at ambracian gulf of greece in 31 bc cleopatra and antony retreated back to egypt to recuperate and prepare for an assault by octavian whose forces grew larger with surrender of many of antony s officers and soldiers in greece for further validation see and after a long period of failed negotiations octavian s forces invaded egypt in spring of 30 bc while octavian captured pelousion near eastern borders of ptolemaic egypt his officer cornelius gallus marched from cyrene and captured paraitonion to west although antony was able to score a small victory over octavian s tired troops as they approached alexandria s hippodrome on 1 august 30 bc his naval fleet and cavalry defected to octavian soon afterwards suicide of antony and cleopatra with octavian s forces in alexandria cleopatra withdrew to her tomb with her closest attendants and had a message sent to antony that she had committed suicide antony ordered his slave eros to murder him but instead eros turned his sword on himself and committed suicide in despair antony stabbed himself through stomach with a sword dying at age 53 in plutarch s telling antony was still alive as he was carried into cleopatra s tomb telling her in his dying words that he would die honorably and that she could trust a certain gaius proculeius on octavian s side to treat her well same proculeius used a ladder to breach a window of cleopatra s tomb and detain her inside before she could have a chance to commit suicide or burn herself to death along with her vast treasure cleopatra was allowed to embalm antony s body before she was forcefully escorted to palace where she eventually met with octavian who had also detained three of her children alexander helios cleopatra selene ii and ptolemy philadelphus as related by livy in her meeting with octavian cleopatra told him candidly i will not be led in a triumph but octavian only gave cryptic answer that her life would be spared he did not offer her any specific details about his plans for egypt or her royal family when a spy informed cleopatra that octavian intended to bring her back to rome to be paraded as a prisoner in his roman triumph she decided to avoid this humiliation and took her own life at age 39 in august 30 bc for further validation see and plutarch elaborates how cleopatra approached her suicide in an almost ritual process that involved bathing and then a fine meal including figs brought to her in a basket thumb left cleopatra and octavian a painting by louis 1787 plutarch writes that octavian ordered his freedman to guard her and prevent her from committing suicide nevertheless cleopatra was able to deceive him and kill herself when octavian received a note from cleopatra requesting that she be buried next to antony he had his messengers rush to her servant broke down her door but was too late plutarch states that she was found with her handmaidens iras dying at her feet and charmion adjusting cleopatra s diadem before she herself fell for primary source translations of plutarch s account of deaths of charmion and iras see and it is unclear from primary sources if their suicides took place within palace or inside cleopatra s tomb cassius dio claims that octavian called on trained snake charmers of tribe of ancient libya to attempt an oral venom extraction and revival of cleopatra but their efforts failed although octavian was outraged by these events and was robbed of full splendor of his victory according to cassius dio he had cleopatra interred next to antony in their tomb as requested and also gave iras and charmion proper burials date of death thumb 300px a coin of cleopatra vii struck in 31 bc year she and mark antony lost battle of actium showing her wearing royal diadem there are no surviving records dating cleopatra s death theodore cressy skeat deduced that she died on 12 august 30 bc on basis of contemporary records of fixed events along with cross examination of historical sources his supposition is supported by stanley m burstein james grout and aidan dodson and dyan although latter are more cautious by qualifying it was circa 12 august an alternative date of 10 august 30 bc is supported by scholars such as duane w roller joann fletcher and anderson cause of death thumb left a steel engraving depicting caesar augustus now lost painting of cleopatra vii in encaustic which was discovered at emperor hadrian s villa near tivoli italy in 1818 she is seen here wearing golden radiant crown of ptolemaic rulers and an isis knot corresponding to plutarch s description of her wearing robes of isis cleopatra s personal physician olympos cited by plutarch mentioned neither a cause of death nor an asp bite or egyptian cobra historian duane w roller in provides a thorough explanation of various claims about cleopatra s cause of death in roman historiography and primary sources he states unequivocally that olympos did not describe any cause of death only that plutarch discussed cause of death only after he was finished relaying report by olympos introducing tale of asp bite in such a way that he expected his readers to have already had foreknowledge about it on other hand claims that olympos theorized about cleopatra s cause of death as being caused by an asp bite or toxic ointment strabo who provides earliest known historical account believed that cleopatra committed suicide either by asp bite or poisonous ointment for further validation see plutarch mentions tale of asp brought to her in a basket of figs although he offers other alternatives for her cause of death such as use of a hollow implement perhaps a hairpin which she used to scratch open skin and introduce toxin according to cassius dio small puncture wounds were found on cleopatra s arm but he echoed claim by plutarch that nobody knew true cause of her death dio mentioned claim of asp and even suggested use of a needle possibly from a hairpin which would seem to corroborate plutarch s account other contemporary historians such as florus and velleius paterculus supported asp bite version roman physician galen mentioned asp story but he advances a version where cleopatra bit her arm and introduced venom brought in a container suetonius relayed story of asp but expressed doubt about its validity cause of cleopatra s death was rarely mentioned and debated in early modern scholarship encyclopedic writer thomas browne in his 1646 pseudodoxia epidemica explained that it was uncertain how cleopatra had died and that artistic depictions of small snakes biting her failed to accurately show larger size of land asp in 1717 anatomist giovanni battista morgagni maintained a brief recreational literary correspondence with papal physician giovanni maria lancisi about queen s cause of death as referenced in morgagni s 1761 de and published as a series of epistles in his 1764 opera omnis morgagni argued that cleopatra was likely killed by a snakebite and contested lancisi s suggestion that consumption of venom was more plausible noting that no ancient greco roman authors had mentioned her drinking it lancisi rebutted by arguing that accounts offered by roman poets were unreliable since they often exaggerated events in his literary memoirs published in 1777 physician jean supported morgagni s argument of snakebite being most probable cause of death thumb cleopatra by benedetto gennari 1674 1675 modern scholars have also cast doubt on story of venomous snakebite as cause of death roller notes prominence of snakes in egyptian mythology while also asserting that no surviving historical account discusses difficulty of smuggling a large egyptian cobra into cleopatra s chambers and then having it behave as intended william maloney clinical associate professor at new york university concurs with this assessment noting incredible weight of these reptiles but states that their venom is very powerful whereas roller claims venom is only fatal if injected into a vital area of body egyptologist wilhelm 1870 1930 argued that cleopatra s choice of suicide by asp bite was one that befitted her royal status asp representing uraeus sacred serpent of ancient egyptian sun god ra robert a gurval associate professor of classics at ucla points out that athenian strategos demetrios of phaleron c 350 c 280 bc confined by ptolemy ii philadelphus in egypt committed suicide by asp bite in a curiously similar manner one that also demonstrated that it was not exclusive to egyptian royalty for further validation that demetrios of phaleron adviser to ptolemy i soter died from an asp bite see gurval notes that bite of an egyptian cobra contains around 175 300 mg of neurotoxin lethal to humans with only 15 20 mg although death would not have been immediate as victims usually stay alive for several hours francois pieter retief retired lecturer and dean of medicine at university of free state and louise cilliers honorary research fellow at their department of greek latin and classical studies argue that a large snake would not have fit into a basket of figs and it was more likely that poisoning would have so rapidly killed three adult women cleopatra and her handmaidens charmion and iras noting example of cleopatra s hairpin cilliers and retief also highlight how other ancient figures poisoned themselves in similar ways including demosthenes hannibal and mithridates vi of pontus according to gregory lecturer in history of medicine at democritus university of thrace and markos associate professor of anatomy at university of thessaly evidence suggests that octavian ordered poisoning of cleopatra their claim of alleged murder by octavian is supported by other authors such as maloney in murder of cleopatra criminal profiler pat brown argues that cleopatra was murdered and details of it were covered up by roman authorities claims that she was murdered contradict majority of primary sources that report her cause of death as suicide historian patricia southern speculates that octavian could have possibly allowed cleopatra to choose manner of her death instead of executing her grout writes that octavian may have wanted to avoid sort of sympathy espoused for cleopatra s younger sister arsinoe iv when she was paraded in chains but spared during julius caesar s triumph octavian perhaps permitted cleopatra to die by her own hand after considering political issues that could have risen from murder of a queen whose statue had been erected in temple of venus genetrix by his adoptive father caesar aftermath during her final days cleopatra had caesarion sent away to upper egypt and perhaps planned for him to eventually flee to nubia ethiopia or india in exile caesarion reigned as ptolemy xv for only eighteen days when he was captured and executed on octavian s orders on 29 august 30 bc this was done following advice of alexandrian greek philosopher arius didymus who cautioned that two rival heirs to julius caesar could not share world together deaths of cleopatra and caesarion marked end of both ptolemaic dynasty s rule of egypt and hellenistic period which had lasted since reign of alexander great r 336 323 bc egypt became a province of newly established roman empire with octavian renamed in 27 bc as augustus first roman emperor for further validation see ruling with facade of a roman republic roller affirms that caesarion s alleged reign was essentially a fiction invented by chroniclers of egypt such as clement of alexandria in his stromata to explain gap between cleopatra s death and induction of egypt as a roman province directly ruled by octavian as pharaoh of egypt for further information see plutarch translated by wrote in vague terms that octavian had caesarion killed later after cleopatra s death contrary to regular roman provinces octavian established egypt as territory under his personal control barring roman senate from intervening in any of its affairs and appointing his own equestrian governors of egypt first of whom was cornelius gallus for further information see and antony s three children with cleopatra were spared and sent to rome their daughter cleopatra selene ii eventually married juba ii of mauretania tomb of antony and cleopatra site of mausoleum of cleopatra and mark antony is uncertain egyptian antiquities service believes that it is in or near a temple of taposiris magna southwest of alexandria in their excavations of temple of osiris at taposiris magna archaeologists kathleen martinez and zahi hawass have discovered six burial chambers and their artifacts including forty coins minted by cleopatra and antony as well as an alabaster bust depicting cleopatra an alabaster mask with a cleft chin discovered at site bears a resemblance to ancient portraits of mark antony in an early 1st century ad painting from house of giuseppe ii in pompeii a rear wall depicted with a set of double doors positioned very high above scene of a woman wearing a royal diadem and committing suicide among her attendants suggests described layout of cleopatra s tomb in alexandria depictions in art and literature hellenistic and roman eras thumb 400px cleopatra committing suicide fresco from house of giuseppe ii pompeii 1st century ad in his triumphal procession at rome in 29 bc octavian paraded cleopatra s children alexander helios and cleopatra selene ii but he also presented an effigy to crowd depicting cleopatra with an asp clinging to her this was likely same painting discovered in emperor hadrian s villa in 1818 now lost but described in an archaeological report and depicted in a steel engraving by john sartain poet propertius an eyewitness of octavian s triumph along via sacra noted that paraded image of cleopatra contained multiple snakes biting each of her arms citing plutarch giuseppe pucci indicates that effigy may have even been a statue in his notes i 1989 french archaeologist jean claude grenier observed that an ancient roman statue of a woman wearing a knot of isis in vatican museums portrays a snake crawling up her right breast perhaps a depiction of cleopatra s suicide while dressed as egyptian goddess isis cleopatra s association with isis continued in egypt after her death at least until 373 ad when egyptian scribe petesenufe compiled a book of isis and explained how he decorated images of cleopatra with gold a mid 1st century bc roman wall painting from pompeii most likely depicting cleopatra with her infant son caesarion was walled off by its owner around 30 bc perhaps in reaction to octavian s proscription against images depicting caesarion rival heir of julius caesar although statues of mark antony were torn down those of cleopatra were generally spared this program of destruction including one erected by caesar in temple of venus genetrix in forum of caesar an early 1st century ad painting from pompeii most likely depicts suicide of cleopatra accompanied by attendants and even her son caesarion wearing a royal diadem like his mother although an asp is absent from scene perhaps reflecting different causes of death provided in roman historiography for further information about painting in house of giuseppe ii i e joseph ii at pompeii and possible identification of cleopatra as one of figures see some posthumous images of cleopatra meant for common consumption were perhaps less flattering a roman terracotta lamp in british museum made circa 40 80 ad contains a relief depicting a nude woman with queen s distinct hairstyle in it she holds a palm branch rides an egyptian crocodile and sits on a large phallus in a scene story of asp was widely accepted among augustan period latin poets such as horace and virgil in which two snakes were even suggested as biting cleopatra although retaining negative views of cleopatra apparent in other pro augustan roman literature horace depicted cleopatra s suicide as a bold act of defiance and liberation virgil established view of cleopatra as a figure of epic melodrama and romance medieval renaissance and baroque periods story of cleopatra s suicide by snakebite was often depicted in medieval and renaissance art artist known as boucicaut master in a 1409 ad miniature for an illuminated manuscript of des cas de nobles hommes et femmes by 14th century ad poet giovanni boccaccio depicted cleopatra and antony lying together in a gothic style tomb with a snake near cleopatra s chest and a bloody sword driven through antony s chest illustrated versions of boccaccio s written works including images of cleopatra and antony committing suicide first appeared in france during quattrocento i e 15th century ad authored by laurent de woodcut illustrations of boccaccio s de mulieribus claris published at ulm in 1479 and augsburg in 1541 depict cleopatra s discovery of antony s body after his suicide by stabbing like much of medieval literature about cleopatra boccaccio s writings are largely negative and misogynistic 14th century poet geoffrey chaucer counters these depictions offering a positive view of cleopatra chaucer began his hagiography on virtuous pagan women with life of cleopatra depicted in a satirical fashion as a queen engaged in courtly love with her knight mark antony his depiction of her suicide included a pit of serpents rather than roman tale of asps thumb upright left cleopatra by michelangelo c 1535 free standing nude depictions of cleopatra poisoned by an asp became common curing italian renaissance 16th century venetian artist giovanni maria padovano i e mosca created two marble reliefs of suicide of antony and cleopatra as well as several free standing nude statues of cleopatra being bitten by asp that were partly inspired by ancient roman sculptures such as esquiline venus as outlined by scholars debate whether or not esquiline venus discovered in 1874 on esquiline hill in rome and housed in palazzo dei of capitoline museums is a depiction of cleopatra based on hairstyle and facial features of woman in sculpture her apparent royal diadem worn over head and uraeus egyptian cobra wrapped around a vase or column at base as explained by esquiline venus is generally thought to be a mid 1st century ad roman copy of a 1st century bc greek original from school of pasiteles bartolommeo bandinelli created a drawing of cleopatra as a free standing nude committing suicide that served as basis for a similar engraving by agostino veneziano another engraving by veneziano and a drawing by raphael depicting cleopatra s suicide as she were inspired by ancient greco roman sleeping ariadne which at time was thought to depict cleopatra works of french renaissance also depict cleopatra slumbering while pressing a snake to her breast michelangelo created a black chalk drawing of cleopatra s suicide by asp bite around 1535 17th century baroque painter guido reni depicted cleopatra s death by asp bite albeit with a snake that is tiny compared to a real egyptian cobra sleeping ariadne acquired by pope julius ii in 1512 inspired three poems of renaissance literature eventually carved into pilaster frame of statue first of these was published by baldassare castiglione which became widely circulated by 1530 and inspired other two poems by bernardino baldi and agostino castiglione s poem depicted cleopatra as a tragic but honorable ruler in a doomed love affair with antony a queen whose death freed her from ignominy of roman imprisonment sleeping ariadne was also commonly depicted in paintings including those by titian artemisia and edward burne jones these works tended to moment of cleopatra s death while victorian era artists found unconscious recumbent female form as an acceptable outlet for their eroticism cleopatra s death features in several works of performing arts in 1607 play devil s charter by barnabe barnes a snake handler brings two asps to cleopatra and allows them to bite both her breasts in a racy manner in william shakespeare s 1609 play antony and cleopatra snake represents both death as well as a lover who cleopatra desires yielding to his pinch shakespeare relied on thomas north s 1579 translation of plutarch for crafting his play which can be viewed as both a comedy and a tragedy play involved use of multiple asps as well as character of charmion who killed herself by asp bite after cleopatra modern era in modern literature ted hughes poem cleopatra to asp 1960 creates a monologue of cleopatra speaking to asp that is about to kill her during victorian era plays such as cleopatre 1890 by victorien sardou became popular although audiences were generally shocked by emotional intensity of stage actress sarah bernhardt s depiction of cleopatra reacting to antony s suicide in opera samuel barber s antony and cleopatra first performed in 1966 and based on shakespeare s play cleopatra recounts a dream that antony now dead before her would become emperor of rome when informs her that caesar intends to march her in his triumph in rome

caucasian features perhaps in keeping with cleopatra s recorded lineage as a macedonian greek affirms that to give cleopatra a white complexion is quite correct given her macedonian descent in
