cyclone percy was seventh named storm of 2004 05 south pacific cyclone season and fourth and final severe tropical cyclone to form during 2004 05 south pacific cyclone season cyclone percy originated as a tropical disturbance on february 23 over course of next few days system organized while moving east southeastward before intensifying into a category 1 tropical cyclone on australian region scale on february 26 system quickly intensified reaching category 4 status later that day on next day percy was steered southward by a blocking ridge of high pressure while stretched out structure of storm into an elliptical shape weakening it back to category 3 status afterward storm rapidly reintensified reaching its peak intensity as a category 5 tropical cyclone on march 2 afterward percy encountered increasing wind shear and weakened once again turning southeastward on next day on march 5 percy transitioned into an extratropical storm before dissipating soon afterward percy was also most damaging of south pacific february cyclones that year as it battered cook islands which were still recovering from impacts of cyclones meena nancy and olaf percy then devastated island of tokelau leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages although exact damage figures are unavailable because of warnings in anticipation of storm there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries meteorological history during february 23 fiji meteorological service reported that tropical disturbance 10f had developed within monsoon trough about to west of tuvaluan atoll of funafuti system was then located just south of a 250 hpa ridge axis in a region wind shear and diurnal variations were evidently influencing development sea surface temperatures sst were around 31 degc later on february 24 shear had decreased markedly outflow was favorable and developing in all quadrants overnight tropical depression underwent explosive development with deep convection increasing spatially and in organization while cooling spiral bands were also wrapping tightly around low level circulation center since depression was located in an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures storm was able to quickly strengthen into tropical storm percy by 1800 utc on february 24 at this point in time percy was located east of tuvalu and was moving towards east southeast at 14 kt 16 mph 26 km h on february 26 percy reached category 1 status while located 400 miles 644 km north of american samoa while percy moved east southeast a shortwave trough developed southwest of storm trough caused cyclone to intensify even further to a category 3 storm as it passed between and swains island percy then reached its initial peak at category 4 status north of pago pago as its winds reached over 135 mph 115 knots 213 km h and barometric pressure at its center fell to 925 millibars on february 27 cyclone percy encountered a ridge of high pressure which slowed its forward speed because of this cyclone s structure became elliptical which caused cyclone to weaken back to category 3 status percy report retrieved june 12 2006 by february 28 percy bypassed pukapuka and nassau islands as a category 3 tropical cyclone as it continued to move south southeastward by then cyclone was re organizing as storm was steered to southeast on march 2 percy reached its peak intensity with sustained winds reached 160 mph 140 knots 265 km h on saffir simpson hurricane scale and an estimated barometric pressure of 900 millibars cyclone percy maintained category 5 status for 18 hours while located 110 mi 177 km west of palmerston island after reaching category 5 status percy began to weaken due to increasing wind shear during its weakening phase cyclone percy passed south of tropical depression 20s pulled by an upper level trough percy swung to east passing tropical depression 24s in process before being caught up by another trough by march 4 center of percy became detached from main area of convection and percy quickly weakened to a tropical storm tropical storm percy then quickly accelerated to 20 kt 23 mph 37 km h as it became an extratropical storm percy briefly entered new zealand area of responsibility before becoming extratropical at 1200 utc by march 5 remnants of percy finally dissipated 700 miles 1127 km southwest of rarotonga monthly global

evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in rarotonga forecasters also predicted that percy was going to cause a strong storm surge joint typhoon warning center and noaa also predicted that storm was going to strengthen further within 12 24 hours in addition forecast models predicted that cyclone percy would take a similar track like cyclone olaf weeks earlier that prompted officials in southern cook islands to order evacuations ap warning 5 retrieved 12 june 2006 effects severe tropical cyclone percy impacted tokelau samoa american samoa as well as northern and
