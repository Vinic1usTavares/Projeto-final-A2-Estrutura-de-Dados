biscayne national park is an american national park in southern florida south of miami park preserves biscayne bay and its offshore barrier reefs ninety five percent of park is water and shore of bay is location of an extensive mangrove forest park covers and includes elliott key park s largest island and northernmost of true florida keys formed from fossilized coral reef islands farther north in park are transitional islands of coral and sand offshore portion of park includes northernmost region of florida reef one of largest coral reefs in world biscayne national park protects four distinct ecosystems shoreline mangrove swamp shallow waters of biscayne bay coral limestone keys and offshore florida reef shoreline swamps of mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish molluscs and crustaceans bay waters harbor immature and adult fish seagrass beds sponges soft corals and manatees keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish pelagic birds whales and hard corals sixteen endangered species including schaus swallowtail butterflies smalltooth sawfish manatees and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in park biscayne also has a small population of threatened american crocodiles and a few american alligators people of glades culture inhabited biscayne bay region as early as 10 000 years ago before rising sea levels filled bay tequesta people occupied islands and shoreline from about 4 000 years before present to 16th century when spanish took possession of florida reefs claimed ships from spanish times through 20th century with more than 40 documented wrecks within park s boundaries while park s islands were farmed during 19th and early 20th centuries their rocky soil and periodic hurricanes made agriculture difficult to sustain in early 20th century islands became secluded destinations for wealthy miamians who built getaway homes and social clubs mark c honeywell s guesthouse on boca chita key that featured a mock lighthouse was area s most elaborate private retreat cocolobo cay club was at various times owned by miami developer carl g fisher yachtsman garfield wood and president richard nixon s friend bebe rebozo and was visited by four united states presidents amphibious community of stiltsville established in 1930s in shoals of northern biscayne bay took advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during prohibition after cuban revolution of 1959 central intelligence agency and cuban exile groups used elliott key as a training ground for infiltrators into fidel castro s cuba originally proposed for inclusion in everglades national park biscayne bay was removed from proposed park to ensure everglades establishment area remained undeveloped until 1960s when a series of proposals were made to develop keys in manner of miami beach and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on mainland shore of biscayne bay through 1960s and 1970s two fossil fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on bay shores a backlash against development led to 1968 designation of biscayne national monument preserved area was expanded by its

covered by mangrove forest park includes southern portion of biscayne bay with areas of thin sediment called and vegetated seagrass meadows supporting turtlegrass and shoal grass as a result of efforts to control water resources in florida and projects to drain everglades during early and mid 20th century water flow into biscayne bay has been altered by construction of canals these canals channel water from portions of southeastern everglades now used for agriculture into bay prior to canal construction most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater but canals are now altering salinity profile of bay conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into biscayne aquifer comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp was established in 2000 to mitigate effects of human intervention into natural water flow of everglades primarily aimed at restoration of historical patterns of water flow into everglades national park project will also deal with issues arising from diversion of water out of southern everglades into biscayne bay npca p 2 biscayne bay coastal wetlands project is a cerp component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that

art marshall opponents of industrialization proposed creation of a national park unit that would protect reefs islands and bay after initial skepticism park proposal obtained support of miami herald editors as well as florida congressman dante fascell and florida governor claude r kirk jr and were supported by lobbying efforts by sympathetic businessmen including herbert hoover jr one vision of islandia supported by land owners would have connected northern florida keys from key biscayne to key largo with bridges and created new islands using fill from seadade channel although miami area politicians and state of florida did not support ludwig s seadade plans islandia s supporters continued to lobby for development support in 1968 when it appeared area was about to become a national

reef composed of living corals is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish as well as molluscs crustaceans and worms every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations npca p 15 coral reefs are estimated to cover about half area of park with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank barrier reef npca p 18 hundreds of species of hard and soft corals sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into outer reef on edge of florida carbonate platform patch reefs between outer reef and keys and reefs in shoals on either side of keys offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to water depth and staghorn coral below 10 meters landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and porites finger corals harris tuttle tuttle pp 272 273 reef environments in biscayne national park have seen declines in species richness and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006 2007 a sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites a correlation has been posited between observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout florida reef tract and decline in fish species declines in populations were noted in both and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure algal cover has increased as coral has declined so coral dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in biscayne bay may also play a role while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples kellison et al pp 19 21 park s eastern boundary lies just beyond rise of offshore reef at ten fathom sea depth areas farther offshore are protected within florida keys national marine sanctuary which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding to a depth of offshore waters harbor brown pelicans magnificent frigatebirds brown boobies particularly around offshore lights and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels whales in offshore waters are rare but can include right whales humpback whales sperm whales fin whales and sei whales all of them endangered smalltooth sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals as well as pillar coral listed as endangered in florida exotic species thumb upright alt aerial view of safety valve shoals biscayne bay s safety valve is a natural outlet for storm surges more than 50 species of exotic plant have been documented in park with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter ecological balance green iguanas cane toads black rats lionfish fire ants oscars and brown basilisk lizards are common in park lionfish pterois and pterois miles is a tropical fish from indian pacific ocean area it is known for its voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters rapidly replacing other species researchers theorized introduction of this species in park occurred during hurricane andrew in 1992 sightings in biscayne bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums destroyed during hurricane though researcher who first proposed theory has since retracted assertion more recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in florida keys to south of park also likely originating from human captivity burmese pythons have been observed near park s boundary along mainland exotic plant species which pose highest risk to native plant communities include brazilian pepper torpedo grass tuberous sword fern guava and climate biscayne s tropical climate reflects its location in extreme south florida southern miami dade county is classified as tropical savanna in koppen geiger system seasons may be divided into november april dry season and may october wet season dry season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of wet season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of wet season roughly coincides with hurricane season with frequent thunderstorms like many locations in southern florida biscayne national park is affected by hurricanes every few years most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities a direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences primarily by its impact on human interventions in environment rather than on natural environment of park which is well adapted to these events harris tuttle tuttle p 268 significant hurricanes to strike biscayne include storms in 1835 and 1904 1906 florida keys hurricane 1926 miami hurricane 1929 bahamas hurricane 1935 labor day hurricane shumaker pp 58 59 1935 yankee hurricane 1941 florida hurricane 1945 southeast florida hurricane 1948 miami hurricane hurricane king in 1950 hurricane donna in 1960 hurricane cleo in 1964 and hurricane andrew in 1992 park can be affected by wave action from more distant tropical storms such as 2012 s hurricane sandy which damaged facilities on elliott key thumb alt satellite image of hurricane andrew hurricane andrew at landfall on biscayne bay on august 24 1992 hurricane andrew came ashore just south of miami passing directly across biscayne national park with maximum sustained winds of with gusts to storm surge was up to above mean sea level it was a compact category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale biscayne bay was affected by bottom scouring and turbidity and with damage to its fringes of mangrove forest leakage from damaged boats and marinas polluted bay with fuel with discharges continuing for nearly a month after hurricane s passage a commemorative plaque was placed at dante fascell visitor center in 2002 to commemorate human and environmental cost of andrew and to celebrate area s recovery from storm s effects inscription reads in part on monday august 24 1992 at 4 30 a m eye wall of hurricane andrew passed over this point before striking homestead and southern miami dade county fowey rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two minute wind speed of and a gust to before station ceased transmitting presumably due to damage from stronger gusts strongest part of eyewall had not reached fowey rocks when it stopped transmitting since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level they are vulnerable to rising sea levels park service studies project that much of park s land area will be lost in next two hundred years sea level in biscayne bay is projected to rise between by 2030 and by 2060 a sea level rise of is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into biscayne aquifer higher rises will make southern everglades a saltwater marsh altering ecology of region month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep
