peter production boruto was first announced in december 2014 by a post credits scene in last naruto movie kishimoto stated film would star son of naruto and hinata boruto uzumaki as well as sasuke and sakura s daughter sarada while not knowing what film would be about voice actress junko takeuchi was pleased with announcement while having too many thoughts about film kishimoto stated he was not sure what technique boruto would use in story director hiroyuki yamashita was added to project in december 2014 and masashi kishimoto began writing script following month yamashita said that he had felt pressured due to time constraints owing to movie s planned release date and had almost refused to direct it kishimoto explained that he felt he could rely on yamashita based on his work on animated adaptations of naruto manga studio pierrot kishimoto had originally envisioned film s storyline as a manga but did not feel there was enough time to complete it and chose to write a screenplay instead kishimoto requested that characters rely on hand to hand combat moves from taijutsu rather than regular ninja techniques from ninjutsu this was a change from previous naruto films kishimoto identified naruto s fights alongside sasuke against momoshiki as highlights of film and asked that film s staff pay close attention to those sequences he said that staff had very few ideas on how to advance story writer ukyo kodachi developed idea that boruto uzumaki s rasengan move becomes invisible when activated script was initially completed around end of january 2014 and was finalised a month later after a few corrections even though kishimoto had worked before on road to ninja 2012 and last 2014 this time he encountered various problems because of his greater involvement with boruto specifically writing script to prepare for boruto kishimoto said that he had read a book about process of creating screenplays he added that in boruto he paid tribute to several movies most notable being 1996 film rock and 2002 film spider man tribute to rock was mostly done by using which is a common way of structuring stories in japan kishimoto developed boruto and naruto s relationship based on his relationship with his own sons yamashita said some scenes had to be removed from film because of short time team had to develop boruto yamashita s favorite scene was sasuke s fight against kinshiki initial scene was also revised multiple times to reduce its length yamashita said they had to remove scenes that featured shikadai and other characters from film he also added that film s success was mostly due to many of kishimoto s ideas which staff liked one of earliest scenes kishimoto conceived for movie was that boruto would follow steps of sasuke uchiha rather than his father during ending while talking with sarada uchiha boruto was supposed to have another teacher but because sasuke had not made many appearances in previous films he took this place as kishimoto wanted him to have a larger role this is also a reference to piccolo and gohan from dragon ball manga series by akira toriyama director also conceived idea of boruto putting on a bandana to convince his mother hinata that he would aid his father and get approval to go with sasuke and all leaders of villages this scene from movie made deepest impression on kishimoto two other scenes written by staff that kishimoto enjoyed were sasuke s use of one of his taijutsu moves and combination of his susanoo technique and naruto s recreation of nine tailed fox kurama kishimoto felt cast s facial expressions were realistic which made film look more appealing in climax when naruto passes all his energy to boruto to create a giant rasengan yamashita added multiple flashbacks of naruto s past which kishimoto liked in developing naruto s role kishimoto felt it would not be entertaining to see him as a flawless father and instead decided to make him an incompetent one however he wanted naruto and boruto s bond strengthened during plot yuko sanpei was thankful for being offered this position and joked about how junko takeuchi became a father as her voice role was naruto initially sanpei recalls having difficulties voicing boruto when she received her script for film she began to understand boruto s concept as boy who loves his father dearly which helped her voice character better noriaki sugiyama expected to see a bond between his character sasuke and his student boruto audio thumb yasuharu takanashi with images of boruto behind alt a long black haired man wearing black
