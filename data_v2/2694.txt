1919 atlantic hurricane season was among least active hurricane seasons in atlantic on record featuring only five tropical storms of those five tropical cyclones two of them intensified into a hurricane with one strengthening into a major hurricane category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale two tropical depressions developed in month of june both of which caused negligible damage a tropical storm in july brought minor damage to pensacola florida but devastated a fleet of ships another two tropical depressions formed in august first of which brought rainfall to lesser antilles most intense tropical cyclone of season was florida keys hurricane many deaths occurred after ships capsized in bahamas florida keys and cuba strong winds left about 2 million in damage in key west after crossing gulf of mexico severe impact was reported in texas especially corpus christi area overall hurricane caused 828 fatalities and 22 million in damage 20 million of which was inflicted in texas alone three other tropical cyclones developed in september including two tropical storms and one tropical depression all of which left negligible impact on land final tropical system of season also did not affect land and became extratropical on november 15 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 55 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm one historical weather maps indicate a tropical wave in southeastern gulf of mexico on july 2 which developed into a tropical depression that day around 18 00 utc depression strengthened into a tropical storm moving north northwestward it peaked with maximum sustained winds winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of storm remained very small in diameter at all times at 11 00 utc on july 4 storm made landfall near navarre florida at same intensity early next day it weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating several hours later in pensacola florida auxiliary schooner nautilus of e e saunders fish company s fleet was destroyed resulting in 1 500 in

bahamas hurricane strengthened into a category 4 hurricane early following day it intensified further over straits of florida and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a minimum

360 km southeast of cape hatteras north carolina depression moved northeastward and detached from stationary front around 06 00 utc on september 2 it strengthened into a tropical storm system intensified into a hurricane early on following day later on september 3 storm strengthened into a category 2 hurricane and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph 155 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of thereafter storm weakened to a category 1 and a tropical storm on september 4 before becoming extratropical near cape breton island later that day this system was first identified as a hurricane by ivan tannehill in 1938 tropical storm four a tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression at 00 00 utc on september 29 while located about northeast of abaco islands in bahamas moving northwestward along periphery of a high pressure area depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day after peaking with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of storm curved west northwestward while approaching southeastern united states at 01 00 utc on october 1 system made landfall near st simons georgia cyclone weakened to a tropical

that time storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of later on november 12 it curved northwestward storm then turned east southeastward following day on november 14 system weakened and curved northeastward around 12 00 utc next day it became extratropical with remnants dissipating hours later tropical depressions in addition to five other tropical storms there were five tropical cyclones that remained a tropical depression first depression formed from a low pressure area just offshore belize on june 1 moving northward storm dissipated
