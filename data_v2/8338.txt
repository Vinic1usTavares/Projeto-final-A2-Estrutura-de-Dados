thumb right mother and child term maternal deprivation is a scientific term summarising early work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst john bowlby on effects of separating infants and young children from their mother or mother substitute although effect of loss of mother on developing child had been considered earlier by freud and other theorists bowlby s work on delinquent and affectionless children and effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write world health organization s report on mental health of homeless children in post war europe whilst he was head of department for children and parents at tavistock clinic in london after world war ii result was monograph maternal care and mental health published in 1951 which sets out maternal deprivation hypothesis bowlby drew together such empirical evidence as existed at time from across europe and us including spitz 1946 and goldfarb 1943 1945 his main conclusions that infant and young child should experience a warm intimate and continuous relationship with his mother or permanent mother substitute in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment and that not to do so might have significant and irreversible mental health consequences were both controversial and influential monograph was published in 14 different languages and sold over 400 000 copies in english version alone bowlby s work went beyond suggestions of otto rank and ian suttie that mothering care was essential for development and focused on potential outcomes for children deprived of such care 1951 who publication was highly influential in causing widespread changes in practices and prevalence of institutional care for infants and children and in changing practices relating to stays of small children in hospitals so that parents were allowed more frequent and longer visits although monograph was primarily concerned with removal of children from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen publication was also highly controversial with amongst others psychoanalysts psychologists and learning theorists and sparked significant debate and research on issue of children s early relationships limited empirical data and lack of comprehensive theory to account for conclusions in maternal care and mental health led to subsequent formulation of attachment theory by bowlby following publication of maternal care and mental health bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology ethology developmental psychology cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant s ties emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure bowlby claimed to have made good deficiencies of data and lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect in maternal care and mental health in his later work attachment and loss published between 1969 and 1980 although central tenet of maternal deprivation theory that children s experiences of interpersonal relationships are crucial to their psychological development and that formation of an ongoing relationship with child is as important a part of parenting as provision of experiences discipline and child care has become generally accepted maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome is not a concept that is much in current use other than in relation to severe deprivation as in failure to thrive in area of early relationships it has largely been superseded by attachment theory and other theories relating to even earlier infant parent interactions as a concept parental deficiencies are seen as a vulnerability factor for rather than a direct cause of later difficulties in relation to institutional care there has been a great deal of subsequent research on individual elements of privation deprivation understimulation and deficiencies that may arise from institutional care history scientific research has stressed grief of mothers over deprivation of their children but little has been said historically about young children s loss of their mothers this may have been because loss of mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast fed infant in 19th century french society a system in which infants were breast fed at homes of foster mothers returning to biological family after weaning and no concern was evinced at possible effect of this double separation on child sigmund freud may have been among first to stress potential effect of loss of mother on developing child but his concern was less with actual experience of maternal care than with anxiety child might feel about loss of nourishing breast as little of freud s theory was based on actual observations of infants little effort was made to consider effects of real experiences of loss thumb right sister irene at her new york foundling hospital in 1890s following freud s early speculations about infant experience with mother otto rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma rank stressed traumatic experience of birth as a separation from mother rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event not long after rank s introduction of this idea ian suttie a british physician whose early death limited his influence suggested that child s basic need is for mother love and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost in 1930s david levy noted a phenomenon he called primary affect hunger in children removed very early from their mothers and brought up in institutions and multiple foster homes these children though often pleasant on surface seemed indifferent underneath he questioned whether there could be a deficiency disease of emotional life comparable to a deficiency of vital nutritional elements within developing organism a few psychiatrists psychologists and paediatricians were also concerned by high mortality rate in hospitals and institutions obsessed with sterility to detriment of any human or nurturing contact with babies one rare paediatrician went so far as to replace a sign saying wash your hands twice before entering this ward with one saying do not enter this nursery without picking up a baby in a series of studies published in 1930s psychologist bill goldfarb noted not only deficits in ability to form relationships but also in iq of institutionalised children as compared to a matched group in foster care in another study conducted in 1930s harold skeels noting decline in iq in young orphanage children removed toddlers from a sterile orphanage and gave them to feeble minded institutionalised older girls to care for toddlers iq rose dramatically skeels study was attacked for lack of scientific rigour though he achieved belated recognition decades later rene spitz a psychoanalyst undertook research in 1930s and 40s on effects of maternal deprivation and hospitalism his investigation focused on infants who had experienced abrupt long term separation from familiar caregiver as for instance when mother was sent to prison these studies and conclusions were thus different from investigations of institutional rearing spitz adopted term depression to describe child s reaction of grief anger and apathy to partial emotional deprivation loss of a loved object and proposed that when love object is returned to child within three to five months recovery is prompt but after five months they will show symptoms of increasingly serious deterioration he called this reaction to total deprivation hospitalism he was also one of first to undertake direct observation of infants conclusions were hotly disputed and there was no widespread acceptance during years of world war ii evacuated and orphaned children were subjects of studies that outlined their reactions to separation including ability to cope by forming relationships with other children some of this material remained unpublished until post war period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children s reactions to loss bowlby who unlike most psychoanalysts had direct experience of working with deprived children through his work at london child guidance clinic called for more investigation of children s early lives in a paper published in 1940 he proposed that two environmental factors were paramount in early childhood first was death of mother or prolonged separation from her second was mother s emotional attitude towards her child karen j pp 26 29 this was followed by a study on forty four juvenile thieves collected through clinic there were many problematic parental behaviours in samples but bowlby was looking at one environmental factor that was easy to document namely prolonged early separations of child and mother of forty four thieves fourteen fell into category which bowlby characterised as being of an affectionless character of these fourteen twelve had suffered prolonged maternal separations as opposed to only two of control group an nih study published in 2011 examined impact of short non traumatic separation from child s primary caregiver subjects were infants separated from their primary caregiver for at least a week controlling for various factors including income stability and parenting style study found increased aggressiveness at ages 3 and 5 in separated infants but it did not find other cognitive impairment most infants in study stayed with close relatives or other parent often in infant s home suggesting that even in ideal circumstances maternal separation can have lasting detrimental impact on infant development maternal care and mental health bowlby s work on delinquent and affectionless children and effects of hospital and institutional care lead to his being commissioned to write world health organization s report on mental health of homeless children in post war europe whilst he was head of department for children and parents at tavistock clinic in london after world war ii bowlby travelled on continent and in america communicating with social workers paediatricians and child psychiatrists including those who had already published literature on issue these authors were mainly unaware of each other s work and bowlby was able to draw together findings and highlight similarities described despite variety of methods used ranging from direct observation to retrospective analysis to comparison groups in addition there was work from england undertaken by dorothy and anna freud on children separated from their families due to wartime disruption and bowlby s own work result was monograph maternal care and mental health published in 1951 which sets out maternal deprivation hypothesis who report was followed by publication of an abridged version for public consumption called child care and growth of love this book sold over half a million copies worldwide bowlby tackled not only institutional and hospital care but also policies of removing children from unwed mothers and untidy and physically neglected homes and lack of support for families in difficulties in a range of areas bowlby cited lack of adequate research and suggested direction this could take principal concepts of bowlby s theory quality of parental care was considered by bowlby to be of vital importance to child s development and future mental health it was believed to be essential that infant and young child should experience a warm intimate and continuous relationship with his mother or permanent mother substitute in which both found satisfaction and enjoyment given this relationship emotions of guilt and anxiety characteristics of mental illness when in excess would develop in an organised and moderate way naturally extreme emotions would be moderated and become amenable to control of child s developing personality he stated it is this complex rich and rewarding relationship with mother in early years varied in countless ways by relations with father and with siblings that child psychiatrists and many others now believe to underlie development of character and mental health left 280px thumb residential nursery state of affairs in which child did not have this relationship he termed maternal deprivation this term covered a range from almost complete deprivation not uncommon in institutions residential nurseries and hospitals to partial deprivation where mother or mother substitute was unable to give loving care a small child needs to mild deprivation where child was removed from mother s care but was looked after by someone familiar whom he trusted complete or almost complete deprivation could entirely cripple capacity to make relationships partial deprivation could result in acute anxiety depression neediness and powerful emotions which child could not regulate end product of such psychic disturbance could be neurosis and instability of character however main focus of monograph was on more extreme forms of deprivation focus was child s developing relationships with his mother and father and disturbed parent child relationships in context of almost complete deprivation rather than earlier concept of broken home as such in terms of social policy bowlby advised that parents should be supported by society as parents are dependent on a greater society for economic provision and if a community values its children it must cherish its parents also mothers of children under 3 should be supported to care for child at home rather than child be left in inadequate care whilst mother sought work it was assumed mother of illegitimate child would usually be left with child fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without mother should be provided with housekeepers so that children could remain at home other proposals included proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers and frank informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and how they felt about it rather than least said soonest mended approach point that children were loyal to and loved even worst of parents and needed to have that fact understood non was strongly made on issue of removal of children from their homes bowlby emphasised strength of tie that children feel towards their parents and discussed reason why as he put it children thrive better in bad homes than in good institutions he was strongly in favour of support being provided to parents and extended families to improve situation and provide care within family rather than removal if possible maternal bowlby used phrase mother or permanent mother substitute as it is commonly used term maternal deprivation is ambiguous as it is unclear whether deprivation is that of biological mother of an adoptive or foster mother a consistent caregiving adult of any gender or relationship to child of an emotional relationship or of experience of type of care called mothering in many cultures questions about exact meaning of this term are by no means new as following statement by mary ainsworth in 1962 indicates although in early months of life it is mother who almost invariably interacts most with child role of other figures especially father is acknowledged to be significant p deprivation has received scant attention in case of institutionalization term parental deprivation would have been more accurate for child has been deprived of interaction with a father figure as well as a mother figure it may be better to discourage use of term deprivation and encourage substitution of terms insufficiency discontinuity and distortion instead ainsworth implies neither word maternal nor word deprivation seems to be a literally correct definition of phenomenon under consideration a contemporary of ainsworth spoke of mother a term by which we mean both child s actual mother and or any other person of either sex who may take place of child s physical mother during a significant period of time however another contemporary referred to quasi mystical union of mother and child of dynamic union that mother and child represent influence on institutionalised care practical effects of publication of maternal care and mental health were described in preface to who 1962 publication deprivation of maternal care a reassessment of its effects as almost wholly beneficial with reference to widespread changes in institutional care of children right thumb 180px maternity ward 1955 practice of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became norm and there was a move towards placing homeless children with foster carers rather than in institutions and a move towards professionalisation of alternative carers in hospitals change was given added impetus by work of social worker and psychoanalyst james robertson who filmed distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with bowlby in making 1952 documentary film a two year old goes to hospital according to michael rutter importance of bowlby s initial writings on maternal deprivation lay in his emphasis that children s experiences of interpersonal relationships were crucial to their psychological development and that formation of an ongoing relationship with child was as important a part of parenting as provision of experiences discipline and child care although this view was rejected by many at time argument focussed attention on need to consider parenting in terms of consistency of caregivers over time and parental sensitivity to children s individuality and it is now generally accepted bowlby s theory sparked considerable interest and controversy in nature of early relationships and gave a strong impetus to what mary ainsworth described as a great body of research in what was perceived as an extremely difficult and complex area psychoanalysis bowlby departed from psychoanalytical theory which saw gratification of sensory needs as basis for relationship between infant and mother food was seen as primary drive and relationship or dependency was secondary he had already found himself in conflict with dominant theories that children s emotional problems are almost entirely due to fantasies generated from internal conflict between aggressive and libidinal drives rather than to events in external world his breach with psychoanalysts only became total and irreparable after his later development of attachment theory incorporating ethological and evolutionary principles when he was effectively ostracised bowlby also broke with social learning theory s view of dependency and reinforcement bowlby proposed instead that to thrive emotionally children needed a close and continuous caregiving relationship bowlby later stated that he had concluded that contrary to focus of psychoanalysts on internal fantasy world of child important area to study was how a child was actually treated by his parents in real life and in particular interaction between them he chose actual removal of children from home at this particular time because it was a specific event effects of which could be studied and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child s development and because it was preventable in addition views that he had already expressed about importance of a child s real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by sheer incredulity by colleagues before world war ii this led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of effects on a child of early experiences bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to advancement of science in this area animal studies thumb 276x276px love wire and cloth mother surrogates in harry harlow s nature of love researchers have for years studied depression alcoholism aggression maternal infant bonding and other conditions and phenomena in nonhuman primates and other laboratory animals using an experimental maternal deprivation paradigm most influentially harry harlow would in mid 1950s begin raising infant monkeys in his university of wisconsin madison laboratory in total or partial isolation and with inanimate surrogate mothers in an attempt to study maternal infant bonding as well as various states of mental illness in harlow s laboratory infant rhesus monkeys were immediately removed from their mothers and placed with cloth or wire surrogate mothers sometimes called iron maidens by researchers harlow found that infants would become attached to their inanimate mothers both those made of wire and those covered with cloth and when removed from them they would screech in terror harlow and his colleagues would later develop evil artificial mothers meant to impart fear and insecurity to infant monkeys including one designed with brass spikes but contrary to researcher s hypothesis these animals too demonstrated an attachment to their surrogates thumb monkey subject is approaching to cloth mother surrogate in fear test subsequent experiments would study effects of total and partial isolation on animals mental health and interpersonal bonding using a stainless steel vertical chamber designed by harlow named pit of despair which was found to produce profound and prolonged depression in monkeys similarly harlow found that extended isolation in bare wire cages left monkeys with profound behavioral abnormalities including self clutching and rocking and later apathy and indifference to external stimulation harlow likened this behavior to catatonic schizophrenia later experiments were devised to test mother child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants this early deprivation was found to have retarded mothers emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant in response harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate these mothers they named a rape rack harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth they cared little for their offspring writing these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants while some mothers simply ignored their children harlow characterized others as evil and abusive and in some instances reported them crushing infant s face to floor chewing off infant s feet and fingers and in one case putting infant s head in her mouth and crushing it like an eggshell harlow s experiments have been heralded as revolutionary and also robustly criticized as scientifically invalid and sadistically cruel writing on researcher s legacy john gluck a former student of harlow s opined on one hand his work on monkey cognition and social development fostered a view of animals as having rich subjective lives filled with intention and emotion on other he has been criticized for conduct of research that seemed to ignore ethical of his own discoveries maternal deprivation experiments on nonhuman primates have continued into 21st century and remain controversial stephen suomi an early collaborator of harlow has continued to conduct maternal deprivation experiments on rhesus monkeys in his nih laboratory and has been vigorously criticized by peta members of congress and others controversy misinterpretation and criticism aside from his profound differences with psychoanalytic ideas theoretical basis of bowlby s monograph was controversial in a number of ways some profoundly disagreed with necessity for maternal or equivalent love in order to function normally or that formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself others questioned extent to which his hypothesis was supported by evidence there was criticism of confusion of effects of privation no primary attachment figure and deprivation loss of primary attachment figure and in particular of failure to distinguish between effects of lack of a primary attachment figure and other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions it was also pointed out that there was no explanation of how experiences subsumed under broad heading of maternal deprivation could have effects on personality development of kinds claimed bowlby explained in his 1988 work that data were not at time accommodated by any theory then current and in brief time of my employment by world health organization there was no possibility of developing a new one he then goes on to describe subsequent development of attachment theory in addition to criticism his ideas were often oversimplified misrepresented distorted or exaggerated for various purposes this heightened controversy in 1962 who published deprivation of maternal care a reassessment of its effects to which mary ainsworth bowlby s close colleague contributed with his approval to present recent research and developments and to address bowlby s work was misinterpreted to mean that any separation from natural mother any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of mothers necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and sometimes that all children undergoing such experiences would develop into affectionless children as a consequence it was claimed that only 24 hour care by same person mother was good enough day care and nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work who advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect such strictures suited policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after world war ii in fact although bowlby was of view that proper care could not be provided by roster he was also of view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and that key to alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous he addressed this point in a 1958 publication called can i leave my baby ainsworth in who 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that requirement for continuity of care did not imply an exclusive mother child pair relationship bowlby s quotable remark that children thrived better in bad homes than in good institutions was often taken to extremes leading to reluctance on part of children s officers equivalent of child care social workers to remove children from homes however neglectful and inadequate in fact although bowlby mentioned briefly issue of partial deprivation within family this was not fully investigated in his monograph as main focus was on risks of complete or almost complete deprivation michael rutter made a significant contribution to controversial issue of bowlby s maternal deprivation hypothesis his 1981 monograph and other papers comprise definitive empirical evaluation and update of bowlby s early work on maternal deprivation rutter 1979 he amassed further evidence addressed many different underlying social and psychological mechanisms and showed that bowlby was only partially right and often for wrong reasons rutter highlighted other forms of deprivation found in institutional care and complexity of separation distress and suggested that anti social behaviour was not linked to maternal deprivation as such but to family discord importance of these refinements of maternal deprivation hypothesis was to reposition it as a vulnerability factor rather than a causative agent with a number of varied influences determining which path a child would take rutter has more recently advised attention to complexity of development and roles of genetic as well as experiential factors noting that separation is only one of many risk factors related to poor cognitive and emotional development fathers thumb left father and child in accordance with prevailing social realities of his time namely assumption that daily care of infants and small children was undertaken by women and in particular mothers bowlby referred primarily to mothers and maternal deprivation although words parents and parental are also used fathers are mentioned only in context of practical and emotional support they provide for mother but monograph contains no specific exploration of father s role nor is there any discussion as to whether maternal role had of necessity to be filled by women as such bowlby s work was misinterpreted by some to mean natural mothers only 1962 who publication contains a chapter on effect of paternal deprivation there having by 1962 been some limited research on issue which illustrated importance of father s relationship with his children hope was expressed by ainsworth that in future there would be more such research and indeed her early research which contributed significantly to attachment theory covered infants relationships with all family members it was also stated that in relation to institutional care parental deprivation would have been more accurate although ainsworth preferred terms insufficiency discontinuity and distortion to either michael rutter in maternal deprivation reassessed 1972 described by new society as a classic in field of child care argued that research showed that it did not matter which parent child got on well with as long as he got on well with one of them that both parents influence their child s development and that which parent is more important varies with age sex and temperamental development he concluded for some aspects of development same sexed parent seems to have a special role for some person who plays and talks most with child and for others person who feeds child father mother brother and sisters friends school teachers and others all affect development but their influences and importance differ for different aspects of development a less exclusive focus on mother is required children also have fathers within attachment theory bowlby in attachment and loss volume one of attachment 1969 makes it quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this does not have to be mother or indeed a female as a matter of social reality mothers are more often primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be primary attachment figure but process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and intensity of engagement however attachment theory relates to development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer infant interactions schaffer in social development 1996 suggests that father child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by requirements of each society in societies where care of infants has been assigned to boys rather than girls no difference in nurturing capacity was found other studies however point in opposite direction feminist criticism there were three broad criticisms aimed at idea of maternal deprivation from feminist critics first was that bowlby overstated his case studies on which he based his conclusions involved almost complete lack of maternal care and it was unwarranted to generalise from this view that any separation in first three years of life would be damaging subsequent research showed good quality care for part of day to be harmless idea of exclusive care or exclusive attachment to a preferred figure rather than a hierarchy subsequently thought to be case within developments of attachment theory had not been borne out by research and this view placed too high an emotional burden on mother secondly they criticised bowlby s historical perspective and saw his views as part of idealisation of motherhood and family life after world war ii certainly his hypothesis was used by governments to close down much needed residential nurseries although governments did not seem so keen to pay mothers to care for their children at home as advocated by bowlby thirdly feminists objected to idea of anatomy as destiny and concepts of naturalness derived from ethnocentric observations they argued that anthropology showed that it is normal for childcare to be shared by a stable group of adults of which maternal care is an important but not exclusive part today whilst bowlby s early writings on maternal deprivation may be seen as part of background to later development of attachment theory there are many significant differences between two at time of 1951 publication there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on development of early relationships aside from its central proposition of importance of an early continuous and sensitive relationship monograph concentrates mostly on social policy for his subsequent development of attachment theory bowlby drew on concepts from ethology cybernetics information processing developmental psychology and psychoanalysis first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958 1959 and 1960 his major work attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980 attachment theory revolutionised thinking on nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken according to ethological attachment theory as outlined by john bowlby 1969 to 1980 has provided one of most important frameworks for understanding crucial risk and protective factors in social and emotional development in first 3 years of life bowlby s 1951 monograph maternal care and mental health reviewed world literature on maternal deprivation and suggested that emotionally available caregiving was crucial for infant development and mental health beyond that broad statement which is now generally accepted little remains of underlying detail of bowlby s theory of maternal deprivation that has not been either discredited or superseded by attachment theory and other child development theories and research except in area of extreme deprivation opening of east european orphanages in early 1990s following end of cold war provided substantial opportunities for research on attachment and other aspects of institutional rearing however such research rarely mentions maternal deprivation other than in a historical context maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome is a concept that is rarely used other than in connection with extreme deprivation and failure to thrive rather there is consideration of a range of different lacks and deficiencies in different forms of care or lack of care of which attachment is only one aspect as well as consideration of constitutional and genetic factors in determining developmental outcome subsequent studies have however confirmed bowlby s concept of cycles of disadvantage although not all children from unhappy homes reproduce deficiencies in their own experience rather it is now conceptualised as a series of pathways through childhood and a number of varied influences will determine which path a particular child takes concept outside mainstream psychology idea that separation from female caregiver has profound effects is one with considerable resonance outside conventional study of child development in united states law tender years doctrine was long applied when custody of infants and toddlers was preferentially given to mothers over last decade or so some decisions appear to have been derived from tender years concept but others involve contrary assumption that a 2 year old is too young to have developed a relationship with either parent concern with harm of separation from mother is characteristic of belief systems behind some complementary and alternative cam psychotherapies such belief systems are concerned not only with effect of young child s separation from care of mother but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if child is separated from birth mother and adopted even if this occurs on day of birth and even if adoptive family provides all possible love and care these beliefs were at one time in existence among psychologists of psychoanalytic background today however beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as william emerson belief in prenatal fetal awareness mental communication between mother and unborn child and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon are concepts that connect easily to unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders these beliefs are also congruent with cam psychotherapies such as attachment therapy not based on attachment theory which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome see also dead mother complex references bibliography external links category attachment theory category psychoanalysis category interpersonal relationships category adoption fostering orphan
