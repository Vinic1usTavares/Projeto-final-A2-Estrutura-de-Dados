he collects antique calculators and sells intelligence as he squats near poole with a gypsy group creator of website discussion group and chatroom fetish footage forum that cayce frequents website s intention is to discuss anonymous film postings style and story elements novel uses a third person narrative in present tense with a somber tone reminiscent of a low level post apocalypticism cayce s memories of september 11 2001 attacks which briefly use future tense are told by gibson as a seed of time as one reviewer calls it because of monistic and lyrical descriptions of cayce s relationship to objects with attacks in background two neologisms appear in novel gender bait and mirror world gibson created term mirror world to acknowledge a locational specific distinction in a manufactured object that emerged from a parallel development process for example opposite side driving or varied electrical outlets gender bait refers to a male posing as a female online to elicit positive responses term not coined by gibson but used in marketing industry for several years is used to describe cayce s profession of identifying roots of emerging trends september 11 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing a break with past with cayce s father who disappears during attacks as personification of 20th century gibson viewed attacks as a nodal point after which nothing is really same one reviewer commented that in gibson s view 9 11 was end of history after it we are without a history careening toward an unknown future without benefit of a past our lives before 9 11 are now irrelevant cayce s search for her father and damien s excavation of german bomber symbolize historicist search for a method to interpret people s actions in past coming to terms with her father s disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to 20th century something that may have been influenced by gibson coming to terms with loss of his own father film clips are a motif used to enhance theme of desire to find meaning or detect patterns they are released over internet and gain a cult following in same way that gained an international following in 2006 corporate interest in footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods characters debate whether anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress and when or where they were shot this enigmatic nature of footage is said to metaphorically represent nature of confusing and uncertain post 9 11 future author dennis danvers has remarked that footage being edited down to a single frame is like world compressed into a single novel footage released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators has also been contrasted to pattern recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name dropping that definitively sets it in london tokyo and moscow in 2002 major themes pattern recognition central theme throughout novel involves natural human propensity to search for meaning with constant risk of apophenia followers of seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are revealed to be victims of apophenia as clips are just edited surveillance camera footage likewise cayce s mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after cayce s father disappears science fiction critic thomas wagner underscores desire for meaning or pattern recognition using a comparison between film clips and cayce s search for her father after attacks t he very randomness and of clips flies in face of our natural human tendency towards pattern recognition t he subculture that surrounds following footage is an effective plot device for underscoring novel s post 9 11 themes to wit uncertainty of fabric of day to day life people began to feel following that event we as people don t like uncertainty don t like knowing that there s something we can t comprehend and if we can t fit something into an existing pattern then by golly we ll come up with one within marketing world cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel but rather a paragon of system inescapably within system she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns review in village voice calls this search a survival tactic within context of no context dowsing for meaning and sometimes settling for illusion of meaning memory of history using 20th century relics such as a curta calculator an excavated stuka hobbs baranov and voytek s planned zx81 show gibson raises question of how a contemporary society views past societies gibson portrays past century as dominated by conflict suspicion and espionage following disappearance of cayce s father a designer of embassy security systems on september 11 2001 cayce is left feeling until she reviews footage and records of that day tracking his movements until he vanishes following this line of thought gibson raises question of how future will view today s society novel adopts a postmodern historicism perspective through arguments presented by bigend cayce and parkaboy bigend and cayce s view of history are compared to those of philosopher benedetto croce in that they believe history is open for interpretation when re written from frame of reference of another society parkaboy rejects this view believing that history can be an exact science originality and monoculture book explores a tension between originality and monoculture by focusing on artist s relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products critic lisa zeidner argues that artist s loyalty and love involved with creating originality counters bigend s assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that creative process no longer rests with individual commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality tommy hilfiger brand is used as an example simulacra of simulacra of simulacra a dilute tincture of ralph lauren who had himself diluted glory days of brooks brothers who themselves had stepped on product of jermyn street and savile row there must be some tommy hilfiger event horizon beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative more removed from source more devoid of soul gibson 2003 p18 one critic points out that marketing agency blue ant is named after wasp blue ant it s a wasp with a painful sting female hunts for a ground dwelling cricket she paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for wasp s young what a clever metaphor for process of targeting commodifying and marketing cool on other hand as rudy rucker notes while new art is constantly threatened by commodification it is dependent on monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness gibson s product positioning language and cayce s analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it alex link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art brand design and terrorism as varying attitudes to history terror and community branding identity and globalization novel s language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements postmodern theorist fredric jameson calls it a kind of hyped up name dropping where an encyclopaedic familiarity with fashions creates class status as a matter of knowing score rather than of having money and power he also calls it postmodern nominalism in that names express new and fashionable this name dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed or re created some that already existed this naming includes nationalities there are eight references to nationality or locality in first three pages zeidner wrote that novel s new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity one character argues that there will soon be no national identity left as all experience will be reduced by spectral hand of marketing to price point variations on same thing gibson 2003 p341 this is juxtaposed against footage that contains no hints of time period or location globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities ease of international travel portable instant communication and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets as an example gibson writes how one yes or no decision by cayce on logo will impact lives of people in remote places who will manufacture logos and how it will infect their dreams genre while some reviewers regard novel as a thriller others see it as an example of post millennial science fiction with stories set in future present some reviewers note that novel furthers post millennial trend in science fiction of illustrating society s inability to imagine a definitive future and use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular gibson said that only science fiction elements are t he footage and cayce s special talents but that he never bought that conceit that science fiction is about future dennis danvers explained use of science fiction as a narrative strategy s fiction in effect has become a narrative strategy a way of approaching story in which not only characters must be invented but world and its ways as well without resorting to magic or supernatural where fantasy folks work a realist wrestling with woes of middle class can leave world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at shallowness of suburbia a science fiction writer must invent world where story takes place often from ground up a process usually called world building in other words in a science fiction novel world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in plot without whom story could not take place whether it s world of dune or neuromancer or 1984 world is story as much as story is in world part of gibson s point is that we live in a time of such accelerated change and layered realities that we re all in that boat like it or not a novel set in real world now has to answer question which one these elements and use of september 11 2001 attacks as a breaking point from past led academics to label it a postmodern novel attacks mark point where modern that is 20th century certainty in society s advancement towards a better future changed to postmodern that is 21st century uncertainty in which future will develop fredric jameson finds gibson using culture as determinant of change for first time with this novel rather than technology jameson focuses on novel s postmodern nominalism that uses brand names to refresh old objects and experiences in post structural literary theory cayce is compared with main character maas of thomas pynchon s crying of lot 49 as detectives interpreting clues but with neither character nor reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and if there is one whether it is real or conspiracy gibson s use of name dropping brands to create a sense of in group style of those in know is traced back to thomas pynchon s 1963 novel v gibson s writing style is said to be similar to raymond chandler s detective stories and alfred hitchcock s thrillers that used macguffins identity of maker of footage in this case to drive story gibson s social observations are influenced by works of naomi klein and malcolm gladwell while markedly different from his previous writing in that it is not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies pattern recognition includes many of his previous elements including impacts of technology shifts on society japanese computer experts and russian mafia figures in common with gibson s previous work paul di filippo found following in pattern recognition close observation of culture s bleeding edge an analysis of ways technology molds our every moment contrasting of boardroom with street impossibility and dire necessity of making art in face of instant co damaged loner facing powers that be for both principle and profit reception pattern recognition was released on february 3 2003 as gibson launched a 15 city tour novel was featured

list on february 15 in hardcover fiction category novel was shortlisted for 2004 arthur c clarke award and british science fiction association award gibson s writing was positively received by science fiction writers dennis danvers jane dorsey and rudy rucker rucker has written w ith a poet s touch he tiles words into wonderful mosaics and danvers wrote that no sentence has a subject if it can do without one one critic found prose to be as hard and compact as glacier ice and another that it gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity gibson s descriptions of interiors and of built environments of tokyo russia and london were singled out as impressive and village voice s review remarked that gibson expertly replicates biosphere of a discussion board coffee shop intimacy fishbowl paranoia splintering factions inevitable flame war lisa zeidner of new york times book review elaborated as usual gibson s prose is corpuscular crenelated his sentences slide from silk to steel and take tonal joy rides from ironic to earnest but he never gets lost in language as he sometimes has in past structurally this may be his most confident novel secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed right down to their personal e mail styles without any metafictional grandstanding gibson nails texture of internet culture how it feels to be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room or to fret about someone spying on your browser s list of sites visited filled with name dropping of businesses and products such as netscape and g4 language of novel was judged by one critic to be awkward in its effort to appear cool while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date novel pittsburgh post gazette review commented that constant unadulterated hipster technocrat cyber mtv lingo is overdone and inappropriate on technology cory doctorow found gibson s use of watermarks and logging to be hollow and has noted that gibson is no technologist he s an accomplished and insightful social critic and he treats these items from real world as metaphor but gibson s metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book some critics found plot to be a conventional unravel secret and woman on a quest thriller toby litt wrote that j just as a thriller pattern recognition takes too long to kickstart gives its big secrets away before it should and never puts heroine in believable peril conclusion called unnecessarily pat by one critic was compared by litt with ultimate fantasy ending of 1980s movies heroine has lucked out without selling out has kept her integrity but still ended up filthy rich review in library journal called novel a melodrama of beset that may well reveal emptiness
