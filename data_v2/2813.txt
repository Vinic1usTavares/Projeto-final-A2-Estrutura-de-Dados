feaster writing for turner classic movies found an unusual theme in film which she interpreted as being one of independence for children professor james r kincaid read film as a call for children s

scholar andrew scahill described it as fitting a cinematic narrative of children in rebellion one in which child appears seemly as with innocents 1961 omen 1976 and others genre has been debated with feaster arguing it was more psychological thriller than horror jim cullen summed film up as a strange hybrid of genres being a horror thriller and feminist film kord listed it among dramas about eerie malevolent or criminal children distinct from depictions of children in supernatural horror genre martin sheen said it was a horror film in some ways but not overt with mystery and suspense elements however director nicolas gessner denied it was horror characterizing it as a teenage love story production development novelist laird koenig adapted book himself originally script was intended as a play but this idea was abandoned due to belief that a young actress would not be available to play rynn for an extended period gessner read book only to find rights were optioned to sam spiegel but project was derailed due to creative differences allowing gessner to secure them film followed tax incentives for cinema offered by government of canada beginning in 1974 stimulating a hollywood north it was a co production of canada and france with zev braun producing as head of zev braun productions based in los angeles alongside l c l industries in montreal and in paris canadian producer denis heroux who during decade specialized in popular cinema with financiers from outside country also worked on project it was shot on a small budget financiers disliked how in novel rynn murdered mrs hallet with poisonous gas causing scene to be rewritten so death is accidental casting director martin scorsese was editing alice doesn t live here anymore and gessner s look at his work led him to discover jodie foster with guidance of her mother brandy jodie took role of rynn and turned 13 while film was being shot she wore a wig for film and a gap was added in her teeth sheen said he was contacted by gessner personally about playing frank hallet which sheen accepted because he found part intriguing and because he believed foster had a promising career gessner claimed sheen was initially more interested in playing mario but gessner persuaded sheen that he was too old for that part gessner noted that casting alexis smith who was born in canada also helped secure canadian tax incentives filming 275px thumb knowlton quebec was a filming location little girl who lives down lane was filmed in montreal and knowlton quebec sheen described set as relaxed and as encouraging creativity and said foster also built a friendship with his daughter renee estevez during shooting a producer s desire for sex and violence led to a nude scene depicting rynn being added to film foster strongly objected saying i walked off set as a result her older sister connie acted as nude double her mother had suggested connie who was 21 at time following release of taxi driver industry shared stories of foster having conflicts during production of little girl who lives down lane however gessner claimed foster only regretted scene after it was shot and her request that it be deleted was denied by canadian producers crew built a false trapdoor for mrs hallet s death scene though gessner acknowledged smith was nervous about effect for scene where frank hallet kills hamster gordon sheen handled a dead and frozen rodent and attempted to make it seem like it was still alive sound effects of squealing were also added dead hamster was obtained from a hospital which carried out animal research while live hamster portraying gordon in other scenes was given to costume designer after production music mort shuman who played officer miglioriti was a musician in real life so crew intended that shuman would also write film score however shuman s arranger christian wrote bulk of music giving him credit of composer while shuman was listed as music supervisor gessner wanted to use music of polish composer and pianist frederic chopin finding his music a good match with dialogue he said chopin s music was intended to symbolize hope and absolution along with sadness chopin s piano
