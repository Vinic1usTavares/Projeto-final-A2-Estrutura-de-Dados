chambers created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop during 1990s and helped return new york city hip hop to national prominence its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production while group members explicit humorous and free associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records serving as a landmark release in era of hip hop known as east coast renaissance its influence helped lead way for several other east coast hip hop artists including nas notorious b i g mobb deep and jay z despite its raw underground sound album had surprising chart

2018 it was certified triple platinum initially receiving positive reviews from most music critics enter wu tang 36 chambers is widely regarded as one of most significant albums of 1990s as well as one of greatest hip hop albums of all time background in late 1980s cousins robert diggs gary grice and russell jones formed a group named force of imperial master also known as all in together now crew each member recorded under an alias grice as genius diggs as prince rakeem or scientist and jones as specialist group never signed to a major label but caught attention of new york city rap scene and was recognized by rapper biz markie by 1991 genius and prince rakeem were signed to separate record labels genius released words from genius 1991 on cold chillin records and prince rakeem released ooh i love you rakeem 1991 on tommy boy records both were soon dropped by their labels embittered but unbowed they refocused their efforts and on new monikers genius became gza pronounced while prince rakeem became rza pronounced rizza rza discussed matter in their release wu tang manual 2005 stating tommy boy made decision to sign house of pain over us when they dropped me i was thinking damn they chose a bunch of shit over me rza began collaborating with dennis coles later known as ghostface killah another rapper from stapleton houses in staten island duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of eastern philosophy picked up from kung fu movies watered down nation of islam preaching picked up on new york streets and comic books recording and production enter wu tang 36 chambers was recorded at firehouse studio in new york city album was produced mixed arranged and programmed by rza and was mastered at hit factory in new york city by chris gehringer because of an extremely limited budget group was only able to record in a small inexpensive studio with up to eight of nine wu tang members in studio at once quarters were frequently crowded to decide who appeared on each song rza forced wu tang rappers to battle with each other this competition led to track meth vs chef a battle between method man and raekwon over rights to rap over rza s beat this track was left off wu tang clan s debut album but surfaced on method man s debut 1994 group leader rza produced enter wu tang 36 chambers by creating sonic collages from classic soul samples and clips from martial arts movies such as shaolin and wu tang 1981 he complemented rappers performances with lean menacing beats that evoked their gritty urban surroundings more effectively than their words according to stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic use of soul samples and various esoteric clips and technique by which rza employed them in his beats was unique and largely unprecedented in hip hop gritty sound of enter wu tang is due at least in part to use of cheap equipment to produce album music and lyrics according to music journalist ben yew minimalist means of production plays directly into music s street aesthetic because rza didn t have best mixing or recording equipment album is wrought with a dirty quality drums have more bass and are more hard hitting than they are crisp and clean samples have an eerie almost haunting type of echo and vocals because each member s voice is already aggressive and gritty perfectly match production although ol dirty bastard is given co production credit on da mystery of chessboxin and method man is co credited for wu tang clan ain t nuthing ta f wit critics and admirers universally credit rza with developing what pitchfork called a dusty yet digital production style that helped legitimize use of more diverse sample sources to hardcore new york rap massive breaking away from james brown based beats and embracing a style that turned underdog theme into menacing coda for a group of underground terrorists enter wu tang ushered in a new standard for hip hop at a time when hip hop music was dominated by jazz influenced styles of a tribe called quest afrocentric viewpoints of public enemy and rising popularity of west coast gangsta rap album s explicit humorous and free associative lyrics have been credited for serving as a template for many subsequent hip hop records rolling stone described album as possessing an aesthetic that was low on hype and production values and high on idea that indigence is a central part of blackness while lyrical content on enter wu tang generally varies from rapper to rapper basic themes are same urban life martial arts movies comic book references and marijuana and setting is invariably harsh environment of new york city lyrics have a universally dark tone and seem at times to be simply aggressive cries allmusic contributor steve huey praises lyricists for their originality and caustic humor stating some were outsized theatrical personalities others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians but each had his own distinctive style every track on enter wu tang is packed with fresh inventive rhymes which are filled with martial arts metaphors pop culture references everything from to lucky charms cereal commercials to barbra streisand s way we were bizarre threats of violence and a truly twisted sense of humor with exception of method man and gza s clan in da front every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths verses are essentially battle rhymes mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use there is some debate about whether lyrics on 36 chambers are properly classified as gangsta rap or something else entirely in a stylus magazine review writer gavin mueller evokes bleakness of wu tang world view all nine original wu tang clan members contribute vocals on enter wu tang masta killa only appears on one track contributing last verse of da mystery of chessboxin but all other rappers appear on at least two songs method man and raekwon are most prolific of group featured on eight tracks though performers have widely differing techniques chemistry between them is a key ingredient of album s success pitchfork asserts that half charm is in cast s idiosyncrasies odb s hovering sing song raekwon s fake stutter ghostface s verbal tics method man s hazy dusted voice title part of album s title originates from five percent philosophy known to adherents as supreme mathematics which attaches number 9 with meaning to bring into existence because wu tang clan was made of nine members each of whom has four chambers of heart album was subtitled 36 chambers being total of nine hearts of members in reference to 1978 kung fu film 36th chamber of shaolin that group enjoyed watching clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of 36 chambers and arrived onto rap scene while appearing to be ahead and more advanced over others with knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain knowledge of 35 lessons also while human body has 108 pressure points 1 0 8 9 only wu tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly 9 36 45 4 5 9 lyrics and rhymes of 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points all of this is basis for album title enter wu tang 36 chambers being that 9 members x 4 chambers 36 however this is just a theory true significance of title is not definitively known perkins brandon wu tang down infinity urb retrieved on 2009 07 02 singles protect ya neck and tearz were first tracks recorded by wu tang clan protect ya neck is a free
