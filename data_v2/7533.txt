south carolina s state government political and personal confrontations combined with howe s reputation as a womanizer among those who disfavored him eventually led to continental congress stripping him of his command over southern department he was then sent to new york where he served under general george washington in hudson highlands although howe did not have a successful or significant

sons of liberty organization which was active in protesting stamp act 1765 that taxed most printed materials at time members of sons of liberty did not consider their resistance to be rebellion as it was based on idea that government officials who performed acts in opposition to will of people were not acting with full authority after resolution of stamp act crisis howe was made an officer of provincial exchequer despite cape fear river area being epicenter of stamp act protests in north carolina howe took no substantial part in active confrontations with governor william tryon due in large part to their personal friendship and patronage provided by governor for howe s political ambitions during french and indian war howe served alongside provincial soldiers from virginia in 1766 he was commissioned as a captain of militia and was given command of fort johnston located at entrance of cape fear river in present day southport north carolina howe served in this capacity between 1766 and 1767 and again between 1769 and 1773 although satisfied with this position howe ultimately desired to obtain a commission in regular british army which was traditionally a prerequisite for commander of fort johnston howe was never granted this commission despite tryon s support in 1768 session of colonial assembly howe played a prominent role by introducing a bill to remedy a currency shortage in colony his bill would have led to acceptance of commodities as legal tender in province but it was not passed regulator movement was in part based on grievances farmers in north carolina

of artillery by governor tryon and served under governor against armed protesters in piedmont during war of regulation howe was among governor s entourage when he confronted regulators in hillsborough

cooperation between southern activists and those in boston he investigated causes of war of regulation to which he had been sympathetic howe served as quincy s guide and with assistance of cornelius harnett and william hooper convinced quincy that regulator movement had been unjustified and wrong to take up arms against tryon quincy found howe to be a most happy compound of man of sense sword senate and buck a favorite of man of sense and female world continuing to say that howe has faults and vice but alas who is without them more importantly however quincy s visit with howe hooper and harnett engendered a desire among those present to open up inter colonial lines of communication in order to coordinate responses to future impositions by british government howe s private fortunes were never stable and between 1766 and 1775 he was forced to mortgage land and sell slaves to generate funds in 1770 howe was able to purchase kendal plantation on cape fear river a rice plantation but in 1775 he mortgaged it for around while causes of howe s financial misfortunes are unknown several contemporary critics held that cause was howe s need to keep up appearances among ruling elite while josiah martin tryon s successor as royal governor believed howe s misfortunes were evidence of his potential for malfeasance with public money in particular martin believed that howe was intentionally under staffing fort johnston in order to pocket excess funds colonial assembly had appropriated for garrison there which was a common form of embezzlement among previous commanders and other royal officials howe as a legislator and public official had a poor working relationship with martin and martin deprived him of his appointed offices captaincy of fort johnston and his position with provincial exchequer shortly after new governor s arrival a legislative confrontation in 1770 over provincial assembly s attempts to pass a law authorizing attachment of real property in north carolina owned by persons living in england placed howe in direct confrontation with martin who preferred a requirement that colonial subjects seek relief from courts in england rather than in north carolina martin believed that howe s virulent opposition to new governor s policies was driven by howe s anger at being deprived of his valuable appointed positions revolutionary political and militia service in december 1773 north carolina colonial assembly created a committee of correspondence to which howe as well as richard caswell john harvey john ashe joseph hewes and samuel johnston were appointed that committee was tasked with corresponding with other colonies to coordinate plans of resistance to british attempts to tax or otherwise burden colonists beginning in 1774 howe was a member of wilmington and brunswick county committees of safety and in august of that year served as a member of a committee that organized collection of corn flour and pork to be sent to boston at

convened on august 25 1774 howe served as a member of that body representing brunswick county first provincial congress quickly passed a bill banning exportation of all pitch tobacco tar and other trade goods to england and banned importation of british tea into north carolina also in 1774 howe penned several documents expressing what would become known as patriot or whig sympathies including an address demanding reforms from royal governor josiah martin on april 7 1775 howe delivered an address to colonial assembly formally rebuffing governor martin s demands that extra legal second provincial congress be dissolved howe s response as adopted by assembly led to martin proroguing colonial legislative body in 1775 when howe received news of battles of lexington and concord first military engagements of american revolutionary war he began to drill local militia using unusual combination of drums and fiddles as opposed to standard fifes and drums on july 15 1775 howe led 500 militiamen from brunswick town on a raid on governor s mansion with intent of kidnapping governor martin plot failed when martin made an early morning escape from fort johnston fleeing to on july 19 howe ordered militia to put fort s structures to torch starting with home of its commanding officer and howe s successor captain john collet who had previously been accused of corruption by committee of safety after fleeing martin made a proclamation on august 8 1775 that attributed growing unrest in north carolina to what he termed basest and most scandalous seditious and inflammatory falsehoods propagated by committee of safety in wilmington howe once again represented brunswick county in third provincial congress in hillsborough beginning on august 20 1775 and was appointed to committee charged with developing a test oath for members of legislative body oath declared allegiance to king of england but denied power of parliament to tax to american colonies during fourth north carolina

provincial congress appointed howe to lead newly created second north carolina regiment of continental army as its colonel initially howe headquartered his command in new bern during fall of 1775 and was charged by provincial congress with protecting northern half of north carolina up to border with virginia at time british forces under command of john murray 4th earl of dunmore last royal governor of colony of virginia were ravaging tidewater region of virginia howe of his own initiative brought his north carolina troops into virginia arriving shortly after battle of great bridge howe then directed occupation of norfolk virginia which had recently been abandoned by loyalist forces and assumed command of various north carolina and virginia units there region around norfolk was being occupied by loyalist militia units under dunmore s command howe as senior officer chosen over more junior william woodford of virginia engaged in contentious negotiations over access to supplies with captains of british ships anchored off norfolk which were by that time overcrowded with loyalist refugees situation deteriorated and norfolk was burned on january 1 1776 in an action started by british marines and a bombardment by royal navy vessels and completed by patriot forces fire raged on for two more days and howe ordered most of buildings that remained standing to be razed before he withdrew to further render location useless to british during howe s time in command at norfolk woodford described north carolinian as a brave prudent spirited commander on december 22 1775 howe was formally thanked by virginia convention and on april 27 1776 he received same honor from fourth north carolina provincial congress charleston 1776 1777 in march 1776 howe was promoted to rank of brigadier general by second continental congress along with fellow north carolinian james moore howe and moore were two of five north carolinians to be given a general s commission in continental army initially howe was given command of all continental forces in virginia but soon both he and moore were ordered to south carolina howe arrived first as presence of british army and royal navy under command of general henry clinton at mouth of cape fear river delayed moore s descent when clinton arrived off coast of north carolina he issued a proclamation offering a pardon to anyone who had taken up arms against crown with explicit exception of howe and fellow revolutionary cornelius harnett then serving as president of north carolina provincial council executive body in revolutionary state howe s plantation kendal was sacked by british during their maneuvers around wilmington upon arriving in charleston howe acted as an adjutant to major general charles lee who had been appointed commander of southern department of continental army howe directly commanded south carolina militia during first siege of charleston in june 1776 and was assigned command over defenses of city proper lee was recalled to north to assist general george washington and in his absence james moore was appointed commander of southern department howe was left in command of charleston and savannah georgia in lee s absence and in september 1776 he became embroiled in a controversy involving provincial assembly of south carolina allowing its officers to recruit soldiers from north carolina s continental line units howe pleaded with provincial congress of north carolina to allow south carolina to recruit within former state s borders because of greater number of white males in that state eventually north carolina acceded to that request but only after ordering howe to reclaim north carolinians who had already been lured away by south carolinians south carolina council took offense and demanded that howe pay recruitment bonuses for men if he wished to have them back with james moore s death on april 15 1777 howe assumed command of southern department florida and political conflict 1777 1778 howe s style of command was quick to cause discontent and on august 20 1777 south carolina assembly protested against howe s right to command soldiers within borders of south carolina he was nonetheless promoted to rank of major general on october 20 1777 only north carolinian to reach that rank in continental army howe often deferred to civil leadership of various states that made up his command often referring conflicts with state officials to continental congress to resolve of particular note was an early conflict with georgia s state government which insisted that governor of that state retain command of state s militia during military engagements when asked for an official opinion congress sided with howe who believed that command of militia should be relinquished to him during such engagements complicating matters however was fact that congressional funding for military expenditures was given over to states rather than army officers forcing howe to rely on state governments for funding in 1778 he was ordered to act on a plan developed by general charles lee to assault british west florida a plan that howe disfavored a previous expedition in 1777 in which howe did not directly participate had ended quickly in failure congress overrode howe s concerns about expedition and directed him to proceed in conjunction with georgia s militia into florida combined army s progress into florida was made slow by a lack of provisions and particularly by a lack of slaves who howe requested be made available to build roads and perform pioneering functions for march southward on june 29 1778 howe captured fort tonyn on st marys river which forms a portion of border between georgia and florida georgia governor john houstoun refused to give up command of his militia to continental army general and declined to participate in howe s council to make matters worse when south carolina militia units arrived in georgia under command of colonel andrew williamson their commander also refused to allow howe to command that state s militia units shortly after this minor incursion british received reinforcements and pressed toward savannah by july 14 1778 howe was forced to pull his units back north and returned to charleston general received much of blame for expedition s failure as georgia officials were quick to cast aspersions on continental command which was compounded by congress failure to understand howe s inability to control georgia militia despite their prior determination of his command authority over militia units thumb right alt a black and

1778 howe s squabbles with local political and militia leaders were not his sole difficulties on august 30 1778 howe engaged in a pistol duel with christopher gadsden of south carolina over an offense gadsden perceived stemming from his resignation in 1777 while under howe s command this controversy like many in which howe was involved centered on conflict between continental army and state governments desires to retain local control over their officers and soldiers gadsden responded to perceived offense by drafting and circulating a letter attacking howe s intelligence and ability as a commander and questioning howe s legal authority to issue orders to south carolina continentals howe took offense and demanded satisfaction from gadsden on august 17 1778 during duel colonel charles pinckney father of south carolina governor charles pinckney served as howe s second while colonel barnard elliot served as second to gadsden howe shooting first missed his shot at eight paces although ball grazed gadsden s ear gadsden then intentionally fired above his own left shoulder and demanded howe fire again a demand howe refused at conclusion of duel participants made amends and parted ways affair did not end privately as south carolinian and american gazette published a full story covering duel on september 3 1778 and in same month ill fated major john andre british officer who would

army and commanded it from savannah while awaiting lincoln s arrival in savannah with reinforcements howe set up defenses around that city preparing for an imminent attack governor houstoun sparred again with howe refusing to grant him more than meager militia support during first battle of savannah on december 29 1778 british landed near city and under command of archibald campbell managed to flank howe s army which was drawn up in open for battle by taking a path through a marshy area howe believed was impassable howe had previously ordered a scout to look for any paths through swamp but campbell s route which was shown to british commander by a slave remained unknown to patriots howe s position was otherwise strong and defensible but appearance of british in patriot rear caused a panic militia under howe s command fled instantly and more than 500 patriots and continental army soldiers were killed or captured ensuing defeat gave savannah to british for which howe received much blame on january 3 1779 howe formally relinquished his command to lincoln howe s failure at savannah led to criticism from georgia state officials who believed he had abandoned state to british as well as from fellow continental army generals such as william moultrie who criticized howe for even attempting to resist british while being so greatly outnumbered during his testimony before a later court martial howe claimed that he knew about pathway through swamp taken by british but stated that he did not defend it because he believed chance of an attack along path was so remote this contradicted earlier testimony from georgia militia officer george walton who stated that howe did not know about path prior to battle and that howe told walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through swamps existed hudson valley and connecticut 1779 thumb right alt a depiction of military execution of john andre who is blindfolded and hanging from a gallows execution of john andre

caused by a fall howe was unable to undertake any duties for a month after his arrival initially howe was charged with defending connecticut from british raids such as those conducted by his former mentor william tryon and tryon s adjutant edmund fanning howe s headquarters were in ridgefield connecticut on june 18 1779 shortly after battle of stony point howe was ordered to assist general israel putnam in assaulting a british fortification at verplanck s point which sat across hudson river from stony point howe was charged with commanding artillery barrage and infantry assault of that position but was given too few field pieces entrenching tools provisions and little ammunition to make a serious attempt at taking fortification he advised washington that an assault would be unfeasible and called off siege with washington s consent historians have noted that howe s inability to take british fortifications damaged his career and that he was never again given a major command contemporaries such as general william irvine criticized howe as having a talent of finding many supposed obstructions and barely plausible pretences for his delay in assaulting verplanck s point after stony point howe was assigned first to command of left wing of washington s army composed of massachusetts brigades under generals john nixon and john glover with his command again in ridgefield connecticut while military action was infrequent in howe s region of control he was integral in recruitment and cultivation of a substantial spy network which provided patriots with information about british positions on manhattan and along long island sound west point and benedict arnold conspiracy 1779 1780 as part of his command duties howe was chosen by washington as president of court martial convened to determine propriety of general benedict arnold s conduct while serving as commandant of philadelphia in 1778 and 1779 during that time arnold was alleged to have conducted business with british merchants and to have undertaken private business transactions that were inappropriate given his position among other improprieties tribunal which met at howe s headquarters in middletown connecticut adjourned for several months due to a threatened british attack but reconvened in december 1779 and closed in january 1780 during interlude in fall of 1779 howe was ordered by washington to move into position to attack british in conjunction with an expected combined french naval and land based assault although french assault in new york never materialized court martial rendered its decision on january 26 1780 finding arnold guilty of breaching articles of war by permitting a vessel from an enemy port into philadelphia and recommended that he be reprimanded by washington howe was made commandant of continental army fortifications at west point on february 21 1780 he held that command immediately prior to benedict arnold s conspiracy to turn over control of that stronghold to british arnold and several supporters in congress had eventually convinced washington to give him command of fortifications on august 3 1780 howe remained active in upper hudson river valley during remainder of war particularly in overseeing his network of spies in area including double agent joshua hett smith who would later play a key role in arnold s treason and prosecution during this time evidence arose implicating howe in discussions with british though evidence was dismissed by washington as merely rumors stirred up by british general henry clinton howe served on court martial board that convicted of espionage and sentenced to death major john andre british officer tasked with facilitating arnold s conspiracy pennsylvania mutinies and war s end 1781 1783 in 1781 howe assisted in putting down pompton mutiny in new jersey which was inspired by slightly earlier pennsylvania line mutiny washington ordered howe to surround camp and arrange for court martial and execution of two of its ringleaders in fall of 1781 howe requested permission to go with washington to virginia for what was anticipated to be final campaign against british but washington refused instead howe was required to appear before a court martial in philadelphia which was opened to inquire into howe s actions in defense of savannah in 1778 tribunal led by friedrich wilhelm von steuben opened on december 7 1781 and closed on january 23 1782 howe of any wrongdoing at savannah with highest honor assistant adjutant general john carlisle ordered howe to convene a court martial to investigate conduct of general alexander mcdougall in spring of 1782 mcdougall was a personal friend of howe s but tribunal convicted him of minor offense of releasing confidential details from a council of war meeting in 1776 to persons who were not permitted to have such information again in 1783 howe was called on to put down pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 which had caused continental congress to flee philadelphia post war career and death after putting down second pennsylvania mutiny in 1783 howe participated in establishment of society of cincinnati and was second officer to sign national charter with his signature appearing directly below that of von steuben howe thereafter returned to his north carolina plantation kendal which was upriver from more famous orton plantation owned by howe s distant relatives also in 1783 howe became a founding member of north carolina society of cincinnati and was a signatory to its institution or charter during much of 1783 and 1784 howe returned frequently to philadelphia new york and other cities in northeast in an attempt to settle accounts and obtain back payments he claimed he was owed by congress he was again forced to mortgage his plantation but eventually received a monetary settlement from congress of 7 000 in 1785 during 1785 howe was appointed by congress of confederation to establish treaties with several western indian tribes but did not actually travel with commissioners george rogers clark richard butler and samuel holden parsons who finalized treaty of fort finney without howe in 1786 howe assisted benjamin smith in planning for construction of bald head light and actively worked to assist former loyalists who sought to return to their prior lives in north carolina by defending them

county howe s remains were buried on property he owned in what later became columbus county north carolina although exact location of his burial has not been discovered a cenotaph was placed in southport s old smithville burying ground honoring him and wife sara legacy howe has been remembered primarily in a negative light based on his lack of military successes and reputation although north carolina historian hugh rankin noted in a biographical sketch that his opportunities came at times when he did not have proper field strength to gain favorable recognition during 1903 session of united states house of representatives congressman john dillard bellamy introduced a bill to erect an equestrian statue of howe in wilmington in order to commemorate general s service this bill was not passed note that article incorrectly cites date as 1908 in 1940 state of north carolina cast and erected a highway historical marker to commemorate howe s service marker stands on north carolina highway 133 in north carolina 1955 film scarlet coat featured a performance by actor john mcintire as howe during height of benedict arnold conspiracy evidence of attempted treason several scholars have raised questions regarding howe s actions as unofficial spymaster of hudson valley all of which center on evidence that suggests howe attempted to bargain with british in exchange for a commission as an officer in regular british army similar to bargain struck by benedict arnold in 1780 as early as 1776 after howe was appointed a brigadier general a loyalist merchant named henry kelly advised secretary of state for colonies george germain 1st viscount sackville that howe could be easily tempted to join british and further claimed that howe could offer a great deal to british in their war effort in 1780 after benedict arnold s attempted treason had been exposed captain beesly edgar joel a british defector and former officer in british army claimed that another officer besides arnold had attempted to defect and after interrogation joel named howe as that officer joel cited edmund fanning william tryon s secretary as source for his information joel further described howe s method of communicating with british which was by means of a frequently imprisoned and exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between parties while neither washington or congressional board of war believed joel s story due to their suspicion of joel as a british spy joel was later commissioned by thomas jefferson and virginia government to lead a patriot militia unit against loyalists in that state furthermore william smith a new york loyalist and brother of howe s agent and arnold s co conspirator joshua hett smith noted in his diary on april 29 1780 that his brother thomas smith had been informed that a commissary had come over to british with information from patriots in much same manner as joel had described on september 28 1780 william smith told henry clinton that he believed bob howe would be willing to turn on patriots later historians including douglas southall freeman have frequently dismissed allegations that howe attempted to defect believing them to have been fabrications used by joel to ingratiate himself with patriot government only full length book treatment of howe s life discusses allegations of attempted treason in a single page on other hand freeman s judgment was based primarily on washington s assessment of allegations but washington did not have access to potentially corroborating evidence in william smith s diary another possibility is that howe had merely attempted to spread word among british of his possible treason in order to conceal his management of vast spy network at his control this tactic was utilized by other spymasters in continental employ such as philip schuyler philip an american historian who studied howe s career and motivations has contrasted schuyler s otherwise shining reputation with howe s record of failures and draws conclusion that howe likely was attempting to defect to date no firm evidence exists which either howe or proves him guilty of attempted treason references notes
