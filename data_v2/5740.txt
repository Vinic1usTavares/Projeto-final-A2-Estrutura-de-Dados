two cent piece was produced by mint of united states for circulation from 1864 to 1872 and for collectors in 1873 designed by james b longacre there were decreasing mintages each year as other minor coins such as nickel proved more popular it was abolished by mint act of 1873 economic turmoil of american civil war caused government issued coins even non silver indian head cent to vanish from circulation hoarded by public one means of filling this gap was private token issues often made of bronze cent at that time was struck of a copper nickel alloy same diameter as later lincoln cent but somewhat thicker piece was difficult for philadelphia mint to strike and mint officials as well as annual assay commission recommended coin s replacement despite opposition from those wishing to keep metal nickel in coinage led by pennsylvania congressman thaddeus stevens congress passed coinage act of 1864 authorizing bronze cents and two cent pieces although initially popular in absence of other federal coinage two cent piece s place in circulation was usurped by other non precious metal coins which congress subsequently authorized three cent piece and nickel it was abolished in 1873 large quantities were redeemed by government and melted nevertheless two cent pieces remain inexpensive by standards of 19th century american coinage inception a two cent piece had been proposed in 1806 by connecticut senator uriah tracy along with a twenty cent piece or double dime reflecting then prevalent view that coins should contain their value in metal tracy s bill provided that two cent piece be made of billon or debased silver bill was opposed by mint director robert patterson as it would be difficult to refine silver from melted down pieces although tracy s legislation passed senate twice in 1806 and 1807 it failed in house of representatives patterson sent a brass button with two of billon planchets that would have been used for coin to tracy showing how hard it would be to prevent counterfeiting mint considered a two cent piece in 1836 and experiments were conducted by second engraver christian gobrecht and melter and refiner franklin peale piece was to be again of billon and provision for coin was included in early drafts of mint act of 1837 but proposal was dropped when peale was able to show that coin could be easily counterfeited thumb left 1836 pattern for two cent piece until 1857 cent coin was a large copper piece containing about its face value in metal these coins were unpopular and in 1857 after receiving congressional approval mint began issuing flying eagle cent of diameter of later lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and made of copper nickel alloy these pieces readily circulated and although design did not strike well and was replaced by indian head cent in 1859 coins were commonly used until all federal coinage vanished from circulation in much of united states in 1861 and 1862 during economic turmoil of american civil war this happened because many northerners feared that if war went poorly paper money and government bonds might become worthless gap was filled by among other things private token issues sometimes in copper nickel approximating size of cent but often thinner pieces in bronze this fact did not escape government officials and when in 1863 they attempted to restore coins to circulation use of bronze coins which would not contain their face values in metal was considered in his annual report submitted october 1 1863 mint director james pollock noted that whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins they merely want inferior base metal money for convenience in making exact payments he observed that private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal yet had still circulated he proposed that copper nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of same size pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery on december 8 pollock wrote to treasury secretary salmon p chase proposing a bronze cent and two cent piece and enclosing pattern coins of two cent piece that he had had prepared according to numismatist neil carothers a two cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as short a time as possible as mint could strike a two cent piece as easily as a cent legislation thumb right cent sized civil war token issued privately as all federal coinage was hoarded on march 2 1864 pollock wrote urgently to chase warning him that mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all time high he also informed secretary that united states assay commission composed of citizens and officials who had met previous month to test nation s silver and gold coinage had recommended use of french bronze 95 copper with remainder tin and zinc as a coinage metal for cent and a new two cent piece three days later chase sent pollock s december letter and draft legislation for bronze one and two cent pieces to maine senator william p fessenden chairman of senate finance committee fessenden took no immediate action and on march 16 pollock wrote again to chase warning that mint was going to run out of nickel much of which was imported chase forwarded his letter to fessenden legislation was finally introduced by new hampshire senator daniel clark on march 22 pollock s letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as senate passed bill without debate domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at gap pennsylvania owned by industrialist joseph wharton on march 19 pollock wrote to chase that they had no more nickel nor was any available from overseas we are thus shut up to home supply from works of mr wharton opposed to removal of nickel from cent wharton published a pamphlet in april 1864 proposing coinage of one two three five and ten cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper doubling percentage of nickel used in cent despite wharton s efforts on april 20 a select committee of house of representatives endorsed bill it was opposed by pennsylvania s thaddeus stevens who represented mining area from which wharton extracted his nickel wharton had spent 200 000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery stevens related and it was unfair to deprive him of major use of his metal shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to government besides he argued copper nickel alloy for cent had been approved by congress and new metal which he termed brass would show rust he was rebutted by iowa congressman john a kasson chairman of house committee on coinage weights and measures who stated that bronze alloy did not resemble brass and he could not support proposition that government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales legislation passed house and coinage act of 1864 was signed by president abraham lincoln on april 22 1864 legislation made base metal coins legal tender for first time both cents and two cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten government would not however redeem them in bulk act also outlawed private one and two cent tokens and later that year congress abolished all such issues legislation did not allow for redemption of old copper nickel cents it had been drafted by pollock who was hoping that seignorage income from issuing new coins would help finance mint operations and he did not want it reduced by recall of old pieces wharton and his interests were appeased by passage of a bill for a three cent piece in 1865 and a five cent piece in 1866 both of his proposed alloy out of which nickel as latter coin has come to be known is still struck design in late 1861 reverend mark r watkinson of pennsylvania had written to chase proposing that some reference to god be placed on coinage in that time of war and on november 20 of that year chase wrote to mint director pollock you will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in fewest terms possible this national recognition several mottoes were considered by pollock including god our trust and god and our country some of patterns he sent chase in december 1863 used god our trust and he wrote of design devices are beautiful and appropriate and motto on each such as all who fear god and love their country will approve he also sent pattern coins depicting george washington chase responded to letter i approve your mottoes only suggesting that on that with washington obverse motto should begin with word our so as to read our god and our country and on that with shield it should be changed so as to read in god we trust pollock had been inspired by star spangled banner a later stanza of which includes line and this be our motto in god is our trust chase may have been influenced in his decision by motto of his alma mater brown university in deo in god we hope as mottoes to be placed on coinage were prescribed by 1837 act a legislative change was needed act which created two cent piece authorized mint director with secretary of treasury s approval to prescribe designs and mottoes to be used longacre s two cent piece was first coin inscribed with in god we trust motto was popularized by new coin on march 3 1865 congress passed legislation ordering its use on all coins large enough to permit it since 1938 in god we trust has been used on all american coins obverse design is a longacre version of great seal of united states his design focuses on shield or escutcheon as a defensive weapon signifying strength and self protection through unity upper part of shield or chief symbolizes congress while 13 vertical stripes or paleways represent states consequently entire escutcheon symbolizes strength of federal government through unity of states crossed arrows represent nonaggression but imply readiness against attack laurel branches taken from greek tradition symbolize victory in heraldic engraving vertical lines represent red clear areas white and horizontal lines blue thus escutcheon is colored red white and blue and is meant to evoke american flag reverse contains denomination 2 cents within a somewhat ornate wheat wreath rest of coin is filled with name of country art historian cornelius vermeule deemed two cent piece most gothic and most expressive of civil war of all american coins shield arrows and wreath of obverse need only flanking cannon to be consummate expression of civil war heraldry vermeule suggested that coin appears calligraphic rather than sculptural and ascribed this to longacre s early career as a plate engraver production and collecting a few thousand of first circulation strikes as well as a handful of proof coins came from a prototype die with smaller letters in motto than all other 1864 pieces although specimens of two cent piece being of base metal were not set aside for testing by annual assay commission congress did order that internal checks be done at mint as to their composition and weight two cent piece was at first a success circulating freely once enough of them were issued to be recognized by public it initially circulated because of wartime coin shortage which was alleviated by new cent and two cent piece although pollock reported hoarding of cents in his june 1864 report he did not thereafter mention such activities silver coins still did not circulate in much of nation and new coins joined by three and five cent pieces of copper nickel first struck in 1865 and 1866 respectively answered need for small change in october 1864 he reported that demand for both coins had been unprecedented and that every effort was being made to increase production in his report next june he called two cent piece a most convenient and popular coin act of march 3 1865 that provided for three cent nickel piece reduced legal tender limit of bronze coins to four cents while making newly authorized coin acceptable up to sixty cents thumb left upright new shield nickel first coined 1866 both resembled two cent piece and helped drive it from circulation after large mintage of just under twenty million in first year according to numismatist q david bowers enthusiasm and public acceptance waned after war bank demand for denomination dropped while demand for new five cent nickel increased mintages of two cent piece were smaller every year lange notes it was evident by end of 1860s that its coinage was no longer necessary according to carothers coinage of a 2 cent piece was unnecessary while it was popular at first because of great public demand for metallic small change it was a superfluous denomination and its circulation waned rapidly after 5 cent nickel coin was introduced beginning in 1867 new mint director henry linderman pollock had resigned began to advocate for congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage although nickel could be redeemed in lots permission granted in its authorizing act there was no provision for government to buy back smaller coins and with more being issued every year there were too many small value coins treasury officials insisted government could not accept pieces beyond their legal tender limits even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency under linderman mint without any legal authority purchased 360 000 in bronze coins using three cent pieces and nickels still millions of two cent pieces accumulated in hands of newspaper and transit companies postmasters and others who took small payments from public and there were complaints to congress with advent of grant administration pollock returned to office and opposed redemption proposals although he included pollock s opinions as part of his annual report treasury secretary george s boutwell asked congress to pass a redemption act and it did so on march 3 1871 allowing for redemption of minor coinage in lots of not less than 20 it also allowed treasury secretary to discontinue coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers pursuant to new law mint in 1871 and 1872 redeemed over 37 000 000 small coins including two cent pieces in postwar years congress and treasury considered a revision of coinage laws as act of 1837 was deemed outdated retention of two cent piece was never seriously considered in debates over what became mint act of 1873 only question concerning minor coinage was whether to make cent from bronze or copper nickel and how large to make three cent nickel with those pieces remaining unchanged bill passed on february 12 1873 putting an end to two cent piece series with two cent piece likely to be abolished only 65 000 were struck for circulation in 1872 it is unclear why they were struck at all on january 18 1873 philadelphia mint chief coiner archibald loudon snowden complained that 3 in date as struck by mint too closely resembled an 8 especially on smaller sized denominations in response pollock ordered new chief engraver william barber longacre had died in 1869 to re engrave date opening arms of 3 wider on most denominations two cent piece was struck only in proof condition in 1873 and due to its february abolition there should not have been time or reason for barber to re engrave coin nevertheless it exists in closed 3 and open 3 varieties breen suggested that open 3 variety was actually struck at a later date probably clandestinely it was not known to exist until discovered by a numismatist in 1950s numismatist paul green ascribed two varieties to two types of proof sets that mint sold at time that would have contained two cent piece nickel set contained only low value coins without precious metal while another contained also silver coins he suggested that one variety was struck for each large quantities of two cent pieces were withdrawn in 1870s and after approximately 17 000 000 of some 45 600 000 two cent pieces issued had been repurchased by treasury as of 1909 withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one cent pieces a bill for a two cent piece bearing portrait of recently deceased former president theodore roosevelt passed senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a house committee but never enacted numismatist s w freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two cent piece but for those who did it was often associated with spending it at a candy store he recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets as a dime did in freeman s day and he feared it would take a quarter to do in future full legal tender status was confirmed for two cent piece by coinage act of 1965 long after coin had passed from circulation as it made all coins and currency of united states good for all public and private debts without limit nevertheless numismatist jack white pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan piece hardly got its two cents in r s yeoman s 2018 edition of a guide book of united states coins lists 1864 large motto and 1865 as least expensive two cent pieces in good
