in mid november 1987 it gradually became better organized and on november 19 was first classified as a tropical cyclone moving west northwest nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening late on november 20 nina passed through chuuk lagoon after a brief pause in intensification nina intensified into a typhoon on november 22 two days later typhoon intensified suddenly before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of during afternoon of november 25 nina moved ashore in southern luzon at same intensity it gradually weakened over land before entering south china sea and turning to north

convection waxed and waned but on november 17 joint typhoon warning center jtwc started tracking system at this time system developed deep convection as well as good outflow jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa at 0100 utc on november 19 due to a significant increase in organization five hours later japan meteorological agency jma started monitoring system continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west northwest cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by jtwc at midday on evening of november 19 both jtwc and jma upgraded system to tropical storm prompting jtwc to name system as nina shortly after developing banding features initially forecast by jtwc to move slowly instead nina accelerated while gradually intensifying at 1600 utc on november 20 tropical storm nina passed south of weno island in chuuk lagoon two hours later jma upgraded nina to a severe tropical storm after moving away from island on morning of november 21 jtwc upgraded nina to a typhoon at 1200 utc with jma following suit early on november 22 shortly thereafter nina made its closest approach to ulithi passing to north at 1600 utc nina tracked about north of yap thumb right nina at peak intensity while approaching landfall in philippines typhoon nina accelerated slightly as it traversed open waters of philippine sea storm continued to slowly deepen though early on november 23 system leveled off in intensity that day philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa also monitored storm and assigned it with local name sisang upon entering philippine area of responsibility however midday on november 24 nina entered a phase of explosive intensification at a rate of an hour despite this jma only increased intensity slightly to after developing a well defined eye jtwc reported that nina attained its peak intensity of making it a low end category 5 system on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale at 1500 utc on november 25 nina moved ashore along southern tip of luzon at its peak intensity despite interacting with land little change in strength occurred until 0000 utc on november 26 at that time system began to weaken after traversing luzon and mindoro jtwc reduced wind speed of typhoon to although no eye was visible on satellite imagery radar imagery indicated that an eye was present but cloud filed henceforth jtwc increased intensity of nina to equivalent to a weak category 3 hurricane according to jma however nina never re intensified by 0000 utc on november 27 low and mid level circulations began to decouple deeply thwarting many jtwc forecasters during this time cyclone posed a serious threat to southern china and hong kong but instead nina veered northward while gradually weakening by midday on november 27 jma had reduced intensity of nina to early on november 28 an eye once again became visible on satellite imagery however no re intensification occurred by afternoon increased wind shear took toll on cyclone causing nina to become less organized due to deep convection being sheared off to east northeast thus jtwc expected nina to move into luzon straits and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after meandering within south china sea nina turned south before dissipating on november 29 though jma continued to monitor its remnants until 0000 utc on november 30
