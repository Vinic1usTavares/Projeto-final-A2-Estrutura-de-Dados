churches of christ are autonomous christian congregations associated with one another through distinct beliefs and practices represented chiefly in united states and one of several branches to develop out of american restoration movement they claim biblical precedent for their doctrine and practice and trace their heritage back to early christian church as described in new testament more broadly restoration movement was an evangelistic and bible based effort launched in various places as several people sought a return to original teachings and practices of new testament christian leaders including robert sandeman james o kelly abner jones elias smith rice haggard thomas campbell alexander campbell walter scott and barton w stone were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted eventual phenomenon known as american restoration movement restoration ideal was also similar and somewhat connected to earlier restoration efforts in europe such as those of john glas robert haldane and james haldane as well as puritan movements in colonial america though differing somewhat in details each group consisted of like minded christians who although often independent of one another had declared independence from their various denominations and traditional creeds seeking a fresh start to return to doctrines and practices of new testament church they did not see themselves as establishing a new church but rather sought unification of all christians in a single body patterned after original church of new testament rubel shelly i just want to be a christian 20th century christian nashville tennessee 1984 names church of christ christian church and disciples of christ were adopted by movement because they believed these terms to be biblical rather than denominational prior to u s religious census of 1906 all congregations associated with restoration movement had been reported together by census bureau but as movement developed tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration highlighting differences in groups underlying approaches to biblical interpretation for churches of christ practices not present in accounts of new testament worship were not permissible in church in contrast christian church may consider any practice not expressly forbidden for example christian church uses musical instruments in worship known as christian church whereas churches of christ believe a cappella singing to be proper although some church of christ congregations do use instruments in addition there was also disagreement over appropriateness of organizational structures above congregational level such as those of missionary societies and funding orphanages though not officially recognized as distinct movements until 1906 separation of churches of christ and christian churches had been taking place gradually for decades restoration movement was not a purely north american phenomenon and active mission efforts began in 18th century in a sense restoration movement began in united kingdom before getting traction in america see e g robert haldane s influence in scotland there are now churches of christ in

music few congregations clap hands or use musical instruments during formal weekly convocations remaining congregations may be grouped into four categories which generally differ from mainstream consensus in specific practices rather than in theological perspectives and tend to have smaller congregations on average largest of these four categories is non institutional churches of christ this group is notable for opposing congregational support of institutions such as orphans homes and bible colleges similarly non institutional congregations also oppose use of church facilities for non church activities such as fellowship dinners or recreation as such they oppose construction of fellowship halls gymnasiums and similar structures in both cases opposition is based on belief that support of institutions and non church activities are not proper functions of local congregation approximately 2 055 congregations fall in this category remaining three groups whose congregations are generally considerably smaller than those of mainstream or non institutional groups also oppose institutional support as well as fellowship halls and similar structures for same reasons as non institutional groups but differ by other beliefs and practices groups often overlap but in all cases hold to more conservative views than even non institutional groups one group opposes separate sunday school classes for children or gender separated groups thus meet only as a whole assembly in one area this group consists of approximately 1 100 congregations no sunday school group generally overlaps with one cup group and may overlap with mutual edification group as defined below another group opposes use of multiple communion cups term one cup is often used sometimes pejoratively as one cuppers to describe this group there are approximately 550 congregations in this group congregations in this group differ as to whether wine should be fermented or whether cup can be refilled if during service it runs dry or even if it is accidentally spilled and whether bread can be broken ahead of time or must be broken by individual participant during lord s supper time last and smallest group emphasize s mutual edification by various leaders in churches and oppose s one person doing most of preaching term mutual edification is often used to describe this group group includes roughly

commands examples and necessary inferences dispensational analysis distinguishing between patriarchal mosaic and christian dispensations however churches of christ are and generally hold views and grammatico historical analysis relative importance given to each of these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts general impression in current churches of christ is that group s hermeneutics are entirely based on command example inference approach in practice interpretation has been deductive and heavily influenced by group s central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology inductive reasoning has been used as well as when all of conversion accounts from book of acts are collated and analyzed to determine steps necessary for salvation one student of movement summarized traditional approach this way in most of their however my impression is that spokespersons in churches of christ reason from scripture in a deductive manner arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion in this regard approach is much like that of science which in practice moves from one hypothesis to another rather than in a inductive manner in recent years changes in degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of traditional hermeneutics among some associated with churches of christ a debate arose during 1980s over use of command example necessary inference model for identifying essentials of new testament faith some argued that it fostered legalism and advocated instead a hermeneutic based on character of god christ and holy spirit traditionalists urged rejection of this new hermeneutic douglas allen foster and anthony l dunnavant encyclopedia of stone campbell movement christian church

colleges in recent decades while it is still not seen as authoritative for christian worship church organization or regulating christian s life some have argued that it is theologically authoritative many scholars associated with churches of christ embrace methods of modern biblical criticism but not associated anti views more generally classical grammatico historical method is prevalent which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding scriptures doctrine of salvation soteriology churches of christ are strongly anti calvinist in their understanding of salvation and generally present conversion as obedience to proclaimed facts of gospel rather than as result of an emotional spirit initiated conversion churches of christ hold view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins these lost souls can be redeemed because jesus christ son of god offered himself as atoning sacrifice children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between two are believed to be innocent of sin there is no set age for this to occur it is only when child learns difference between right and wrong that they are accountable congregations differ in their interpretation of age of accountability churches of christ generally teach that process of salvation involves following steps one must be properly taught and hear one must believe or have faith one must repent which means turning from one s former lifestyle and choosing god s ways one must confess belief that jesus is son of god one must be baptized in name of jesus christ and one must live faithfully as a christian beginning in 1960s many preachers began placing more emphasis on role of grace in salvation instead of focusing exclusively on implementing all of new testament commands and examples richard thomas hughes and r l roberts churches of christ 2nd edition greenwood publishing group 2001 345 pages this was not an entirely new approach as others had actively affirmed a theology of free and unmerited grace but it did represent a change of emphasis with grace becoming a theme that would increasingly define this tradition baptism thumb right 200px alt a baptism in a river two men are standing hip deep in blue water with trees in background baptism by has been recognized as an important rite throughout history of christian church but christian groups differ over manner in which baptism is administered meaning and significance of baptism its role in salvation and who is a candidate for baptism baptism in

capable of belief and repentance are baptized i e infant baptism is not practiced because new testament has no precedent for it churches of christ have historically had most conservative position on baptism among various branches of restoration movement understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion douglas allen foster and anthony l dunnavant encyclopedia of stone campbell movement christian church disciples of christ christian churches churches of christ churches of christ wm b eerdmans publishing 2004 854 pages entry on baptism most significant disagreements concerned extent to which a correct understanding of role of baptism is necessary for its validity david lipscomb argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey god baptism was valid even if individual did not fully understand role baptism plays in salvation austin mcgary argued that to be valid convert must also understand that baptism is for forgiveness of sins mcgary s view became prevailing one in early 20th century but approach advocated by lipscomb never totally disappeared more recently rise of international churches of christ who some who came into their fellowship even those previously immersed for remission of sins in a church of christ has caused some to reexamine question of churches of christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to god and that god by merits of christ s blood cleanses one from sin and truly changes state of person from an alien to a citizen of god s kingdom baptism is not a human work it is place where god does work that only god can do baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work it is a confession that a person has nothing to offer god while churches of christ do not describe baptism as a sacrament their view of it can legitimately be described as sacramental they see power of baptism coming from god who chose to use baptism as a vehicle rather than from water or act itself and understand baptism to be an integral part of conversion process rather than as only a symbol of conversion a recent trend is to emphasize transformational aspect of baptism instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in past it is seen as event that places believer into christ where god does ongoing work of transformation there is a minority that downplays importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism but broader trend is to reexamine richness of biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in christianity because of belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation some baptists hold that churches of christ endorse doctrine of baptismal regeneration douglas a foster churches of christ and baptism an historical and theological overview restoration quarterly volume 43 number 2 2001 however members of churches of christ reject this arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary and that cleansing of sins is by blood of christ through grace of god baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual douglas allen foster and anthony l

regeneration one author describes relationship between faith and baptism this way faith is reason why a person is a child of god baptism is time at which one is incorporated into christ and so becomes a child of god italics are in source baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance rather than a work that earns salvation a cappella worship churches of christ generally combine lack of any historical evidence that early church used musical instruments in worship and belief that there is no scriptural support for using instruments in church s worship service to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship churches of christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services not all churches of christ are without instruments use of musical instruments in worship was a divisive topic within stone campbell movement from its earliest years when some adherents opposed practice on traditional grounds while others may have relied on a cappella simply because they lacked access to musical instruments alexander campbell opposed use of instruments in worship as early as 1855 some restoration movement churches were using organs or pianos ultimately leading churches of christ to separate from groups that condoned instrumental music scriptural backing given by members for practice of a cappella includes and when they had sung a hymn they went out to mount of olives therefore i will praise thee among gentiles and sing to thy name be filled with spirit addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody to lord with all your heart i will sing with spirit and i will sing with understanding also let word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts unto god i will declare thy name unto my brethren in midst of church will i sing praise unto thee by him therefore let us offer

musical instruments began in 1860 with introduction of organs in some churches more basic were differences in underlying approach to biblical interpretation for churches of christ any practices not present in accounts of new testament worship were not permissible in church and they could find no new testament documentation of use of instrumental music in worship for christian churches any

adopted a new provisional design for their work together becoming christian church disciples of christ those congregations that chose not to be associated with new denominational organization continued as undenominational christian churches and churches of christ completing a separation that had begun decades before instrumental christian churches and churches of christ in some cases have both organizational and differences with churches of christ discussed in this article for example they have a loosely organized convention and view scriptural silence on an issue more but they are more closely related to churches of christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with disciples of christ denomination some see divisions in movement as result of tension between goals of

strong opponent of slavery arguing that there was no biblical justification for form of slavery then being practiced in united states and calling for immediate emancipation alexander campbell represented a more jeffersonian opposition to slavery writing of it as more of a political problem than as a religious or moral one having seen methodists and baptists divide over issue of slavery campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it and that abolition should not be allowed to become an issue over which christians would break fellowship with each other like country as a whole assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all sides of issue and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members after

harding university railed against racial integration claiming that racial segregation was divine order manner in which brethren in some quarters are going in for negro meetings leads one to wonder whether they are trying to make white folks out of negroes or negroes out of white folks trend of general mix up seems to be toward latter reliable reports have come to me of white women members of church becoming so animated over a certain colored preacher as to go up to him after a sermon and shake hands with him holding his hand in both of theirs that kind of thing will turn head of most white preachers and sometimes affect their conduct and anybody ought to know that it will make fools out of negroes for any woman in church to so far forget her dignity and lower herself so just because a negro has learned enough about gospel to preach it to his race is pitiable indeed her husband should take her in charge unless he has gone crazy too in that case somebody ought to take both
