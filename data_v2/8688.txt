born in ontario he studied law at osgoode hall law school before coming west to practice in edmonton he became active with liberal party of canada and when alberta was created in 1905 he was chosen by premier alexander cameron rutherford to be its first attorney general implicated in alberta and great waterways railway scandal he resigned in 1910 along with rest of rutherford s government as a backbencher he became leader of liberals opposed to government of rutherford s successor arthur sifton until sifton re appointed him attorney general in 1912 cross served in this capacity under sifton and his successor charles stewart until 1918 when stewart fired him after receiving no response to his request for cross s resignation cross remained in provincial politics until 1925 but in a radically diminished role after leaving provincial politics he was elected to canadian house of commons only to be defeated in his 1926 re election bid he died in 1928 early life cross was born in madoc ontario to merchant thomas cross and his wife marie he studied at upper canada college university of toronto and osgoode hall law school he moved west to edmonton in 1897 where he opened a law practice with william short it exists today as duncan craig llp when idea of creating one or more new provinces out of northwest territories gained currency cross was one of three people selected by edmonton city council to travel to ottawa and ensure that edmonton s interests were respected provincial politics early provincial career cross was a liberal and fast established himself was one of party s leading edmonton lights by some assessments he was second most influential liberal in city after frank oliver owner of edmonton bulletin and local member of parliament thomas 21 once decision was made to create province of alberta question emerged of who would govern it northwest territories were governed on a non partisan basis by premier frederick w a g haultain who was a conservative in federal politics some liberals such as peter talbot were amenable to haultain s becoming first premier of alberta either as head of a non partisan government or one formed by a coalition of liberals and conservatives cross was not among them thomas 15 cross s view prevailed and alberta s first lieutenant governor liberal george bulyea invited alexander cameron rutherford to form a government haultain went to saskatchewan created from a portion of northwest territories at same time as alberta was to lead provincial rights party thomas 18 20 though cross was only 32 rutherford named him alberta s first attorney general in consequence he was required to contest 1905 election he did so in district of edmonton against conservative william antrobus griesbach griesbach fought his campaign on liberal federal government s imposition on alberta of a requirement to fund separate schools an imposition to which older provinces were not subject thomas 24 cross won election with such a margin that griesbach lost his deposit thomas 28 one of first questions considered by new legislative assembly of alberta was choice of provincial capital terms of autonomy had made edmonton provisional capital but there was a movement to make calgary permanent choice this movement was led in legislature by minister of public works william henry cushing cross s cabinet colleague who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in calgary than in edmonton and that calgary was economic centre of province and therefore ought to be capital cross countered that edmonton s history as capital of canadian fur trade and its geographic location close to centre of province gave it stronger claim edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8 thomas 38 it would not be last issue on which cross and cushing disagreed as attorney general cross was responsible for overseeing prosecutions he was especially aggressive in his enforcement of sabbath observance act which prohibited most business activities on sundays thomas 68 he also introduced new workers compensation legislation highlight of which was making compensation automatic rather than result of a lawsuit by injured worker thomas 57 though bill addressed some of labour movement s concerns there remained many criticisms it failed to fine employers responsible for workplace hazards did not apply to injuries sustained while building or repairing buildings of less than in height did not protect casual labourers and limited compensation to a maximum of c 1 500 in response to these concerns cross lowered minimum building height to and raised maximum compensation to 1 800 to assuage farm leaders he also included an exemption for farm labour railway scandal cross was re elected in 1909 election as one of two members elected in newly expanded edmonton district soon after in february 1910 cushing resigned from cabinet stating that he disagreed with rutherford s approach to railway policy and specifically with his actions regarding alberta and great waterways railway a gw a gw was one of several new railways to take advantage of government s offer made under considerable public pressure of loan guarantees cushing and john r boyle attacked rutherford s government with latter charging that deputy attorney general s b woods had removed papers from government s files on a gw cross denied these charges on his deputy s behalf thomas 72 boyle followed with a motion that assets of a gw which he believed was taking advantage of government s guarantees to build a sub standard railway at government expense be expropriated thomas 74 cross led government s opposition to motion thomas 75 on march 9 cross abruptly resigned as attorney general woods resigned next day cross gave as his reason that rutherford had told him that cushing was re entering cabinet and cross felt that that made his position untenable cushing gave a different account he said that he had been asked by rutherford to re enter cabinet and that premier had told him that if he did cross would resign however he denied ever having agreed to do so and accused cross of fabricating his story completely rutherford stayed silent until march 11 when he announced that he had refused cross s resignation and that he was still attorney general thomas 82 83 soon after boyle made his own set of accusations saying that agents of liquor license department which was under cross had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that cross was aware of this cross denied charge thomas 85 crisis divided liberal party into two camps pro government liberals led by cross and rutherford and insurgent liberals led by cushing and boyle insurgents objective was to replace rutherford with cushing though most important liberals outside legislature including bulyea and oliver lacked confidence in rutherford they had little more in cushing thomas 87 some newspapers characterized struggle as visible element of a battle for influence between oliver long alberta s most prominent liberal and cross seen as its rising star thomas 91 though rutherford never actually lost a confidence motion bulyea pressured him to resign in favour of arthur sifton province s chief justice several of cross s supporters attempted to extract a promise to keep cross as attorney general in exchange for their support of sifton s government but sifton was unwilling to agree rutherford eventually and reluctantly complied with bulyea s wishes and rest of his government including cross followed suit thomas 89 90 subsequent rumours suggested that cross and his followers had agreed to resign only because of a belief that sifton would be appointed to supreme court of canada after approximately a year as premier with cross then being asked to form a government thomas 92 a subsequent commission declined to find cross guilty of wrongdoing in relation to a gw incident but criticized him and rutherford for granting over generous terms to railway thomas 104 backbenches and return to cabinet in keeping with sifton s policy of excluding all prominent players in a gw affair from cabinet cross was not re appointed cushing rutherford and boyle were also left out despite this cross declared his support for sifton s government while restating his admiration for rutherford s in response to a gw s default of its obligations to government sifton introduced a bill confiscating money a gw had raised through sale of government guaranteed bonds cross still a supporter of building a gw and concerned that bill did not include a commitment to use money to do so opposed it thomas 110 bill passed but was disallowed by courts sifton left with little choice but to use money for purpose for which it had been raised announced a new policy of railway construction thomas 121 at same time he invited cross to resume his post as attorney general boyle was also admitted to cabinet as minister of education cushing and rutherford other major players in a gw affair had withdrawn from limelight and neither would return to legislature after 1913 election cross accepted sifton s offer telling public that sifton s new railway policy made it proper for me to support and join his government thomas 125 126 in keeping with custom at time once appointed to cabinet cross resigned his seat in legislature and contested it in a by election his by election was held at same time as four others and while liberal papers were about endorsing liberal candidates in those in edmonton they gave cross a somewhat ride calgary albertan in an editorial advocating return of liberal candidates in all five by elections criticized cross as disloyal to sifton in beginning and doubtless will be to end edmonton bulletin still owned by oliver complained that while in other four by elections voters were being asked to judge sifton s government in edmonton it appeared that they were being asked to judge rutherford s thomas 126 cross defeated his main opponent conservative albert ewing but by a much smaller margin than he had managed in 1905 and 1909 ewing claimed electoral fraud and appealed outcome to courts but 1913 election pre empted his appeal thomas 127 in that election perhaps recalling narrowness of his by election win cross ran in two ridings edmonton and edson he won both ewing was second victor from two member edmonton district making him only person in alberta history to represent two constituencies at same time though not only one to try sifton also did so in 1913 and boyle would in 1921 thomas 144 prohibition was gaining currency in alberta conservatives had included it in their 1913 platform and it was supported by increasingly powerful united farmers of alberta ufa thomas 136 138 139 government generally opposed idea and cross held up manitoba as example of its failures thomas 139 but government had also at ufa s behest introduced direct democracy measures one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites well organized temperance movement did so on prohibition which was endorsed in ensuing plebiscite legislature passed prohibition act in spring of 1916 thomas 157 160 as attorney general cross was responsible for enforcing it thomas 161 conscription and stewart cabinet in 1917 alberta liberal party held delicately together since 1910 burst once again into conflict with conscription crisis conservative federal government of robert borden supported imposing conscription to help win world war i and most of english canada supported him liberal leader wilfrid laurier opposed conscription but many of party s english speaking members supported it and defected to a borden led union government this dispute had repercussions in alberta party sifton supported conscription and shortly after winning 1917 election in which cross was re elected in edson but did not run in edmonton resigned as premier to move to federal politics and a ministry in borden s government thomas 179 cross opposed conscription in this he was joined by oliver and two put aside years of animosity to campaign together for laurier in 1917 federal election cross regarded laurier as something of a hero and proclaimed that he was fairly convinced that first duty of canadians to their country is to get rid of crowd of profiteers at ottawa who have brought country to its present condition thomas 181 182 sifton s successor as premier was charles stewart minister of public works in his cabinet stewart who supported conscription but did not actively campaign for it or unionists kept cross as attorney general despite rumours that he would not thomas 180 181 cross s major challenge was enforcing prohibition which was proving challenging conservatives and in particular george douglas stanley were to accuse cross of mismanagement thomas 168 in meantime a rift was opening between cross and stewart whom conservatives accused somewhat ironically of being unduly influenced by his attorney general stewart found cross neglectful of his duties and after cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work stewart felt could be better done by alberta provincial police stewart requested his resignation when twelve days passed without a reply from cross stewart fired him august 26 1918 his replacement as attorney general was boyle his nemesis of alberta and great waterways era thomas 194 cross remained in legislature for several more years but took no active role in its proceedings and soon ceased to be regarded as a major force he was re elected in 1921 election making him and boyle only veterans of first legislature still in office ufa fielding candidates for first time won a majority of seats in election and stewart resigned as premier thomas 204 cross continued his indifferent performance as mla until may 1925 when he resigned to enter federal politics federal career and later life cross ran as a liberal in 1925 federal election in riding of and defeated donald ferdinand kellner progressive incumbent from edmonton east stewart who had also left provincial politics was elected in adjacent edmonton west liberals under incumbent prime minister william lyon mackenzie king won fewer seats than conservatives but king decided to remain as prime minister anyway as a result cross sat in house of commons of canada throughout king byng affair in ensuing 1926 election cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with kellner charles wilson cross died of a heart attack june 2 1928 in calgary electoral record 1921
