amanita ocreata commonly known as death angel destroying angel angel of death or more precisely western north american destroying angel is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus one of many in genus amanita occurring in pacific northwest and california floristic provinces of north america a ocreata associates with oak trees large fruiting bodies mushrooms generally appear in spring cap may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre while stipe ring gill and volva are all white amanita ocreata resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans increasing risk of accidental poisoning mature fruiting bodies can be confused with edible a velosa a or while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible agaricus mushrooms or puffballs similar in toxicity to death cap a phalloides and destroying angels of europe a virosa and eastern north america a bisporigera it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in california its principal toxic constituent a amanitin damages liver and kidneys often fatally and has no known antidote though and n acetylcysteine show promise initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain diarrhea and vomiting these subside temporarily after 2 3 days though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common symptoms of jaundice diarrhea delirium seizures and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6 16 days post ingestion taxonomy and naming amanita ocreata was first described by american mycologist charles horton peck in 1909 from material collected by charles fuller baker in claremont california specific epithet is derived from latin wearing greaves from greave referring to its loose baggy volva amanita is a botanical synonym mushroom belongs to same section phalloideae and genus amanita as several deadly poisonous fungi including death cap a phalloides and several all white species of amanita known as destroying angels a bisporigera of eastern north america and european a virosa death angel is used as an alternate common name description a ocreata is generally stouter than other fungi termed destroying angels it first appears as a white egg shaped object covered with a universal veil as it grows mushroom breaks free though there may rarely be ragged patches of veil left at cap edges cap is initially hemispherical before becoming more convex and flattening sometimes irregularly this may result in undulations in cap which may reach up to 12 cm 5 in in diameter colour varies from white through yellowish white to shades of ochre sometimes with a brownish centre occasionally parts of fruiting bodies may have pinkish tones rest of fungus below cap is white crowded gills are free to narrowly adnate stipe is 8 20 cm 3 8 in high and 1 5 2 cm 1 2 2 3 in thick at apex and bears a thin white membranous ring volva is thin smooth and sac like although may be quite extensive and contain almost half stipe spore print is white and subglobose to ovoid to amyloid spores are 9 14 x 7 10 mm viewed under a microscope there is typically no smell though some fruiting bodies may have a slight odour described as that of bleach or chlorine dead fish or iodine like other destroying angels flesh stains yellow when treated with potassium hydroxide koh thiers hd 1982 agaricales gilled fungi of california 1 amanitaceae eureka ca mad river press this fungus resembles edible mushrooms agaricus arvensis and a campestris and puffballs lycoperdon spp before caps have opened and gills have become visible so those collecting immature fungi run risk of confusing varieties it also resembles and grows in same areas as edible and prized amanita velosa which can be distinguished from a ocreata by its lack of ring striate cap margin and thick universal veil remnants comprising veil edible amanita calyptroderma lacks a ring and is more likely to have veil patches remaining on its cap which is generally darker volvariella speciosa has pink spores and no ring or volva distribution and habitat appearing from january to april a ocreata occurs later in year than other amanitas except a calyptroderma it is found in mixed woodland on pacific coast of north america from washington south through california to baja california in mexico it may feasibly occur on vancouver island in british columbia though this has never been confirmed it forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak quercus agrifolia benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 205 as well as hazel corylus spp in oregon and washington it may also be associated with garry oak quercus toxicity amanita ocreata is highly toxic and has been responsible for mushroom poisonings in western north america particularly in spring it contains highly toxic amatoxins as well as phallotoxins a feature shared with closely related death cap a phalloides half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human and other species known as destroying angels benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 211 there is some evidence it may be most toxic of all north american phalloideae as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40 perished dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in california with fatal results amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure that of eight amino acid rings of those found in a ocreata a amanitin is most prevalent and along with b amanitin is likely to be responsible for toxic effects major toxic mechanism is inhibition of rna polymerase ii a vital enzyme in synthesis of messenger rna mrna microrna and small nuclear rna snrna without mrna essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and cell dies liver is principal organ affected as it is first organ encountered after absorption by gastrointestinal tract though other organs especially kidneys are susceptible to toxins benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas p 217 phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds all of which have seven similar peptide rings although they are highly toxic to liver cells phallotoxins have since been found to have little input into destroying angel s toxicity as they are not absorbed through gut furthermore one phallotoxin phalloidin is also found in edible and sought after amanita rubescens signs and symptoms signs and symptoms of poisoning by a ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include abdominal pain with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and in severe cases hypotension tachycardia hypoglycemia and acid base disturbances initial symptoms resolve two to three days after ingestion of fungus a more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur jaundice diarrhea delirium seizures and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by accumulation of normally liver removed substances in blood renal failure either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage and coagulopathy may appear during this stage life threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure intracranial hemorrhage sepsis pancreatitis acute renal failure and cardiac arrest death generally occurs six to sixteen days after poisoning treatment consumption of a ocreata is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization there are four main categories of therapy for poisoning preliminary medical care supportive measures specific treatments and liver transplantation preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage however due to delay between ingestion and first symptoms of poisoning it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion potentially reducing efficacy of these interventions supportive measures are directed towards treating dehydration which results from fluid loss during gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis hypoglycemia electrolyte imbalances and impaired coagulation no definitive antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available but some specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin g have been shown to improve survival there is some evidence that intravenous silibinin an extract from blessed milk thistle silybum marianum may be beneficial in reducing effects of amatoxins preventing their uptake by thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue in patients developing liver failure a liver transplant is often only option to prevent death liver transplants have become a well established option in amatoxin poisoning this is a complicated issue however as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality patients require long term immunosuppression to maintain transplant evidence suggests that although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage benjamin mushrooms poisons and panaceas pp 231 232 however a follow up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion see also list of amanita species list of deadly fungi references works cited external links key to species of amanita
