boletus abruptibulbus is a species of bolete mushroom in family boletaceae described as new to science in 2009 it is found only in gulf coast of florida panhandle where it grows on ground in coastal sand dunes one of only three north american boletes known to favor this habitat fruit bodies have convex brownish caps up to in diameter supported by solid yellowish to reddish stems measuring long by thick pores on underside of cap measure about 1 2 mm in diameter and are initially pale yellow before developing a greenish tinge in age mushroom s spores about 20 micrometers long are unusually long for a member of boletaceae stem base is bulbous a diagnostic feature for which species is named taxonomy species was described as new to science in 2009 by beatriz ortiz santana william roody and ernst both in journal mycotaxon holotype material was collected at st joseph peninsula state park in florida in january 2005 in 2007 roody and both published a short description and color photograph of species in their field guide mushrooms of southeastern united states but this was not a valid name as it lacked a latin description specific epithet abruptibulbus refers to abruptly swollen bulbus shape of bulb at base of stem description convex cap measures in diameter slightly sticky when wet cap surface is shiny and smooth sometimes surface has flattened filaments formed from aggregated hyphae and may develop cracks thin and easily detached cap cuticle is initially reddish brown to dark brown later becoming cinnamon brown cap margin is curved inward when young but becomes bent downward when mature white to very pale yellow cap flesh does not change color when exposed to air and has a pleasant odor and mild taste tubes comprising hymenophore on underside of cap measure long and are pale yellow initially before developing a greenish tinge in age pore surface does not stain when it is bruised pores are roughly spherical or polyhedral at first becoming angular to pentagonal in age and almost gill like near attachment to stem pores are about 1 2 mm in diameter stem is solid i e not hollow long thick in upper part expanding to at bulbous base it has pseudorrhiza cord like structures resembling a plant root that are long stem surface is dry and smooth except for a powdery region near apex top of stem is yellow but it gradually becomes reddish approaching bulbous base stem tissue is pale yellow although tunnels dug by insect larvae are reddish brown a drop of dilute ammonia as a 12 nh4oh solution placed on cap surface immediately turns dark red if placed on bulbous part of stem base of a dried specimen it will turn dark for roughly 15 seconds before starting to fade spores are smooth spindle shaped and measure 13 5 19 8 by 5 0 7 2 um rather large for a member of boletaceae grayish yellow or greenish yellow when mounted in a dilute potassium hydroxide they are dextrinoid yellowish or reddish brown when stained with melzer s reagent basidia spore bearing cells in hymenium are club shaped hyaline translucent four spored and measure 28 8 42 3 by 7 2 11 7 um hymenium contains basidioles immature or aborted basidia which are club shaped and measure 20 7 35 1 by 7 2 9 0 um pleurocystidia cystidia on surface of tubes range in shape from somewhat spindle shaped to cylindrical and are hyaline smooth and thin walled with dimensions of 41 4 61 2 by 7 2 10 8 um cystidia on edges of pores cheilocystidia are 31 5 49 5 by 7 2 13 5 um spindle shaped to centrally swollen hyaline smooth and thin walled clamp connections are absent from hyphae bulbous base large spores and distinctive habitat are characteristic features that make this species readily distinguishable from other boletes it has a coloration and cap texture similar to boletus and b but spores of these species are shorter 11 15 um and 11 16 um respectively habitat and distribution thumb right typical habitat st joseph peninsula state park fruit bodies of boletus abruptibulbus grow singly or in groups in sand species is known only from gulf coast of florida panhandle where fruiting occurs on older sand dunes particularly in areas where habit changes from coastal scrub to oak pine woods this latter habitat is characterized by presence of tree species sand live oak quercus myrtle oak q myrtifolia and sand pine pinus clausa fruiting occurs from december to march boletus abruptibulbus is one of only three north american boletaceae species that occur in coastal sand dunes others are leccinum arenicola found in new brunswick canada and arenicola described from oregon see also list of boletus species references external links abruptibulbus category fungi of united states category fungi described in 2009
