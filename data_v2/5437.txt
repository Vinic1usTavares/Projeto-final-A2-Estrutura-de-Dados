hurricane ignacio was latest forming first hurricane of a pacific hurricane season since reliable satellite observation began in 1966 ninth tropical storm of 2003 pacific hurricane season ignacio developed out of a tropical wave on august 22 a short distance off coast of mexico it was initially predicted to track out to sea and remain a weak tropical storm though it unexpectedly organized rapidly to attain peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h on august 24 while located a short distance southeast of southern baja california land interaction weakened ignacio to an 80 mph 130 km h hurricane by time it made landfall near la paz and it dissipated on august 27 in central region of baja california peninsula hurricane produced heavy rainfall in southern baja california killing two rescue works from floodwaters resort areas near coast experienced minor effects though further inland damage was more severe impact of ignacio was compounded by flooding from hurricane marty a month later with damage from two hurricanes totaling about 1 billion 2003 usd 1 1 billion 2006 usd meteorological history a tropical wave exited coast of africa on august 6 it moved westward across atlantic ocean without development and entered eastern pacific ocean on august 16 after crossing central america cloudiness and convection gradually increased along wave axis and organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather on august 20 while located a short distance south of manzanillo mexico it slowly became better organized as it moved northwestward in an area favorable for continued development with light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures convection concentrated around a developing low level circulation and on august 22 it organized enough for national hurricane center to classify it as tropical depression nine e while it was located about 115 miles 185 km west of mexico mainland or about 220 miles 345 km southeast of southern tip of baja california peninsula with an anticyclone located over southwestern united states and a ridge extending southward into northwestern mexico national hurricane center initially predicted depression to track generally west northwestward out to sea and reach peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h tropical depression moved slowly northwestward with slow motion persisting for its entire lifetime due to storm being embedded within weakness of a mid level ridge to its north shortly after forming storm was located in a marginally favorable environment with westerly wind shear and dry air approaching depression and leaving center of circulation exposed from convection however wind shear subsequently decreased and early on august 23 depression intensified into tropical storm ignacio storm quickly organized and developed well defined banding features and very well organized upper level outflow and by late on august 23 a warm spot formed in center of convection warm spot organized into an intermittent eye feature early on august 24 ignacio attained hurricane status latest formation of first hurricane of a season recorded in east pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966 right thumb hurricane ignacio near baja california peninsula on august 24 hurricane ignacio continued to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane and reached peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h later on august 24 while located within 30 miles 48 km h off coast of baja california sur upon reaching peak strength hurricane possessed a 12 mile 19 km wide eye surrounded by very deep convection national hurricane center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if center remained over open water however it turned to northwest and paralleled baja california peninsula a short distance offshore resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with high terrain on august 25 ignacio made landfall just east of la paz with winds of 80 mph 130 km h it rapidly weakened over land first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12 hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore ignacio continued northwestward across peninsula and dissipated on august 28 while located in northwestern baja california sur preparations thumb left hurricane ignacio making landfall in baja california peninsula on august 25 coinciding with issuance of first advisory on ignacio government of mexico issued a tropical storm watch from santa fe to la paz with watch upgraded to a warning nine hours later warning was extended on both coasts from bahia magdalena to san evaristo next day about 48 hours before ignacio made landfall a hurricane warning was issued from santa fe to la paz and 21 hours later extended to bahia magdalena and san evaristo government of mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for mainland from to topolobampo in state of sinaloa civil protection agency for state of baja california sur ordered for evacuation for 10 000 residents in flood prone areas near la paz officials also moved 700 people in areas near rivers to shelters in los cabos 32 emergency shelters were set up in and around la paz residents near coast placed sandbags to protect their houses from potential flooding and also stocked up on hurricane supplies police authorities were stationed in areas around los cabos to guard against price gouging officials closed many schools and businesses throughout area and also shut down area s primary airport in la paz about 500 people in sinaloa were evacuated as well impact thumb right hurricane ignacio rainfall prior to developing precursor tropical disturbance dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds primarily from zihuatanejo in state of guerrero to manzanillo in state of colima slow motion of ignacio produced heavy rainfall across southern portion of baja california peninsula including a peak 24 hour total of 7 25 inches 184 mm in ciudad constitucion national hurricane center warned of rainfall totals of up to 20 inches 500 mm in some localized areas which did verify in los cabos ignacio produced strong waves which hit eastern baja california coastline swells of 10 feet 3 m in height in la paz closed city s small port hurricane force winds blew down trees signs and power lines in and around la paz while closer to beach hurricane destroyed multiple beach huts rough surf in harbor of la paz sunk one fishing vessel and grounded four others efforts by mexican navy prevented an additional vessel and two cruise ships from being grounded in cabo san lucas effects were minimal amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2 inches 50 mm passage of hurricane left citizens in todos santos without power for around 24 hours heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding destroying bridges and multiple mudslides some of which blocked roads flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads causing mexican government to restrict traffic through much of peninsula for up to a week after storm many roads remained impassable for a month after hurricane closed roads and airport in la paz and southern baja california left some tourists stranded rainfall was welcome in some desert areas where moderate precipitation filled reservoirs two rescue workers died when they were swept away by floodwaters six municipalities in baja california were declared disaster areas and by four days after landfall mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet immediate needs of affected citizens heavy rainfall was also reported in sinaloa on mexican mainland remnants of ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior california over 300 lightning strikes from remnant moisture was recorded in a one hour period lightning caused 14 forest fires in merced county resulting in a loss of power to over 3 500 customers in and around atwater area just a month after ignacio hurricane marty passed through area causing additional damage to areas hit by ignacio combined damage from two hurricanes totaled about 1 billion 2003 usd 1 1 billion 2006 usd and effects from two storms left at least 50 000 homeless see also
