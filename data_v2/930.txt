insurgency following 2009 afghan presidential election afghan president karzai s views about security issues confronting afghanistan and how best to deal with them reportedly changed this impacted working relationship between president of afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief saleh said he karzai thought democracy had hurt him as a person his family had been attacked by media unfairly and west was criticizing him unfairly so after a presidential election he was a changed man and we could not have same relationship as before presidential election political analyst ahmed rashid in 2010 observed same karzai s new outlook is most dramatic political shift he has undergone in twenty six years that i have known him both saleh and interior minister hanif atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with karzai on how to proceed against taliban who karzai began referring to as brothers at that point saleh and atmar were increasingly isolated in karzai administration president obama visited kabul in late march 2010 to address afghan cabinet and repair ties with hamid karzai obama reiterated us commitment to afghanistan saying united states does not quit once it starts on something saleh explained to obama that pakistanis believe west has lost in afghanistan and that isi seeks to exploit division between europe and united states he recommended intense cooperation between us and afghanistan to prevent extremist groups from regaining power in early 2010 an afghan man approached nds claiming to represent senior taliban commander mullah akhtar muhammad mansour offering a letter allegedly written by mansour he said mansour was interested to open a channel for negotiations saleh s people started testing credentials of supposed messenger and judged them to be false closing case man then approached other afghan government institutions saleh recounts when i learned that he was going through a different avenue i warned government that if it is this aminullah if he claims this and if it is this guy trust me he is not representing anybody it s a scam be careful this is not mansour but there was a perception that amrullah is against talks so let s sideline him afghan man who lived in pakistan where taliban s leadership council is based subsequently held three meetings with nato and afghan officials having been flown from pakistan to kabul on a nato airplane man met with president karzai in presidential palace in late 2010 it turned out that supposed representative for mansour was an impostor as saleh had previously warned new york times writes in an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel united states and afghan officials now say afghan man was an impostor thumb 300px amrullah saleh at an international conference in late 2011 on june 6 2010 saleh resigned from nds while atmar resigned from his position as interior minister after a militant attack against national peace jirga although nobody had been killed or wounded and attackers had been arrested a few days after jirga karzai had summoned atmar and saleh to discuss attack against jirga after meeting both men officially resigned because of failure to stop attack on jirga writes saleh told reporters he had submitted his resignation as general director of national security because he had lost karzai s trust as a result of attack he said he and atmar had briefed president on security preparations for jirga and subsequent success in capturing facilitators but karzai had not been satisfied he had therefore felt unable to continue in his post he also said there were tens of reasons for leaving his position but would not elaborate on others two men s resignation led to widespread concerns among afghanistan experts concerns were voiced over direction country was moving in former united nation s special representative to afghanistan kai eide writes president karzai s national security adviser rangin was quoted as saying according to ambassador hank crumpton from cia who led operation enduring freedom in afghanistan in 2001 saleh possessed good technical skills and emerging leadership traits ambassador crumpton also writes in his recent book that he found saleh to be young brilliant honest and devoted to a free afghanistan art of intelligence lessons from a life in cia s clandestine service by henry a crumpton resignation of saleh and atmar came amidst heavy disagreement between hamid karzai and amrullah saleh on how to proceed against taliban daoud a member of afghan parliament said he had observed that disagreement between karzai on one side and cabinet members such as saleh and atmar on other side had been going on for a while saleh publicly blamed pakistan for its support to taliban and other extremist groups and said talks with taliban should take place but not at cost of democratic structures meanwhile karzai had increasingly been placing his hopes on his attempts to reach a secret deal with taliban and pakistan pakistan had repeatedly urged karzai to oust saleh from his position afghan media extensively covered resignations with daily liberal newspaper e headlining an article resignation of atmar and saleh accountability to people or tribute to pakistan saleh said he considered karzai a patriot but that president was making a mistake if he planned to rely on pakistani support as pakistan was trying to reimpose taliban saleh on bbc s hard talk explained and reiterated that karzai in hoping to reach a deal with taliban and pakistan s isi through appeasement policy had alienated his internal allies as well as afghanistan s external allies and had undermined morale of afghan security forces it was reported in 2010 that inter services intelligence isi and taliban regarded saleh as their fiercest opponent he subsequently founded basej e milli national mobilization and green trend as a pro democracy and anti taliban movement bin laden musharraf controversy saleh has repeatedly stated that afghan intelligence believed and had shared information about osama bin laden hiding in an area close to abbottabad pakistan four years before he bin laden was killed there by us forces saleh had shared information with pakistani president pervez musharraf who had angrily brushed off claim taking no action as early as 2004 agents working for afghan intelligence determined that bin laden was living in a major settled area in pakistan proper rather than semi autonomous tribal areas on afghan pakistan border amrullah saleh told guardian leading saleh and afghan intelligence to that conclusion were thousands of interrogation reports and assumption that bin laden a millionaire with multiple wives and no background of toughness would not be living in a tent i was pretty sure he was in settled areas of pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate tribal areas and we had massive numbers of informants there they could find any arab but not bin laden in 2007 afghans specifically identified two al qaeda safe houses in a town just miles from abbottabad leading them to believe that bin laden was possibly hiding there but amrullah saleh says that pakistani president pervez musharraf angrily smashed his fist on a table when saleh presented information to him during a meeting in which afghan president hamid karzai also took part according to saleh he said am i president of republic of banana then he turned to president karzai and said why have you brought this panjshiri guy to teach me intelligence a bbc journalist confronting musharraf with saleh s allegations writes former leader of pakistan plays dispassionate broker very well but this is when mr musharraf s camouflage starts to slip substance of claim he handles like a politician it was actually a case of mistaken identity involving cia he says but he bristles with anger at mention of amrullah saleh s name accusing saleh of impertinence and being lowly musharraf stated amrullah saleh i have never liked and therefore he has no right to present anything to me a december 2011 analysis report by jamestown foundation however came to conclusion that in spite of denials by pakistani military evidence is emerging that elements within pakistani military harbored osama bin laden with knowledge of former army chief general pervez musharraf and possibly current chief of army staff general ashfaq pervez kayani former pakistani army chief general ziauddin butt aka general ziauddin khawaja revealed at a conference on pakistani us relations in october 2011 that according to his knowledge then former director general of intelligence bureau of pakistan 2004 2008 brigadier ijaz shah retd had kept osama bin laden in an intelligence bureau safe

afghan local police should be strengthened but be insulated from political influence of current government stakeholders explaining reason why west has not succeeded in afghanistan amrullah emphasized lack of effort towards creating an anti taliban constituency he wrote anti taliban constituency is not an ethnic alliance against south but rather a political umbrella for all afghans who seek a pluralistic society and oppose of society as part of a so called reconciliation deal perhaps 80 percent of afghans oppose taliban such an umbrella will be afghans best representative in any talks with taliban since karzai and his high peace council lack credibility among afghans who experienced taliban s oppressive rule anti taliban constituency by amrullah saleh published at national review online on april 6 2011 accessed at http www com articles anti taliban constituency amrullah saleh speaking during inauguration of an islamic foundation in kabul saleh said karzai government and united states of america cannot represent anti taliban afghan civilians and initiate peace talks while simultaneously excluding them former afghan intelligence chief insisted on considering views of afghan people during peace talks process as a majority of afghans both in northern and southern regions he said have negative views of taliban he also questioned honesty of taliban s involvement in peace talks recent objections by nearly all major opposition parties come amid growing efforts by us and hamid karzai to make headway in secret talks with taliban and gulbuddin hekmatyar s hezb i islami in these talks representatives from anti taliban united front which fought taliban from 1994 until 2001 and unites leaders representing roughly 60 of afghanistan s population are being excluded criticizing secretive nature of us talks with taliban which they suspect might end in a return of taliban to power opposition leaders have asked for a transparent un led peace process in a recent article for foreign policy titled what went wrong with afghanistan published in march 2013 amrullah saleh mentioned that key reason for current problematic situation in afghanistan was west s us and nato s mistaken belief that pakistan would change its policies in afghanistan what went wrong with afghanistan by amrullah saleh published by foreign policy in march 2013 accessed at http www foreignpolicy com articles 2013 03 04 what went wrong page 0 starting with a rhetorical question is nato losing and taliban winning amrullah saleh discusses uncertainty among afghans about 2014 when nato ends its combat mission in afghanistan he then mentions afghans perception that us is funding both sides of conflict because pakistan remains key country supporting insurgency amrullah saleh also discusses why nato and us remain unwilling to confront pakistan because of their own security concerns he advocates for a surge in capacity of afghan national security forces amrullah saleh highlights importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of afghanistan are held communication lines are kept open and major population centers are defended he specifically mentions maintaining military pressure on taliban is key for survival of pluralistic state in afghanistan otherwise democratic space will shrink and taliban s bargaining power in future talks will increase further he then concludes presciently some analysts have tried to paint this war as a conflict between afghans it isn t in reality it is a war between a pakistan supported militant group and rest of world there are only two possible solutions a western backed afghan government decisively defeats taliban or taliban agree to demilitarize and join political process united states however should understand one thing
