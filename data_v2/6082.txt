thumb logo of international mathematical olympiad international mathematical olympiad imo is a mathematical olympiad for pre college students and is oldest of international science olympiads first imo was held in romania in 1959 it has since been held annually except in 1980 more than 100 countries representing over 90 of world s population send teams of up to six students plus one team leader one deputy leader and observers content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered at school and often not at university level either such as projective and complex geometry functional equations combinatorics and well grounded number theory of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required calculus though allowed in solutions is never required as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand problems even if solutions require a great deal more knowledge supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant deceptively simple looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity selection process differs by country but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test awards are given to approximately top scoring 50 of individual contestants teams are not officially recognized all scores are given only to individual contestants but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores contestants must be under age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution subject to these conditions an individual may participate any number of times in imo international mathematical olympiad is one of most prestigious mathematical competitions in world in january 2011 google sponsored eur1 million to international mathematical olympiad organization google europe blog giving young mathematicians chance to shine blogspot com 2011 01 21 retrieved on 2013 10 29 history first imo was held in romania in 1959 since then it has been held every year except in 1980 that year it was cancelled due to internal strife in mongolia turner d a historical sketch of olympiads u s a and international college mathematics journal vol 16 no 5 nov 1985 pp 330 335 it was initially founded for eastern european member countries of warsaw pact under ussr bloc of influence but later other countries participated as well because of this eastern origin imos were first hosted only in eastern european countries and gradually spread to other nations sources differ about cities hosting some of early imos this may be partly because leaders are generally housed well away from students and partly because after competition students did not always stay based in one city for rest of imo exact dates cited may also differ because of leaders arriving before students and at more recent imos imo advisory board arriving before leaders several students such as zhuo qun song teodor von burg lisa sauermann and christian reiher have performed exceptionally well in imo winning multiple gold medals others such as grigory margulis jean christophe laurent stanislav smirnov terence tao sarkar grigori perelman ngo bao chau and maryam mirzakhani have gone on to become notable mathematicians several former participants have won awards such as fields medal scoring and format examination consists of six problems each problem is worth seven points so maximum total score is 42 points no calculators are allowed examination is held over two consecutive days each day contestants have four and a half hours to solve three problems problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics broadly classifiable as geometry number theory algebra and combinatorics they require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis and solutions are often short and elementary however they are usually disguised so as to make solutions difficult prominently featured are algebraic inequalities complex numbers and construction oriented geometrical problems though in recent years latter has not been as popular as before each participating country other than host country may submit suggested problems to a problem selection committee provided by host country which reduces submitted problems to a shortlist team leaders arrive at imo a few days in advance of contestants and form imo jury which is responsible for all formal decisions relating to contest starting with selecting six problems from shortlist jury aims to order problems so that order in increasing difficulty is q1 q4 q2 q5 q3 and q6 as leaders know problems in advance of contestants they are kept strictly separated and observed each country s marks are agreed between that country s leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by host country leader of team whose country submitted problem in case of marks of host country subject to decisions of chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved selection process thumb 200px a stage in process of solving a from aime part of united states selection process selection process for imo varies greatly by country in some countries especially those in east asia selection process involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to imo itself chinese contestants go through a camp chen wang personal interview february 19 2008 in others such as united states possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty in united states tests include american mathematics competitions american invitational mathematics examination and united states of america mathematical olympiad each of which is a competition in its own right for high scorers in final competition for team selection there also is a summer camp like that of china in countries of former soviet union and other eastern european countries a team has in past been chosen several years beforehand and they are given special training specifically for event however such methods have been discontinued in some countries in ukraine for instance selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to imo by difficulty and schedule while identifying winners only results of current selection olympiads are considered awards participants are ranked based on their individual scores medals are awarded to highest ranked participants slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal cutoffs minimum scores required to receive a gold silver or bronze medal respectively are then chosen so that numbers of gold silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in ratios 1 2 3 participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention special prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem this last happened in 1995 nikolay nikolov bulgaria and 2005 iurie boreico but was more frequent up to early 1980s special prize in 2005 was awarded to iurie boreico a student from moldova who came up with a brilliant solution to question 3 which was an inequality involving three variables rule that at most half contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause total number of medals to deviate too much from half number of contestants this last happened in 2010 when choice was to give either 226 43 71 or 266 51 45 of 517 contestants excluding 6 from north korea see below a medal 2012 when choice was to give either 226 41 24 or 277 50 55 of 548 contestants a medal and 2013 when choice was to give either 249 47 16 or 278 52 65 of 528 contestants a medal in these cases slightly more than half contestants were awarded a medal thumb 200px some of gold medal contestants during imo 2015 closing ceremony chiang mai thailand penalties
