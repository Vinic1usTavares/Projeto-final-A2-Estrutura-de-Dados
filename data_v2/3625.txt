going to be amazing jenny s death is shown during journey s end when doctor recalls those who have died while helping him as he did not know she revived characterisation character creation while it is well established within doctor who that doctor once had a family his first incarnation having travelled with his granddaughter susan this fact has been seldom referenced in show as executive producer russell t davies stated when discussing creation of jenny as doctor s newest family member in current series once or twice we ve had fleeting little mentions he said to rose in tardis in fear her that he d been a father once fear her russell t davies david tennant billie piper matthew graham euros lyn doctor who bbc 24 june 2006 no 11 season 2 rose i ve got cousins kids can t have it all their own way that s part of being a family doctor what about trying to understand them rose easy for you to say you don t have kids doctor i was a dad once and now obviously this story it s not a natural biological daughter you could argue but this really brings him face to face with fatherhood regarding creation of character jenny series producer phil collinson explained it came out of a desire to keep pushing david and keep taking him in new directions and keep challenging him really to suddenly find himself with a member of family is kind of one of biggest challenges you could give him so i m chuffed we did it tennant has agreed that giving character a daughter was an interesting emotional dramatic place for character to go while episode s writer stephen greenhorn has spoken of manner in which creating jenny allowed show to broach aspects of doctor s past life that we don t often get to discuss about his previous family that he had and lost in time war steven moffat suggested that character lives in episode s conclusion casting thumb georgia moffett at a science fiction convention before being cast as jenny georgia moffett had previously auditioned for a smaller role in doctor who episode unicorn and wasp phil collinson revealed that as soon as we saw her we realised there was a much bigger and better part later on in series so georgia kindly waited until time was right coverage of her casting focused on fact that moffett is daughter of peter davison who played doctor s fifth incarnation as radio times stated a doctor s daughter is playing doctor s daughter moffett has described how after davison filmed 2007 children in need segment time crash in which fifth doctor briefly returned to meet tenth doctor her father called her to inform her right now it s your go discussing moffett s casting as jenny both actors relayed their amusement at character s first line being hello dad with davison describing his own daughter playing doctor s daughter as kind of surreal he has denied that there was any nepotism involved in casting process explaining she got it off her own bat i would love to get another part in doctor who i m certainly not going to get her one first moffett has praised her character and episode in which she appeared asserting that if i d had to write my ideal part in an episode of doctor who it would have been that script she has also expressed a desire to return to role calling on show s producers to bring jenny back please characteristics over course of episode doctor s daughter character of jenny undergoes marked change moffett explained she starts off not being particularly likeable but by end she s learned a lot from her experiences and from doctor she becomes something that he s very proud of initially jenny is portrayed as an action hero character described by series producer phil collinson as a warrior she s born to fight she s born to use weapons she s born to karate chop and kick her feet and by episode writer stephen greenhorn as a kind of manufactured soldier with a kinda pre programming towards aggression and war shortly after her creation within episode character explains that she was born knowing just how to fight and how to die learning from doctor jenny begins to adapt her ideology moffett explained that her character begins to become much more like doctor and much more like a time lord describing episode as a journey over course of which jenny learns to use her fighting skills in right way developing morals as she grows on a personal level executive producer russell t davies has discussed doctor s initial reluctance to accept jenny as his daughter explaining it s awful for him in that this daughter is everything he wouldn t be she s a soldier she s got military protocols downloaded into her brain she can fight and she wants to fight that s important thing that she thinks killing is fine greenhorn asserts that as character develops you can see in her and you can see that actually reason he would warm to that is because he begins to recognise there are elements in her that are strong in him as well concluding character s development over course of episode moffett surmised by end of it they ve both realised that they want to be a little bit more like other one and admire that in each other reception martin anderson of den of geek has suggested that creation of a daughter character for doctor was a move designed to lay to rest decades long speculation that doctor himself might one day regenerate into a female form he describes act of reviving character at end of episode as a pretty cheap trick but asserts that this is outshone by big surprise at jenny s career choice at conclusion of doctor s daughter wow newsround mzimba opines that moffett s appearance as jenny is superb while doctor who producer phil collinson has hailed introduction of jenny as doctor s daughter one of best pre title sequences we ve ever had despite reviewing episode doctor s daughter poorly as a whole digital spy ben rawson jones argues that jenny deserved a stronger narrative context for her debut and that georgia moffett portrayed character with right spirit arrogance and compassion that befits a of time lord ian berriman writing for sfx is somewhat more critical of character stating we re not given much time to get to know jenny and you always suspect she s a redshirt so her death is not as affecting as it could have been stage mark wright is similarly critical of character and her conception writing i ll admit to feeling cheated that she isn t real thing and it s a bit of techno gubbins malarkey to give doctor something to emote against i don t quite buy bond that springs up between doctor and georgia moffett s jenny a name she is given rather quickly she is a genetically engineered soldier with military tactics and skills programmed in and knows what to do with a gun much to doctor s horror but why does he care she isn t really his daughter georges jeanty artist of comic series buffy vampire slayer season eight felt that character of jenny was a homage to joss whedon s influential character buffy summers sarah michelle gellar from buffy vampire slayer jeanty returned favour by modelling buffy s outfit in season eight 32 after jenny s outfit in doctor s daughter possible return anderson berriman wright and times andrew billen all speculate that character is likely to return to series in future with anderson assessing that episode s ending left vast scope for return of character in her own spin off moffett herself has obvious credentials due to her real life dad and she s certainly young attractive and athletic enough to cross quite a few barriers in viewer demographics billen adds if jenny does not spin off into at least her own comic books i shall be surprised big finish in june 2018 big finish productions released an audio drama that brought georgia tennant nee moffett back to role of jenny references
