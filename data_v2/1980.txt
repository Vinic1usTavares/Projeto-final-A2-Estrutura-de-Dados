little butte creek is a tributary of rogue river in u s state of oregon its drainage basin consists of approximately of jackson county and another of klamath county its two forks north fork and south fork both begin high in cascade range near mount mcloughlin and brown mountain they both flow generally west until they meet near lake creek main stem continues west flowing through communities of eagle point and white city before finally emptying into rogue river about southwest of eagle point little butte creek s watershed was originally settled by takelma and possibly shasta tribes of native americans in rogue river wars of 1850s most of native americans were either killed or forced onto indian reservations early settlers named little butte creek and nearby big butte creek after their proximity to mount mcloughlin which was known as snowy butte in late 19th century watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production city of eagle point was incorporated in 1911 and remains only incorporated town within watershed s boundaries large amounts of water are diverted from little butte creek for irrigation water storage and power generation canal systems deliver water to nearby howard prairie lake and klamath river watershed agate lake and rogue valley despite being moderately polluted creek is one of best salmon producing tributaries of rogue river coho and chinook salmon migrate upstream each year however several dams hinder their progress a fish ladder was built in 2005 to help fish swim past a dam constructed in eagle point in 1880s but was destroyed by flooding just three months later it was rebuilt in 2008 restoration of a artificially straightened section of creek in denman wildlife area was completed in 2011 course little butte creek begins in cascade range near mount mcloughlin and brown mountain it flows generally west over approximately to its confluence with rogue river there are two main forks of little butte creek north fork and south fork south fork s headwaters are at above sea level while north fork s headwaters are considerably lower at they meet each other at creating main stem itself little butte creek s mouth is at above sea level giving creek an overall gradient of approximately north fork begins at fish lake near mount mcloughlin it flows west collecting only minor tributaries before merging with south fork south fork s headwaters are just south of brown mountain pacific crest trail passes through this area it flows west receiving beaver dam creek and dead indian creek on left bank beaver dam creek drains

of southern oregon elevations range from at mouth of creek to at summit of mount mcloughlin with an average of forest accounts for about 65 percent of total area of watershed while 32 percent is farmland remaining three percent is within eagle point city limits forty eight percent of watershed is federally owned 50 percent is privately owned and eagle point accounts for remaining two percent over 10 000 people live within watershed s boundaries region experiences a mediterranean climate temperatures average from in summer to in winter average precipitation in area ranges from in lower regions to over in upper reaches july through october are driest months while december through april are wettest thirty four percent of surface runoff in watershed is collected from rain 31 percent from rain on snow and 35 percent from snowmelt two main geologic regions in little butte creek watershed are high cascades and western cascades western cascades make up western two thirds of watershed generally below in elevation steep rugged canyons are common in this region lower stretches of watershed contain soils such as decomposed lavas clay and gravel high cascades compose eastern third of watershed including volcanoes such as brown mountain and mount mcloughlin and lava plateaus in some places streams descend over nearby watersheds include two rogue river tributaries big butte creek to north and bear creek to south and small klamath river tributaries to east as of 2003 there were 581 water rights recorded in watershed with 394 of them related to irrigation four hundred sixty six water diversions were also recorded in summer many streams are over appropriated leading to frequent water shortages along lower portion of creek flora and fauna thumb northern pygmy owl alt a small bird perched on a limb of a tree it has predominantly brown feathers with white spots on its head and back while its chest is mostly white its eyes are round and yellow and its beak is short and curved downward flora in little butte creek watershed is predominately temperate coniferous forest which makes up approximately 65 percent of total area lower regions are covered with chaparral and upper regions by fir forests chaparral region is inhabited by oaks such as garry oak and california black oak with an understory of buckbrush and manzanita coast douglas fir sugar pine ponderosa pine california incense cedar and white fir are most common trees found in mixed coniferous forest shasta red fir white fir and noble fir grow in higher elevations of watershed mountain hemlock lodgepole pine sitka mountain ash and also grow in this region chinquapin can be found around fish lake most common species of plants above near tree line on mount mcloughlin and brown mountain include

endangered townsend s big eared bat is known to live in watershed little butte creek is known to be one of best salmon producing tributaries of rogue river and is also one of only a few streams in upper rogue watershed to support salmon populations most common anadromous fish inhabiting creek include chinook and coho salmon and sea run cutthroat trout southern oregon northern california coast coho salmon evolutionary significant unit is listed as threatened 2011 coho salmon are known to spawn in of streams in little butte creek watershed an estimated 35 131 coho salmon lived in creek in 2002 resident fish include coastal cutthroat trout sculpins rainbow trout and brook trout history little butte creek area was originally settled by takelma and possibly shasta tribe of native americans first non indigenous settlers arrived in eagle point region in 1852 little butte creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to mount mcloughlin also known as snowy butte as was nearby big butte creek due to conflicts with rogue river indians major j a lupton gathered 35 men from jacksonville on october 8 1855 and attacked native americans near mouth of little butte creek killing about 30 of them lupton was also killed and eleven of his men were injured on december 24 of same year captain miles alcorn discovered and attacked a native american camp on north fork killing eight on christmas following day another band of native americans were attacked near little butte creek s mouth some fled while rest were either captured or killed by late 1850s land was primarily used for agriculture and lumber in upper regions a sawmill was constructed on north fork in 1870s in 1901 sunnyside hotel was built by alfred howlett on banks of creek in eagle point eagle point was later incorporated in 1911 and remains only incorporated town in watershed in 1917 manganese ore was discovered near confluence of south fork little butte creek and its tributary lost creek mined nodules consisted of approximately 55 percent manganese and weighed up to cinnabar was also discovered in area in 1922 antelope creek covered bridge was constructed on antelope creek it was moved to little butte creek in eagle point in 1987 diversions and dams thumb 300px a map of dams and canals associated with little butte creek alt cascade canal connects fourmile and fish lakes in northeast portion of watershed four dams divert water from south fork of little butte creek and its tributaries through deadwood tunnel to howard prairie lake to south two other dams from dead indian and conde creeks also divert water to howard prairie lake water from howard prairie lake flows through a canal to keene creek reservoir then through cascade tunnel and greensprings power plant it travels through greensprings tunnel and spreads out into a large system of canals in rogue valley to north water from north and south forks are diverted to agate lake and also to rogue valley in total 18 canals and 21 dams are related to little butte creek watershed some of water in little butte creek watershed is diverted to irrigate rogue valley and to supplement bear creek both roughly to southwest in late 19th century a large number of orchards were planted near ashland they were initially irrigated by bear creek however there was not enough water to satisfy orchards needs in 1898 fish lake water company was established to solve problem company proposed enlargement of fourmile and fish lakes by impounding fourmile creek and north fork little butte creek respectively and connecting them via cascade canal construction of temporary fish lake dam began in 1902 around this time construction of joint system canal to west also began construction of fourmile lake dam started in 1906 along with cascade canal a network of other small canals such as hopkins canal and medford canal were also built in rogue valley around this time fish lake dam was completed in 1908 creating reservoir cascade canal was completed in 1915 delivering about of water from fourmile lake in klamath river watershed southwest to fish lake in rogue river watershed temporary fish lake dam was also replaced by a permanent earthfill dam it was later modified in 1922 and 1955 in 1996 an auxiliary spillway was added dam stands high and has a length of in 1956 united states bureau of reclamation awarded a contract to portland oregon based lord brothers to build deadwood tunnel tunnel was finished in 1957 howard prairie lake was completed in 1958 and is about east of ashland excess water is diverted from south fork beaver dam creek and two of its tributaries south into deadwood tunnel to supplement lake and surrounding regions dead indian creek is also diverted into howard prairie lake about annually or about was diverted into klamath river watershed between 1962 and 1999 howard prairie delivery canal was completed in 1959 along with keene creek reservoir cascade tunnel and greensprings tunnel water from howard prairie lake is diverted into canal west to keene creek reservoir about east of ashland nearby hyatt reservoir also provides water it is then piped through mile long cascade tunnel to greensprings power plant which generates about 18 megawatts of power afterward water is conveyed from power plant through greensprings tunnel into emigrant creek a tributary of bear creek an average of approximately of water flows through tunnel water eventually ends up in emigrant lake about southeast of ashland where it either continues along bear creek or is diverted for irrigation butte creek mill thumb butte creek mill in eagle point oregon butte creek mill originally named snowy butte mill was built in 1872 on banks of little butte creek about from its mouth a diversion dam was built in 1880s to provide water for turbine that powers mill dam was a damaging fish barrier in watershed in 2005 rogue basin fish access team built a 250 000 concrete fish ladder to allow fish to swim past dam a small weir made of boulders was built at base of ladder creating a jump between creek and ladder however boulders were washed away in a severe storm just three months later making distance between them over weir was rebuilt in 2008 for about 122 500 with concrete instead of boulders mill is now included on national register of historic places and is only gristmill in oregon to still grind flour it is also oldest water powered gristmill west of mississippi river on christmas morning december 25 2015 store had a fire and was considered a total loss there are plans to rebuild to assist in helping with rebuild visit their website com restoration intense flooding occurred throughout rogue valley in 1955 and little butte creek s meanders in denman wildlife area between eagle point and rogue river were blamed for severe erosion section of creek was subsequently bulldozed and straightened in late 1950s and early 1960s straightness forced water downward instead of outward like a typical creek scouring stream bed down to bedrock and creating an unsuitable habitat for wild salmon in 2007 a plan to divert creek back into its old meanders was proposed 700 000 project involved building engineered riffles and log jams and adding boulders extending creek by approximately it was completed in september 2011 pollution thumb a wild blackberry vine alt several large thorny purple vines with green leaves ground below is covered in gravel grass and dead leaves and vegetation oregon department of environmental quality deq has monitored little butte creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality temperature oxygen saturation ph nutrients bacteria chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals turbidity and alkalinity streams that exceed standard level are then placed on deq 303d list in accordance with clean water act about 40 percent of streams in little butte creek watershed were listed on 2002 deq 303d list entire main stem exceeded standard level for temperature oxygen saturation fecal coliforms bacteria and turbidity lower of north fork were listed for high temperature and elevated levels of e coli while upper region was affected by chlorophyll a and ph levels south fork was listed for turbidity and temperature overall high temperature is most common problem in little butte creek watershed this is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones approximately 53 percent of riparian zones in watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation while 43 percent are classified as healthy another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish high concentration of bacteria is also an issue in 2003 little butte creek watershed council rated health of little butte creek watershed on a scale of 1 slightly degraded to 5 severely degraded overall watershed received 2 95 or moderately degraded on oregon water quality index owqi used by deq water quality scores can vary from 10 worst to 100 ideal average for little butte creek at rm 1 4 rk 2 3 between 1998 and 2007 was 72 poor in summer and 82 fair in fall winter and spring recreation little butte creek watershed contains several points of interest popular activities in and around fish lake include fishing swimming and boating two campgrounds are on banks of lake doe point and fish lake resort several trails in area lead to much larger pacific crest trail two are on oregon route 140 eagle point golf course is in watershed built in 1995 by world renowned golf course architect robert trent jones jr another course stone ridge golf course is near agate lake butte creek mill and antelope and lost creek covered bridges are also popular attractions several historic structures can be found in eagle point including eagle point museum built in 1925 as long mountain school and
