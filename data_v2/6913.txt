covered in full on any of bbc s national radio networks its 4 15pm start coincided with conclusion of fa cup semi finals and it had been decided that rowing would be broadcast in full on bbc world service and bbc radio oxford only commentator john snagge who had described every race since 1931 was disappointed i do not want to be unreasonable but i am a little surprised that for an event like boat race with its tradition and history bbc cannot find 20 minutes on one of its four networks to carry it in full oxford s preparations for race including coming second only to leander club in head of river race both crews had to cope with strong winds in their outings with large pieces of driftwood providing additional hazards to boats cambridge s number four chris baillieu recovered from a back injury while his cox mike williams spent time before race recuperating from an upset stomach their number seven steven tourek was also forced from boat with illness missing several days training cambridge were coxed by lou barry oxford s boat built by swiss manufacturer was considered suitable for placid continental lakes while cambridge s boat while lighter than their previous year s craft had a deeper hull and was better equipped for inclement conditions in an interview with barry norman writing for observer oxford s stroke sawyier had prophetically suggested if we do lose i hope we re not disgraced it would be a kind of tawdry end of year to be in a crew that was beaten out of sight crews cambridge crew weighed over per rower more than their opponents oxford saw four former blues return magarey hall payne and cox yalouris while cambridge welcomed back chris baillieu for his fourth race and michael hart burnell p 82 oxford s crew contained three non british competitors australian magarey and americans yalouris and sawyier who had rowed for harvard university and united states olympic team in 1972 summer olympics burnell p 29 while cambridge featured just one foreign

president race right thumb championship course along which boat race is contested following good performances in practice in buildup oxford were considered pre race favourites they won toss and elected to start on surrey station handing middlesex side of river to cambridge in warm up to race light blues opted for calm waters in wandsworth reach while oxford rowed part of course in rough conditions up to mile post and back arriving back at stake boat dark blues spent considerable time attempting to alleviate their boat of large amounts of water using their tracksuits as makeshift sponges oxford made a fast start rating over 40 strokes per minute but in rough conditions it resulted in more water being drawn into their boat cambridge slowly but surely took control with a lead of just under three lengths within three minutes of start a ten second lead at mile post was extended to sixteen seconds by hammersmith bridge with oxford still taking on more water in their pursuit of light blues oxford were 26 seconds behind at chiswick steps and despite a last push from oxford to reduce deficit cambridge passed finishing post in 19 minutes 21 seconds 13 lengths and 48 seconds ahead of their opponents it was cambridge s sixth consecutive victory and their 67th overall to oxford s 51 wins in reserve race cambridge s goldie beat oxford s isis by five lengths their seventh consecutive victory in 28th running of women s boat race cambridge triumphed their eleventh consecutive victory reaction oxford boat club president andy hall said water was round our ankles we made a mistake in doing that warm up over part of course there was so much water on board that i thought god we re going to sink it was really hopeless after that in losing race hall became first oxonian to lose four boat races in 20th century jim railton writing in times summarised race cambridge beat tideway and tideway beat oxford according to dickie burnell to say that race was soon over would be a
