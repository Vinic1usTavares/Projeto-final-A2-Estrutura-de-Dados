to three murder charges case was prosecuted by tim raggatt qc and smith was defended by rachel brand qc on opening day of trial raggatt told court there was powerful and compelling scientific evidence linking smith to killings smith s defence was that traces of blood found on his clothes were there because police had tampered with evidence while trousers belonging to rosemary corcoran found at his

were briefly halted while he was treated for symptoms of a panic attack when smith returned to witness stand he said he wished to speak to his barrister presiding judge rafferty told him that he must

during a raid on his flat after his arrest and that he wanted money to buy mars bars in prison passing sentence rafferty said you robbed three innocent ladies of their lives i suspect that their families will suffer more as they simply don t understand why you did brutality of these ladies deaths designed by you to evade discovery showing coldness with which you dispatched them is appalling you should clearly have faced up like a man at overwhelming nature of crown s case against you but you chose to put victims families through misery which you compounded by this trial motive for smith s actions remained unclear after trial but police believed a lack of permanent sexual relations had been a contributing factor further inquiries as a result of their inquiries into smith s background police launched an investigation into death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him patricia lynott a 47 year old divorced mother of two had moved to birmingham from athlone during mid 1990s on 23 october 2000 while she was employed at rainbow pub as a cleaner and to look after licensee s children she was found dead in bedroom of her flat on street bordesley green police believed at first that she had died of natural causes a post mortem failed to establish a cause of death and her body was returned to ireland for burial because lynott had worked alongside smith at rainbow west midlands police wished to re examine cause of her death in early 2001 investigators asked irish authorities for a new post mortem and on 8 march lynott s body was exhumed by gardai from a cemetery in athlone and taken to city morgue in dublin for further examination by ireland s state pathologist dr john harbison however results of this autopsy also proved inconclusive an inquest into lynott s death was held at birmingham coroner s court in january 2003 hearing was told that marks found on her back and an arm may have been bruising but pathologist who conducted original post mortem could not be sure how she had died because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days it was also said that despite her connection with smith police and four pathologists had failed to establish that lynott had been murdered coroner s jury returned an open verdict police also conducted a routine re examination of other unsolved murder cases dating back 20 years in areas where smith had lived officers from west midlands police held a conference in october 2001 with representatives from several other forces including west mercia and gloucestershire to share information about unsolved murder cases in their areas detectives interviewed smith three times but he refused to answer their questions and no further charges were brought references category 1965 births category
