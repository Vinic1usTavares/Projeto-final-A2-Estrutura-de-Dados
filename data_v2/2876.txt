mary rose is a carrack type warship of english tudor navy of king henry viii she served for 33 years in several wars against france scotland and brittany then was substantially rebuilt in 1536 she saw her last action on 1545 she led attack on galleys of a french invasion fleet but she sank in solent straits north of isle of wight wreck of mary rose was discovered in 1971 and was raised on 11 october 1982 by mary rose trust in one of most complex and expensive maritime salvage projects in history surviving section of ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of great value as a tudor era time capsule excavation and raising of mary rose was a milestone in field of maritime archaeology comparable in complexity and cost to raising of 17th century swedish warship vasa in 1961 finds include weapons sailing equipment naval supplies and a wide array of objects used by crew many of artefacts are unique to mary rose and have provided insights into topics ranging from naval warfare to history of musical instruments remains of hull have been on display at portsmouth historic dockyard since mid 1980s while undergoing restoration an extensive collection of well preserved artefacts is on display at mary rose museum built to display remains of ship and its artefacts mary rose was one of largest ships in english navy through more than three decades of intermittent war and she was one of earliest examples of a purpose built sailing warship she was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through recently invented gun ports she was substantially rebuilt in 1536 and was also one of earliest ships that could fire a broadside although line of battle tactics had not yet been developed several theories have sought to explain demise of mary rose based on historical records knowledge of 16th century shipbuilding and modern experiments precise cause of her sinking is still unclear because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence

holdings of english kings war of roses civil war between houses of york and lancaster had ended with henry vii s establishment of house of tudor new ruling dynasty of england ambitious naval policies of henry v were not continued by his successors and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for crown marriage alliance between anne of brittany and charles viii of france in 1491 and his successor louis xii in 1499 left england with a weakened strategic position on its southern flank despite this henry vii managed to maintain a comparatively long period of peace and a small but powerful core of a navy rodger 1997 pp 153 56 at onset of early modern period great european powers were france holy roman empire and spain all three became involved in war of league of cambrai in 1508 conflict was initially aimed at republic of venice but eventually turned against france through spanish possessions in low countries england had close economic ties with spanish habsburgs and it was young henry viii s ambition to repeat glorious martial endeavours of his predecessors in 1509 six weeks into his reign henry married spanish princess catherine of aragon and joined league intent on certifying his historical claim as king of both england and france by 1511 henry was part of an anti french alliance that included ferdinand ii of aragon pope julius ii and holy roman emperor

rose began in 1510 in portsmouth and she was launched in july 1511 she was then towed to london and fitted with rigging and decking and supplied with armaments other than structural details needed to sail stock and arm mary rose she was also equipped with flags banners and streamers extremely elongated flags that were flown from top of masts that were either painted or gilded marsden 2003 pp 2 5 see maria hayward flags fabric in knighton and loades 2000 pp 31 33 for a more detailed account of making of flags constructing a warship of size of mary rose was a major undertaking requiring vast quantities of high quality material in case of building a state of art warship these materials were primarily oak total amount of timber needed for construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of ship still exists marsden 2003 p 51 one estimate for number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks representing about 16 hectares 40 acres of woodland huge trees that had been common in europe and british isles in previous centuries were by 16th century quite rare which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern england largest timbers used in construction were of roughly same size as those used in roofs of largest cathedrals in high middle ages an unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300 kg 660 lb and one of main deck beams would have weighed close to three quarters of a tonne damian woodworking aspects of mary rose in marsden 2009 pp 66 68 71 naming common explanation for ship s name was that it was inspired by henry viii s

peter marsden no direct evidence of naming ship after king s sister exists it was far more common at time to give ships pious christian names a long standing tradition in western europe or to associate them with their royal patrons names like grace dieu thank god and holy spirit had been common since 15th century and other tudor navy ships had names like regent and three ostrich feathers referring to crest of prince of wales virgin mary is a more likely candidate for a namesake and she was also associated with rosa mystica mystic rose name of sister ship of mary rose peter pomegranate

accurate picture is overall an accurate illustration of ship mary rose was substantially rebuilt in 1536 1536 rebuilding turned a ship of 500 tons into one of 700 tons and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to old carrack style structure by consequence modern research is based mostly on interpretations of concrete physical evidence of this version of mary rose construction of original design from 1509 is less known mary rose was built according to carrack style with high castles in bow and stern with a low waist of open decking in middle shape of hull has a so called tumblehome form and reflected use of ship as a platform for heavy guns above waterline hull gradually narrows to compensate for weight of guns and to make boarding more difficult marsden 2003 p 90 since only part of hull has survived it is not possible to determine many of basic dimensions with any great accuracy moulded breadth widest point of ship roughly above waterline was about 12 metres 39 ft and keel about 32 metres 105 ft although ship s overall length is uncertain richard barker brad loewen and christopher dobbs hull design of mary rose in marsden 2009 p 36 hull had four levels separated by

would have been watertight when closed this was also highest deck that was caulked and waterproof along sides of main deck there were cabins under forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to carpenter barber surgeon pilot and possibly also master gunner and some of officers top deck in hull structure was upper deck or weather deck which was exposed to elements in waist it was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns over open waist upper deck was entirely covered with a boarding net a coarse netting that served as a defence measure against boarding rule 1983 pp 117 133 see marsden 2009 for a detailed survey of deck design and construction though very little of upper deck has survived it has been suggested that it housed main living quarters of crew underneath sterncastle a drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible piss dale a general urinal to complement regular toilets that would probably have been located in bow peter marsden upper deck in marsden 2009 p 216 castles of mary rose had additional decks but since virtually nothing of them survives their design has had to be reconstructed from historical records contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles although speculative this layout is supported by illustration in anthony roll and gun inventories peter marsden reconstruction of mary rose her design and use in marsden 2009 pp 371 78 alexzandra hildred fighting ship in marsden 2009 pp 340 41 during early stages of excavation of wreck it was believed that ship had originally been built with clinker or clench planking a technique where hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore structural strength of ship cutting gunports into a clinker built hull would have meant weakening ship s structural integrity and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge to edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports see for example rule 1983 later examination indicates that clinker planking is not present throughout ship only outer structure of sterncastle is built with overlapping planking though not with a true clinker technique marsden 2003 pp 94 96 sails and rigging alt five well preserved rigging blocks on a white background thumb right a small selection of many rigging blocks raised from mary rose although only lower fittings of rigging survive a 1514 inventory and only known contemporary depiction of ship from anthony roll have

respectively mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail and possibly also a square sail and bowsprit flew a small square peter marsden

with twin curved blades sharpened on inside that were intended to cut an enemy ship s rigging during boarding actions richard propulsion rigging in marsden 2009 p 261 sailing capabilities of mary rose were commented on by her contemporaries and were once even put to test in march 1513 a contest was arranged off downs west of kent in which she raced against nine other ships she won contest and admiral edward howard described her enthusiastically as noblest ship of sayle of any ship at this that i trow believe be in marsden 2003 pp 7 8 several years later while sailing between dover and downs vice admiral william fitzwilliam noted that both henry grace a dieu and mary rose performed very well riding steadily in rough seas and that it would have been a hard chose between two marsden 2003 p 14 modern experts have been more sceptical to her sailing qualities believing that ships at this time were almost incapable of sailing close against wind and describing handling of mary rose as

illustration from a french edition of froissart chronicle depicting battle of sluys in 1340 picture clearly shows how medieval naval tactics focused on close combat fighting and boarding mary rose represented a transitional ship design in naval warfare since ancient times war at sea had been fought much like that on land with melee weapons and bows and arrows but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields though introduction of guns was a significant change it only slowly changed dynamics of ship to ship combat rodger 1997 pp 205 6 as guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges they needed to be placed lower in ship closer to water line gunports cut in hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501 only about a decade before mary rose was built rodger 1997 p 207 this made broadsides it was not until 1590s that word broadside in english was commonly used to refer to gunfire from side of a ship rather than ship s side itself rodger 1996 pp 312 316 coordinated volleys from all guns on one side of a ship possible for first time in history at least in theory naval tactics throughout 16th century and well into 17th century focused on countering oar powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in bow facing forwards which were aimed by turning entire ship against its target combined with inefficient gunpowder and difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms this meant that boarding remained primary tactic for decisive victory throughout 16th century rodger 1996 rodger 1997 pp 206 8 215 bronze and iron guns thumb right upright alt a view of four very large cannons leaning towards inside wall of a building with a high ceiling two culverins and two demi cannons from mary rose on display at mary rose museum as mary rose was built and served during a period of rapid development of heavy artillery her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations heavy armament was a mix of older type wrought iron and cast bronze guns which differed considerably in size range and design large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded from back and equipped with simpler gun carriages made from hollowed out elm logs with only one pair of wheels or without wheels entirely bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four wheel carriages which were essentially same as those used until 19th century breech loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns generally bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large jagged holes but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel alexzandra hildred fighting ship in marsden 2009 pp 297 344 majority of guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person two most common are bases breech loading swivel guns most likely placed in castles and hailshot pieces small muzzle loaders with rectangular bores and fin like protrusions that were used to support guns against railing and allow ship structure to take force of recoil though design is unknown there were two top pieces in a 1546

accompanying her rebuilding in 1536 see below when number of anti personnel guns was reduced and a second tier of carriage mounted long guns fitted there are three inventories that list her guns dating to 1514 1540 and 1546 last record is illustrated anthony roll which was compiled after sinking when it was apparently still believed that mary rose could be raised and restored together with records from armoury at tower of london these show how configuration of guns changed as gun making technology evolved and new classifications were invented in 1514 armament consisted mostly of anti personnel guns like larger breech loading iron murderers and small serpentines demi slings and stone guns only a handful of guns in first inventory were powerful enough to hole enemy ships and most would have been supported by ship s structure rather than resting on carriages inventories of both mary rose and tower had changed radically by 1540 there were now new cast bronze cannons demi cannons culverins and sakers and wrought iron port pieces a name that indicated they fired through ports all of which required carriages had longer range and were capable of doing serious damage to other

300 longbows and several thousand arrows there had to be a considerable proportion of longbow archers examination of skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os affecting their shoulder blades this condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on arm and shoulder muscles particularly of left arm that is used to hold bow to brace against pull on bowstring among men who died on ship it was likely that some had practised using longbow since childhood and served on board as specialist

brandon came close to capturing paris in 1523 there was little gained either against france or scotland throughout war with defeat of french army and capture of francis i by charles v s forces at battle of pavia on 1525 war was effectively over without any major gains or major victories for english side rodger 1997 pp 174 75 maintenance and in ordinary mary rose was kept in reserve from 1522 to 1545 she was once more caulked and repaired in 1527 in a newly dug dock at portsmouth and her longboat was repaired and trimmed little documentation about mary rose between 1528 and 1539 exists a document written by thomas cromwell in 1536 specifies that mary rose and six other ships were made new during his service under king though it is unclear which years he was referring to and what made new actually meant a later document from january 1536 by an anonymous author states that mary rose and other ships were new made and dating of timbers from ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536 this would have coincided with controversial dissolution of monasteries that resulted in a major influx of funds into royal treasury marsden 2003 pp 15 16 nature and extent of this repair is unknown many experts including margaret rule project leader for raising of mary rose have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from clinker planking to carvel planking and that it was only after 1536 that ship took on form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in 20th century marsden has speculated that it could even mean that mary rose was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th century ships with a rounded rather than square stern and without main deck gunports marsden 2003 p 142 for examples of authors that have stated that ship went through

together with emperor charles v and english forces captured boulogne at great cost in september but soon england was left in lurch after charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace rodger 1997 pp 176 82 in may 1545 french had assembled a large fleet in estuary of seine with intent to land troops on english soil estimates of size of fleet varied considerably between 123 and 300 vessels according to french sources and up to 226 sailing ships and galleys according to chronicler edward hall in addition to massive fleet 50 000 troops were assembled at havre de grace modern day le havre an english force of 160 ships and 12 000 troops under viscount lisle was ready at portsmouth by early june before french were ready to set sail and an ineffective pre emptive strike was made in middle of month in early july huge french force under command of admiral claude d annebault set sail for england and entered solent unopposed with 128 ships on english had around 80 ships with

indicated by positioning of many of skeletons recovered from wreck what turned sinking into a major tragedy was anti boarding netting that covered upper decks in waist midsection of ship and sterncastle with exception of men who were stationed in tops in masts most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under netting they would have been in view of surface and their

while going about and that ship was brought down because of open gunports a biography of peter carew brother of george carew written by john hooker sometime after 1575 gives same reason for sinking

marsden 2003 pp 18 20 130 34 178 79 and rule 1983 pp 36 38 and stirland 2000 pp 22 23 modern theories most common explanation for sinking among modern historians is that ship was unstable for a number of reasons when a strong gust of wind hit sails at a critical moment open gunports proved fatal ship flooded and quickly foundered rodger 1997 rule 1983 stirland 2000 coates offered a variant of this hypothesis which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking and which even fought in actions in rough seas off brittany unexpectedly foundered ship had accumulated additional weight over years in service and finally become unseaworthy stirland 2000 pp 22 23 that ship was turning after firing all cannons on one side has been questioned by marsden after examination of guns recovered in both 19th and 20th centuries guns from both sides were found still loaded this has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure gunports before making a potentially risky turn marsden 2003 pp 132 33 most recent surveys of ship indicate that ship was modified late in her career and have lent support to idea that mary rose was altered too much to be properly seaworthy marsden has suggested that weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her draught so much that waterline was less than one metre c 3 feet from gunports on main deck peter marsden loss of mary rose 1545 in marsden 2009 pp 391 92 peter carew s claim of insubordination has been given support by james watt former medical director general of royal navy based on records of an epidemic of dysentery in portsmouth which could have rendered crew incapable of handling ship properly watt 1983 p 17 while historian richard barker has suggested that crew actually knew that ship was an accident waiting to happen at which they balked and refused to follow orders barker 1992 p 439 marsden has noted that carew biography is in some details inconsistent with sequence of events reported by both french and english eyewitnesses it also reports that there were 700 men on board an unusually high number distance in time to event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch marsden 2003 p 130 report of french galleys sinking mary rose as stated by martin du bellay has been described as account of a courtesan by naval historian maurice de brossard du bellay and his two brothers were close to king francis i and du bellay had much to gain from portraying sinking as a french victory english sources even if biased would have nothing to gain from portraying sinking as result of crew incompetence rather than conceding to a victory to much feared gun galleys de brossard 1983 dominic fontana a geographer at university of portsmouth has voiced support for du bellay s version of sinking based on battle as it is depicted in cowdray engraving and modern gis analysis of modern scene of battle by plotting fleets and calculating conjectured final manoeuvres of mary rose fontana reached conclusion that ship had been hit low in hull by galleys and was destabilised after taking in water he has interpreted final heading of ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach shallows at spitbank only a few hundred metres away this theory has been given partial support by alexzandra hildred one of experts who has worked with mary rose though she has suggested that close proximity to spitbank could also indicate that sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground alexzandra hildred fighting ship pp 307 8 in marsden 2009 for a detailed account of dominic fontana s theory on sinking see cowdray engravings and loss of mary rose experiments in 2000 channel 4 television programme what sank mary rose attempted to investigate causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models of ship and

since ship had settled at a 60 degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into clay of seabed this made it virtually impossible to pass cables under hull and required far more lifting power

deterioration after sinking partially buried wreck created a barrier at a right angle against currents of solent two scour pits large underwater ditches formed on either side of wreck while silt and seaweed was deposited inside ship a deep but narrow pit formed on upward tilting port side while a shallower broader pit formed on starboard side which had mostly been buried by force of impact abrasive actions of sand and silt carried by currents and activity of fungi bacteria and wood boring crustaceans and molluscs such as teredo shipworm began to break down structure of ship eventually exposed wooden structure was weakened and gradually collapsed timbers and contents of port side were either deposited in scour pits and remaining ship structure or carried off by currents following collapse of exposed parts of ship site was levelled with seabed and gradually covered by layers of sediment concealing most of remaining structure during 16th century a hard layer of compacted clay and crushed shells formed over ship stabilising site and sealing tudor era deposits further layers of soft silt covered site during 18th and 19th centuries but frequent changes in tidal patterns and currents in solent occasionally exposed some of timbers leading to its accidental rediscovery in 1836 and aided in locating wreck in 1971 jones 2003 pp 12 24 rule 1983 pp 69 71 see marsden 2003 pp 76

rediscovery in 19th century in mid 1836 a group of five fishermen caught their nets on timbers protruding from bottom of solent they contacted a diver to help them remove hindrance and on henry abbinett became first person to see mary rose in almost 300 years later two other professional divers john deane and william edwards were employed using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet deane and edwards began to examine wreck and salvage items from it along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects including several longbows they brought up several bronze and iron guns which were sold to board of ordnance for over ps220 initially this caused a dispute between deane who had also brought in his brother charles into project abbinett and fishermen who had hired them matter was eventually settled by allowing fishermen a share of proceeds from sale of first salvaged guns while deane received exclusive salvage rights at expense of abbinett wreck was soon

which were brought up though many of objects could not be properly conserved at time and subsequently deteriorated many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day john deane ceased working on wreck in 1836 but returned in 1840 with new more destructive methods with help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from ordnance board he blasted his way into parts of wreck fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during modern excavations but there was no evidence that deane managed to penetrate hard layer that had sealed off tudor levels deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and lower part of main mast both of which would have been located inside ship recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that deane did manage to penetrate tudor levels at some point though this has been disputed by excavation project leader margaret rule newspaper reports on deane s diving operations in october 1840 report that ship was clinker built but since sterncastle is only part of ship with this feature an alternative explanation has been suggested deane did not penetrate hard shelly layer that covered most of ship but only managed to get into remains of sterncastle that today no longer exist despite rough handling by deane mary rose escaped wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that

in 1965 as part of a project to locate shipwrecks in solent project was under leadership of historian journalist and amateur diver alexander mckee another group led by lieutenant commander alan bax of royal navy sponsored by committee for nautical archaeology in london also formed a search team initially two teams had differing views on where to find wreck but eventually joined forces in february 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked positions of mary rose and several other wrecks charted position coincided with a trench one of scour pits that had already been located by mckee s team and a definite location was finally established at a position 3 km 1 9 mi south of entrance to portsmouth harbour in water with a depth of 36 feet at low tide wille 2005 p 388 diving on site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by harold edgerton in 1967 68 revealed some type of buried feature in 1970 a loose timber was located and on 1971 first structural details of buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms marsden 2003 pp 30 34 rule 1983 pp 47 56 a major problem for team from start was that wreck sites in uk lacked any legal protection from plunderers and treasure hunters sunken ships once being moving objects were legally treated as chattel and were awarded to those who could first raise them merchant shipping act of 1894 also stipulated that any objects raised from a wreck should be auctioned off to finance salvage operations and there was nothing preventing anyone from stealing wreck and making a profit problem was handled by forming an organisation mary rose committee aiming to find excavate raise and preserve for all time such remains of ship mary rose as may be of historical or archaeological interest marsden 2003 pp 32 33 quote from rule 1983 p 54 to keep intruders at bay committee arranged a lease of seabed where wreck lay from portsmouth authorities thereby discouraging anyone from trespassing on underwater property in hindsight this was only a legalistic charade which had little chance of holding up in a court of law in combination with secrecy as to exact location of wreck it saved project from interference it was not until passing of protection of wrecks act on 1973 that mary rose was declared to be of national historic interest that enjoyed full legal protection from any disturbance by commercial salvage teams despite this years after passing of 1973 act and excavation of ship lingering conflicts with salvage legislation remained a threat to mary rose project as personal finds such as chests clothing and cooking utensils risked being confiscated and auctioned off rule 1983 pp 54 56 survey and excavation following discovery of wreck in 1971 project became known to general public and received increasing media attention this helped bring in more donations and equipment primarily from private sources by 1974 committee had representatives from national maritime museum royal navy bbc and local organisations in 1974 project received royal patronage from prince charles who participated in dives on site this attracted yet more publicity and also more funding and assistance marsden 2003 p 35 initial aims of mary rose committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed committee had become a registered charity in 1974 which made it easier to raise funds and application for excavation and raising of ship had been officially approved by uk government rule 1983 p 67 by 1978 initial excavation work had uncovered a complete and coherent site with an intact ship structure and orientation of hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60 degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards bow as no records of english shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like mary rose survive excavation of ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on construction of ships of era rule 1983 p 108 a full excavation also meant removing protective layers of silt that prevented remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and scouring of currents operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage it was also considered desirable to recover and preserve remains of hull if possible for first time project was faced with practical difficulties of actually raising conserving and preparing hull for public display rule 1983 p 72 to handle this new considerably more complex and expensive task it was decided that a new organisation was needed mary rose trust a limited charitable trust see mary rose trust registered charity no at charity commission with representatives from many organisations would handle

encountered before raising of swedish warship vasa 1959 61 was only comparable precedent but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since hull was completely intact and rested upright on seabed it had been raised with basically same methods as were in use in tudor england cables were slung under hull and attached to two pontoons on either side of ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters only one third of mary rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud if hull were raised in traditional way there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water many suggestions for raising ship were discarded including construction of a cofferdam around wreck site filling ship with small buoyant objects such as ping pong balls or even pumping brine into seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take hull with it after lengthy discussions it was decided in february 1980 that hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames it would then be lifted to surface with floating attached to nylon strops passing under hull and transferred to a cradle it was also decided that ship would be recovered before end of diving season in 1982 if wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring wendell lewis raising mary rose in marsden 2003 pp 51 53 during last year of operation massive scope of full excavation and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in project in may 1981 alexander mckee voiced concerns about method chosen for raising timbers and openly questioned margaret rule s position as excavation leader mckee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role both as initiator of search for mary rose and other ships in solent and as an active member throughout diving operations he had several supporters who all pointed to risk of project s turning into an embarrassing failure if ship were damaged during raising operations to address these concerns it was suggested that hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater this would avoid inherent risks of damaging wooden structure if it were lifted out of water without appropriate support idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame childs 2007 pp 197 98 in spring of 1982 after three intense seasons of archaeological underwater work preparations began for raising ship operation soon ran into problems early on there were difficulties with custom made lifting equipment divers on project belonging to royal engineers had to be pulled because of outbreak of falklands war and method of lifting hull had to be considerably altered as late as june after frame was properly attached to hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs to pull ship off seabed massive crane of barge mor then moved frame and hull transferring them underwater to specially designed cradle which was padded with water filled bags on morning of 1982 final lift of entire package of cradle hull and lifting frame began it was watched by team prince charles and other spectators in boats around site at 9 03 am first timbers of mary rose broke surface a second set of bags under hull was inflated with air to cushion waterlogged wood finally whole package was placed on a barge and taken to shore though eventually successful operation was close to foundering on two occasions first when one of supporting legs of lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of frame with an unforgettable

without having to auction off part of findings to finance its activities where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds everything found in connection with mary rose was recovered and recorded raising of vessel made it possible to establish first historic shipwreck museum in uk to receive government accreditation and funding excavation of mary rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land marsden 2003 pp 143 46 throughout 1970s mary rose was meticulously surveyed excavated and recorded with latest methods within field of maritime archaeology working in an underwater environment meant that principles of land based archaeology did not always apply mechanical excavators airlifts and suction dredges were used in process of locating wreck but as soon as it began to be uncovered in earnest more delicate techniques were employed rule 1983 p 61 many objects from mary rose had been well preserved in form and shape but many were quite delicate requiring careful handling artefacts of all sizes were supported with soft packing material such as old plastic ice cream containers and some of arrows that were soft like cream cheese had to be brought up in special styrofoam containers rule 1983 p 89 airlifts that sucked up clay sand and dirt off site or to surface were still used but with much greater precision since they could potentially disrupt site many layers of sediment that had accumulated on site could be used to date artefacts in which they were found and had to be recorded properly various types of accretions and remnants of chemicals with artefacts were essential clues to objects that had long since broken down and disappeared and needed to be treated with considerable care marsden 2003 pp 44 47 excavation and raising of ship in 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased even though modern scaffolding and part of bow were left on seabed pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and high costs of conserving storing and displaying finds and ship meant that there were no funds available for diving in 2002 uk ministry of defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers because of great size of new vessels outlet from portsmouth needed to be surveyed to make sure that they could sail no matter tide planned route for underwater channel ran close to mary rose wrecksite which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate site once more even though planned carriers were

two fiddles a bow a still shawm or three three hole pipes and a tabor drum with a drumstick were found throughout wreck these would have been used for personal enjoyment of crew and to provide a rhythm to work on rigging and turning capstans on upper decks tabor drum is earliest known example of its kind and drumstick of a previously unknown design tabor pipes are considerably longer than any known examples from period their discovery proved that contemporary illustrations previously viewed with some suspicion were in fact accurate depictions of instruments before discovery of mary rose shawm an early predecessor to oboe instrument historians had been puzzled by reference to still shawms or soft shawms that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms jermy montagu music on board mary rose in gardiner 2005 pp 226 30 still shawm disappeared from musical scene some time in 16th century and instrument found on mary rose is only surviving example a reproduction has been made and played combined with a pipe and tabor it provides a very effective bass part that would have produced rich and full sound which would have provided excellent music for dancing on board ship charles foster wind instruments in gardiner 2005 pp 240 41 only a few other fiddle type instruments from 16th century exist but none of them of type found on mary rose reproductions of both fiddles have been made though less is known of their design than shawm since neck and strings were missing mary anne bowed string instruments in gardiner 2005 pp 242 49 navigation tools in remains of a small cabin in bow of ship and in a few other locations around wreck was found earliest dated set of navigation instruments in europe found so far compasses divider calipers a stick used for charting protractors sounding leads tide calculators and a logreel an instrument for calculating speed several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early definite dating but also because they pre date written records of their use protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps but sea charts are not known to have been used by english navigators during first half of 16th century compasses were not depicted on english ships until 1560s and first mention of a logreel is from 1574 robert hicks navigation and ship

contents was an essential part of project from start though many artefacts especially those that were buried in silt had been preserved long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from start to prevent deterioration of artefacts marsden 2003 p 145 after recovery finds were placed in so called passive storage which would prevent any immediate deterioration before active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open air environment passive storage depended on type of material that object was made of and could vary considerably smaller objects from most common material wood were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques including low temperature storage chemicals and in case of large objects common pond snails that consumed wood degrading organisms but not wood itself jones 2003 pp 35 43 other organic materials such as leather skin and textiles were treated similarly by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation as was glass ceramic and stone iron copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with chlorides that had penetrated surface alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in atmosphere and generally require no special treatment silver and gold were only materials that required no special passive storage jones 2003 pp 47 49 right thumb alt a diagonal section of a wooden ship seen

to severe warping and cracking as water evaporates from cellular structure of wood substance polyethylene glycol peg had been used before on archaeological wood and was during 1980s being used to conserve vasa after almost ten years of small scale trials on timbers an active three phase conservation programme of hull of mary rose began in 1994 during first phase which lasted from 1994 to 2003 wood was sprayed with low molecular weight peg to replace water in cellular structure of wood from 2003 to 2010 a higher molecular weight peg was used to strengthen mechanical properties of outer surface layers third phase consisted of a controlled air drying ending in 2016 jones 2003 pp 67 69 bbc news mary rose warship full view revealed after museum revamp researchers are planning on using

eyre architects after decision to raise mary rose discussions ensued as to where she would eventually go on permanent display east end of portsea island at eastney emerged as an early alternative but was rejected because of parking problems and distance from dockyard where she was originally built placing ship next to famous flagship of horatio nelson hms victory at portsmouth historic dockyard was proposed in july 1981 a group called maritime preservation society even suggested southsea castle where henry viii had witnessed sinking as a final resting place and there was widespread scepticism to dockyard location at one point a county councillor even threatened to withdraw promised funds if dockyard site became more than an interim solution as costs for project mounted there was a debate in council chamber and in local paper news as to whether money could be spent more appropriately although author david childs writes that in early 1980s debate was as a fiery one project was never seriously threatened because of great symbolic importance of mary rose to naval history of both portsmouth and england childs 2007 p 199 since mid 1980s hull of mary rose has been kept in a covered dry dock while undergoing conservation although hull has been open to public for viewing need for keeping ship saturated first with water and later a polyethylene glycol peg solution meant
