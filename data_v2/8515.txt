kepler 8 is a star located in constellation lyra in field of view of kepler mission a nasa led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets star which is slightly hotter larger and more massive than sun has one gas giant in its orbit kepler 8b this gas giant is larger than jupiter but is less massive and thus more diffuse planet s discovery was announced to public on january 4 2010 along with four other planets as fifth confirmed planetary system verified by kepler it helped demonstrate capabilities of kepler spacecraft nomenclature and history kepler 8 was named way it was because it is home to eighth planetary system confirmed during course of kepler mission a nasa directed program tasked with searching a region of sky for terrestrial planets that transit or cross in front of and thereby for a while make dimmer stars that they orbit with respect to earth planet in orbit around kepler 8 kepler 8b was fifth of first five planets discovered by kepler spacecraft first three planets confirmed by kepler had been previously discovered and were only used to verify accuracy of kepler s measurements kepler 8b s discovery was announced to public on january 4 2010 at 215th meeting of american astronomical society in washington d c alongside planets in orbit around kepler 4 kepler 5 kepler 6 and kepler 7 data that was used to identify kepler 8b s existence was re examined and verified by observatories in hawaii arizona texas california and canary islands characteristics kepler 8 is situated some 1050 pc or light years from earth with a mass of 1 213 msun and a radius of 1 486 rsun kepler 8 is more massive than sun by about a fifth of sun s mass and is nearly three halves its size star is predicted to be 3 84 1 5 billion years old compared to sun s age at 4 6 billion years kepler 8 has a metallicity of fe h 0 055 0 03 making it 12 less metal rich than metal rich sun metallicity is important in stars because stars richer in metal are more likely to harbor planets star also has an effective temperature of 6213 150 k meaning that it is hotter than sun which has an effective temperature of 5778 k 300px thumb first five planets discovered by kepler compared by relative size kepler 8b is depicted in orange kepler 8 has an apparent magnitude of 13 9 in other words as seen from earth kepler 8 is an extremely dim star it cannot be seen with naked eye planetary system kepler 8b is only planet that has been discovered orbiting of kepler 8 with a mass of 603 mj and a radius of 1 419 rj planet is 60 mass of but 42 larger than planet jupiter planet is diffuse with a density of 261 grams cc especially in comparison to jupiter and its density of 5 515 grams cc at a distance of 0483 au kepler 8b orbits its star every 3 days eccentricity of kepler 8 is assumed to be 0 which would give planet a circular orbit in comparison planet mercury orbits sun at 3871 au every 87 97 days mercury also has an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 2056 see also list of extrasolar planets kepler mission references category planetary systems category lyra constellation 8 category planetary transit variables
