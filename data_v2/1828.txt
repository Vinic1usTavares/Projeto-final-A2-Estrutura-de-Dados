poetic technique to challenge society s concepts of gender identity especially in how it affects women she varies length of poem s lines beginning in first stanza and continuing throughout poem to convey ambiguity and doubt and to demand that reader question their perceptions of gender and power couple starting in its second stanza attacks class based ideals of masculinity in society poem ends

seas take time out elegy reverses little girl this winter day critical response kathryn gibbs harris in her review in library journal states that poems in oh pray like child dead in old seas are good heritage ballads with excellent lyrics she calls this winter day colorful and pleasant and states that it reminds her of a genre painting she like many critics about much of angelou s poetry says poems work best read aloud critic in booklist considers way in which poems are organized distracting but says that it does not diminish street wise soundings infused with a particular pain and pride according to review rhyme in here s to adhering is simple but its structure is deceptively complex critic also says sardonic quality of on reaching forty reduces age to a minor milestone nationhood is elevated to a higher yet deeper plane in africa and in america pusher is a typical angelou acceleration but it is chicken licken that causes a dead halt poetry critic sandra gilbert says that angelou s poems when they re not awkward or stilted are corny according to a reviewer in choice poems in oh pray focus on themes of love insight and tension they also focus on black condition celebrated triumphant over difficulties reviewer finds some poems uneven sometimes banal also best if read aloud and meant to be reread and laughed over and thought about reviewer james finn cotter states that this volume suffers from dangers of success that happen when poets gain too much fame too soon gilbert blames angelou s publishers for capitalizing on her success as an autobiographer stating that oh pray is such a painfully collection of poems that i can t think of any reason other than maya myth for it to be in print writer lyman b hagen responds to gilbert s criticism by stating that angelou
