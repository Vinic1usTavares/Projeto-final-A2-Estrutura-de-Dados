rhenium is a chemical element with symbol re and atomic number 75 it is a silvery gray heavy third row transition metal in group 7 of periodic table with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ppb rhenium is one of rarest elements in earth s crust rhenium has third highest melting point and highest boiling point of any stable element at k rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by product of extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from 1 to 7 discovered in 1908 rhenium was second last stable element to be discovered last being hafnium it was named after river rhine in europe nickel based superalloys of rhenium are used in combustion chambers turbine blades and exhaust nozzles of jet engines these alloys contain up to 6 rhenium making jet engine construction largest single use for element second most important use is as a catalyst rhenium is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization and is used for example in catalytic reforming of naphtha for use in gasoline process because of low availability relative to demand rhenium is expensive with price reaching an all time high in 2008 2009 us 10 600 per kilogram us 4 800 per pound due to increases in rhenium recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium in catalysts price of rhenium has dropped to us 2 844 per kilogram us 1 290 per pound as of july 2018 history rhenium meaning rhine was second last discovered of elements that have a stable isotope other new elements discovered in nature since then such as francium are radioactive existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in periodic table had been first predicted by dmitri mendeleev other calculated information was obtained by henry moseley in 1914 in 1908 japanese chemist masataka ogawa announced that he had discovered 43rd element and named it nipponium np after japan nippon in japanese however recent analysis indicated presence of rhenium element 75 not element 43 although this reinterpretation has been questioned by eric scerri eric scerri a tale of seven elements oxford university press 2013 p 109 114 symbol np was later used for element neptunium and name nihonium also named after japan along with symbol nh was later used for element 113 element 113 was also discovered by a team of japanese scientists and was named in respectful homage to ogawa s work rhenium is generally considered to have been discovered by walter noddack ida noddack and otto berg in germany in 1925 they reported that they had detected element in platinum ore and in mineral columbite they also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite in 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of element by processing 660 kg of molybdenite it was estimated in 1968 that 75 of rhenium metal in united states was used for research and development of refractory metal alloys it took several years from that point before superalloys became widely used characteristics rhenium is a silvery white metal with one of highest melting points of all elements exceeded by only tungsten and carbon it also has one of highest boiling points of all elements it is also one of densest exceeded only by platinum iridium and osmium rhenium has a hexagonal close packed crystal structure with lattice parameters a 276 1 pm and c 445 6 pm its usual commercial form is a powder but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering in a vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere this procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90 of density of metal when annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent coiled or rolled rhenium molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 k tungsten rhenium alloys

containing second generation superalloys rhenium is added to high temperature superalloys that are used to make jet engine parts using 70 of worldwide rhenium production another major application is in platinum rhenium catalysts which are primarily used in making lead free high octane gasoline alloys nickel based superalloys have improved creep strength with addition of rhenium alloys normally contain 3 or 6 of rhenium second generation alloys contain 3 these alloys were used in engines for f 15 and f 16 whereas newer single crystal third generation alloys contain 6 of rhenium they are used in f 22 and f 35 engines rhenium is also used in superalloys such as cmsx 4 2nd gen and cmsx 10 3rd gen that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like ge rhenium can cause superalloys to become unstable forming undesirable tcp topologically close packed phases in 4th and 5th generation superalloys ruthenium is used to avoid this effect among others new superalloys are epm 102 with 3 ru and tms 162 with 6 ru as well as tms 138 and tms 174 thumb left cfm international cfm56 jet engine still with blades made with 3 rhenium for 2006 consumption is given as 28 for general electric 28 rolls royce plc and 12 pratt whitney all for superalloys whereas use for catalysts only accounts for 14 and remaining applications use 18 in 2006 77 of rhenium consumption in united states was in alloys rising demand for military jet engines and constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content for example newer cfm international cfm56 high pressure turbine hpt blades will use rene with a rhenium content of 1 5 instead of rene n5 with 3 rhenium improves properties of tungsten tungsten rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature allowing them to be more easily machined high temperature stability is also improved effect increases with rhenium concentration and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27 of re which is solubility limit tungsten rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization this allows wire to meet specific performance objectives including superior vibration resistance improved ductility and higher resistivity one application for tungsten rhenium alloys is x ray sources high melting point of both elements together with their high atomic mass makes them stable against prolonged electron impact rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as thermocouples to measure temperatures up to 2200 degc high temperature stability low vapor pressure good wear resistance and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self cleaning electrical contacts in particular discharge that occurs during electrical switching oxidizes contacts however rhenium oxide re2o7 has poor stability sublimes at 360 degc and therefore is removed during discharge rhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to tantalum and tungsten therefore rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if filament is operated not in vacuum but in oxygen containing atmosphere those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers ion gauges and photoflash lamps in photography catalysts rhenium in form of rhenium platinum alloy is used as catalyst for catalytic reforming which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery with low octane ratings into high octane liquid products worldwide 30 of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium olefin metathesis is other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst normally re2o7 on alumina is used for this process rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions other uses isotopes 188re and 186re are radioactive and are used for treatment of liver cancer they both have similar penetration depth in tissue 5 mm for 186re and 11 mm for 188re but 186re has advantage of longer lifetime 90 hours vs 17 hours 188re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of bacterium listeria monocytogenes related by periodic trends rhenium has a similar chemistry to that of technetium work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium this is useful for where it is difficult to work with technetium especially 99m isotope used in medicine due to its expense and short half life precautions very little is known about toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts soluble salts such as rhenium halides or perrhenates could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride which were injected as a solution into rats perrhenate had an ld50 value of 2800 mg kg after seven days this is very low toxicity similar to that of table salt and rhenium trichloride showed ld50 of 280 mg kg references external links rhenium at periodic table of videos university of nottingham category
