betula pubescens syn betula alba commonly known as downy birch and also as moor birch white birch european white birch or hairy birch is a species of deciduous tree native and abundant throughout northern europe and northern asia growing farther north than any other broadleaf tree it is closely related to and often confused with silver birch b pendula but grows in wetter places with heavier soils and poorer drainage smaller trees can also be confused with dwarf birch b nana three varieties are recognised and it hybridises with silver and dwarf birches a number of cultivars have been developed but many are no longer in cultivation larva of autumnal moth epirrita autumnata feeds on foliage and in some years large areas of birch forest can be defoliated by this insect many fungi are associated with tree and certain pathogenic fungi are causal agents of birch dieback disease tree is a pioneer species readily colonising cleared land but later being replaced by taller more long lived species bark can be stripped off without killing tree and bark and timber is used for turnery and in manufacture of plywood furniture shelves coffins matches toys and wood flooring inner bark is edible and it was ground up and used in bread making in times of famine rising sap in spring can be used to make refreshing drinks wines ales and and various parts of tree have been used in herbal medicine description thumb left 200px branches are upward or horizontally spread but never pendulous as with silver birch betula pubescens is commonly known as downy birch with other common names including moor birch white birch european white birch or hairy birch it is a deciduous tree growing to tall rarely to 27 m with a slender crown and a trunk up to exceptionally 1 m in diameter with smooth but dull grey white bark finely marked with dark horizontal lenticels shoots are grey brown with fine downy leaves are ovate acute long and broad with a finely serrated margin flowers are wind pollinated catkins produced in early spring before leaves fruit is a pendulous cylindrical aggregate long and wide which disintegrates at maturity releasing individual seeds these seeds are long with two small wings along side species identification b pubescens is closely related to and often confused with silver birch b pendula many north american texts treat two species as conspecific and cause confusion by combining downy birch s alternative vernacular name white birch with scientific name b pendula of other species but they are regarded as distinct species throughout europe downy birch can be distinguished from silver birch with its smooth downy shoots which are hairless and warty in silver birch bark of downy birch is a dull greyish white whereas silver birch has striking white papery bark with black fissures leaf margins also differ finely serrated in downy birch coarsely double toothed in silver birch two have differences in habitat requirements with downy birch more common on wet poorly drained sites such as clays and peat bogs and silver birch found mainly on dry sandy soils in more northerly locations downy birch can also be confused with dwarf birch betula nana both species being morphologically variable all three species can be distinguished cytologically silver birch and dwarf birch being diploid with two sets of chromosomes whereas downy birch is tetraploid with four sets of chromosomes in iceland dwarf birch and downy birch sometimes hybridise resulting plants being triploid with three sets of chromosomes distribution and habitat thumb left betula pubescens near a path encircling a lake inside arctic circle in tromso betula pubescens has a wide distribution in northern and central europe and asia its range extends from newfoundland iceland british isles and spain eastwards across northern and central europe and asia as far as lake baikal region in siberia range extends southwards to about its southernmost limit being turkey caucasus and altai mountains it is a pioneer species which establishes itself readily in new areas away from parent tree this allows other woodland trees to become established and birch a short lived tree eventually gets crowded out as its seedlings are intolerant of shady conditions downy birch extends farther north into arctic than any other broadleaf tree specimens of subarctic populations are usually small and very contorted and are often distinguished as arctic downy birch or mountain birch b p var pumila not to be confused with b nana this variety is notable as being one of very few trees native to iceland and greenland and is only tree to form woodland in iceland at one time island is thought to have been covered in downy birch woodland but that cover is reduced to about one percent of land surface today varieties and cultivars thumb arctic downy birch forms treeline in most of scandinavia three varieties are recognised nominate betula pubescens var pubescens b p var distributed in caucasus and turkey and b p var pumila arctic downy birch or mountain birch formerly called b p subsp tortuosa latter has arisen from hybridization of var pubescens and b nana dwarf birch vare h 2001 mountain birch taxonomy and of mountain birch woodlands in e ed nordic mountain birch ecosystems man and biosphere series 27 35 46 unesco paris and parthenon publishing group new york london and is characterised by its shrubby habit smaller leaves resinous glands and smaller wings on fruit a number of cultivars have been grown but many are no longer in cultivation they include armenian gold arnold brembo scented foliage crenata nana shrubby and dwarf incisa lobed foliage integrifolia foliage shrubby with doubly serrate leaves hairless undulata leaf margins waxy nettle leaved variegata variegated and yellow wings two others described by german botanist ernst schelle in 1903 are also lost pendula a cultivar with a leader and weeping branches and pendula nana which grows into an umbrella shaped tree with weeping branches but no leader ecology thumb left scarce dagger larva feeding on moor birch larva of autumnal moth epirrita autumnata feeds on foliage of betula pubescens and other tree species in outbreak years large areas of birch forest can be defoliated by this insect damage to leaf tissue stimulates tree to produce chemicals that reduce foliage quality retarding growth of larvae and reducing their pupal weights in greenland about seventy species of fungi have been found growing in association with b pubescens as parasites or saprobes on living or dead wood some of most common fungi include reticulata exidia spp inonotus inonotus radiatus mycena galericulata mycena peniophora incarnata phellinus lundellii confluens stereum spp spp and birch dieback disease associated with fungal pathogens and can affect planted trees while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible this disease also affects betula pendula and in 2000 was reported at many of sites planted with birch in scotland during 1990s uses thumb betula pubescens is a pioneering species seen expanding its range here in norway outer layer of bark can be stripped off tree without killing it and can be used to make canoe skins drinking vessels and roofing tiles inner bark can be used for production of rope and for making a form of oiled paper this bark is also rich in tannin and has been used as a brown dye and as a preservative bark can also be turned into a high quality charcoal favoured by artists twigs and young branches are very flexible and make good whisks and brooms timber is pale in colour with a fine uniform texture and is used in manufacture of plywood furniture shelves coffins matches and toys and in turnery sami people of scandinavia used bark of both b pubescens and b pendula as an ingredient in bread making reddish phloem just below outer bark was dried ground up and blended with wheat flour to make a traditional loaf in finland a traditional easter food was packed and baked in boxes of birch bark nowadays cardboard boxes are used but imprinted with typical bark pattern nordic recipe archive origin birch bark was used as an emergency food in times of famine in novgorod in 1127 28 desperate people ate it along with such things as leaves of lime trees wood pulp straw husks and moss in iceland trimmings of birch trees are used with birch sap in making of a sweet birch liqueur removal of bark was at one time so widespread that carl linnaeus expressed his concern for survival of woodlands leaves can be infused with boiling water to make a tea and extracts of plant have been used as herbal remedies both b pubescens and b pendula can be tapped in spring to obtain a sugary fluid this can be consumed fresh concentrated into a syrup similar to better known maple syrup or can be fermented into an ale or wine in scandinavia this is done on a domestic scale but in former ussr particularly russia ukraine belarus estonia latvia and lithuania birch sap is harvested commercially and used to manufacture cosmetics medicines and foodstuffs references external links betula pubescens information genetic
