thumb 237px right graph of equation here is unique number larger than 1 that makes shaded area equal to 1 number is a mathematical constant that is base of natural logarithm unique number whose natural logarithm is equal to one it is approximately equal to 2 oxford english dictionary 2nd ed natural logarithm and is limit of as approaches infinity an expression that arises in study of compound interest it can also be calculated as sum of infinite dictionary of mathematics 142 d constant can be characterized in many different ways for example it can be defined as unique positive number such that graph of function has unit slope at function is called natural exponential function and is unique exponential function equal to its own derivative natural logarithm or logarithm to base is inverse function to natural exponential function natural logarithm of a number can be defined directly as area under curve between and in which case is value of k for which this area equals one see image there are alternative characterizations is sometimes called euler s number after swiss mathematician leonhard euler not to be confused with euler constant sometimes called simply euler s constant or as napier s constant however euler s choice of symbol is said to have been retained in his honor constant was discovered by swiss mathematician jacob bernoulli while studying compound interest number is of eminent importance in mathematics alongside 0 1 and all five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics and are five constants appearing in one formulation of euler s identity like constant is irrational it is not a ratio of integers also like is transcendental it is not a root of any non zero polynomial with rational coefficients numerical value of truncated to 50 decimal places is history first references to constant were published in 1618 in table of an appendix of a work on logarithms by john napier however this did not contain constant itself but simply a list of logarithms calculated from constant it is assumed that table was written by william discovery of constant itself is credited to jacob bernoulli in 1683 jacob bernoulli considered problem of continuous compounding of interest which led to a series expression for e see jacob bernoulli 1690 quaestiones nonnullae de usuris cum solutione problematis de sorte alearum in gall a 1685 some questions about interest with a solution of a problem about games of chance proposed in journal des savants ephemerides eruditorum in year anno 1685 acta eruditorum pp 219 23 on page 222 bernoulli poses question alterius naturae hoc problema est si creditor ea lege ut pars quantum anno this is a problem of another kind question is if some lender were to invest a sum of money at interest let it accumulate so that at every moment it were to receive a proportional part of its annual interest how much would he be owed at end of year bernoulli constructs a power series to calculate answer and then writes quae nostra serie mathematical expression for a geometric series c major est si a b quam 2 1 2a minus quam 3a which our series a geometric series is larger than if a b lender will be owed more than 2 1 2a and less than 3a if a b geometric series reduces to series for a x e so 2 5 e 3 reference is to a problem which jacob bernoulli posed and which appears in journal des scavans of 1685 at bottom of page 314 who attempted to find value of following expression which is in fact first known use of constant represented by letter was in correspondence from gottfried leibniz to christiaan huygens in 1690 and 1691 leonhard euler introduced letter as base for natural logarithms writing in a letter to christian goldbach on 25 november 1731 lettre xv euler a goldbach dated november 25 1731 in p h fuss ed correspondance mathematique et physique de quelques celebres geometres du siecle mathematical and physical correspondence of some famous geometers of 18th century vol 1 st petersburg russia 1843 pp 56 60 see especially p 58 from p 58 e denotat hic numerum cujus logarithmus hyperbolicus est 1 e denotes that number whose hyperbolic i e natural logarithm is equal to 1 euler started to use letter for constant in 1727 or 1728 in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons euler in instituta and first appearance of in a publication was in euler s mechanica 1736 leonhard euler mechanica sive scientia st petersburg russia academy of sciences 1736 vol 1 chapter 2 corollary 11 paragraph 171 p 68 from page 68 seu ubi e denotat numerum cuius logarithmus hyperbolicus est 1 so it i e c speed will be or where e denotes number whose hyperbolic i e natural logarithm is 1 while in subsequent years some researchers used letter letter was more common and eventually became standard in mathematics standard is to typeset constant as in italics iso 80000 2 2009 standard recommends typesetting constants in an upright style but this has not been validated by scientific community applications compound interest thumb right 350px effect of earning 20 annual interest on an investment at various compounding frequencies jacob bernoulli discovered this constant in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest if interest is credited twice in year interest rate for each 6 months will be 50 so initial 1 is multiplied by 1 5 twice yielding at end of year compounding quarterly yields and compounding monthly yields if there are compounding intervals interest for each interval will be and value at end of year will be 1 bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit force of interest with larger and thus smaller compounding intervals compounding weekly yields 2 while compounding daily yields 2 just two cents more limit as grows large is number that came to be known as with continuous compounding account value will reach 2 more generally an account that starts at 1 and offers an annual interest rate of will after years yield dollars with continuous compounding here is decimal equivalent of rate of interest expressed as a percentage so for 5 interest bernoulli trials thumb 300px graphs of probability p of observing independent events each of probability 1 n after n bernoulli trials and 1 p vs n it can be observed that as n increases probability of a 1 n chance event never appearing after n tries rapidly number itself also has applications to probability theory where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in and plays it times then for large such as a million probability that gambler will lose every bet is approximately for it is already approximately 1 2 79 this is an example of a bernoulli trial process each time gambler plays slots there is a one in one million chance of winning playing one million times is modelled by binomial distribution which is closely related to binomial theorem and pascal s triangle probability of winning times out of a million trials is in particular probability of winning zero times is this is very close to limit standard normal distribution normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as standard normal distribution given by probability density function constraint of unit variance and thus also unit standard deviation results in in exponent and constraint of unit total area under curve results in factor proof this function is symmetric around where it attains its maximum value and has inflection points at derangements another application of also discovered in part by jacob bernoulli along with pierre raymond de montmort is in problem of derangements also known as hat check problem grinstead c m and snell j l introduction to probability theory published online under gfdl p 85 guests are invited to a party and at door guests all check their hats with butler who in turn places hats into boxes each labelled with name of one guest but butler has not asked identities of guests and so he puts hats into boxes selected at random problem of de montmort is to find probability that none of hats gets put into right box answer is as number of guests tends to infinity approaches furthermore number of ways hats can be placed into boxes so that none of hats are in right box is rounded to nearest integer for every positive knuth 1997 art of computer programming volume i addison wesley p 183 optimal planning problems a stick of length is broken into equal parts value of that maximizes product of lengths is then either or stated result follows because maximum value of occurs at steiner s problem discussed below quantity is a measure of information gleaned from an event occurring with probability so that essentially same optimal division appears in optimal planning problems like secretary problem asymptotics number occurs naturally in connection with many problems involving asymptotics an example is stirling s formula for asymptotics of factorial function in which both numbers and enter as a consequence in calculus thumb right graphs of functions are shown for dotted blue and dashed they all pass through point but red line which has slope is tangent to only there thumb right value of natural log function for argument i e equals principal motivation for introducing number particularly in calculus is to perform differential and integral calculus with exponential functions and logarithms kline m 1998 calculus an intuitive and physical approach section 12 3 derived functions of logarithmic functions pp 337 ff courier dover publications 1998 a general exponential has a derivative given by a limit limit on right is independent of it depends only on when base is set this limit is equal and so is symbolically defined by equation consequently exponential function with base is particularly suited to doing calculus as opposed to some other number as base of exponential function makes calculations involving derivative much simpler another motivation comes from considering derivative of base logarithm this is approach taken by kline 1998 i e of for where substitution was made logarithm of is 1 if equals so symbolically logarithm with this special base is called natural logarithm and is denoted as it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through calculations there are thus two ways in which to select such special numbers one way is to set derivative of exponential function equal to and solve for other way is to set derivative of base logarithm to and solve for in each case one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus it turns out that these two solutions for are actually same number alternative characterizations thumb right five colored regions are of equal area and define units of hyperbolic angle along other characterizations of are also possible one is as limit of a sequence another is as sum of an infinite series and still others rely on integral calculus so far following two equivalent properties have been introduced number is unique positive real number such that number is unique positive real number such that following four characterizations can be proven equivalent properties calculus as in motivation exponential function is important in part because it is unique nontrivial function up to multiplication by a constant which is its own derivative and therefore its own as well inequalities thumb right exponential functions and intersect graph of respectively at and number is unique base such that intersects only at we may infer that lies between 2 and 4 number is unique real number such that for all positive also we have inequality for all real with equality if and only if furthermore is unique base of exponential for which inequality holds for all a standard calculus exercise using mean value theorem see for example apostol 1967 calculus ss6 17 41 this is a limiting case of bernoulli s inequality exponential like functions thumb right 250px global maximum of steiner s problem asks to find global maximum for function this maximum occurs precisely at for proof inequality from above evaluated at and simplifying gives so for all positive x similarly is where global minimum occurs for function defined for positive more generally for function global maximum for positive occurs at for any and global minimum occurs at for any infinite or converges if and only if or approximately between 0 and 1 due to a theorem of

irrational euler proved this by showing that its simple continued fraction expansion is infinite see also fourier s proof that is irrational furthermore by lindemann weierstrass theorem is transcendental meaning that it is not a solution of any non constant polynomial equation with rational coefficients it was first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose compare with liouville number proof was given by charles hermite in 1873 it is conjectured that is normal meaning that when is expressed in any base possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length complex numbers exponential function may be written as a taylor series because this series is convergent for every complex value of it is commonly used to extend definition of to complex numbers this with taylor series for and allows one to derive euler s formula which holds for every complex special case with is euler s identity from which it follows that in principal branch of logarithm furthermore using laws for exponentiation which is de moivre s formula expression is sometimes referred to as expressions of and in terms of exponential function can be deduced differential equations family of functions where is any real number is solution to differential equation representations number can be represented as a real number in a variety of ways as an infinite series an infinite product a continued fraction or a limit of a sequence chief among these representations particularly in introductory calculus courses is limit given above as well as series given by evaluating above power series for at less common is continued fraction hofstadter d r
