thumb right a retiarius stabs at a secutor with his trident in this mosaic from villa at c 2nd 3rd century ce a retiarius plural retiarii literally net man in latin was a roman gladiator who fought with equipment styled on that of a fisherman a weighted net rete 3rd hence name a three pointed trident fuscina or tridens and a dagger pugio retiarius was lightly armoured wearing an arm guard manica and a shoulder guard galerus typically his clothing consisted only of a loincloth subligaculum held in place by a wide belt or of a short tunic with light padding he wore no head protection or footwear retiarius was routinely pitted against a heavily armed secutor net fighter made up for his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent s attacks and waiting for opportunity to strike he first tried to throw his net over his rival if this succeeded he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled another tactic was to ensnare his enemy s weapon in net and pull it out of his grasp leaving opponent defenseless should net miss or secutor grab hold of it retiarius likely discarded weapon although he might try to collect it back for a second cast usually retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish fight trident as tall as a human being permitted gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance it was a strong weapon capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb dagger was retiarius s final backup should trident be lost it was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle bout in some battles a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously for these situations lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers retiarii first appeared in arena during 1st century ad and had become standard attractions by 2nd or 3rd century gladiator s lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered retiarius lowliest and most effeminate of gladiators an already stigmatised class passages from works of juvenal seneca and suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype retiarii tunicati who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns nevertheless roman artwork graffiti and grave markers include examples of specific net men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers history and role thumb right relief showing a fight between a secutor and retiarius roman gladiators fell into stock categories modelled on real world precedents duncan 204 almost all of these classes were based on military antecedents retiarius net fighter or net man baker 53 ward 39 who was themed after sea was one exception junkelmann 59 rare gladiator fights were staged over water these may have given rise to concept of a gladiator based on a fisherman fights between differently armed gladiators became popular in imperial period junkelmann 61 retiarius versus scaly secutor developed as conflict of a fisherman with a stylised fish earlier had borne a fish on their helmets oxford classical dictionary gladiators secutores with their scaly armour evolved from them however because of stark differences in arms and armour between two types pairing pushed such practices to new extremes roman art and literature make no mention of retiarii until early imperial period for example type is absent from copious gladiator themed reliefs dating to 1st century found at and pompeii nevertheless graffiti and artifacts from pompeii attest to class s existence by this time jacobelli 48 fights between retiarii and secutores probably became popular as early as middle of 1st century ce net fighter had become one of standard gladiator categories by 2nd or 3rd century ce and remained a staple attraction until end of gladiatorial games junkelmann 51 59 60 in addition to man versus nature symbolism inherent in such bouts duncan 206 lightly armoured retiarius was viewed as effeminate counterpoint to manly heavily armoured secutor retiarius was also seen as water to secutor s fire one constantly moving and escaping other determinedly inescapable auguet 78 another gladiator type noose man was similar to retiarius but fought with a lasso in place of a net grant 60 more skin left unarmoured and exposed lower a gladiator s status and greater his perceived effeminacy braund 159 likewise engulfing net may have been seen as a feminine symbol edwards 93 note 47 light arms and armour of retiarius thus established him as lowliest most disgraced and most effeminate of gladiator types helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise fighters when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade at arms someone he had probably lived and trained with every day his opponent s helmet added an extra layer of separation however retiarius was allowed no head protection his face was visible to all junkelmann 68 emperor claudius had all net fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony auguet 49 retiarius s fighting style was another strike against him as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to straightforward trading of blows baker 55 56 retiarii lived in worst barracks grant 60 61 some members of class trained to fight as samnites another gladiator type in order to improve their status grant 61 there is evidence that those net men wearing tunics known as retiarii tunicati formed a special sub class one even more demeaned than their loincloth wearing colleagues cerutti and richardson 589 roman satirist juvenal wrote that so even lanista s establishment is better ordered than yours for he separates vile from decent and even from their fellow retiarii wearers of ill famed tunic in training school and even in gaol such creatures herd apart juvenal satires vi oxford text 1ff ergo laribus lanista in cuius numero longe ab quid quod nec retia nec cella eadem munimenta arma qui emphasis added translation from ramsay passage suggests that tunic wearing retiarii were trained for a different role in servitude under strict discipline and even possibly under some restraints cerutti and richardson 590 591 certain effeminate men mentioned by seneca younger in his quaestiones naturales were trained as gladiators and may correspond to juvenal s tunic wearing retiarii seneca quaestiones naturales 7 31 3 quoted in cerutti and richardson 589 590 suetonius reports this anecdote once a band of five retiarii in tunics matched against same number of secutores yielded without a struggle but when their death was ordered one of them caught up his trident and slew all victors reaction of emperor caligula showed disgust with which he viewed gladiators actions caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder and expressed his horror of those who had had heart to witness it suetonius xxx fate of retiarii is not revealed this was probably not a standard competition as real gladiators did not surrender so easily cerutti and richardson 594 rather such tunic wearing net men may have served as comic relief in gladiatorial programming juvenal s second satire wherein he deplores immorality he perceived in roman society introduces a member of gracchus family who is described as a homosexual married in female persona to a horn player cerutti and richardson 591 gracchus later appears in arena greater still portent when gracchus clad in a tunic played gladiator and fled trident in hand across arena gracchus a man of nobler birth than capitolini or or descendants of catulus or paulus or nobler than all spectators in podium not excepting him who gave show at which that net was flung juvenal satires ii 143ff et hoc monstrum tunicati fuscina gracchi fuga gladiator et et et et et omnibus ad podium his licet ipsum cuius retia emphasis added translation from ramsay gracchus appears once again in juvenal s eighth satire as worst example of noble romans who have disgraced themselves by appearing in public spectacles and popular entertainments cerutti and richardson 592 to crown all this scandal what is left but amphitheatre and this disgrace of city you have as well gracchus not fighting as equipped as a with buckler or falchion for he condemns yes condemns and hates such equipment nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet see he wields a trident when he has cast without effect nets suspended from his poised right hand he boldly lifts his uncovered face to spectators and easily to be recognized flees across whole arena we can not mistake tunic since ribbon of gold reaches from his neck and flutters in breeze from his high peaked cap therefore disgrace which secutor had to submit to in being forced to fight with gracchus was worse than any wound juvenal satire viii 90 left thumb a murmillo stands victorious over a retiarius in verso a painting by jean leon gerome 1872 passage is obscure but cerutti and richardson argue that gracchus begins fight as a loincloth wearing retiarius when tide turns against him he dons a tunic and a womanish wig spira evans 90 translates this as high peaked cap and baker 56 as queer conspicuous arm guard apparently part of same costume and thus enjoys a reprieve although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by priests of mars of whom gracchus was chief priest change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent it is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire as such fighters usually take role of men who are brawny brutal sexually successful with women of both high and low status but especially latter ill educated if not uneducated and none too bright intellectually cerutti and richardson 593 retiarius tunicatus in satire is opposite a mock gladiatorial figure of equivocal sex regularly dressed in costume of some sort possibly usually as a woman and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition despite their low status some retiarii became quite popular throughout early empire zoll 117 fact that spectators could see net fighters faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity zoll 119 at pompeii graffiti tells of crescens or cresces retiarius lord of girls and doctor to nighttime girls morning girls and all rest r cresces and cresces retiarius ser medicus translation in jacobelli 49 wiedemann 26 gives an alternate translation for latter graffito netter of girls in night evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators and retiarius would have been particularly appealing roman art depicts net men just as often as other types a mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at villa dei shows a retiarius named montanus fact that his name is recorded indicates that gladiator was famous mosaic dates to c ce 130 when quintilii family had home built emperor commodus who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a secutor acquired house in ce 182 and used it as a country villa valsecchi 1 2 in modern times popular culture has made retiarius probably most famous type of gladiator connolly and dodge 214 arms and armour right thumb in this scene from zliten mosaic c ce 200 a retiarius armed only with a dagger raises a finger in surrender his trident lies at foot of his secutor adversary and his net is missing he is also seen bleeding from an artery in his leg retiarius is most readily identifiable gladiator type due to his signature equipment arm guard manica shoulder guard galerus net rete trident fuscina or tridens and dagger pugio technically retiarius was not a gladiator at all since he did not fight with sword gladius after which such fighters took their name his weapons and armour could be decorated an embellished gladiatorial dagger is held at naples national archaeological museum wisdom 32 archaeologists have excavated three engraved shoulder guards from gladiator barracks at pompeii one is engraved with illustrations of an anchor a crab and a dolphin another with cupids and head of hercules and a third with weapons and inscription ret retiarius second rank jacobelli 13 14 although net rete was this gladiator s signature weapon few depictions of device survive combat with throwing nets may have occurred on ancient battlefields but modern experiments and comparisons with modern fishing nets offer only clues as to how gladiatorial net was constructed such data indicate that rete was circular with a wide mesh about in diameter and lead weights along edges a rope ran around perimeter of mesh with ends tied to gladiator s wrist wisdom 31 32 because it was thrown net was sometimes called a retiarius complemented his net with an iron or bronze trident fuscina fascina or rarely tridens braund 159 calls it a fascina but most sources spell it fuscina that stood about as high as a human being auguet 57 a skull found in a gladiator graveyard in ephesus turkey shows puncture holes consistent with a trident strike wounds are apart and match a bronze trident excavated from ephesus harbour in 1989 trident s prongs are long follain 2 a long straight bladed dagger pugio was gladiator s final weapon junkelmann 60 a tombstone found in romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes known as a each spike at corner of a square guard instead of usual bladed dagger this was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in ephesus has wounds consistent with use of such a weapon retiarius wore minimal armour unlike other gladiator types he wore no helmet greaves or shield he wore a manica on his left arm where other gladiators wore it on right this allowed him to more fluidly make a right handed cast of his net jacobelli 13 attached to top of this was a long bronze or leather guard over upper left arm and shoulder known as a galerus this guard extended beyond shoulder blade and flared outward allowing free movement of gladiator s head device protected upper arm head and face when retiarius kept his left side to his opponent armour was designed to let net man duck his head behind it and it was curved so as to deflect a blow from top downwards not up towards eyes zoll 118 three examples of this protective gear found at pompeii vary between in length and about same in width they weigh about in eastern roman empire in later years some retiarii wore a chainmail manica instead of galerus this mail covered arm and upper chest equipment styles stayed relatively fixed in western empire besides these items retiarius wore only a loincloth subligaculum held in place by a wide belt and gaiters or as images show in lieu of loincloth a tunic that left right shoulder uncovered he wore fabric padding on his body to provide minimal additional protection artistic depictions show that other options included a headband and a medallion wisdom 62 all told retiarius s equipment weighed 7 to to 17 6 lb making him lightest of standard gladiator types like other arena combatants retiarius fought barefoot fighting style thumb left in lower frame of this mosaic at national archaeological museum in madrid retiarius kalendio captures secutor astyanax in his net nevertheless in upper image kalendio lies wounded on ground and raises his dagger to surrender retiarius was traditionally pitted against a secutor or possibly on rare occasions a murmillo auguet 73 mentions retiarius murmillo pairing but zoll 117 says that two gladiator types do not seem to have ever fought each other despite disparity between nearly nude net fighter and his heavily armoured adversary modern re enactments and experiments show that retiarius was by no means outmatched baker 186 his lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage baker 55 he also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent s one auguet 72 net fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs keep his distance and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net name secutor means pursuer or chaser because this gladiator had to chase down retiarius they were also known as those against net man secutor s strategy was to keep behind his shield scutum and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword in close quarters net man had only his galerus shoulder guard for defence its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it secutor s helmet greatly restricted his sight hearing and airflow coupled with heavy weight of his arms and armour gear of a murmillo of which secutor was a variant weighed junkelmann 51 this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight junkelmann 61 63 one of retiarius s tactics was to jab at secutor s shield heaviest part of his equipment forcing him to block and wear himself out baker 189 overall roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a retiarius although skill and experience could affect odds in individual matches e g edward lucas white e p dutton 1922 chap xxxiv no one not reckless or drunk bet even money on an ordinary secutor odds on retiarius are customarily between five to three and two to one in skilled hands net was a useful weapon retiarius s primary objective with it was to capture his opponent a ewer found at rheinzabern demonstrates throwing technique retiarius held net folded up in his right hand and cast it underhanded he held his trident and dagger in his left hand careful to keep trident s prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in mesh junkelmann 59 60 if toss missed retiarius used tied to his wrist to bring net back in hand on a successful cast gladiator tightened around net s perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival a successful cast of net could win battle for retiarius straightaway this was not certain however as a mosaic at national archaeological museum in madrid shows in first panel retiarius kalendio has caught his opponent a secutor named astyanax in his net in later image however kalendio lies on ground wounded and raises his dagger to surrender inscription above kalendio shows sign for null implying that match organisers ordered him killed futrell 98 net could ensnare secutor s weapon to disarm him and snag away his shield to put him at a significant disadvantage other retiarius tricks were to whip net at his opponent s eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him wisdom 31 helmet of secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging net in most cases secutor knew to expect net man s tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to weapon possibly his enemy by on net in such danger retiarius could sever from his wrist with his dagger secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it speculation surrounds frequency with which retiarius used his net extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of type with a net yet class is named for device and juvenal uses net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost weapon in fight another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets auguet 74 thumb right in this mock gladiatorial fight at carnuntum austria scissor left is wearing a conical arm guard used to snag away net of retiarius right in most bouts retiarius probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger placing him at a disadvantage trident was his primary weapon in such situations and its length allowed retiarius to keep his opponent at bay auguet 56 he held weapon two handed left nearer prongs so that he could parry his enemy s strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends wielded two handed weapon could land powerful blows images show retiarii stabbing downward at secutor s unshielded legs or stabbing down at helmet in an attempt to poke through an trident itself was too weak to pierce metal although a skull found at ephesus turkey dating to ce 200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent follain 1 secutor s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring net or being caught in trident s prongs but attacks on it forced secutor to duck or hide behind his shield this reduced his field of vision and gave retiarius an advantage with his speed should secutor strike with his sword retiarius parried with trident prongs and attempted to disarm him likewise more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block trident with his shield and force net man to lose it another type of gladiator scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius images from eastern roman empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm guard in lieu of a shield guard fits over left hand and ends in a hooked knife like blade that was probably intended to parry net and trident or to snag and pull away net scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped hook weapon and fought with just a sword junkelmann 63 auguet 73 74 retiarius held dagger in his left hand gladiator could use dagger to cut his net free if it got snagged on his trident shadrake 178 he might fight with trident in one hand and dagger in other but this negated advantage of distance afforded by longer weapon when wielded by itself auguet 58 dagger also served as a backup should retiarius lose both net and trident he attacked with dagger when he had element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle secutor to ground fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations perhaps with daggers should retiarius win and be ordered to kill his rival he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat evidence shows that retiarii could be quite successful combatants a tombstone from gaul reads for retiarius l pompeius winner of nine crowns born in vienna twenty five years of age his wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse quoted in futrell 152 nevertheless gladiators themselves were prone to boast a graffito at pompeii shows retiarius antigonus who claims a ridiculous 2 112 victories facing a challenger called superbus who has won but a single fight auguet 44 in some contests a retiarius faced two secutores at same time he stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist sized stones to lob at his adversaries and keep them at bay secutores tried to scale structure and get at him platform called a pons bridge may have been constructed over water junkelmann 60 61
