crossing between 1322 and 1328 is greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at ely cathedral according to architectural historian nikolaus pevsner building continued until dissolution of abbey in 1539 during reformation cathedral was sympathetically restored between 1845 and 1870 by architect george gilbert scott as seat of a diocese ely has long been considered a city in 1974 city status was granted by royal charter ely is built on a kimmeridge clay island which at is highest land in fens major rivers including witham welland nene and great ouse feed into fens and until draining commenced in 17th century formed freshwater marshes and meres within which peat was laid down there are two sites of special scientific interest in city a former kimmeridge clay quarry and one of united kingdom s best remaining examples of medieval ridge and furrow agriculture economy of region is mainly agricultural before fens were drained harvesting of osier willow and sedge rush and extraction of peat were important activities as were eel fishing from which settlement s name may have been derived and wildfowling city had been centre of local pottery production for more than 700 years including pottery known as babylon ware a roman road akeman street passes through city southern end is at ermine street near wimpole and its northern end is at brancaster little direct evidence of roman occupation in ely exists although there are nearby roman settlements such as those at little thetford and stretham a coach route known to have existed in 1753 between ely and cambridge was improved in 1769 as a turnpike toll road present day a10 closely follows this route a southwestern bypass of city was built in 1986 ely railway station built in 1845 is on fen line and is now a

sssi northeast of city jurassic kimmeridge clays were quarried in 19th and 20th centuries for production of pottery and for maintenance of river embankments many specimens of ammonites belemnites and bivalves were found during quarrying in addition to an almost complete specimen of a pliosaur there is some scattered evidence of late mesolithic to bronze age activity in ely such as neolithic flint tools a bronze age axe and spearhead there is slightly denser iron age and roman activity with some evidence of at least seasonal occupation for example a possible farmstead of late iron age to early roman period was discovered at west fen road and some roman pottery was found close to east end of cathedral on paddock there was a roman settlement including a tile kiln built over an earlier iron age settlement in little thetford to south name origin and meaning of ely s name have always been regarded as obscure by place name scholars and are still disputed earliest record of name is in latin text of bede s historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum where bede wrote elge this is apparently not a latin name and subsequent latin texts nearly all used forms elia eli or heli with inorganic h in old english charters and in anglo saxon chronicle spelling is usually elig skeat derived name ely from what he called o ld northumbrian elge meaning district of eels this uses a hypothetical word ge which is not recorded in isolation but thought by some to be related to modern german word gau meaning district theory is that name then developed a vowel to become elige and was afterwards re interpreted to mean eel island this essentially is explanation accepted by reaney ekwall mills and watts but difficulties remain bailey in his discussion of ge names has pointed out that ely would be anomalous if really from elge eel district being remote from areas where possible examples of ge names occur and moreover there is no parallel for use of a fish name in compounds with ge more seriously usual english spelling remains elig even in dative case used after many prepositions where elige would be expected if second element were ig island this is in conflict with all other island names which surround ely medieval period city s origins lay in foundation of an abbey in 673 to north of village of on isle of ely under protection of saint etheldreda daughter of king anna this first abbey was destroyed in 870 by danish invaders and rededicated to etheldreda in 970 by ethelwold bishop of winchester abbots of ely then accumulated such wealth in region that in domesday survey 1086 it was second richest monastery in england first norman bishop simeon started building cathedral in 1083 octagon was rebuilt by sacrist alan of walsingham between 1322 and 1328 after collapse of original nave crossing on 22 february 1322 ely s octagon is considered one of wonders of medieval world architectural historian nikolaus pevsner believes octagon is a delight from beginning to end for anyone who feels for space as strongly as for construction and is greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at ely cathedral left thumb alt east aspect of oliver cromwell house in ely
