yellow star is written in free verse after roy struggled with how to authentically express perlmutter rozines experiences to children in a way that did not seem stiff or detached first i tried to write story as a straight nonfiction account too dry next i rewrote it in third person narrative but that didn t quite work either frustrated i went back to tapes and listened again to my aunt s lilting european accented voice suddenly voices of all my jewish relatives came flooding back to me and that s when i knew that i would write my aunt s story in first person as if she were telling story herself from introduction roy cites karen hesse s newbery medal winning out of dust as an inspiration for book s voice roy edited perlmutter rozines various recollections together into chronological order and penned narrative introductions to each chapter describing war s events outside ghetto while book is substantially based on perlmutter rozines recollections it is classified as
