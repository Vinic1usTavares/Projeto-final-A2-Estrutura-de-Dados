terms of washington naval treaty to an aircraft carrier as replacement for battlecruiser which had been damaged during 1923 great kanto earthquake kaga was rebuilt in 1933 1935 increasing her top speed improving her exhaust systems and adapting her flight decks to more modern heavier aircraft ship figured prominently in development of ijn s carrier striking force doctrine which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power a revolutionary strategic concept at time employment of doctrine was crucial in enabling japan to attain its initial strategic goals during first six months of pacific war kagas aircraft first supported japanese troops in china during shanghai incident of 1932 and participated in second sino japanese war in late 1930s with other carriers she took part in pearl harbor raid in december 1941 and invasion of rabaul in southwest pacific in january 1942 following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on darwin australia helping secure conquest of dutch east indies by japanese forces she missed indian ocean raid in april as she had to return to japan for repairs after hitting a reef in february following repairs kaga rejoined 1st air fleet for battle of midway in june 1942 after bombarding american forces on midway atoll kaga and three other ijn carriers were attacked by american aircraft from midway and carriers and dive bombers from enterprise severely damaged kaga when it became obvious she could not be saved she was scuttled by japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands loss of four large attack carriers including kaga at midway was a crucial setback for japan and contributed significantly to japan s ultimate defeat in 1999 debris from

scrapped under terms of washington naval treaty gardiner and gray p 232 jentschura p 35 treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to standard displacement incomplete battlecruisers amagi and were initially selected but great kanto earthquake of 1923 damaged hull beyond economically feasible repair and kaga was selected as her replacement formal decision to convert kaga to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 december 1923 but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to yokosuka naval arsenal was repaired she was officially commissioned on 31 march 1928 but this signified only beginning of sea trials she joined combined fleet kantai on 30 november 1929 as ijn s third carrier to enter service

kaga like akagi was completed with three superimposed flight decks only carriers ever to be designed so british carriers converted from large light cruisers and each had two flight decks but there is

recovery of aircraft brown p 2 kagas main flight deck was long and wide peattie p 231 her middle flight deck was only about long and started in front of bridge and her lower flight deck was

not proved successful and wind tunnel testing had not provided an answer as a result akagi and kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real world conditions kagas funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at rear of each side of flight deck in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep hot gases away from flight deck predictions proved to be correct not least because kaga was slower than akagi which allowed gases to rise and interfere with landing operations another drawback was that heat of gases made crew s quarters located on side of ship by funnels almost uninhabitable kaga was completed with four kawasaki brown curtis geared turbines with a total of on four shafts as a battleship her

fleet training with rest of combined fleet at this time ijn s developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages kaga and other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting fleet s battleships in ijn s decisive battle doctrine in this role kagas aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later beginning around 1932 1933 deemed of equal importance in order to establish air superiority during initial stages of battle essential component in this strategy was that japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed aerial attack as a result in fleet training exercises carriers began to operate together in front of or with main battle line this revolutionary strategy emphasized maximum speed from both carriers and aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range thus longer flight decks on carriers were required in order to handle newer heavier aircraft which were entering service peattie pp 72 76 152 stille p 13 goldstein jisaburo ozawa pp 76 78 kaga was soon judged inferior to akagi because of her slower speed smaller flight deck

weaknesses in kagas design were not rectified kagas aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into structure of carrier meaning that shocks to ship such as those caused by bomb or shell hits would be transmitted directly to tanks resulting in cracks or leaks also fully enclosed structure of new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in hangars adding to danger was requirement from japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced fueled and armed whenever possible on hangar decks rather than on flight deck in addition carrier s hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection furthermore there was no redundancy in ship s fire extinguishing systems these weaknesses would later be crucial factors in

off china had helped further develop ijn s carrier doctrine one lesson learned in china was importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore therefore in april 1941 ijn formed first air fleet to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command on 10 april 1941 kaga was assigned to first carrier division with akagi as part of new carrier fleet which also included second and fifth carrier divisions ijn centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined air groups within carrier divisions rather than each individual carrier when more than one carrier division was operating together divisions air groups were combined with each other this doctrine of combined massed carrier air attack groups was most advanced of its kind of all world s navies ijn however remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike thus ijn developed a compromise solution in which fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations with approximately separating
