elisenberg station is an unfinished railway station within oslo tunnel on drammen line in oslo norway ghost station was partially built during construction of tunnel between 1971 and 1980 but has never been put into use it is located between nationaltheatret station and skoyen station at elisenberg in frogner a long center platform and part of access way has been built but never completed while station initially was not put into use because of lack of funds to complete it it is now unlikely that it will ever be completed as need for a station has disappeared and an opening would need a large investment of funds toc facilities elisenberg is located approximately halfway between nationaltheatret station and skoyen station in oslo tunnel of drammen line it is located under gate near tram stop with same name all that has been built at elisenberg station is centre platform which is long and wide and a passageway across south track tracks lay below surface plans called for a two track station which would be connected to surface via elevators at ground level there would have been a vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales main entrance was to be from with a secondary entrance from street junction history planning of oslo tunnel was officially initiated in 1938 as a way to connect drammen line to oslo east station oslo o now oslo central station oslo s station committee of 1938 led by axel grenholm recommended a route that would branch off from existing line close to then terminal station of oslo west station oslo v another committee led by oddvar halvorsen was established in 1960 to look at matter again it stated that tunnel should be longer and intersect with drammen line at a point between skarpsno and skoyen and with a second station built at frogner proposal was presented to parliament on 4 november 1961 along with several other matters related to rail transport investments construction of oslo tunnel and elisenberg station was passed unanimously a planning office was established in 1962 initially led by erik himle final plans for route were passed by parliament in 1968 and construction started in 1971 rationale for building of station was that frogner was to be developed as a dense commercial district however to cut costs with oslo tunnel it was decided that parts of nationaltheatret would not be built yet and that elisenberg station would not open until after tunnel was completed by 1978 platform area had been built but access way had not investments cost 30 million norwegian krone nok 75 mill of 1998 standard oslo tunnel opened without elisenberg station on 1 june 1980 during mid 1980s plans for elisenberg were again considered after an initiative by prime minister kare who had been stuck in traffic congestion at frogner at time cost estimate to open station was nok 105 million rail administration planned instead to build an additional western entrance to nationaltheatret station located near roundabout between parkveien and henrik ibsens gate then drammensveien which would only cost 40 million nok thumb left many feared that south western corner of palace park named queen s park would vanish this entrance was expected to replace need for elisenberg station and was located in middle of oslo tunnel between nationaltheatret and skoyen oslo byes vel and conservative red and centre parties opposed construction of entrance arguing that it would ruin south western corner of palace park conservative party proposed building it further south across henrik ibsens gate either in hansteens gate or in parkveien near oslo commerce school while others wanted to open elisenberg station for traffic however by then it had become clear that frogner west of solli plass would remain dominantly a residential area estimates showed that station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for a small minority of those who used nationaltheatret station and skoyen station with upgraded nationaltheatret station which opened in 1999 capacity of oslo tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction because station from then had four rather than two tracks a similar upgrade would need to be done for elisenberg station should it be taken into use or capacity of tunnel would again be reduced it is therefore highly unlikely that station will ever be opened in 1998 readers of norwegian newspaper aftenposten proposed making elisenberg an emergency exit in 2008 one hundred million nok were given from state budget of norway to make improvements to oslo tunnel following a cable fire at skoyen station replacement of overhead wires would be started close to elisenberg station references bibliography category railway stations on drammen line category railway stations in oslo category disused railway stations in norway category railway stations located underground in norway
