with his imprisonment and his first line being i know a way out of here in may 2005 producers mentioned possibility of following extinction with a sequel entitled afterlife to be shot and set in tokyo japan and alaska despite resident evil extinction being billed on official website and elsewhere as final installment of resident evil film series on september 23 2007 rory sony s head of distribution explained it absolutely would not surprise me considering success of franchise that they find a way to come up with another it s a real possibility producer jeremy bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film that third had been particularly well done and that paul anderson was talking with sony about possibility in june 2008 anderson noted that negotiations were underway with sony for creating film in december 2008 anderson stated that he was working on script following year it was announced that sony was aiming to release resident evil afterlife by august 27 2010 casting thumb 175px left boris kodjoe trained for six weeks to perform his own stunts he dislocated his knee in course of filming while trying to kick in a gate in september 2006 reports indicated that casting for fourth film had begun with jensen ackles being considered for role of leon s kennedy ali larter missed seven episodes of filming television show heroes in order to appear in film before wentworth miller was cast as chris redfield actor johnny messner auditioned for role having never played resident evil video games miller began preparing for role by searching internet for images of chris redfield much to his surprise he noticed how muscular character was with only three weeks to prep before shooting he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent he was shown video footage of games and saw how he was visually different especially in first game he did cardio to build up endurance miller described his interpretation on character from video game as he s definitely capable and heroic but there s also something quite innocent he was still freshly scrubbed in a way at beginning of this horrifying journey he described his take as character in film my chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time edges are sharper and they re way more jagged shawn roberts was originally going to audition for chris redfield before miller accepted role he went to audition for role of albert wesker a role previously played by jason o mara describing character roberts said he s chairman of umbrella corporation he is in a position of power he pretty much runs world and alice is an annoyance it s a whole process i get to set and wardrobe gives me this big long black jacket and props comes over and gives me dark glasses and gloves by time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter you walk a little differently he s got everything going for him he s super fast super strong has ability to regenerate it s all elements from game that was one thing we all agreed on from start this character has to be for fans sienna guillory reprises her role as jill valentine who was last seen in resident evil apocalypse she is featured briefly in a scene shown during credits setting up sequel cinematography and set design anderson was shown footage of james cameron s avatar which sold him on idea to shoot resident evil afterlife in digital 3d he shot in high definition with an aspect ratio of 2 35 1 using cameron s fusion camera system or more specifically a sony f35 camera crew spent two weeks in pre production learning 3d camera system with a budget of about 60 million principal photography took place for 55 days from september 29 2009 to december filming in 3d added 20 to budget roberts began filming his scenes on october 10 2009 final showdown scene was filmed for about six days during production jovovich accidentally shot out a 100 000 camera thumb right robarts library s exterior was used to portray prison thumb right leslie dan faculty of pharmacy was used to portray umbrella corporation s underground tokyo headquarters anderson said it had a fantastic atrium that had these huge floating pill shapes in it inside pills were conference rooms we shot at night so there was no ambient light coming into glass and then with visual effects replaced glass with concrete walls for slow motion scenes like with bullets and drops of water twin phantom high speed cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second a fight scene with wesker and chris in resident evil 5 game was recreated shot by shot for film and phantom cameras were used to create wesker s superhuman speed which took about two days to film added size and weight of 3d cameras meant filmmakers were not able to use existing equipment such as steadicam rigs instead camera operator worked on a segway to achieve look of a steadicam shot much of action scenes were shot in front of a green screen a 1983 yak 52 was used throughout film by jovovich and larter stunt pilot martin mattes was dressed like jovovich and flew plane for camera 3d cameras were unable to pick up anything shiny such as stainless steel due to a flare set decorator cal loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom 3d cameras which are slow to pick up information loucks said it s a very restrictive color palette for example in this warehouse scene we saturated floors in a dark dark charcoal and we thought that was enough but then cameras showed them as still being too light so we had to add more and more black reason i say it s too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before filming locations principal photography was done mostly at cinespace film studios in toronto ontario toronto police received hundreds of calls from concerned neighbors after a scene involving a burning plane crashed for underwater scenes cargo shipping containers were cut and welded to make a giant tank on stage opening scene was filmed at cinespace film studios interior scenes of umbrella corporation s subterranean lair were filmed at leslie dan faculty of pharmacy robarts library was used to portray exterior shots of a los angeles prison due to its resemblance to a prison and other scenes were shot at university of toronto scarborough scenes portraying an alaskan aircraft boneyard were actually filmed at oshawa airport a location depicting an alaskan beach was filmed at sandbanks provincial park second unit was sent to alaska to capture establishing shots of scenery visual and special effects visual effects were done by rocket science vfx and mr x inc paul jones served as special effects creator who previously designed nemesis character in resident evil apocalypse production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once but time restraints prevented that around 150 zombies were eventually used and mr x inc s visual effects supervisor dennis added more in post production for alice s clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of jovovich for wide shots they took digital photo doubles visual effects production manager eric robertson described look of film interesting contrasts pure whites which is a staggering look it s so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of silent hill so we ve got extremes but it s definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it s been fun to see those looks a burned cityscape with ash and smoke in sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic los angeles in which most of film is set bolt described this approach as in a world that has gone to hell in a there s no control and no fire service so clearly what s going to happen to la is it s going to get burned infected dobermans from games and previous films return but are more advanced dogs wore a costume with prosthetics anderson wanted to make dogs in this film look absolutely terrible computer effects were used to make dog s jaw flare open with tentacles coming out of their mouths similar to dogs from fourth and fifth video games other creatures borrowed from fifth video game are majini who are more intelligent and have mandibles and tentacles coming out of their mouths and executioner named axeman in film release thumb right milla jovovich speaking at wondercon 2010 about film in august 2009 it was announced that film would be

response resident evil afterlife was not screened in advance for critics review aggregator rotten tomatoes gives film a score of 23 based on reviews of 95 critics with a rating average of 4 1 out of 10 site s consensus states as dim witted and lifeless as its undead antagonists resident evil afterlife is a wholly unnecessary addition to franchise metacritic which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics film received an average score of 37 based on 14 reviews indicating generally reviews cinemascore polls reported that average grade moviegoers gave film was a b on an a to f scale michael ordona of los angeles times gave it a positive review noting slower cut of film and saying action is easier to read than in most films of genre and therefore more enjoyable anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for stereoscopic buck phelim o neill of guardian gave film two stars out of five praising use of 3d while stating that resident evil films always look good and have well staged action but they don t have one iota of originality or imagination chicago readers andrea gronvall described plot as nearly indiscernible but did call film so far thanks to 3d and star milla jovovich s body hugging catsuit jeannette catsoulis of new york times gave film a negative review saying cannibalizing john carpenter s thing and much of sci fi horror canon afterlife is more moribund than its thronging undead david edwards of daily mirror compared it to resident evil extinction stating that results are even less impressive which is saying quite something and only fans of series will care with film looking suspiciously like a series of barely connected action scenes and unimpressive 3d welded to a who hell cares plot spill com critics korey coleman and co host 3000 gave film a some ol bullshit second lowest rating on site they criticized overuse of slow motion lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action but gave film points for its cinematography small bits of action 3d and special effects of axeman andrew barker of variety compared film to previous installment as equally moribund and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative he compared roberts wesker to hugo weaving s agent smith from matrix calling it a slipshod impression a particularly scathing review came from brian orndorf of dark horizons who commented perhaps first 3d motion picture to simulate experience of watching paint dry resident evil afterlife is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to
