symbol represents female sex alt a lesbian is a homosexual woman zimmerman p 453 word lesbian is also used for women in relation to their sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same sex attraction concept of lesbian to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation evolved in 20th century throughout history women have not had same freedom or independence as men to pursue homosexual relationships but neither have they met same harsh punishment as homosexual men in some societies instead lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless unless a participant attempts to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men as a result little in history was documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality was expressed when early sexologists in late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior hampered by a lack of knowledge about homosexuality or women s sexuality they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female gender roles and incorrectly designated them mentally ill a designation which has been reversed in global scientific community women in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in europe and united states following world war ii during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families with second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women s history and sexuality in 20th century definition of lesbian broadened sparking a debate about sexual desire as major component to define what a lesbian is some women who engage in same sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well while other women s self identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior sexual identity is not necessarily same as one s sexual orientation or sexual behavior due to various reasons such as fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting portrayals of lesbians in media suggest that society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles as well as fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity as homosexuals they are unified by discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families friends and others as a result of homophobia as women they face concerns separate from men lesbians may encounter

societies in categorizing behavior that indicated what was referred to as inversion by german sexologist magnus hirschfeld researchers categorized what was normal sexual behavior for men and women and therefore to what extent men and women varied from perfect male sexual type and perfect female sexual type aldrich p 168 far less literature focused on female homosexual behavior than on male homosexuality as medical professionals did not consider it a significant problem in some cases it was not acknowledged to exist however sexologists richard von krafft ebing from germany and britain s havelock ellis wrote some of earliest and more enduring categorizations of female same sex attraction approaching it as a form of insanity ellis categorization of lesbianism as a medical problem is now discredited faderman 1981 p 241 krafft ebing who considered lesbianism what he termed a neurological disease and ellis who was influenced by krafft ebing s writings disagreed about whether sexual inversion was generally a lifelong condition ellis believed that many women who professed love for other women changed their feelings about such relationships after they had experienced marriage and a practical life faderman 1981 p 242 however ellis conceded that there were true inverts who would spend their lives pursuing erotic relationships with women these were members of third sex who rejected roles of women to be subservient feminine and domestic faderman 1981 p 240 invert described opposite gender roles and also related attraction to women instead of men since women in victorian period were considered unable to initiate sexual encounters women who did so with other women were thought of as possessing masculine sexual desires jennings p 77 work of krafft ebing and ellis was widely read and helped to create public consciousness of female homosexuality in germany between 1898 and 1908 over a thousand articles were published regarding topic of homosexuality faderman 1981 p 248

by homosexual men it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor should be considered a criminal vice as was widely acknowledged in absence of any other material to describe their emotions

define a lesbian or lesbian relationship continues to be debated according to feminist writer naomi mccormick women s sexuality is constructed by men whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women same indicator is not necessary to identify a woman as heterosexual however mccormick states that emotional mental and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than genital mccormick pp 60 61 nonetheless in 1980s a significant movement rejected of lesbianism by cultural feminists causing a heated controversy called feminist

couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples calling this lesbian bed death however lesbians dispute study s definition of sexual contact and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian

heterosexuality is an innate quality in all people when a woman realizes her romantic and sexual attraction to another woman it may cause an existential crisis many who go through this adopt identity of a lesbian challenging what society has offered in stereotypes about homosexuals to learn how to function within a homosexual subculture schlager p 93 lesbians in western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity they have a shared history and subculture and similar experiences with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles this identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women and often creates tension with bisexual women one point of contention are lesbians who have had sex with men while lesbians who have never had sex with men may be referred to as gold star lesbians those who have had sex with men may face ridicule from other lesbians or identity challenges with regard to defining what it means to be a lesbian researchers including social scientists state that often behavior and identity do not match women may label themselves heterosexual but have sexual relations with women self identified lesbians may have sex with men or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time a 2001 article on differentiating lesbians for medical studies and health

measurable health or psychosocial issues brogan donna frank erica elon lisa o hanlon katherine january 2001 methodological concerns in defining lesbian for health research epidemiology 12 1 pp 109 113

behavior women who self identify as lesbian i e identity and women whose sexual preference is for women i e desire or attraction and that t he lack of a standard definition of lesbian and of standard questions to assess who is lesbian has made it difficult to clearly define a population of lesbian women how and where study samples were obtained can also affect definition female homosexuality without identity in western culture general varied meanings of lesbian since early 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before wide usage of word was defined by erotic proclivities discussion from historians caused further questioning of what qualifies as a lesbian relationship as lesbian feminists asserted a sexual component was unnecessary in declaring oneself a lesbian if primary and closest relationships were with women when considering past relationships within appropriate historic context there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions rothblum pp 4 7 in 1989 an academic cohort named lesbian history group wrote because of society s reluctance to admit that lesbians exist a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use label evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here a woman who never married who lived with another woman whose friends were mostly women or who moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles may well have been a lesbian but this sort of evidence is not proof what our critics want is incontrovertible evidence of sexual activity between women this is almost impossible to find norton p 184 female sexuality is often not adequately represented in texts and documents until very recently much of what has been documented about women s sexuality has been written by men in context of male understanding and relevant to women s associations to men as their wives daughters or mothers for example rabinowitz p 2 often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were ancient greece and rome history is often analyzed with contemporary ideologies ancient greece as a subject enjoyed popularity by ruling class in britain during 19th century based on their social priorities british scholars interpreted ancient greece as a westernized white and masculine society and essentially removed women from historical importance rabinowitz p 11 women in greece were sequestered with each other and men with men in this homosocial environment erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature art and philosophy hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women there is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls poet used term as feminine form of which was official term for younger participant in a pederastic relationship bremmer pp 27 28 aristophanes in plato s symposium mentions women who love women but uses term to be focused on instead of eros which was applied to other erotic relationships between men and between men and women aldrich p 47 historian nancy rabinowitz argues that ancient greek red vase images portraying women with their arms around another woman s waist or leaning on a woman s shoulders can be construed as expressions of romantic desire rabinowitz p 115 much of daily lives of women in ancient greece is unknown specifically their expressions of sexuality although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met women who appear on greek pottery are depicted with affection and in instances where women appear only with other women their images are eroticized bathing touching one another with dildos placed in and around such scenes and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction whether this eroticism is for viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown rabinowitz p 148 women in ancient rome were similarly subject to men s definitions of sexuality modern scholarship indicates that men viewed female homosexuality with hostility they considered women who engaged in sexual relations with other women to be biological oddities that would attempt to penetrate women and sometimes men with monstrously enlarged verstraete p 238 according to scholar james lesbianism challenged not only roman male s view of himself as exclusive giver of sexual pleasure but also most basic foundations of rome s male dominated culture no historical documentation exists of women who had other women as sex partners verstraete pp 239 240 early modern europe thumb upright lesbianism and

response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history whereas sodomy between men men and women and men and animals was punishable by death in britain acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in france in 1270 norton p 191 in spain italy and holy

carlini was documented to have seduced many of her sisters when possessed by a divine spirit named to end her relationships with other women she was placed in solitary confinement for last 40 years of her life norton p 190 female homoeroticism however was so common in english literature and theater that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during renaissance jennings p 1 ideas about women s sexuality were linked to contemporary understanding of female physiology vagina was considered an inward version of penis where nature s perfection created a man often nature was thought to be trying to right itself by vagina to form a penis in some women jennings p 12 these sex changes were later thought to be cases of hermaphrodites and hermaphroditism became synonymous with female same sex desire medical consideration of hermaphroditism depended upon measurements of clitoris a longer engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women penetration was focus of concern in all sexual acts and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a literally one who rubs jennings pp 14 16 not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate but pamphlets warning women about masturbation leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales for a while masturbation and lesbian sex carried same meaning aldrich p 129 class distinction however became linked as fashion of female homoeroticism passed were simultaneously considered members of lower class trying to ruin virtuous women and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals or more often their wives engaged in

excused because of her noble birth she was brought up as a male and there was speculation at time that she was a hermaphrodite even after christina abdicated throne in 1654 to avoid marriage she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women faderman pp 54 55 some historians view cases of cross dressing women to be manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire or their way of making sense out of their desire for women lillian faderman argues that western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles catharine linck and other women who were accused of using dildos such as two nuns in 16th century spain executed for using material instruments were punished more severely than those who did not two marriages

cascades down her back invisibility of lesbians has gradually eroded since early 1980s this is in part due to public figures who have caused speculation and comment in press about their sexuality and lesbianism in general primary figure earning this attention was martina navratilova who served as tabloid fodder for years as she denied being lesbian admitted to being bisexual had very public relationships with rita mae brown and judy nelson and acquired as much press about her sexuality as she did her athletic achievements navratilova spurred what scholar diane hamer termed constant

issues were significant concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in 1960s and 1970s custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers

lesbians and experienced racism homophobia and misogyny due to their many identities some scholars have noted that in past predominant lesbian community was largely composed of white women and influenced by american culture leading some lesbians of color to experience difficulties integrating into community at large many lesbians of color have stated that they were often systematically excluded from lesbian spaces based on fact that they are women of color additionally these women face a unique set of challenges within their respective racial communities many feel abandoned as communities of color often view homosexual identity as a white lifestyle and see acceptance of homosexuality as a setback in achieving equality lesbians of color especially those of immigrant populations often hold sentiment that their sexual orientation identity adversely affects assimilation into dominant culture historically women of color were often excluded from participating in lesbian and gay movements scholars have stated that this exclusion came as a result of majority of whites dismissing intersections of gender race and sexuality that are a core part of lesbian of color identity lesbians that organized events were mostly white and middle class and largely focused their political movements on issues of sexism and homophobia rather than class or race issues early lesbian feminist movement was criticized for excluding race and class issues from their spaces and for a lack of focus on issues that did not benefit white women audre lorde barbara smith and cherrie moraga are cited as major theorists within various lesbians of color movements for their insistence on inclusion and equality from both racial communities and white lesbian communities many intersections surrounding lesbians of color can often contribute to an increased need for mental health resources lesbians of color are more likely to experience a number of psychological issues due to various experiences of sexism racism and homophobia as a part of their existence mental health providers such as therapists often use heteronormative standards to gauge health of lesbian relationships and relationships of lesbian women of color are often subjects of judgment because they are seen as most deviant within racial communities decision to come out can be costly as threat of
