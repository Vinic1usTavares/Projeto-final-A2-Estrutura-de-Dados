union as an amateur sport for most of its history job of deciding tactics and running team trainings has often been that of captain or senior players therefore a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible although coached by jean desclaux between 1973 and 1980 french team s main influence during late 1970 was captain jacques fouroux fouroux played scrum half and captained france to their 1977 five nations grand slam during which france played a very forward oriented style of rugby dine 2001 pg 155 although style of fouroux s gang was successful it was criticised because it contrasted with traditional open attacking style of french rugby fouroux was given nickname little corporal same as napoleon bonaparte fouroux was named as desclaux s successor in 1981 at age of just 33 he continued to promote a forward oriented style of play and france won six five nations titles including two grand slams while he was coach after nearly ten years in role he resigned in 1990 after a

become secretary of state for sport after philippe saint andre turned down offer to replace laporte french rugby federation president bernard appointed marc lievremont to guide france to 2011 world cup lievremont s tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices and player discontent there were some bright moments notably wins against new zealand in dunedin and south africa in toulouse and 2010 six nations grand slam but there was also a 59 16 loss to australia in paris a 22 21 loss to italy in 2011 six nations and a 19 14 loss to tonga during 2011 world cup in august 2011 before world cup it was announced that philippe saint andre would replace lievremont and guide france to 2015 world cup this came as no surprise to lievremont as he had announced as early as may 2010 that he would not continue as coach of france after world cup france did not impress under saint andre finishing no higher than fourth in six nations during his tenure and even claiming wooden spoon in 2013 following 2015 six nations he announced his resignation effective after that year s world cup and was replaced by guy noves guy noves confirmed as next france head coach
