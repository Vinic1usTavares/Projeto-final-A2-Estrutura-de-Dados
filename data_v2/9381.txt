grayrigg derailment was a fatal railway accident that occurred at approximately 20 15 gmt on 23 february 2007 just to south of grayrigg cumbria in north west england region of united kingdom accident investigation concluded that derailment was caused by a faulty set of points number 2b on down main running line controlled from lambrigg ground frame scheduled inspection on 18 february 2007 had not taken place and faults had gone undetected incident 17 30 virgin west coast pendolino west coast main line intercity service from london euston to glasgow central derailed at 20 15 at a faulty set of points almost immediately after crossing docker viaduct rear half of train would still have been crossing bridge whilst front derailed at points train was reported to have been travelling at when it was derailed train consisted of unit city of glasgow which was constructed at heath birmingham in 2002 and nine carriages it carried 105 passengers and four crew thumb right docker viaduct carrying west coast main line just south of site of accident rear half of train would have been crossing bridge whilst front derailed at points immediately north of bridge passengers said that carriages of train began rocking and swaying violently as first coach left rails momentum of other vehicles caused front of second passenger carriage to jack knife against back of first coach eventually pushing it down embankment and through 190 degrees to face in opposite direction to travel resulting forces led to remaining seven coaches derailing with all but one coming to rest in adjacent field train was reported as being evacuated around midnight emergency crews scanned train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside up to 500 rescuers attended scene along with at least 12 ambulances at least five fire engines three royal air force sea king search and rescue helicopters international rescue corps three civilian mountain rescue teams plus raf leeming mountain rescue team and one merseyside police helicopter rescue operation was hindered by rain darkness and access problems caused by narrow country lanes and muddy fields emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud train s derailment caused severe damage to overhead line equipment and tripped entire circuit between brock near preston and resulting in a number of other electric powered services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger red in accordance with system s fail safe design live bbc television coverage at 08 15 following morning showed that although whole train had been derailed rear carriage was standing nearly vertical on sleepers and ballast standard class front five carriages were worst affected and rear four first class carriages were in better condition leading carriage a driving motor coach had headed down embankment and turned end for end as it fell it was lying on its side at foot of embankment second carriage had jack knifed against first breaking coupling and so had not followed it down bank this second carriage came to rest some distance further along track at a steep angle with one end in air middle part of train toppled sideways down embankment with a total of 5 carriages turning onto their sides all partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact with damage mainly confined to crumple zones at their ends none of windows broke and lighting remained in all carriages most injuries occurred in front two carriages driver who had stayed at controls but had little option to move once accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab other three members of crew were in rear first class section of train survivors were initially received at grayrigg primary school which had been opened as a survivor reception centre hospitals in area including some over scottish border in dumfries and galloway were put on standby but not all received patients according to bbc news five passengers were admitted to royal preston hospital in a critical condition police later released a statement revealing that one passenger 84 year old margaret masson from glasgow had died in hospital her funeral took place on 31 march 2007 at crematorium in glasgow 80 of people on train were injured to some extent with principal cause being secondary impacts hitting or being hit by objects interior of train or other passengers as carriage impacted ground or other carriages exceptions to this were that one passenger was ejected and one passenger was partially ejected through emergency exit egress windows as carriages came to a stop location of accident aftermath a family liaison centre was set up in glasgow central station for worried relatives within three hours of derailment site of accident had been sealed off with a five mile cordon line was expected to be closed for two weeks with virgin trains saying that line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 march 2007 recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to site which required temporary roads to be constructed sir richard branson virgin group chairman visited site of derailment at 11 00 following morning to comment on incident during his news conference at site he said that he regarded driver named as iain black from dumbarton as a hero as he had attempted to stop train and remained in his seat to ensure safety of passengers black left hospital in late march and stated that i ve got to be in cab to help train and it never crossed my mind to leave branson also later thanked local residents for their help at accident site describing how he was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress local farmers assisted emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four wheel drive vehicles sergeant jo fawcett of cumbria constabulary also offered thanks saying that there are so many people who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with aftermath of derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out branson also paid tribute to pendolino train comparing it to a tank he also added if train had been old stock then number of injuries and mortalities would have been horrendous several sources also gave their praise due to fact that carriages generally stayed intact during accident as a result of suspicion that faulty points were cause of grayrigg derailment network rail checked over 700 sets of similar points across country as a precautionary measure saying later that nothing of concern had been found operation to remove train from site began on evening of 1 march 2007 with first carriages moved from embankment this allowed passengers property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to train interior which previously had not been possible because it would have been unsafe last of carriages were removed on 4 march 2007 and road was reopened points which caused derailment and points 2a on opposite line were removed from track following derailment and line is now welded continuously for including line over docker viaduct derailment also brought down overhead line equipment which had to be replaced modern double line catenary from a single stand was used for this which reduces risk of carriages bending if a derailment occurs for example becoming wedged between overhead line stanchions as seen in southall crash in 2013 british transport police btp posthumously awarded a chief constable s commendation to a member of its staff jon ratcliffe who was at time of disaster media and marketing manager for btp s north western area he received commendation for his good handling of media enquires in aftermath of crash ratcliffe had died in 2008 following a sudden illness cause lambrigg ground frame south west of accident site controlled two crossovers each one comprising two sets of points allowing trains to cross from one running line to other in emergencies or during track maintenance work these points were used only occasionally operated locally after a release was obtained from carlisle power signal box they were normally locked in main line running position early statements by chief superintendent martyn ripley of british transport police suggested that investigations would focus on these points investigations were launched by rail accident investigation branch and her majesty s railway inspectorate rmt rail union leader bob crow said on bbc news that a points failure was responsible for incident experts compared cause to that of potters bar rail crash in 2002 on 26 february an interim report published by rail accident investigation branch outlined current progress of investigation note passenger numbers subsequently revised from 111 to 105 in final report report contained a single conclusion that immediate cause of accident was condition of stretcher bar arrangement at points 2b at lambrigg crossover which resulted in loss of gauge separation of point switch blades stretcher bars components that hold moving blades of points correct distance apart had been found to be disconnected or missing of three bars one was not in position another had nuts and bolts missing and two were fractured points in question were facing direction of travel of train following raib report network rail released a statement in which its chief executive john armitt described how organisation was devastated to conclude that condition of set of points at grayrigg caused this terrible accident he apologised to all people affected by failure of infrastructure raib report noted that network rail new measurement train ran over site on 21 february this train uses lasers and other instruments to make measurements of track geometry and other features such as overhead line height and stagger and track gauge twist and cant it is not used to inspect points but it does make a video record of track which can be reviewed later responding to suggestion that train s video might have been used to detect points damage and thereby prevent accident a network rail spokesman said inspection train runs at speeds of up to 125 mph or 95 mph on this stretch there would be no point somebody watching it at that speed as they wouldn t be able to pick up any faults it has to be run in super slow motion to spot faults train runs for up to 18 hours a day seven days a week it would probably take someone most of month to watch one day s worth of data it s not what it s there for it s a backwards reference tool network rail admitted it failed to carry out a scheduled visual track inspection in area on sunday before derailment bob crow of rmt union said this is shutting stable door after horse has well and truly bolted we argued this train should not replace visual inspections inspectors who walk track are eyes and ears of railway they don t just check safety of track they look at area surrounding it check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in fence where vandals could get in as part of investigation by british transport police three network rail employees were arrested and bailed one in july 2007 and two in november 2007 all three were due to answer bail in march 2008 but this was extended until end of june pending further inquiries on 9 february 2009 british transport police confirmed that none of three network rail employees arrested in connection with derailment would be charged following advice from crown prosecution service subsequent service disruption immediately after accident all services were suspended and first scotrail sleeper train caledonian sleeper was curtailed and passengers transferred to overnight coaches line closure that followed initial service suspension saw most virgin services terminate at preston or lancaster from south with buses to carlisle and all stations along route only exception was an early morning and late evening through service from carlisle to london and return this was diesel hauled via blackburn and settle there were also several non stop trains from preston to london euston local services all terminated short but many were able to make their journeys as their destinations were off branches caledonian sleeper was diverted via east coast main line along with freight services although some were diesel hauled via blackburn and settle trains began running on line again on 12 march subject to a speed restriction of at crash site first train was 05 10 manchester to glasgow prosecution on 13 january 2012 office of rail regulation announced that network rail was to be prosecuted under section 3 1 of health and safety at work act 1974 for company s failure to provide and implement suitable and sufficient standards procedures guidance training tools and resources for inspection and maintenance of fixed stretcher bar points at first hearing at lancaster magistrates court on 28 february 2012 network rail indicated an intention to plead guilty to charges on 4 april 2012 network rail was fined a total of ps4 118 037 including costs following court case critical commentary appeared in media concerning knighthood awarded to john armitt in 2012 new year honours for services to engineering and construction armitt had been chief executive of network rail at time of grayrigg derailment and family of a victim of accident criticised award which coincidentally was conferred on same day that network rail was prosecuted for accident after a two week hearing one of issues coroner ian smith announced was that he would be issuing a rule 43 report intention of report is to raise concerns with authorities to prevent similar incidents occurring
