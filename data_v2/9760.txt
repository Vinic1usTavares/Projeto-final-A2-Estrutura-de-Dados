old bridge which is now also known as william edwards bridge or pontypridd bridge was originally known as new bridge or newbridge is an arched single span footbridge that spans river taff at pontypridd in wales bridge was built by william edwards and was completed in 1756 bridge now has statutory protection as a scheduled ancient monument and is grade i listed pontypridd in early 18th century pontypridd then known as pont y ty pridd bridge of earthen house was a tiny hamlet pont y ty pridd took its name from original bridge of same name however very little is known of that ancient ford with stepping stones which ran alongside current old bridge and was used only when river ran low possibly in 1744 or after bridge was built pont y ty pridd became known as newbridge or new bridge after william edwards bridge by 1856 newbridge had been renamed pontypridd in 1746 when william edwards was just 27 years of age he was commissioned by hundreds of miskin and caerphilly to build a three arch bridge across river taff for this he was paid on condition that he would maintain it for seven years construction first bridge first bridge to be constructed was a three arch stone bridge which was built in 1746 it was destroyed by a heavy storm which caused river taff to flood about two years later a large amount of debris came down river which then become trapped against two abutments supporting bridge weight and force of debris ultimately destroyed bridge which was then swept away down river second bridge after destruction of first bridge over fast flowing river taff edwards designed a more radical single arch bridge that would eliminate possibility of debris destroying bridge due to flooding of river taff second bridge was built from 1748 however two reports differ as to what actually happened during this second attempt thomas morgan a contemporary of edwards said that when he edwards had almost finished arch centre timber work gave way and all fell to bottom however national library of wales has a contemporary work known as manuscript which says just after first single arch was finished and before centre was struck a flood came and carried all away it is not clear which account is accurate however it is clear that edwards latest attempt to build a bridge across river taff had failed third bridge single arch bridge was rebuilt and was completed it stood for about six weeks before it failed again weight of materials in bridge was not balanced on either side of keystone which gradually forced stone out of position as traffic on bridge created small vibrations and movement and bridge collapsed in theory of arches and pontypridd it states that weight of bridge was either too great on haunches or too little on crown at this stage edwards was either encouraged or forced to try again with extra money being provided to cover his losses for earlier attempts fourth bridge thumb old bridge when it was known as newbridge final design of bridge included three cylindrical voids holes of and on each side on bridge this reduced weight and pressure on crown and bridge is still in operation today although it is now only used for foot traffic theory of arches and pontypridd states that as a bridge for commerce it was a failure as it was only eleven feet wide between parapets and so steep that wagons had to use a chain and drag to descend from crown thumb left bridge in january 2016 with victoria bridge in background 140 ft old bridge surpassed old walton bridge as longest single span bridge in great britain and remained longest bridge for another 40 years pp 217 218 it was also one of few bridges in europe at time and indeed worldwide whose span exceeded 40 m mark whole project including three failed attempts cost edwards a total of ps1 153 18s 2d approximately ps1 153 91 and consequently his loss exceeded ps600 it was reported that edwards attempts to build bridge over river taff left him in considerable debt thomas morgan reported that mason was considerably in debt and greatly discouraged but lords talbot and windsor who have estates in neighbourhood his case and being willing to encourage such an enterprising genius most generously promoted a subscription among gentry in those parts subsequent history thumb old bridge with steps ascending bridge old bridge was so steep that horse carts had difficulty crossing it by 1857 a new bridge victoria bridge was built next to old bridge which was paid for by people of pontypridd victoria bridge is a three arch bridge built by thomas jenkins that did not have a problem with roadway steepness since bridge was opened in 1756 it has been subject for many landscape artists including richard wilson and turner old bridge is now a scheduled monument and is also depicted in
