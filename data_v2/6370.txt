a pitot static system is a system of pressure sensitive instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft s airspeed mach number altitude and altitude trend a pitot static system generally consists of a pitot tube a static port and pitot static instruments other instruments that might be connected are air data computers flight data recorders altitude encoders cabin pressurization controllers and various airspeed switches errors in pitot static system readings can be extremely dangerous as information obtained from pitot static system such as altitude is potentially safety critical several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of pitot static system right thumb 350px diagram of a pitot static system including pitot tube pitot

airliner pitot static system of instruments uses principle of air pressure gradient it works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess speed and altitude these pressures can be measured either from static port static pressure or pitot tube pitot pressure static pressure is used in all measurements while pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed pitot pressure pitot pressure is obtained from pitot tube pitot pressure is a measure of ram air pressure air pressure created by vehicle motion or air ramming into tube which under ideal conditions is equal to stagnation pressure also called total pressure pitot tube is most often located on wing or front section of an aircraft facing forward where its opening is exposed to relative wind by situating pitot tube in such a location ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by aircraft s structure when airspeed increases ram air pressure is increased which can be translated by airspeed indicator static pressure static pressure is obtained through a static port static port is most often a flush mounted hole on fuselage of an aircraft and is located where it can access air flow in a relatively undisturbed area some aircraft may have a single static port while others may have more than one in situations where an aircraft has more than one static port there is usually one located on each side of fuselage with this positioning an average pressure can be taken which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations an alternative static port may be located inside cabin of aircraft as a backup for when external static port s are blocked a pitot static tube effectively integrates static ports into pitot probe it incorporates a second coaxial tube or tubes with pressure sampling holes on sides of probe outside direct airflow to measure static pressure when aircraft climbs static pressure will decrease multiple pressure some pitot static systems incorporate single probes that contain multiple pressure transmitting ports that allow for sensing of air pressure angle of attack and angle of sideslip data depending on design such air data probes may be referred to as 5 hole or 7 hole air data probes differential pressure sensing techniques can be used to produce angle of attack and angle of sideslip indications pitot static instrument right thumb airspeed indicator diagram showing pressure sources from both pitot tube and static port pitot static system obtains pressures for interpretation by pitot static instruments while explanations below explain traditional mechanical instruments many modern aircraft use an air data computer adc to calculate airspeed rate of climb altitude and mach number in some aircraft two receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports and aircraft s flight data computer compares information from both computers and checks one against other there are also standby instruments which are back up pneumatic instruments employed in case of problems with primary instruments airspeed indicator airspeed indicator is connected to both pitot and static pressure sources difference between pitot pressure and static pressure is called dynamic pressure greater dynamic pressure higher airspeed reported a traditional mechanical airspeed indicator contains a pressure diaphragm that is connected to pitot tube case around diaphragm is airtight and is vented to static port higher speed higher ram pressure more pressure exerted on diaphragm and larger needle movement through mechanical linkage right thumb aneroid wafer of an altimeter altimeter pressure altimeter also known as barometric altimeter is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as aircraft s altitude changes pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register pressure as an altitude above sea level instrument case of altimeter is airtight and has a vent to static port inside instrument there is a sealed aneroid barometer as pressure in case decreases internal barometer expands which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes machmeter aircraft designed to operate at transonic or supersonic speeds will incorporate a machmeter machmeter is used to show ratio of true airspeed in relation to speed of sound most supersonic aircraft are limited as to maximum mach number they can fly which is known as mach limit mach number is displayed on a machmeter as a decimal fraction right thumb a vertical speed indicator vertical speed indicator also known as vertical speed indicator vsi or vertical velocity indicator vvi is pitot static instrument used to determine whether or not an aircraft is flying in level flight vertical speed specifically shows rate of climb or rate of descent which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within instrument area surrounding diaphragm is vented to static port through a calibrated leak which also may be known as a restricted diffuser when aircraft begins to increase altitude diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of calibrated leak causing needle to show a positive vertical speed reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending calibrated leak varies from model to model but average time for diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds pitot static errors there are several situations that can affect accuracy of pitot static instruments some of these involve failures of pitot static system itself which may be classified as system malfunctions while others are result of faulty instrument placement or other environmental factors which may be classified as inherent errors system malfunctions blocked pitot tube a blocked pitot tube is a pitot static problem that will only affect airspeed indicators a blocked pitot tube will cause airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when aircraft climbs even though actual airspeed is constant as long as drain hole is also blocked as air pressure would otherwise leak out to atmosphere this is caused by pressure in pitot system remaining constant when atmospheric pressure and static pressure are decreasing in reverse airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when aircraft descends pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice water insects or some other obstruction for this reason aviation regulatory agencies such as u s federal aviation administration faa recommend that pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight to prevent icing many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element a heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as experimental amateur built blocked static port a blocked static port is a more serious situation because it affects all pitot static instruments one of most common causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing a blocked static port will cause altimeter to freeze at a constant value altitude at which static port became blocked vertical speed indicator will read zero and will not change at all even if vertical speed increases or decreases airspeed indicator will reverse error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause airspeed to be read less than it actually is as aircraft climbs when aircraft is descending airspeed will be over reported in most aircraft with unpressurized cabins an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within cockpit inherent errors inherent errors may fall into several categories each affecting different instruments density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude this type of error is caused by variations of pressure and temperature in atmosphere a compressibility error can arise because impact pressure will cause air to compress in pitot tube at standard sea level pressure altitude calibration equation see calibrated airspeed correctly accounts for compression so there is no compressibility error at sea level at higher altitudes compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed a correction may be obtained from a chart compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above and at airspeeds greater than hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of aneroid capsules located within instruments these capsules used to determine pressure differences have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape even though external forces may have changed reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading this false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft s pitch a large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in opposite direction reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators position errors another class of inherent errors is that of position error a position error is produced by aircraft s static pressure being different from air pressure remote from aircraft this error is caused by air flowing past static port at a speed different from aircraft s true airspeed position errors may provide positive or negative errors depending on one of several factors these factors include airspeed angle of attack aircraft weight acceleration aircraft configuration and in case of helicopters rotor downwash there are two categories of position errors which are fixed errors and variable errors fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing flow of air or particular situations which may aircraft lag errors lag errors are caused by fact that any changes in static or dynamic pressure outside aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down tubing and affect gauges this type of error depends on length and diameter of tubing as well as volume inside gauges william 1981 measurement of aircraft speed and altitude new york john wiley sons p 8 lag error is only significant around time when airspeed or altitude are changing it is not a concern for steady level flight pitot static related disasters 1 december 1974 northwest airlines flight 6231 a boeing 727 crashed northwest of john f kennedy international airport during climb
