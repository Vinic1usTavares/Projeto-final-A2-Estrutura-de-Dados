style a lot of moving camera and crane work lots of very fast cutting he s got a very cool eye and sees great ways to shoot his work certainly had a big influence on me as a filmmaker and that s why i was very excited to work with him on this movie casting thumb left 150px ali larter portrayed claire redfield a character that originated from video game series on june 12 2005 milla jovovich was announced to reprise her role as heroine alice in an interview with blackfilm com on september 9 2005 mike epps confirmed that he would be reprising his role from resident evil apocalypse as l j wayne

rumored to appear in film portrayed by australian actor charlie clausen and leon s kennedy was also rumored to be played by jensen ackles story development film s story takes place in death valley where large scale action sequences take place amid post apocalyptic landscapes of las vegas in broad daylight drawing inspirations from western films and post apocalyptic movies including mad max series extinction manages to reference such predecessors with plot elements revolving around shortage of oil shortage of supplies a convoy traveling across a desert and desert taking over civilized land anderson stated that film s story is original and unfolds in a world that fans of game recognize it s all part of trying to deliver a movie going experience that satisfies fans of game but also provides a fun cinematic experience for a broader audience that has never played a resident evil game story takes place five years after events of resident evil apocalypse while previous installments in series had minor changes to plot and characters extinction branches completely away from video game series as evidenced by fact that resident evil 4 takes place six years after events portrayed in resident evil 2 and world has not become overrun with zombies references to code veronica are made such as replica mansion and viral outbreak itself a common element used throughout each resident evil film is climactic battle which occurs in finale extinction marked first appearance of herbs a healing item in video game series as seen in dr isaac s lab and it also referenced first film with inclusion of a replica hive facility designed after one in raccoon city raccoon city hospital a holographic computer database known as white queen and replica spencer mansion numerous references to video game series have been made including zombies being unleashed through a t virus mutation while concept of undead remains same this film includes super undead as anderson explains these are a result of umbrella experimenting with undead and attempting to give them back some of their reasoning power some of their intelligence and a little of their humanity unfortunately these experiments don t quite work and side effect is super undead which are undead that are faster stronger and a more cunning foe other creatures from video game series have also made appearances in film including tyrant a swarm of crows and a pack of dobermans although belgian shepherd dogs were used during production two main characters were added to film s cast albert wesker portrayed by jason o mara and claire redfield portrayed by ali larter from resident evil 2 horror magazine fangoria featured film in its august 2007 issue and also on cover of its september 2007 issue talking with director russell mulcahy following details reported were inaccurate possibly indicating to a change in storyline alice s convoy are traveling across nevada desert trying to reach sanctuary in alaska to meet chris redfield and other survivors in film however there is no mention of chris and convoy is headed by claire film would feature new super zombies that had been pumped up on some sort of alter essence steroids final super zombies are created using blood taken from clones of alice mulcahy stated concerning what was then considered to be ending of film trilogy as far as i m aware this is indeed supposed to close book resident evil extinction takes place eight years after resident evil apocalypse in film this was contradicted when characters stated that it had been five years since outbreak character of claire redfield did not exist in early draft scripts for film and previously jill valentine who appeared in resident evil apocalypse played by sienna guillory would continue role in resident evil extinction later producers paul w s anderson and jeremy bolt decided to have a separate game character appear alongside alice saying we thought rather than bring jill back put her with another game heroine filming and post production resident evil extinction began principal photography in mexicali baja california mexico in may 2006 after filming locations had to be changed from

b on scale of a to f steven hyden of onion s a v club said that movie delivers some simple minded thrills and praised solidly effective killer ravens sequence but felt film was too predictable saying anybody who has ever seen a zombie movie can figure out what happens next somebody will get bit without telling others which will inevitably backfire survivors will be forced to shoot suddenly undead friends in head one of them dastardly science folk will protect monsters in order to study them which will also inevitably backfire and legions of undead will be re killed in surprisingly easy fashion kevin crust of los angeles times praised film saying that story and characters are surprisingly engaging with fight scenes and scares effectively placed between plot turns although he felt that ending was too open ended ref resident evil extinction review http articles latimes com 2007 sep 24 entertainment et ref kyle smith of new york post gave extinction half a star out of a possible four saying
