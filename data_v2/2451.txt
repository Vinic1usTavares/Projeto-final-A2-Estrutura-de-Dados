sit writing along with a large jewelled sceptre and cushion court of chancery in reign of george i court of chancery was a court of equity in england and wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid slow pace of change and possible harshness or inequity of common law chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity including trusts land law estates of lunatics and guardianship of infants its initial role was somewhat different as an extension of lord chancellor s role as keeper of king s conscience court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law thus court of chancery had a far greater remit than common law courts whose decisions it had jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence and was far more flexible until 19th century court of chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than common law courts such as specific performance and injunctions and had some power to grant damages in special circumstances with shift of exchequer of pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by administration of justice act 1841 chancery became only national equitable body in english legal system academics estimate that court of chancery formally split from and became independent of curia regis in mid 14th century at which time it consisted of lord chancellor and his personal staff chancery initially an administrative body with some judicial duties chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during 15th century particularly under house of york which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body from time of elizabeth i onwards court was severely criticised for its slow pace large backlogs and high costs those problems persisted until its dissolution despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms particularly during 19th century attempts at fusing chancery with common law courts began in 1850s and finally succeeded with 1873 and 1875 supreme court of judicature acts which dissolved chancery and created a new unified high court of justice with chancery division one of three divisions of high court succeeding court of chancery as an equitable body for much of its existence court was formally led by lord chancellor assisted by judges of common law courts staff of court included a large number of clerks led by master of rolls who regularly heard cases on his own in 1813 a vice chancellor was appointed to deal with chancery s increasing backlogs and two more were appointed in 1841 offices of chancery were sold by lord chancellor for much of its history raising large amounts of money many of clerks and other officials were sinecures who in lieu of wages charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases one of main reasons why cost of bringing a case to chancery was so high 19th century saw abolition of many sinecure offices and institution of a wage and pension for lord chancellor to curb sale of offices and later right to appoint officials was transferred from chancellor to crown history origins thumb right upright alt a pale brown haired man holding a sceptre and wearing a crown he is clothed in a black and robe over a white

council maintained by most early rulers of england after 1066 marsh 1890 p 6 under feudal system council was made up of monarch great officers of crown and anyone else monarch allowed to attend its jurisdiction was virtually unlimited with executive judicial and legislative functions carne 1927 p 391 this large body contained lawyers peers and members of church many of whom lived far from london it soon became apparent that it was too unwieldy to deal with nation s day to day business as a result a smaller curia was formed to deal with regular business of country and this soon split into various courts first exchequer of pleas to deal with finance and then court of common pleas to deal with common cases carne 1927 p 392 chancery started as personal staff of lord chancellor described as a great secretarial bureau a home office a foreign office and a ministry of justice carne 1927 p 400 earliest reference to legal issues being sent to him is from 1280 when edward i of england annoyed with number of cases coming to him which could have been dealt with by other elements of his administration passed a statute saying that all petitions that touch seal shall go first to chancellor and those that touch exchequer to exchequer and those that touch justices or law of land to justices and those that touch jurie to justices of jurie and if matters are so great or so much of grace that chancellor and others cannot do what is asked without king then they shall take them to king to know his will and that no petition come before king and his council except by hands of said chancellor and other chief ministers so that king and his council may be able without embarrassment of other business to attend to important business of his kingdom and his foreign lands parkes 1828 p 29 records show dozens of early cases being sent to lord chancellor and master of rolls but at time chancellor had no specific jurisdiction to deal with them cases were referred to him only as a matter of convenience kerly 1890 p 26 under edward ii chancellor dedicated set days to hearing pleas as documented in records of parliament of lincoln in 1315 which also show that some cases were heard by his personal staff chancery and not by chancellor kerly 1890 p 27 by 1320 requests were regularly sent there and heard by judges of common law courts with rules used to settle cases being those of law or reason sometimes simply reason a far more liberal and adjustable approach than common law kerly 1890 p 28 rise and early years chancery came to prominence after decline of exchequer dealing with law of equity something more fluid and adaptable than common law early court of chancery dealt with verbal contracts matters of land law and matters of trusts and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints poverty for example was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation carne 1927 p 403 complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition which had to show that common law did not provide a remedy for problem chancery writs were in french and later english rather than latin used for common law bills carne 1927 p 404 in reign of edward iii court found a fixed home at westminster hall where it sat almost continually until its dissolution kerly 1890 p 30 before this justice was difficult to dispose because lord chancellor had to travel with king wherever he went kerly 1890 p 31 thumb alt a very large room with a high vaulted ceiling mostly empty save for a few small groups of people westminster hall where court sat almost continuously from reign of edward iii until its dissolution in 1875 by 1345 lord chancellor began to be seen as leader of court of chancery rather than as a representative of king and writs and bills were addressed directly to him under richard ii it became practice to consider chancery separate from curia academic william carne considers this a key moment in confirming independence of court of chancery carne 1927 p 405 chancellor and his clerks often heard cases directly rather than having them referred to council itself occasionally a committee of lay and church members disposed of them assisted by judges of common law courts carne 1927 p 410 john baker argues that it was late 14th century that saw chancery procedure become fixed citing work done by john waltham as master of rolls between 1381 and 1386 and notes that this period also saw first complaints about chancery baker 2002 p 103 chancery and its growing powers soon came to be resented by parliament and nobility carne says that it is possible to trace a general trend of opposition during plantagenet period particularly from members of clergy who were more used to roman law than equity from reign of richard ii house of commons regularly complained about work of court and in 1390 it petitioned king to pronounce that court could not act contrary to common law nor annul a judgement without due process at same time it asked that no writ could be issued that would compel a man to appear before court if it was clerk who issued it would lose his job and lord chancellor would be fined ps100 king gave evasive answers to requests and made no decision carne 1927 p 413 commons did succeed in making some changes to court s procedure however in 1394 king assented to their request that victorious defendants in court have their costs recompensed from other side and in 1341 king on their application allowed lord chancellor to send cases directly to common law courts to avoid common law judges having to waste time travelling carne 1927 p 414 kerly suggests that many complaints from commons came from lawyers of common law aggrieved at chancery s extended jurisdiction that overlapped with that of common law kerly 1890 p 37 these complaints from commons did not prevent court from successfully functioning in 1393 for example it was considered prominent enough that house of lords sent two cases there to be dealt with kerly 1890 p 40 according to many academics court of chancery really began to expand its caseload during 15th century margaret avery reports a massive increase in cases during 1440s while nicholas suggests that real expansion came during yorkist rule 1461 85 when number of cases submitted each year quadrupled he gives complaints about perversion of justice in common law courts along with growing mercantile and commercial interests as main reason for growth arguing that this was period when chancery changed from being an administrative body with some judicial functions to one of four central courts of realm growth in number of cases is a primary indicator of changing position of chancery tucker 2000 p 792 this increasing role was assisted by changing function of court until late 14th century private parties could not bring cases to chancery as they could to other courts while by 15th century number of private cases had increased to point where there were many complaints in parliament tucker 2000 p 800 marsh writes that another reason for chancery s growing influence was remedies available through orders of specific performance and injunctions court could not only rectify previous wrongs but prevent future wrongs from occurring while common law courts were limited to awarding damages marsh 1890 p 46 chancery s role in development of standard english chancery english used in official documents can be seen as beginnings of standard freeborn from old english to standard english 2nd ed basingstoke palgrave 1998 orig publ 1992 p 250 a national standard of

who worked to maintain chancery s ability to override common law courts as lord chancellor early elizabethan period featured a dispute between court of chancery and common law courts over who held pre eminence it had been practice under henry vi that plaintiffs in common law courts could not execute judgments given by common law judges if lord chancellor felt their claim was against conscience this had been vehemently opposed by common law judges who felt that if lord chancellor had power to override their decisions parties to a case would flock to court of chancery kerly 1890 p 107 dispute over pre eminence of lord chancellor continued into elizabeth i s reign with judges increasing in strength lord chancellor was no longer a clergyman whom it was risky to offend while judges had grown in stature kerly 1890 p 108 sir edward coke cites in his reports a case at end of elizabeth s reign which seems to indicate that chancellor s prerogative had been overturned when judges without opposition from monarch allowed a claim to proceed despite lord chancellor s implied jurisdiction at same time common law judges ruled that chancery had no jurisdiction over matters of freehold kerly 1890 p 109 lord chancellor of time lord ellesmere was not dissuaded and maintained that he had jurisdiction to oversee decisions of common law courts and matters of freehold in 1614 he heard case of courtney v glanvil dictating that glanvil should be imprisoned for deceit this was over ruled by sir edward coke in court of king s bench who demanded that glanvil be released and issued a writ of habeas corpus kerly 1890 p 110 two years later earl of oxford s case came before ellesmere who issued a judgment that directly contradicted english law based on law of god kerly 1890 p 111 coke and other judges over ruled this judgment while ellesmere was ill taking case as an opportunity to completely overthrow lord chancellor s jurisdiction ellesmere appealed to monarch who referred matter to attorney general for prince of wales and francis bacon attorney general for england and wales both recommended a judgment in ellesmere s favour which monarch made saying as mercy and justice be true supports of our royal throne and it properly to our princely office to take care and provide that our subjects have equal and indifferent justice ministered to them and that when their case to be relieved in course of equity by suit in our court of chancery they should not be abandoned and exposed to perish under rigor and extremity of our laws we do approve and confirm as well practice of our court of chancery kerly 1890 p 114 coke s challenge to chancery is seen by academic duncan kerly as helping him lose his position as a judge and until its dissolution court of chancery could overrule judgments issued in common law courts this was not end of dispute however in his institutes of lawes of england coke suggested that monarch s decree was unlawful and his contemporary david jenkins wrote in eight centuries of reports that excess of jurisdiction in chancery in examining judgments at common law was one of largest abuses of law in 17th century robert atkyns attempted to renew this controversy in his book an enquiry into jurisdiction of chancery in causes of equity but without any tangible result kerly 1890 p 115 even so future lord chancellors were more cautious when francis bacon succeeded ellesmere he made sure to prevent misuse of injunctions kerly 1890 p 116 horwitz writes that this was not just limited to bacon and that after dramatic confrontations between lord chief justice coke and lord chancellor ellesmere chancellors took care to circumscribe court s corrective jurisdiction and to focus more narrowly on territories they had staked out as peculiarly their own horowitz 1996 p 25 attempted reform under commonwealth of england by time of english civil war court of chancery was being criticised extensively for its procedure and practice during 16th century court was vastly overworked francis bacon wrote of 2 000 orders being made a year while sir edward coke estimated backlog to be around 16 000 cases kerly 1890 p 154 this was partly due to incompetence of judges and partially due to procedure used evidence was re heard up to three times and orders were issued and then over ruled only to be issued again what was ordered one day was contradicted next so as in some cases there had been five hundred orders and faire more as some affirmed kerly 1890 p 155 court spent a long time on each case which combined with backlog made pursuit of a case extremely expensive this was exacerbated by appointment to court of useless highly paid officials by lord chancellor or master of rolls many of whom were their friends chancellor and master both openly sold these roles whose exorbitant pay is more surprising considering that their duties were normally such that could be easily performed by solicitor s clerks and that they were usually performed by not by officials kerly 1890 p 156 in 1649 during english civil war parliament published a series of orders to reform court most were from doctrines set out by francis bacon as lord chancellor but there were some more modern reforms counsels to defendants could deliver pleas rather than defendants in person thus saving cost of a commissioner of oaths and cases were to be heard in order they were accepted by court parliament also fixed fees that officers could charge in an attempt to reduce expense of a case following year parliament appointed a commission to look at court reform this made many recommendations but none that directly affected chancery in august 1653 another debate took place in parliament lasting two days in which a paper titled observations concerning court of chancery was circulated this concerned costs workings and officers of court a second paper was given out for regulation or taking away of court of chancery and settling business of equity according to original and primitive constitution of it and for taking away all unnecessary fees offices and officers and formalities now used and for speedy dispatch of business kerly 1890 p 157 parliament eventually proposed dissolving court as it then stood and replacing it with some of most able and honest men who would be tasked with hearing equity cases rather than mass of clerks on staff a sufficient number of godly able honest and experienced clerks which be working attorneys and clerks and not overseeing officers would be appointed and bar would elect two supervising chief clerks to advise on points of practice a far reaching and heavily criticised draft this was eventually replaced by an even more thorough going bill kerly 1890 p 158 judges would be six masters who would sit in groups of three and be appointed by parliament assisted by a chief clerk all justices of peace would be allowed to submit cases to court with cases to be heard within 60 days kerly 1890 p 159 party that lost case was to pay full fees to other side fees would be set ludicrously low this bill was never put into effect as parliament was dissolved oliver cromwell did appoint a commission to institute similar provisions in 1654 but commission refused to perform its duties kerly 1890 p 161 restoration after english restoration those judges and officials sacked under cromwell were reinstated with little modern progression as kerly puts it unjust judges presided again and rank maladministration invaded offices situation was much improved nonetheless because many of faults were down to machinery of court rather than spirit which lord clarendon soon rectified kerly 1890 p 163 upon appointment as lord chancellor he immediately published a new issue of orders for regulation of practice of court of chancery this was based on code set by cromwellian commissioners and limited fees charged by court and amount of time they could take on a case kerly 1890 p 164 an effect of civil war and resulting commonwealth of england particularly liberal values and feelings it stirred up was continuous modernisation and improvement of common law courts something that reduced interference of lord chancellor in common law matters except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law under charles ii for first time there was a type of common law appeal where nature of evidence in initial trial was taken into account which reduced need to go to court of chancery kerly 1890 p 166 as a result nature of court of chancery changed rather than being a major corrective system for common law it became primarily concerned with administration and protection of rights as opposed to common law courts which were mainly concerned with remedy and retribution of problems kerly 1890 p 167 this was further enforced by statute of frauds which confirmed chancery principles across board allowing people to receive same treatment in common law courts as they did in chancery kerly 1890 p 171 a major reform to court happened soon after restoration with introduction of a right of appeal to house of lords from chancery before this there had been no records of appeals to lords and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give lords jurisdiction over equity matters except when problems and cases were sent directly to parliament as occasionally had been case in 1660 convention parliament claimed for itself right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters and also right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance after disputes which lasted into next parliament this second measure was dropped but right to hear equity appeals was confirmed kerly 1890 p 168 horowitz writes that despite these changes one of academic certainties is that problems which had dogged court for last two centuries persisted observations on dilatory and expensive proceedings in court of chancery written in 1701 listed 25 different procedures areas and situations which contributed to problems of high fees and slow processes horowitz 1996 p 26 further reform lord somers following his dismissal as lord chancellor introduced an act in 1706 which became most important act of law reform which 18th century produced act significantly amended existing law and court procedure and while most of it was aimed at common law courts it did affect chancery for equity act provided that a party trying to have his case dismissed could not do so until he had paid full costs rather than nominal costs that were previously required at same time reforms act made to common law procedure such as allowing claims to be brought against executors of wills reduced need for parties to go to equity for a remedy kerly 1890 p 173 legal historian wilfrid prest writes that despite these legislative enactments tally of which begins to look quite impressive old problems continued albeit less frequently one barrister of time claimed that going to court with a case worth anything less than ps500 was a waste of time horowitz 1996 p 27 under lord hardwicke chancery procedure was further reformed with a pair of orders published in 1741 and 1747 which mandated that a claimant who brought his case to court and had it dismissed immediately should pay full costs to other side rather than 40 shillings previously paid and that parties filing bills of review should pay ps50 for privilege at same time a review of court s costs and fees was undertaken by a parliamentary committee committee reported that fees and costs had increased significantly since last review under charles i a number of expensive honorary positions had been created and on many occasions court officers had not known what correct fees were at same time proceedings had grown to several thousand pages in length necessitating additional expense committee concluded that interest which a great number of officers and clerks have in proceedings of court of chancery has been a principal cause of extending bills answers pleadings examinations and other forms and copies of them to an unnecessary length to great delay of justice and oppression of subject they recommended that a list of permissible fees be published and circulated to court officials kerly 1890 p 178 recommendations were not immediately acted on but in 1743 a list of permissible fees was published and to cut down on paperwork no party was required to obtain office copies of proceedings permissible fees list contained over 1 000 items which kerly describes as an appalling example of abuses which unrestrained farming of offices of court and payment of all officials by fees had developed kerly 1890 p 179 victorian era thumb alt a courtroom seen from side made of stone there is a large arched

court of chancery in early 19th century sitting in lincoln s inn old hall despite these small reforms 18th century ended with continuous and unrestrained attacks on court although complaints had been common since time of elizabeth i problems had become more unrestrained at same time as politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number many critics were barristers of common law ignorant of court s workings but some such as sir samuel romilly had trained as a chancery advocate and were well aware of chancery s procedure kerly 1890 p 264 success of code napoleon and writings of jeremy bentham are seen by academic duncan kerly to have had much to do with criticism and growing wealth of country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity while upper classes had been struggling with court for centuries and regarded it as a necessary evil growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding with increasing court backlogs it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed kerly 1890 p 265 first major reforms were appointment of a vice chancellor in 1813 to hear cases and extension of master of rolls jurisdiction in 1833 to hear any and all cases in 1824 a chancery commission was appointed to oversee court which political opposition maintained was simply to protect it membership included lord chancellor master of rolls and all senior chancery judges lobban spring 2004 p 409 some significant reforms were proposed in 1829 for example lord lyndhurst proposed unsuccessfully that equity jurisdiction of court of exchequer be merged with chancery and that a fourth judge be appointed to hear additional cases a year later when common law courts were each gaining a judge he repeated his proposal but bill was strongly opposed by judges who maintained that court backlog did not justify additional expense of a fourth judge lobban spring 2004 p 416 eventually two more vice chancellors were appointed in 1841 and a decade later two lord justices were tasked with hearing appeals from court through court of appeal in chancery kerly 1890 p 272 these are described by lobban as hasty reactions to mounting arrears rather than result of long term planning lobban spring 2004 p 390 as a result of new appointments court backlog was significantly reduced court processed 1 700 cases in 1846 49 compared to 959 in 1819 24 but it rose again after death of shadwell vc and retirement of wigram vc shadwell appointed under 1831 act of parliament could be replaced but a principal in 1841 act under which wigram had been appointed meant that it provided for two life appointments to court not two open positions after retirement or death of judges no more could be appointed again backlog became a problem particularly since lord chancellor was distracted with appellate cases through court of appeal in chancery and house of lords leaving a maximum of three chancery judges who were available to hear cases further structural reforms were proposed richard bethell suggested three more vice chancellors and an appellate tribunal in chancery formed of two of vice chancellors taken in rotation but this came to nothing lobban spring 2004 p 422 thumb upright alt a sepia cabinet photograph of a middle aged man relaxing in an armchair

old corruption that had long plagued court first through chancery sinecures act 1832 which abolished a number of sinecure offices within court and provided a pension and pay rise for lord chancellor in hope that it would reduce need for chancellor to make money by selling court offices and then through chancery regulation act 1833 which changed appointments system so that masters in chancery would henceforth be appointed by crown not by lord chancellor and that they would be paid wages through abolition of sinecures taking into account wages and pension this saved court ps21 670 a year government had initially intended 1832 bill to go further and abolish six clerks but clerks successfully lobbied to prevent this lobban spring 2004 p 569 this did not save them however in 1842 nettle of six clerks office was grasped by thomas pemberton who attacked them in house of commons for doing effectively sinecure work for high fees that massively increased expense involved in cases as a result court of chancery act 1842 was passed in same year that abolished office of six clerks completely lobban autumn 2004 p 570 some further procedural reforms were undertaken in 1850s in 1850 a new set of chancery orders were produced by lord chancellor allowing masters to speed up cases in whatever way they chose and allowing plaintiffs to file a claim rather than more expensive and long winded bill of complaint lobban autumn 2004 p 579 suitors in chancery relief act 1852 gave all court officials salaries abolished need to pay them fees and made it illegal for them to receive gratuities it also removed more sinecure positions lobban autumn 2004 p 573 master in chancery abolition act 1852 abolished masters in chancery allowing all cases to be heard directly by judges instead of bounced back and forth between judges and masters lobban autumn 2004 p 582 as a result of these reforms court became far more efficient and backlog decreased in 1860s an average of 3 207 cases were submitted each year while court heard and dismissed 3 833 many of them from previous backlog lobban spring 2004 p 424 much of this work was carried out by growing number of clerks however and members of legal profession became concerned about famine of equity judges lobban spring 2004 p 425 despite these reforms it was still possible for charles dickens writing in 1853 in preface to his novel bleak house to bemoan inefficiencies of court of chancery his novel revolves around a fictional long running chancery case jarndyce and jarndyce he observed that at time he was writing there was a case before chancery court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago and which is i am assured no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun he concluded that if i wanted other authorities for jarndyce and jarndyce i could rain them on these pages to shame of a parsimonious public dissolution idea of fusing common law and equity courts first came to prominence in 1850s although law times dismissed it as suicide in 1852 idea gained mainstream credibility and by end of year times was writing that there was almost unanimity of opinion that existence of two separate systems was parent of most of defects in administration of our law lobban autumn 2004 p 584 much of impetus for fusion came from pressure groups and lawyers associations they partially succeeded with common law procedure act 1854 and chancery amendment act 1858 which gave both courts access to full range of remedies until then common law courts were limited to granting damages and chancery was limited to granting specific performance or injunctions county courts equity jurisdiction act 1865 gave county courts authority to use equitable remedies although it was rarely used lord chancellors during this period were more cautious and despite a request by lawyers associations to establish a royal commission to look at fusion they refused to do so lobban autumn 2004 p 585 after chancery regulation act 1862 had gone some way toward procedural reform in february 1867 roundell palmer again brought problem of having two separate court systems to parliament s attention and in march 1870 lord hatherley introduced a bill to create a single unified high court of justice bill was a weak one not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with common law and which with equity and was also silent on structure of court as hatherley believed difference between common law and equity was one of procedure not substance as a result bill was heavily opposed from two sides those who opposed fusion and those who supported fusion but felt provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use lobban autumn 2004 p 594 as a result bill was eventually withdrawn lobban autumn 2004 p 595 in 1873 idea was resurrected again by palmer who was now lord selborne and new lord chancellor as supreme court of judicature bill while still cautious selborne s bill was far more structured than hatherley s and contained more detail on what was to be done rather than fusing common law and equity which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy idea of trusts he decided to fuse courts and procedure lobban autumn 2004 p 596 final draft provided that all of existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels one of first instance one appellate court of first instance to be known as high court of justice would be subdivided into several divisions based on old superior courts one of which chancery division would deal with equity cases all jurisdiction of court of chancery was to be transferred to chancery division section 25 of act provided that where there was conflict between common law and equity latter would prevail an appeal from each division went to appellate level court of appeal of england and wales these provisions were brought into effect after amendment with supreme court of judicature act 1875 and court of chancery ceased to exist master of rolls was transferred to new court of appeal lord chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles and position of vice chancellor ceased to exist replaced by ordinary judges chancery division remains to this day part of high court of justice of england and wales kerly 1890 p 294 jurisdiction trusts and administration of estates idea of a trust originated during crusades of 12th century when noblemen travelled abroad to fight in holy land hudson 2001 p 41 as they would be away for years at a time it was vital that somebody could look after their land with authority of original owner as a result idea of joint ownership of land arose common law courts did not recognise such trusts and so it fell to equity and to court of chancery to deal with them hudson 2001 p 42 as befitting common principle that chancery s jurisdiction was for matters where common law courts could neither enforce a right nor administer it adams 1855 p 153 use of trusts and uses became common during 16th century although statute of uses dealt a severe blow to these forms of conveyancing and made law in this area far more complex court s sole jurisdiction over trusts lasted until its dissolution carne 1928 p 599 from its foundation court of chancery could administer estates due to its jurisdiction over trusts while main burden in 16th century fell on ecclesiastical courts their powers over administrators and executors was limited regularly necessitating court of chancery s involvement before statute of wills many people used feoffees to dispose of their land something that fell under jurisdiction of lord chancellor anyway in addition in relation to discovery and accounting of assets process used by court of chancery was far superior to ecclesiastical one as a result court of chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters but their remedies for problems were far more limited initially court of chancery would not entertain a request to administer an estate as soon as a flaw in will was discovered rather leaving it to ecclesiastical courts but from 1588 onwards court did deal with such requests in four situations where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors which could not be done in ecclesiastical courts to secure femme covert assets from a husband and where deceased s debts had to be paid before legacies were valid carne 1928 p 600 insanity and guardianship chancery s jurisdiction over lunatics came from two sources first king s prerogative to look after them which was exercised regularly by lord chancellor and second lands of lunatics act which gave king and therefore chancellor custodianship of lunatics and their land carne 1928 p 607 lord chancellor exercised first right directly and second in his role as head of court of chancery carne 1928 p 608 this jurisdiction applied to any idiots or lunatics regardless of whether or not they were british or whether their land was within england and wales they were divided into two categories idiots who have no glimmering of reason from their birth and are therefore by law presumed never likely to attain any adams 1855 p 653 and lunatics who have had understanding but have lost use of it adams 1855 p 654 lunatics and idiots were administered separately by lord chancellor under his two prerogatives appeal under king s prerogative went directly to king and under lands of lunatics act 1324 to house of lords adams 1855 p 655 idiots and lunatics had their land looked after by a court appointed administrator and any profits went into a trust fund to support insane person due to vested interest of king who would hold lands actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury not by an individual judge adams 1855 p 656 under lunacy act 1845 lord chancellor had a right to appoint a commission to investigate insanity of an individual as part of his role as keeper of king s conscience however he would only do this when it was beneficial to lunatic not simply because somebody had been found insane adams 1855 p 657 law courts jurisdiction over guardianship of children is said to have come from king s prerogative of parens patriae chancery had administered this area of law from an early period since it primarily concerned holding of land a form of trust since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records first reference comes from 1582 when a curator was appointed to deal with property of an infant while common law courts regularly appointed guardians chancery had right to remove them replace them or create them in first place similarly while there were actions against guardians which child could undertake in common law courts these were regularly undertaken in court of chancery carne 1928 p 605 this jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards and its main focus was welfare of child carne 1928 p 606 as such wards of court had certain principles their estates had to be administered under supervision of court they had to be educated under same supervision and any marriage had to be sanctioned by court adams 1855 p 637 charities lord chancellor had since 15th century been tasked with administering estates where estate was to be used for charitable purposes in bailiff of burford v lord hardwicke suggested that jurisdiction of court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts as well as from charitable uses act 1601 carne suggests that as court had long been able to deal with such situations 1601 act was actually just declaration of pre existing custom carne 1928 p 601 this is illustrated by chancellor s original jurisdiction over to uses which came from his original status as a clergyman as charity had been originally enforced by church and ecclesiastical courts d january 1862 p 141 essentially an owner of land could dispose of it by granting right to use it and collect fees to another not just by selling it this was not valid at common law courts but was in court of chancery lord chancellor is reported as having said in 1492 where there is no remedy at common law there may be good remedy in conscience as for example by a feoffment upon confidence feoffor has no remedy by common law and yet by conscience he has and so if feoffee transfers to another who knows of this confidence feoffor by means of a subpoena will have his rights in this court d january 1862 p 142 after reign of edward iv if charitable land were to be sold or land were to be sold to create charity court of chancery was only place this could be done as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction d april 1862 p 321 remedies court of chancery could grant three possible remedies specific performance injunctions and damages remedy of specific performance is in contractual matters an order by court which requires party in breach of contract to perform his obligations mckendrick 2007 p 451 validity of contract as a whole was not normally considered only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting party that breached contract to carry out his obligations was viable adams 1855 p 243 injunctions on other hand are remedies which prevent a party from doing something unlike specific performance which requires them to do something mckendrick 2007 p 455 until common law procedure act 1854 court of chancery was only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance 1998 p 6 damages is money claimed in compensation for some failure by other party to a case peel 2007 p 992 it is commonly believed that court of chancery could not grant damages until chancery amendment act 1858 which gave it that right but in some special cases it had been able to provide damages for over 600 years idea of damages was first conceived in english law during 13th century when statutes of merton and gloucester provided for damages in certain circumstances despite what is normally assumed by academics it was not just common law courts that could grant damages under these statutes exchequer of pleas and court of chancery both had right to do so in cardinal beaufort s case in 1453 for example it is stated that i shall have a subpoena against my feoffee and recover damages for value of land mcdermott 1992 p 652 a statute passed during reign of richard ii specifically gave chancery right to award damages stating for as much as people be compelled to come before king s council or in chancery by writs grounded upon untrue suggestions that chancellor for time being presently after that such suggestions be duly found and proved untrue shall have power to ordain and award damages according to his discretion to him which is so troubled unduly as afore is said mcdermott 1992 p 653 this did not extend to every case but merely to those which had been dismissed because one party s suggestions are proved untrue and was normally awarded to pay for innocent party s costs in responding to party that had lied lord hardwicke however claimed that chancery s jurisdiction to award damages was not derived from any authority but from conscience and rather than being statutory was instead due to lord chancellor s inherent authority as a result general orders were regularly issued awarding innocent party additional costs such as cost of a solicitor on top of costs of responding to other party s false statements court became more cautious about awarding damages during 16th and 17th centuries lord chancellors and legal writers considered it a common law remedy and judges would normally only award damages where no other remedy was appropriate damages were sometimes given as an ancillary remedy such as in browne v dom bridges in 1588 where defendant had disposed of waste inside plaintiffs woods as well as an injunction to prevent defendant dumping waste in woods damages were also awarded to pay for harm to woods mcdermott 1992 p 654 this convention that damages could only be awarded as an ancillary remedy or where no others were available remained cause until 18th and early 19th centuries when attitude of court towards awarding damages became more liberal in lannoy v for example it was held that where there was sufficient evidence of harm court could award damages in addition to specific performance and other remedies mcdermott 1992 p 656 this changed with todd v gee in 1810 where lord eldon held that except in very special cases it was not course of proceeding in equity to file a bill for specific performance of an agreement praying in alternative if it cannot be performed an issue or an inquiry before master with a view to damages plaintiff must take that remedy if he chooses it at law this was followed by hatch v cobb in which chancellor kent held that though equity in very special cases may possibly sustain a bill for damages on a breach of contract it is clearly not ordinary jurisdiction of court mcdermott 1992 p 657 court s right to give damages was reiterated in phelps v prothero in 1855 where court of appeal in chancery held that if a plaintiff starts an action in a court of equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate court of equity may choose to award damages mcdermott 1992 p 658 this authorisation was limited to certain circumstances and was again not regularly used eventually chancery amendment act 1858 gave court full jurisdiction to award damages situation before that was so limited that lawyers at time commented as if court had not previously been able to do so mcdermott 1992 p 659 officers lord chancellor lord chancellor was official head of court of chancery for much of its early existence he was closely linked with curia regis even after court became independent around 1345 petitions were addressed to king and others by time of edward iv however petitions were issued in name of lord chancellor and court of chancery in early years lord chancellor made most of decisions himself he summoned parties set a date for hearings addressed questions from parties to case and announced verdict carne 1927 p 411 he regularly called for assistance from common law judges who complained that this prevented them from doing work of common law courts and early records frequently say that decision was made with advice and consent of justices and servants of our lord king in chancery carne 1927 p 412 in one period particularly under edward iii lord chancellor also possessed some common law jurisdiction able to hear cases for petitions of right and repeal of letters patent as well as other cases in which king was a party he heard cases on recognizances execution of acts of parliament and any case in which an officer of court of chancery was involved records show that he enrolled recognizances and contracts and also issued writs commanding a sheriff to enforce them carne considers that this common law jurisdiction was likely down to a failure to separate common law jurisdiction and equity jurisdiction possessed by lord chancellor a failure that continued into 16th century sir edward coke wrote that in chancery there was both an ordinary court and an extraordinary one carne 1927 p 415 most of early lord chancellors were members of clergy first legally trained lord chancellor was robert sl who was appointed in 1341 and held office for two years his successors were again clerics until appointment of robert thorpe in 1371 probably due to pressure from parliament precedent of appointing legally trained lord chancellors was not followed strongly although others such as nicholas bacon did hold office one lord chancellor is said to have been appointed because queen was impressed with his skill at dancing carne 1928 p 591 according to william carne thomas egerton was first proper lord chancellor from court of chancery s point of view having recorded his decisions and followed legal doctrine of precedent carne 1928 p 592 marsh writes that use of clergymen as lord chancellors had a tremendous influence on court s actions tracing idea of following natural law in court back to chancellors christian roots marsh 1890 p 71 following dissolution of court of chancery in 1873 lord chancellor failed to have any role in equity although his membership of other judicial bodies allowed him some indirect control other officers of court thumb upright alt an engraving of a middle aged man in formal nineteenth century dress with sideburns and tousled hair john romilly last master of rolls to sit in court of chancery when court was a part of curia regis officers were fluid they could include doctors of civil law members of curia and those who ought to be summoned as members of curia ceased to sit as officers however composition of court became more solid from an early period lord chancellor was assisted by twelve clerks in chancery known as masters in chancery it was said that these positions had existed since before norman conquest sitting as part of witenagemot after conquest they gradually lost their authority and became advisers and assistants to lord chancellor it was masters who started court cases issuing initial writs without which parties could not begin cases in common law courts in addition they took depositions and acted as secretaries to lord chancellor maintaining plea rolls in early years they were almost always members of clergy called de prima forma it was not until reign of edward iii that they were referred to as masters in chancery carne 1927 p 416 twelve masters in chancery were led by one of their number known as master of rolls he was almost as powerful as lord chancellor and had wielded judicial power since time of edward i he was sometimes known as vice chancellor and was given title right worshipful master of rolls assisted court s judges in forming judgments and regularly sat in place of lord chancellor first reference to master of rolls comes from 1286 although it is believed that position probably existed before that sainty 1993 p 144 first reference to his having independent judicial authority is from 1520 1935 p 327 master of rolls had six clerks simply known as six clerks who helped keep records they were independently accountable for any mistakes these were initially solicitors for people suing in court and no other counsel was allowed but by time of francis bacon claimants were allowed their own counsel master of rolls and his clerks were housed in rolls office along with six clerks clerks who numbered sixty six clerks were abolished in 1843 masters in chancery in 1852 and when court of chancery was abolished master of rolls moved to newly established court of appeal of england and wales carne 1927 p 417 from an early period court was also assisted by two registrars who enrolled decrees of court and orders their books documented legal precedent set by court at same time two examiners were appointed to assist master of rolls in examining witnesses carne 1927 p 418 positions were regularly and openly sold by master of rolls and lord chancellor masters in chancery went for ps6 000 in 1625 to avoid sale of offices and due to corruption of many court officials an act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into bank of england and creating an accountant general to oversee financial aspects of court kerly 1890 p 174 in 1813 first vice chancellor was appointed to deal with increasing number of cases submitted to court kerly 1890 p 271 with backlog growing larger two more were appointed in 1841 under a second act of parliament although this provided for two life appointments not two new positions when new vice chancellors died there could be no replacements with dissolution of court in 1873 position of vice chancellor ceased to exist see also chancery lane court of chancery ireland court of chancery of county palatine of
