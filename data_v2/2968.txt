nothomyrmecia also known as dinosaur ant or dawn ant is a rare genus of ants consisting of a single species nothomyrmecia macrops these ants live in south australia nesting in old growth mallee woodland and eucalyptus woodland full distribution of nothomyrmecia has never been assessed and it is unknown how widespread species truly is its potential range may be wider if it does favour old growth mallee woodland possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change nothomyrmecia is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as camponotus and iridomyrmex and it also increases hunting success thus increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for ant to live in as a result iucn lists ant as critically endangered as a medium sized ant nothomyrmecia measures workers are monomorphic showing little morphological differentiation among one another mature colonies are very small with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest workers are strictly nocturnal and are solitary foragers collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as honeydew from scale insects and other hemiptera they rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that species use chemicals to communicate when foraging but they do use chemical alarm signals a queen ant will mate with one or more males and during colony foundation she will hunt for food until brood have fully developed queens are univoltine they produce just one generation of ants each year two queens may establish a colony together but only one will remain once first generation of workers has been reared nothomyrmecia was first described by australian entomologist john s clark in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants these were reportedly collected in 1931 near russell range inland from israelite bay in western australia after its initial discovery ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977 away from original reported site dubbed as holy grail of myrmecology ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery attracting scientists from around world in poochera rediscovery site pictures of ant are stencilled on streets and it is perhaps only town in world that thrives off ant based tourism some entomologists have suggested a relationship to baltic eocene fossil ant genus prionomyrmex based on morphological similarities but this interpretation is not widely accepted by entomological community owing to its body structure nothomyrmecia is regarded to be most plesiomorphic ant alive and a living fossil stimulating studies on its morphology behaviour ecology and chromosomes description thumbnail closeup view of a worker s head alt head of worker dinosaur ant with large eyes and long mandibles nothomyrmecia is a medium sized ant measuring in length workers are monomorphic meaning that there is little morphological differentiation among one another mandibles clypeus one of sclerites that make up face of an arthropod or insect antennae and legs are pale yellow hairs on body are yellow erect and long and abundant but on antennae and legs they are shorter and standing almost in an erect position it shows similar characteristics to myrmecia and somewhat resembles oecophylla commonly known as weaver ants workers are strictly nocturnal active mainly at night but navigate by vision relying on large compound eyes mandibles are shorter than head they have 10 to 15 teeth and are less specialised than those of myrmecia and prionomyrmex being elongate and triangular head is longer than it is wide and broader towards back sides of head are convex around eyes long antennal scapes base of antenna extend beyond occipital border and second segment of funiculus a series of segments between base and club is slightly longer than first third and fourth segment node pronotum and thorax are longer than broad and mesonotum is just as long as it is wide first segment of gaster bulbous posterior portion of metasoma is broader than long by a third and broader at back than front with strongly convex sides a long and retractable stinger is present at rear of abdomen it has been described as prominent and effective and is capable of inflicting a painful sting to humans a sting bulb gland is also present in nothomyrmecia this is a small exocrine gland of unknown function first discovered and named in 1990 it is situated in basal part of insect s sting and is located between two ducts of venom gland and dufour s gland despite its many plesiomorphic features sting apparatus of nothomyrmecia is considered less primitive than those found in other ants such as stigmatomma pallipes it is only known species of ant that contains both a sting and a waist i e it has no postpetiole between first and second gastral segments thumbnail left n macrops winged male alt male dinosaur ant with long functional wings queens look similar to workers but several morphological features distinguish two castes from each other queen s body is usually larger ocelli are highly developed but eyes on queen are not enlarged structure of wing bearing area of thorax is consistent with other reproductive ants but it does not occupy as much of its bulk wings of queens are reduced to point that they are not functional they are brachypterous their wings are rudimentary and stubby barely overlapping first gastral segment males resemble those of myrmecia but nothomyrmecia males bear a single waist node wings on male ant are not stubby like a queen s rather they are long and fully developed exhibiting a primitive complement they have a jugal anal lobe a portion of hindwing a feature found in many primitive ants and basal hamuli hook like projections that link forewings and hindwings most male specimens collected have two tibial spurs spines located on distal end of tibia first spur is a long calcar and second spur is short and thick adults have a stridulatory organ on ventral side of abdomen unlike all other hymenopterans in which such organs are located dorsally in all castes these ants have six maxillary palps palps that serve as organs of touch and taste in feeding and four labial palps sensory structures on labium a highly primitive feature females have a 12 segmented antenna whereas males have 13 segments other features include paired found on both hind and middle tibiae and claws have a median tooth unspecialised nature of cuticle outer exoskeleton of body is similar to a member of subfamily pseudomyrmecinae many of features known in nothomyrmecia are found in ponerinae and pseudomyrmecinae thumb stinger of n macrops alt microscopic image of stinger of nothomyrmecia macrops appearing needle like eggs of nothomyrmecia are similar to those of myrmecia being and non adhesive larvae bear a primitive body structure with no specialised tubercles sharing similar characteristics with subfamily ponerinae but sensilla are more abundant on mouthparts larvae are characterised into three stages very young young and mature measuring and respectively cocoons have thin walls and produce a metabolic waste product expelled through anal opening after an insect emerges from its pupal stage cuticular hydrocarbons have internally branched alkenes a feature rarely found in ants and most insects in general body structure of all nothomyrmecia castes demonstrates primitive nature of species notable derived features include vestigial ocelli on workers brachypterous queens and structure on males morphology of abdomen mandibles a sclerite serving as base of ovipositors sheath and basal hamuli show it is more primitive than myrmecia structure of abdominal region can separate it from other myrmeciinae relatives fourth abdominal segment of myrmecia is whereas nothomyrmecia has a non abdominal segment appearance of fourth abdominal segment is consistent with almost all aculeate insects and possibly sphecomyrma feature of non functional vestigial wings may have evolved in this species relatively recently as wings might otherwise have long since disappeared completely had they no function for dispersal wing reduction could somehow relate to population structure or some other specialised ecological pressure equally wing reduction might be a feature that only forms in drought stressed colonies as has been observed in several ant species found throughout semi arid regions of australia as yet scientists do not fully understand how feature of non functional vestigial wings arose in nothomyrmecia macrops taxonomy discovery thumbnail n macrops worker specimen collected by taylor alt side view of worker dinosaur ant first collection of nothomyrmecia was made in december 1931 by amateur entomologist amy crocker whose colleagues had collected a range of insect samples for her during a field excursion including specimens of two worker ants reportedly near russell range inland from israelite bay in western australia crocker then passed ants to australian entomologist john s clark recognised shortly afterwards as a new species these specimens became syntypes entomologist robert w taylor subsequently expressed doubt about accuracy of recording of original discovery site stating specimens were probably collected from western end of great australian bight south from balladonia discovery of nothomyrmecia and appearance of its unique body structure led scientists in 1951 to initiate a series of searches to find ant in western australia over three decades teams of australian and american collectors failed to re find it entomologists such as e o wilson and william brown jr made attempts to search for it but neither was successful then on 22 october 1977 taylor and his party of entomologists from canberra serendipitously discovered a solitary worker ant at poochera south australia southeast of ceduna some from reported site of 1931 discovery in 2012 a report discussing possible presence of nothomyrmecia in western australia did not confirm any sighting of ant between balladonia and western australian coastal regions after 46 years of searching for it entomologists have dubbed ant holy grail of myrmecology naming in 1934 entomologist john s clark published a formal description of nothomyrmecia macrops as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe of ponerinae he did so because two specimens which then became syntypes bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of but they did share similar morphological characteristics with extinct genus prionomyrmex clark notes that head and mandibles of nothomyrmecia and prionomyrmex are somewhat similar but two can be distinguished by appearance of node a segment between mesosoma and gaster in 1951 clark proposed new ant subfamily nothomyrmeciinae for his nothomyrmecia based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants this proposal was rejected by american entomologist william brown jr who placed it in subfamily myrmeciinae with myrmecia and prionomyrmex under tribe its distant relationship with extant ants was confirmed after its rediscovery and its placement within formicidae was accepted by most scientists until late 1980s single waist node led scientists to believe that nothomyrmecia should be separate from myrmecia and retained clark s original proposal this proposal would place ant into its own subfamily despite many familiar morphological characteristics between two genera this separation from myrmecia was retained until 2000 thumbnail left label of one of nothomyrmecia specimens collected by taylor alt label showing details of rediscovered specimen i e collectors name when and where it was found in 2000 entomologist cesare baroni urbani described a new baltic fossil prionomyrmex species p after examining specimens of nothomyrmecia baroni urbani stated that his new species and n macrops were so morphologically similar that they belonged to same genus he proposed that name prionomyrmex should replace name nothomyrmecia which would then be just a synonym and also that subfamily nothomyrmeciinae should be called in 2003 russian palaeoentomologists g m dlussky and e b perfilieva separated nothomyrmecia from prionomyrmex on basis of fusion of an abdominal segment in same year american entomologists p s ward and s g brady reached same conclusion as dlussky and perfilieva and provided strong support for monophyly of prionomyrmex ward and brady also transferred both taxa as distinct genera in older subfamily myrmeciinae under tribe in 2005 and 2008 baroni urbani suggested further evidence in favour of his former interpretation as opposed to ward and brady s this view is not supported in subsequent relevant papers which continue to use classification of ward and brady rejecting that of baroni urbani ant is commonly known as dinosaur ant dawn ant or living fossil ant because of its plesiomorphic body structure generic name nothomyrmecia means false bulldog ant its specific epithet macrops big eyes is derived from greek words meaning long or large and meaning eyes genetics and phylogeny studies show that all hymenopteran insects that have a diploid 2n chromosome count above 52 are themselves all ants nothomyrmecia and another ponerinae ant share highest number of chromosomes within all hymenoptera having a diploid chromosome number of 92 94 genetic evidence suggests that age of most recent common ancestor for nothomyrmecia and myrmecia is approximately 74 million years old giving a likely origin in cretaceous there are two hypotheses of internal phylogeny of nothomyrmecia subfamily is more closely related to nothomyrmecia than it is to myrmecia evolving from nothomyrmecia like ancestors alternatively nothomyrmecia and aneuretinae may have shared a common ancestor two most likely separated from each other and first evolved from aneuretinae instead currently scientists agree that nothomyrmecia most likely evolved from ancestors to ponerinae nothomyrmecia and other primitive ant genera such as and myrmecia exhibit behaviour similar to a clade of soil dwelling families of vespoid wasps following cladogram generated by canadian entomologist s b archibald and his colleagues shows possible phylogenetic position of nothomyrmecia among some ants of subfamily myrmeciinae they suggest that nothomyrmecia may be closely related to extinct myrmeciinae ants such as avitomyrmex macabeemyrma prionomyrmex and ypresiomyrma thumb nothomyrmecia and extinct prionomyrmex are closely related to each other distribution and habitat thumbnail reported occurrences of nothomyrmecia according to atlas of living australia alt map of australia showing reported occurrences of nothomyrmecia nothomyrmecia is present in cool regions of south australia within mallee woodland and especially old growth areas populated with various eucalyptus species including eucalyptus e gracilis and e it is possible that it also occurs in western australia from where it was first collected full distribution of nothomyrmecia has never been assessed and it is unknown how widespread it really is if it does favour old growth mallee woodland it could have potential for a wider range than is currently known from surveys and museum specimens in 1998 nothomyrmecia colonies were located in 18 areas along eyre peninsula by a team of entomologists a stretch of nests are found in degraded limestone soil with callitris trees present colony construction only occurs when soil is moist nest entrance holes are difficult to detect as they are only in width and are located under shallow leaf litter with no mounds or soil deposits present guards are regularly seen a single gallery in diameter forms inside a nothomyrmecia colony this gallery descends steeply into ground towards a somewhat elliptical and horizontal chamber that is in diameter and in height this chamber is typically below soil s surface behaviour and ecology foraging diet and predators thumb left workers feeding on honey bait alt foraging workers feeding on experimental honey on a tree workers are and can be found foraging on top of eucalyptus trees where they search for food and prey for larvae workers are known to consume hemolymph from insects they capture and a queen in a captive colony was observed consuming a fly captured prey items are given to larvae which are carnivorous workers search for prey in piles of leaves killing small arthropods including drosophila flies and spiderlings prey items are usually less than in size and workers grab them using their mandibles and forelegs then kill them with their sting workers also feed on sweet substances such as honeydew secreted by scale insects and other hemiptera one worker alone may feed on these sources for 30 minutes pupae may be given to larvae if a colony has a shortage of food workers are able to lay unfertilised eggs specifically to feed larvae these are known as trophic eggs sometimes adults including queen and other sexually active ants consume these eggs workers transfer food to other nestmates including winged adults and larvae anal droplets are exuded by larvae which are taken up by workers age caste polyethism does not occur in nothomyrmecia where younger workers act as nurses and tend to brood and older workers go out and forage only ant known other than nothomyrmecia which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is stigmatomma pallipes workers are strictly nocturnal and only emerge from their nests on cold nights they are most active at temperatures of and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights cold temperatures may also hamper escape of prey items so increasing ants hunting success unless a forager has captured prey workers stay on trees for remainder of night until dawn possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest there is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging instead workers rely on visual cues to navigate around chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances ants are solitary foragers waste material such as dead nestmates cocoon shells and food remnants are disposed of far away from nest workers from different nothomyrmecia colonies are not antagonistic towards one another so they can forage together on a single tree and they attack if an outsider tries to enter an underground colony ants such as camponotus and iridomyrmex may pose a threat to foragers or to a colony if they try to enter foraging workers that encounter iridomyrmex ants are vigorously attacked and killed nothomyrmecia workers counter this by secreting alarm pheromones from mandibular gland and dufour s gland foraging workers also engage in alternative methods to protect themselves from predators adopting a posture by opening jaws in a threatening stance or deliberately falling onto ground and remaining motionless until threat subsides are two known methods with that said nothomyrmecia is a timid and shy species that retreats if exposed life cycle and reproduction thumbnail upright two queens showing their vestigial wings as well as a wingless worker and several cocoons alt two queens showing their short stubby wings a similar looking worker is nearby along with some pupae nuptial flight meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate does not occur in nothomyrmecia instead they engage in long range dispersal they walk away from colony for some distance and mate which presumably begins by late summer or autumn with winged adults emerging around march and april but sometimes a colony may overwinter a process by which an organism waits out winter season these winged adults born around january are usually quite young when they begin to mate queens are seen around vegetation trying to flutter their vestigial wings a behaviour seen in some brachypterous myrmecia queens due to queen s brachypterous wings it is likely that winged adults mate near their parent nest and release sex pheromones or instead climb on vegetation far away from their nests and attract fully winged males nothomyrmecia is a polyandrous ant in which queens mate with one or more males in one study of 32 colonies it was found that queens mated with an average of 1 37 males after mating new colonies can be founded by one or more queens a colony with two queens reduces to a single queen when nest is mature forming colonies that are termed monogynous queens will compete for dominance and subordinate queen is later expelled by workers who drag her outside nest an existing nest with no queen may adopt a foraging queen looking for an area to begin her colony as well as workers queens are semi claustral meaning that during initial establishment of new colony queen will forage among worker ants so that she can ensure sufficient food to raise her brood sometimes a queen will leave her nest at night with sole purpose of finding food or water for herself eggs are not seen in nests from april to september they are laid by late december and develop into adults by mid february pupation does not occur until march nothomyrmecia is univoltine meaning that queen produces a single generation of eggs per season and it sometimes may take as many as 12 months for an egg to develop into an adult adults are defined as either juveniles or post juveniles juveniles are too young perhaps several months old to have experienced overwintering whereas post juveniles have pupae generally overwinter and begin to hatch by time a new generation of eggs is laid workers are capable of laying reproductive eggs it is not known if these develop into males females or both this uncertainty results from suggestion that because some colonies have been shown to have high levels of genetic diversity worker ants could be inseminated by males and act as supplementary reproductives eggs are scattered among nest whereas larvae and pupae are set apart from each other in groups larvae are capable of crawling around nest when larvae are ready to spin their cocoons they swell up and are later buried by workers in ground to allow cocoon formation small non aggressive workers that act as nurses provide assistance for newborns to hatch from their cocoons at maturity a nest may only contain 50 to 100 adults in some nests colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies colony may be taken over by one of her daughters or it may adopt a newly mated queen restricting reproduction among workers this method of founding extends lifespan of colony almost indefinitely relationship with humans conservation thumb left sculpture of a nothomyrmecia ant in poochera alt a large yellow sculpture of nothomyrmecia is located in poochera before its rediscovery in 1977 entomologists feared that nothomyrmecia had already become extinct ant was listed as a protected species under western australian wildlife conservation act 1950 in 1996 international union for conservation of nature listed nothomyrmecia as critically endangered stating that only a few small colonies were known threatened species scientific committee states that species is ineligible for listing under environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 this is because there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that populations are declining colonies are also naturally lacking in numbers of ants and their distribution is potentially quite extensive across southern australia due to ants preference for old growth mallee woodland with 18 sites known for this species and potential for many more being discovered there seems little immediate possibility of extinction with this said it is unknown how widespread species actually is and scientists are not yet clear what if any threats affect it suspected anthropogenic threats that can significantly affect nothomyrmecia include habitat destruction and fragmentation by railway lines roads and wheat fields in town of ceduna west of poochera local populations of ant were almost eliminated after area was bulldozed and burned during installation of an underground telephone line although nearby sites had larger populations than those found in destroyed site colonies may not survive tree clearing as they depend on overhead canopies to navigate bushfires are another major threat to survival of nothomyrmecia potentially destroying valuable food sources including trees they forage on and reducing population of a colony these ants may have recovered from previous bushfires but larger more frequent fires may devastate population nothomyrmecia ants can be safe from fires if they remain inside their nests climate change could be a threat to their survival as they depend on cold temperatures to forage and collect food an increase in temperature will prevent workers from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for species to live in cold winds blowing off southern ocean allow nothomyrmecia to benefit from cool temperatures they need for night time foraging so an increase in sea temperature could also potentially threaten it conservationists suggest that conducting surveys maintaining known populations through habitat protection and fighting climate change may ensure survival of nothomyrmecia they also advocate protection of remaining mallee habitat from degradation and for management actions to improve tree and understorey structure because most known populations are found outside protected areas in vegetation alongside roads a species management plan is required to identify other key actions including making local councils aware of presence conservation status and habitat requirement of nothomyrmecia this could result in future land use and management being decided more appropriately at local level not all colonies are found in unprotected areas some have been discovered in lake gilles conservation park and conservation reserve more research is needed to know true extent of ant s geographical distribution significance nothomyrmecia macrops is widely regarded as most plesiomorphic living ant and as such has aroused considerable interest among entomological community following its rediscovery it was subject of a prolonged and rigorous series of studies involving australian american and european ant specialists and it soon became one of most studied ant species on planet nothomyrmecia can be cultured with ease and could potentially prove a useful subject for research into learning in insects as well as physiology of nocturnal vision since its chance discovery at poochera town has become of international interest to myrmecologists and it is possibly only town in world with ant based tourism promoting it as a tourist attraction nothomyrmecia has been adopted as emblem of poochera community pictures of ant have been stencilled onto pavements and a large sculpture of nothomyrmecia has been erected in town notes references cited literature
