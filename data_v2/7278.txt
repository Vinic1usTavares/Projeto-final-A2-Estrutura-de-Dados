janmaat janmaat went on to become leader of party which subsequently became strongly centered on his person newly formed centre democrats represented more moderate faction of centre party but espoused an anti immigration and nationalist ideology their claims of standing in centre of political landscape have thus been disputed by political scientists centre democrats did not gain enough votes for parliamentary representation in 1986 general election but janmaat won back his seat after following election in 1989 in 1994 he was joined by two additional representatives won by party cd was subject to a cordon sanitaire by other parties in parliament although some parties rather sought to confront it following its 1994 success cd failed to win any seats in 1998 election and it fell into disarray until it was finally dissolved in 2002 history early years 1984 1989 thumb 200px hans janmaat as a member of parliament in early 1984 while still representing centre party centre democrats was founded on 7 november 1984 by a few low key members who broke away from centre party cp on 5 december same year only member of parliament for centre party hans janmaat changed party to centre democrats and became its seventh member janmaat believed that by steering a more moderate course centre party would attract more voters at polls but was expelled by party s hardliners in an attempt to appear more mainstream than centre party new centre democrats slogans were more moderate and less explicit as opposed to centre party s volk our people first centre democrats manifesto used dutch proverb oost west best east west home best after janmaat joined centre democrats party became known as his party despite widespread media coverage generated by janmaat s reputation party membership remained small in first few years mudde 2003 p 123 during its early years centre democrats received extensive media attention on two occasions first occurred when centre democrats and centre party met on 29 march 1986 in a group of anti fascist activists believed that two parties were planning to merge and hotel where meeting was held venue was severely damaged janmaat narrowly escaped death and party secretary wil schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape conflagration mudde 2003 pp 123 124 janmaat s attempt to be reinstated as a teacher at his old school following his failed re election to parliament led to second media frenzy although he was legally permitted to go back to his job protests of some students and parents due to his reputation as a racist led him to be bought off by court from pursuing a return to his old job unable to go back to his former job returned to politics taking advantage of janmaat s profile centre democrats contested 1986 general election under name janmaat centrumdemocraten but gained just 0 1 of vote and no parliamentary seat centre democrats failed in its attempt to win votes from centre party which gained 0 4 of vote but also did not win a seat in parliament 1989 1998 thumb 200px demonstration against janmaat during swearing in of house of representatives in 1989 following 1986 election centre democrats worked on improving both its image and its grassroots support strategy paid off with janmaat winning a seat in house of representatives in 1989 general election by contesting election in all nineteen constituencies party won right to state sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members in 1990 local elections centre democrats won eleven seats then in 1991 provincial elections three seats in provincial parliament mudde 2003 p 124 electoral success overtook party and janmaat began to make controversial statements in media based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third generation dutch nationals he suggested that several cabinet ministers including justice minister ernst hirsch ballin who was of jewish descent and agriculture state secretary gabor who was of hungarian descent should be removed from dutch leadership this marked start of prosecutions of centre democrats party members on charges of racism as well as decision by other parties in parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around party cordon sanitaire turned out to be counterproductive with centre democrats winning 77 seats in 1994 local elections and gaining representation in almost every city where it fielded a candidate large cities were strongholds of party winning more than 10 of vote in rotterdam it became fifth largest dutch political party after elections however scandal loomed over centre democrats largely because of its weak organization and lack of active party members many of its previously won local seats became vacant after a while as elected representatives failed to take them up joined or founded other parties left party or left politics altogether before 1994 general election opinion polls predicted that party could win more than five seats in house of representatives however media reports claiming that some newly elected local members had extremist pasts damaged centre democrats prospects a secret recording broadcast on national television one week before election showed an amsterdam council member bragging about having set immigrant centers on fire in early 1980s in election that followed centre democrats won 2 5 of vote and three seats in house of representatives janmaat was joined by wil schuurman and cor zonneveld well below earlier expectations janmaat claimed that relatively poor result was a result of an anti cd campaign in media mudde 2003 p 125 due to its growth and questions arising amongst other parties over development of a multicultural society political opponents began to confront centre democrats directly rather than maintain a strict cordon sanitaire around it lucardie 1998 p 121 despite attempts to broaden their appeal issue of foreigners remained central to party s rhetoric janmaat was convicted of inciting racial hatred by dutch 2003 p 126 for speaking out against multiculturalism his conviction later came to be seen as unwarranted by mainstream observers janmaat and schuurman who were to marry in 1996 dominated party with schuurman s son head of party office centre democrats became almost a family affair lucardie 1998 pp 115 116 janmaat remained skeptical of initiatives outside his own control and expelled multiple local council members from party while much of this was due to local cooperation unauthorized by centre democrats leadership with more radical centre party 86 cp 86 janmaat later agreed to coordinate joint demonstrations with it cooperation soon fell apart and janmaat distanced himself from cp 86 as 1998 election approached in 1995 provincial elections in face of competition from four new ethnocentric competitors none of which won a seat centre democrats did not increase its three seat presence in provincial parliament in 1998 local elections centre democrats lost all but one of its seats having contested election in just around half of municipalities it contested in 1994 in 1998 general election two months later party lost all its seats in parliament this was as a result of centre democrats s failure to benefit from increased attention on immigration issues its years of internal infighting and new legislation directed mainly against far right which had raised number of signatures per district required in order to contest elections mudde 2003 pp 126 127 demise 1998 2002 after 1998 election janmaat became increasingly worried by legal pressure believing that centre democrats could become government s next target after cp 86 was officially banned in 1998 he founded conservative democrats as a potential successor party in event that centre democrats was proscribed new party contested 1999 european elections as centrumdemocraten a supposed two party cooperation where two names in reality represented same party it won only 0 5 of vote in election a showing widely seen as last spasm of a dying party mudde 2003 p 127 janmaat s increasing physical exhaustion only served to exacerbate situation nonetheless with a new political climate following september 11 attacks and rise of pim fortuyn janmaat sought political rehabilitation in his final years reason was that his earlier criminal convictions arose from stating things that had now become accepted on 18 april 2002 only a few months before janmaat died party was formally dissolved as a result it did not participate in 2002 general election where recently emerged pim fortuyn list attracted votes based on an appeal similar to that of centre democrats ideology after split from centre party ideology of centre democrats was broadly similar to that of its originator although centre party became increasingly radical in following years lucardie 1998 p 114 centre democrats did not publish a party or electoral manifesto before 1989 and until then its policies were known primarily through small scale distribution of pamphlets which were almost exact copies of old centre party pamphlets like centre party centre democrats claimed to be at centre of political spectrum representing a centre democratic ideology lucardie 1998 p 117 nevertheless party focused mainly on issue of immigration and mainstream observers considered party s ideology to be a populist form of nationalism immigration and multiculturalism centre democrats was strongly opposed to multiculturalism and immigration it did not however exclude people based on ethnicity it spoke initially at least of a dutch population rather than a dutch ethnic community party remained distinct from ethnic nationalists as it gave immigrants choice between repatriation or assimilation its 1989 party program stated that foreigners and minorities either adjust to dutch ways and customs or leave country centre democrats considered dutch culture to be under threat from foreigners and that muslims in particular had come to netherlands with intention of taking over or dominating country also opposed to multicultural marriages and wanting to limit possibility of adoptions from third world cp generally sought a return to old dutch society with its singular dutch culture according to political scientist cas mudde party s ideology is best described as civic nationalism nevertheless by 1994 party had moved more towards ethnic nationalism by asserting that its program began from indissoluble unity and solidarity of dutch ethnic community based on common history and culture that originated from that history mudde 2003 pp 132 134 foreign policy centre democrats opposed any limitation of sovereignty of dutch state and was thus skeptical of european union and european integration seeing maastricht treaty as one of many international defeats inflicted on dutch government while it generally described international organizations such as united nations as superfluous and inefficient bureaucracies it supported nato as a means of keeping west safe from communism mudde 2003 pp 139 140 in its 1998 program centre democrats included a call for reunification with flanders and other dutch speaking territories thereby promoting idea of a greater netherlands society while party did not originally place heavy emphasis on ethical issues it did see family as cornerstone of society by 1994 it had become more conservative stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values over years it also sought to make divorce more difficult particularly for families with children party also lent much space to discussing aids virus which it put in context of a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality economic party s economic policies did not deviate substantially from generally supported mixed economy of netherlands its other demands did not have a strong ideological coherency mudde 2003 p 135 supporting a generous welfare state for dutch people it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in economy notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative or overspending on subsidies mudde 2003 p 141 organisation original scientific bureau or think tank of centre democrats was stichting foundation for scientific elaboration of centre democratic ideology in 1992 its name was changed to thomas hobbes stichting thomas hobbes foundation after janmaat s favorite political philosopher young centre democrats jonge centrumdemocraten became youth organization of centre democrats having originally been founded as youth wing of centre party in early 1980s it was later succeeded by cd youth cd which was based almost exclusively in haarlem area centre democrats did not attract many youngsters nor did it establish a particularly active youth organization most of far right youth tended to join cp 86 mudde 2003 pp 127 128 over time centre democrats published a variety of party papers of varying quality centrumtaal and middenkoers were original newspapers first published in 1986 although former was intended for general party news and latter aimed at a more intellectual readership they did not differ much in content by 1987 1988 centrumtaal was more or less succeeded by cd info and middenkoers by cd actueel cd actueel was distributed for last time in 1993 with cd info succeeded by cd in 1997 although in later years it had been published less and less frequently mudde 2003 pp 129 130 international relations cd regarded itself as related to other european patriotic parties but its official contact was limited to german people s union french national front and belgian vlaams blok party regularly attended annual meetings of german people s union and national front and janmaat spoke of his good contacts with latter party s leader jean marie le pen relations with vlaams blok created a conflict of interest given vb s arguably better contacts with cp 86 centre democrats main rival in netherlands even so centre democrats maintained official contacts domestically with both centre party and its successor cp 86 mudde 2003 p 128 election results house of representatives house of representatives election year of total votes of overall vote of seats won 1986 12 277 0 1 0
