imme r100 was a lightweight motorcycle made by riedel ag from 1948 to 1951 it is noted for its simple and innovative design with many advanced features with low cost and technical innovation r100 sold well but reliability problems and low profit margins resulted in warranty costs driving riedel ag into bankruptcy advanced specification of imme r100 caused it to be highly regarded r100 was one of motorcycles included in art of motorcycle exhibition at solomon r guggenheim museum in 1998 and is on permanent display at barber vintage motorsports museum concept design and engineering thumb left imme r100 rear suspension and swingarm exhaust pipe a spare wheel is mounted on left side of rear wheel motorcycle engineer norbert riedel recognized need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during germany s recovery from second world war and began to design one by summer of 1947 a prototype frame had been built and tested spine frame was made from 40 mm steel tubing as were steering head single sided front fork and single sided swingarm wheels were interchangeable and were mounted from left on stub axles attached to suspension on right riedel developed engine at same time this was a piston ported two stroke single cylinder engine of capacity engine was cast in light alloy around cylinder liner and had an integral cylinder head crankshaft was suspended on only one side power output of engine was at 5 800 rpm which was considered a high output at time contemporary engines of comparable size typically made about and 4 5 ps was expected from 125 cc engines such as those used in rt 125 and later hoffmann vespa transmission had three speeds with no neutral position a mechanism held clutch open when motorcycle was at idle in first gear first gear was positioned in middle of shift pattern with second gear below and third gear above engine and transmission were mounted together on swingarm in front of pivot axle at bottom of spine frame near horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a power egg style which would later be used by benelli and tubular swingarm also served as exhaust pipe behind pivot axle swingarm reinforced rear fender and supports for rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported rear spring this suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate test rides on complete prototype began in december 1947 and showed that combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping friction dampers were added production marketing and demise norbert riedel registered riedel ag in 1948 he moved his facilities from to and began production there in june 1948 it is widely believed that name imme came from an abbreviation of this location and that imme s bee on wheels logo came from imme being a dialect word meaning bee however it has also been suggested that name came from motorcycle itself resembling a bee or from engine sounding like a buzzing bee thumb imme r100 engine imme r100 s light weight relatively powerful engine and long travel suspension made it popular in motorsport this along with good marketing and low pricing led to strong sales management of riedel ag expected high sales volume to offset low profit margin a basic imme sold for 775 deutschmark without battery or centre stand passenger accommodation was an optional extra as was a spare wheel initially were all painted oxide red in 1950 a better equipped export version became available for 850 deutschmark with a battery an electric horn a centre stand a speedometer a more comfortable seat chrome plating pinstriping and a choice of colours including lime green and gloss black production of imme r100 had gone up to 1 000 per month and by autumn of 1950 more than 10 000 had been sold imme engines were also sold to fritz fend to power his fend flitzer invalid carriages these replaced fichtel sachs engines used in earlier versions of flitzer however imme began to develop problems especially with single sided crankshaft bearings and for kick starter riedel corrected problem beginning with model d version which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings however profit from sales was not enough to cover warranty expenses and by end of 1950 riedel ag went bankrupt with debts of 1 25 million deutschmark legacy thumb a zmg imme at time of riedel ags bankruptcy three prototypes of an imme with a 150 cc parallel twin two stroke engine had been made fritz philipps who had been a senior executive at riedel ag formed motoren und gmbh zmg to supply parts and perform repairs on imme motorcycles zmg also set up to manufacture an imme with a 175 cc straight twin two stroke engine but made only 25 before they ended production imme r100 is noted for its simple and innovative design its advanced features include single sided suspension front and rear interchangeable wheels front and rear with option of a spare tyre complete drivetrain mounted on swingarm and swingarm tube used as exhaust pipe remarking on r100 being displayed in solomon r guggenheim museum exhibition art of motorcycle guilfoyle curatorial adviser at museum said it s my favourite unknown
