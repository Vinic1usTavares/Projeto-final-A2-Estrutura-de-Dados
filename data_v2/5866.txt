newberry volcano is a large active shield shaped stratovolcano located about south of bend oregon united states east of major crest of cascade range within newberry national volcanic monument its highest point is paulina peak largest volcano in cascade volcanic arc newberry has an area of when its lava flows are taken into account from north to south volcano has a length of with a width of and a total volume of approximately it was named for geologist and surgeon john strong newberry who explored central oregon for pacific railroad surveys in 1855 surrounding area has been inhabited by native american populations for more than 10 000 years volcano contains a large caldera in diameter known as newberry caldera within caldera are two lakes paulina lake and east lake volcano and its vicinity include many pyroclastic cones lava flows and lava domes newberry has more than 400 vents most of any volcano in contiguous united states glaciers may have once been present at volcano though this remains contested area has a dry climate with low precipitation levels and little surface runoff origin of volcano remains somewhat unclear while some scientists believe it originated from an independent hotspot most evidence indicates that it formed from subduction of oceanic juan de fuca and gorda tectonic plates under continental north american plate eruptive activity at newberry volcano began about 600 000 years ago and has continued into holocene last eruption taking place 1 300 years ago unlike other shield shaped volcanoes which often erupt basaltic lavas only newberry volcano has also erupted andesitic and rhyolitic lavas a popular destination for hiking fishing boating and other recreational activities volcano lies within of 16 400 people and within of nearly 200 000 people and it continues to pose a threat to life still considered an active volcano it could erupt and produce lava flows pyroclastic flows lahars volcanically induced mudslides landslides and debris flows ashfall earthquakes avalanches and floods to track this threat volcano and its surroundings are closely monitored with sensors by united states geological survey geography thumb upright 1

center of state under three sisters and above crater lake mount mazama center of newberry volcano lies to south of city of bend at intersection of deschutes klamath and lake counties in oregon where it is one of most accessible volcanoes in state it is largest volcano in cascade volcanic arc and has roughly same area as state of rhode island at if its lava flows are included newberry lies east of major crest of cascade range in high lava plains region rising above its surroundings from north to south volcano runs for a length of with a width of and a total volume of about because of its enormous size and topographic prominence it is often confused for an entire mountain range newberry volcano has an extremely dry climate due to its location in rain shadow of cascade range climate data for newberry national volcanic monument are collected at lava butte cinder cone which had an average annual precipitation of from 2002 to 2012 summer temperatures average from dipping to average minimum and maximum temperatures of during winter season spring has average temperatures of while fall temperatures average each year total precipitation consisting of winter snow and summer rain varies from in highest parts of region and surface runoff rarely occurs even during heavy rain showers only one stream appears on newberry s entire surface and it remains unclear whether volcano has ever been able to support glaciers on its slopes since mountain lacks cirques amphitheater like valleys formed by glacial erosion or evidence of contact between lava and ice however displaced glacial erratics have been found far from their native areas moraine sediment has been deposited on eastern and northeastern slopes of volcano and mountain s various cone features have boat shapes that indicate glacial alteration precise history of glaciers on volcano is debated but dry channels and dry waterfalls on eastern and western slopes are evidence that volcano once held water volcano has two crater lakes paulina lake and east lake which are filled by precipitation and percolation of ground water paulina lake occupies an area of and reaches a maximum depth of and it is separated from east lake by a narrow isthmus a piece of land connecting two larger areas across an expanse of water by which they are otherwise separated which is composed of rhyolite lava east lake has a smaller area of with a maximum depth of lakes have historically flooded channels surrounding volcano a large flood between 4 000 and 2 300 years ago released up to 12 000 acre feet 0 0148 km3 in volume from paulina lake filling valley floor above paulina prairie which surrounds lake it was possibly caused by failure of a rock ledge in height rather than eruptive activity another flood took place in 1909 on deschutes river downstream from where it meets its tributary little deschutes river ecology newberry national volcanic monument forms part of northern section of mazama ecological province which has soil comprised by aeolian pumice and volcanic products over basalt bedrock flora within newberry volcano area includes forests of juniper whitebark pine ponderosa pine including oregon s largest ponderosa pine tree lodgepole pine jack pine and white fir in addition to other plants like indian paintbrush purple penstemon bitterbrush manzanita and infestations by mountain pine beetles have killed many lodgepole pines in area animals near newberry volcano include burrowing owls kangaroo rats lizards bats rattlesnakes eagles porcupines otters bobcats mule deer roosevelt elk ducks and american pika lava flows from newberry display varied vegetation cover and there are variable levels of flora between flows though level of vegetation and species diversity generally increase with elevation dominant plant species on lava flows include and wax currant with rabbitbrush also common though forbs are not widespread on lava flows where they do occur davidson s penstemon and penstemon dominate above elevations of is common particularly near edges of lava flows all lava flows support patches of grasses such as idaho fescue especially on north facing slopes one lava flow at lava butte is barren except for scattered dense patches of greenleaf manzanita lava cast forest is a group of trees molded by lava from an eruption 6 000 years ago today surrounding site lies within newberry national volcanic monument and includes 11 plots of land surrounded by one or more younger lava flows these habitat islands range from in area and sustain forests that have not been significantly altered by humans other than nearby fire suppression and land management efforts consisting of pure and mixed forest stands these forests include ponderosa pine lodgepole pine and grand

also known as high lava plains newberry volcano lies within a cenozoic highland marked by normal faults known as brothers fault zone it is situated at intersection of brothers fault zone with north northwest trending sisters and northeast trending walker rim fault zones in mantle under newberry volcano p and s seismic waves exhibit an unusually low wave velocity earth s crust thins from at nearby three sisters volcano complex to near newberry where it has a high poisson s ratio oldest rocks in this region include silicic rich in silica lava domes from late miocene or early pliocene which lie near province s eastern and southern borders respectively volcanism in this area suggests a progression of silicic eruptions known as newberry trend that moves in a northwest trending direction from harney basin to newberry volcano and rest of cascade range newberry volcano s origins are somewhat controversial some scientists think it originated from an independent hotspot but overwhelming evidence suggests that it is part of cascades arc and was produced by subduction of oceanic juan de fuca and gorda tectonic plates under continental north american plate however newberry volcano has been transformed by tectonic processes possibly related to mechanisms that enhance melting of juan de fuca tectonic plate high lava plains trend or newberry trend moves at an oblique angle to underlying north american tectonic plate for which subduction gravitational flow along lithosphere s base faulting and extension of basin and range province have all been proposed as possible mechanisms at newberry subducting plate has a depth that is shallower than elsewhere in major crest of cascades accounting for its unique magmas newberry volcano is likely fed by a magma chamber under large cauldron like caldera at its summit this caldera has dimensions of and formed about 75 000 years ago newberry volcano first formed about 600 000 years ago and has since been built up by several thousand eruptions about 500 000 years ago mount newberry attained an elevation of caldera forming event occurred about 75 000 years ago from a major explosive eruption it formed crater lakes and paulina peak which is highest point on volcano at as a result of its caldera forming eruption newberry has a horizontal profile which is typical of a shield volcano however it is also considered a composite volcano made up of a matrix of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits unlike more typical composite volcanoes in cascades it formed from several eruption types including more traditional explosive eruptions and more fluid effusive events thus it is usually classified as a shield shaped composite volcano or shield shaped stratovolcano volcano has a caldera at its summit which has a diameter of and features two crater lakes paulina lake and east lake this caldera known as newberry crater is forested with small parts of its surface covered with lava flows and pumice deposits before caldera s creation mountain s summit was greater in height than its current elevation caldera has reformed several times throughout volcano s history burying caldera floor to a depth of and creating concentric calderas each smaller than its predecessor first caldera volcano s largest caldera forming approximately 300 000 years ago was produced by eruption of of pyroclastic ejecta which created tepee draw tuff and ash deposits that cover volcano s eastern flank last crater formed after an explosive eruption about 80 000 years ago which ejected up to of pyroclastic materials throughout this progression volcano shifted from rhyodacitic pumice to basaltic ash flows latter producing black lapilli tuff that covers western side of volcano since last caldera forming eruption 80 000 years ago volcano has undergone silicic eruptions at caldera and produced basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows that extended down its outer flanks tephra and ash from black lapilli tuff by caldera formed around its rim newberry volcano is cut by several fault scarps small step offsets on ground surface where one side of a fault has moved vertically with respect to other at center of isthmus that separates newberry volcano s two crater lakes is central volcanic cone named central pumice cone which reaches above east lake with a broad flat top it formed during an explosive eruption about 7 000 years ago and sits in center of caldera compositionally lava from newberry volcano has varied from primitive basalts with high magnesium levels to more evolved tholeiitic and calc alkaline deposits based on major element characteristics of lavas primitive lavas exhibit high abundances of chromium and nickel as well as variable concentrations of fluid mobile elements like barium and strontium tholeiitic and calc alkaline lavas display overlap in magnesium calcium oxide and aluminum oxide levels but differ in that tholeiites have lower contents of silica and potassium oxide and higher iron ii oxide titanium dioxide and sodium oxide there is also much overlap in isotopic composition though tholeiitic lavas mark low point for 87sr 86sr and high point for 143nd 144nd and examination of newberry lavas with olivine plagioclase shows that tholeiites are anhydrous less than and thus distinct from calc alkaline deposits both have different fractional crystallization sequences that derive from primitive magmas which had their compositions influenced by equilibrium with peridotite in mantle by volume basaltic andesite is principal lava type at newberry volcano with large volumes of silicic lava among older ash flow tuff deposits subfeatures thumb right upright 1 6 lava butte a cinder cone produced by eruptions at newberry volcano alt conical volcano lava butte and its central crater are seen from above with volcano s right half forested while opposite side is largely barren an access road flanks cone vents at volcano follow north east and north west trends influenced by extension of basin and range province with more than 400 vents newberry has more individual subfeatures than any other volcano in contiguous united states these include cinder cones lava domes and various other lava edifices with at least 25 vents on volcano s flanks and summits becoming active within past 10 000 years most of cinder cones on volcano s edifice vary from in elevation though a number of them reach heights above with diameters greater than most of these exhibit saucer like summit depression landforms with notable exceptions at lava top and north kawak buttes which have craters that are in depth basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows have penetrated bases of many of these cinder cones forming a matrix of connected flows and a veneer of pahoehoe and a a lavas can be found on newberry volcano s northern and southern sides northern flank holds three distinct lava tube systems that formed out of pahoehoe lava horse lava tube system also known as horse system arnold lava tube system and lava top butte basalt about 7 000 years ago at newberry s northwest rift zone lava fountains erupted from a fissure with a length of yielding basaltic and andesitic lava flows strombolian eruptions which eject incandescent cinder lapilli and lava bombs produced tephra that formed lava butte a cinder cone near newberry with a height of a base diameter of and a crater depth of with a lopsided shape where northeastern rim is taller than southwestern counterpart this cinder cone sits south of bend nearby badlands shield volcano which formed out of a rootless vent to produce a large basaltic lava flow at newberry has a diameter of it has pahoehoe lava throughout its surface with tumuli mounds of earth and stones and a pit crater dacite and rhyodacite domes can be found on middle and upper flanks and newberry also features twenty rhyolitic lava domes and lava flows among its western eastern and southern flanks these include east butte and china hat at eastern base of volcano which date to 850 000 and 780 000 years ago and therefore predate newberry mckay butte found on volcano s western side formed 580 000 years ago other holocene eruptions have produced rhyolite lava that remained closed to summit including paulina peak which has a width of one mile and reaches within of wall of caldera hot springs can be found at paulina lake and east lake along with one fumarole gas vent at lost lake located near big obsidian lava flow these discharge gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide and give off a rotten smell though composition has few noxious components eruptive history thumb upright 1 35 map showing lava flows from newberry volcano alt a map shows extent of lava flows emanating from newberry volcano under extent of volcanic center itself during late pleistocene newberry volcano produced a number of voluminous lava flows made of basalt which originated from several vents on its northern flank and reached modern areas of bend and redmond they filled canyons that served as precursors for deschutes and crooked rivers since eroded and extended tens of miles from volcano lava from last of these eruptions about 78 000 years ago covered bend area surrounded pilot butte cinder cone and filled deschutes river bed in addition to its production of large lava flows newberry volcano has also produced a number of plinian eruptions similar to eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompeii and pelean eruptions like 1902 explosion of mount pelee these include a number of caldera forming eruptions producing ash flow deposits including tepee draw tuff and black lapilli tuff and rising or more into stratosphere last of these eruptions covered tens of thousands of square miles with ash extending to san francisco bay area in california nearly to southwest here it reaches a thickness of one centimeter additionally newberry has produced multiple voluminous explosive eruptions with certain studies estimating up to 60 eruptive events of rhyolite and dacite tephra that reach idaho utah and northern california these include eruption that produced paulina creek tephra between 55 000 and 50 000 years ago and eruption from 20 000 years ago responsible for tephra which extends into western nevada and east central california as a result of compositional zoning within magma chamber that feeds volcano its ash deposits may show different chemical and mineralogical makeups last of these tephra eruptions yielded newberry pumice just before 1 300 years ago reaching several hundred miles to east between last ice age about 12 000 years ago and 7 700 years ago volcano erupted at least 12 times mount mazama erupted 7 700 years ago producing volcanic ash and pumice that accumulated to a thickness of up to on newberry volcano covering many of lava flows on its slopes during three eruptive periods at newberry over past 7 500 years caldera has seen rhyolitic eruptions from seven individual vents about 7 000 years ago eruptions occurred along rift zone northwest of newberry volcano s caldera yielding 12 lava flows that encompassed an area of at about same time central pumice cone was produced by eruptions that also formed and game hut obsidian flows from a vent on cone s southern flank an eruption from a fissure zone at east lake 3 500 years ago yielded tephra and formed east lake obsidian lava flows volcano underwent its most recent eruptions 1 300 years ago producing big obsidian flow a silicic deposit it is made up of rhyolite and features a number of lava blocks although it is frequently cited as largest holocene obsidian formation in united states its area of and volume of actually place it fifth in nation eruptions which were both explosive and effusive began with a plinian explosion of pumice and tephra that covered caldera s eastern half and reached several hundred miles to east this deposit called newberry pumice reaches a thickness of up to from vent that produced it which is located at southern flank of caldera and a thickness of up to from volcano because of strong westerly winds tephra reached as far east as idaho this eruption also produced pyroclastic flows that left volcanic bombs in paulina lake recent activity and current threats though newberry volcano is currently quiet united states geological survey considers it an active volcano with a very high threat level hot springs within caldera remain active and small earthquakes have occurred within recent local history any future eruptions would likely show similar characteristics to eruptions from past 15 000 years ranging from effusive production of lava flows to explosive eruptions ejecting pumice and ash if future lava flows from newberry volcano are of comparable size to its late pleistocene eruptions they would bury settlements throughout central oregon region they would also likely destroy segments of u s route 97 disabling transportation in area in addition to likely ruining gas pipelines and power lines that extend electricity to california both of which would be accompanied by serious economic consequences flank lava flows which would likely be basaltic in origin might form lava fountains that could scatter cinders and lava for several thousand meters building cinder cones or initiating forest fires while flows themselves move at rates of per minute and thus could be escaped by animals and humans they would destroy stationary structures in their paths pyroclastic flows on other hand travel at speeds of and their violent force could incinerate or pulverize objects in their path or asphyxiate living things if another caldera forming eruption of similar magnitude to previous ones at volcano occurred pyroclastic flows could devastate area surrounding volcano for up to however pyroclastic flows have been rare at newberry tephra from explosive eruptions would short circuit electric transformers and power lines clog engine filters produce clouds that might yield lightning and pose a hazard to aircraft overhead it would also pose health hazards because ash particles can irritate eyes and when ingested lungs among other health issues because of water from two crater lakes eruptions at newberry volcano may become more explosive and more likely to produce pyroclastic flows moreover if pyroclastic flows mix with snow or water overflowing from crater lakes they could spawn lahars volcanically induced mudslides landslides and debris flows that could devastate paulina creek valley and reach la pine valley within 30 minutes threats from volcano pose hazards to about 16 400 people who live within and more than 180 000 people living within in addition to threats from volcanic activity at least one flood has taken place at newberry volcano in past though it may not have been a result of eruptive activity if lava flows from an eruption blocked deschutes river they might generate floods upstream by increasing water level and downstream once blockage clears earthquakes unrelated to volcanic activity also take place in oregon though they are usually less than 2 5 on richter magnitude scale volcanoes can also cause earthquakes reaching magnitudes up to 5 on richter scale which sometimes occur as swarms these clusters of tremors cause shaking of houses walls and windows and can crack plaster or walls in older buildings but rarely cause major damage powerful earthquakes close to magnitude 7 would cause damage independently but they would not cause newberry volcano to erupt unless it were already on verge of activity additional threats exist for rockfalls and avalanches if newberry volcano were to erupt it should be possible to detect increased seismic activity while increased production of volcanic gas would likely kill trees near volcano which scientists would quickly recognize before notifying emergency management agencies before 2011 newberry was monitored by just one seismic station that had been installed in 1987 and had only detected seven earthquakes within of volcano in 2011 scientists from cascades volcano observatory installed eight more seismic and deformation monitors in volcano s vicinity which has seen number of detectable earthquakes rise to 10 15 per year volcano continues to be closely monitored by united states geological survey which monitors a seismometer network with geophysics program at university of washington and regularly conducts leveling surveys to check for geological deformation that could suggest impending activity in addition to sampling geothermal areas there are gps instruments installed within volcano s vicinity to monitor any swelling that occurs as a result of underground movement of magma despite historical uplift at volcano deformation has remained continuously low in recent years human history thumb newberry volcano was named after john strong newberry pictured an american surgeon and geologist who explored central oregon in early 19th century though he never actually visited volcano itself alt black and white portrait of john strong newberry volcano s namesake area around newberry volcano has been inhabited by native american populations for more than 10 000 years though only intermittently as a result of eruptive activity at volcano and in surrounding area during an archaeological excavation near paulina lake in 1992 researchers discovered remnants of a central hearth and a housing structure with support posts and linear rock arrangements with dimensions of radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from site were dated to 11 000 years ago mountain s caldera was used to harvest obsidian which they used to sharpen arrowheads and tools and traded throughout pacific coast region for several thousand years first recorded white person to visit volcano was peter skene ogden a trapper who reached crater in 1826 in 1855 volcano s namesake john strong newberry a surgeon and geologist for williamson and abbot survey party visited central oregon while mapping local area for pacific railroad but never visited volcano paulina lake paulina creek and paulina peak are named after paulina a snake indian chief who headed raiding parties against whites during 1850s and 1860s before he was pursued and shot by settler howard maupin near end of 19th century lava river cave was used by hunter leander dillman to store perishable foods name mount newberry was proposed by israel russell who visited area in 1903 though name did not come into use instead it was known as newberry crater until it was renamed to newberry volcano in 1930s by geologist howel williams a name which was formally accepted in 2003 when geologist larry chitwood supported it through official geographic naming process because of efforts of hollis dole head of oregon department of geology to promote area in 1963 nasa scientists became interested in using lava fields at newberry to prepare for united states first moon landing nasa used area in october 1964 and july 1966 to geologically train apollo astronauts in recognizing volcanic features such as cinder and pumice cones lava flows ash and obsidian flows and a lava tube astronauts who would use this training on moon included apollo 11 s neil armstrong and buzz aldrin apollo 12 s alan bean apollo 14 s edgar mitchell apollo 15 s james irwin and apollo 16 s charlie duke notable geologist instructors included aaron waters newberry national volcanic monument was established in november 1990 by united states congress with an area of more than it forms a near circular shape around summit caldera and then a long corridor from mountain s northwestern side to deschutes river that includes a rift zone monument lies within deschutes national forest which is managed by united states forest service as of 1997 caldera area of newberry holds seven campgrounds two resort areas and six summer houses mining and geothermal energy because newberry has had recent eruptive activity has remained active for a long time and has a shallow heat source feeding hot springs it represents a source of geothermal energy an investigation conducted by united states geological survey in 1981 drilled a well in depth at a location to east of big obsidian flow finding temperatures of under surface there an energy company drilled two holes with a depth of in 1995 and 1996 but they were unable to find fluids so they lacked a mechanism to drive turbines and opted to end project at newberry according to many scientists newberry volcano represents best geothermal energy candidate in pacific northwest in 2012 a deep well was built to determine whether water directed into hole might be heated and returned to surface in order to yield energy recreation thumb right upright 1 6 a hiker under arched ceilings of a
