thumb upright 1 front page of u s armed forces newspaper stars and stripes on 2 may 1945 adolf hitler was an austrian german politician who was leader of nazi party chancellor of germany from 1933 to 1945 and fuhrer leader of nazi germany from 1934 to 1945 he killed himself by gunshot on 30 april 1945 in his fuhrerbunker in berlin eva braun his wife of one day committed suicide with him by taking cyanide in accordance with hitler s prior written and verbal instructions that afternoon their remains were carried up stairs through bunker s emergency exit doused in petrol and set alight in reich chancellery garden outside bunker records in soviet archives show that their burned remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1946 they were exhumed again and cremated in 1970 and ashes were scattered accounts differ as to cause of death one version states that he died by poison only and another view claims that he died by a self inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile different conclusions one eyewitness stated that hitler s corpse showed signs of having been shot through mouth but this has been proven unlikely dental remains found on hitler s corpse were matched with his dental records in 1945 for political reasons soviet union presented various versions of hitler s fate they maintained in years immediately following war that hitler was not dead but had fled and was being shielded by former western allies preceding events by early 1945 germany was on verge of total military collapse poland had fallen to advancing soviet red army who were preparing to cross oder between kustrin and frankfurt with

american forces to reach berlin by 11 april americans crossed elbe to west of city on 16 april soviet forces to east crossed oder and commenced battle for seelow heights last major defensive line protecting berlin on that side by 19 april germans were in full retreat from seelow heights leaving no front line berlin was bombarded by soviet artillery for first time on 20 april which was also hitler s birthday by evening of 21 april red army tanks reached outskirts of city at afternoon situation conference on 22 april hitler suffered a total nervous collapse when he was informed that orders he had issued previous day for ss general felix steiner s army detachment steiner to counterattack had not been obeyed hitler launched a tirade against treachery and incompetence of his commanders which culminated in a declaration for first time that war was lost hitler announced that he would stay in berlin until end and then shoot himself later that day he asked ss physician dr werner haase about most reliable method of suicide haase suggested pistol and poison method of combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to head luftwaffe chief reichsmarschall hermann goring learned about this and sent a telegram to hitler asking for permission to take over leadership of reich in accordance with hitler s 1941 decree naming him as his successor hitler s secretary martin bormann convinced hitler that goring was threatening a coup in response hitler informed goring that he would be executed unless he resigned all of his posts later that day he sacked goring from all of his offices and ordered his arrest by 27 april berlin was cut off from rest of germany secure radio communications with defending units had been lost command staff in bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information on 28 april hitler received a bbc report originating from reuters report stated that reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler had offered to surrender to western allies offer was declined himmler had implied to allies that he had authority to negotiate a surrender and hitler considered this treason that afternoon hitler s anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against himmler hitler ordered himmler s arrest and had hermann fegelein himmler s ss representative at hitler s headquarters shot by this time red army had advanced to potsdamer platz and all indications were that they were preparing to storm chancellery this report and himmler s treachery prompted hitler to make last decisions of his life shortly after midnight on 29 april he married eva braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within fuhrerbunker hitler then hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife after which he took secretary traudl junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament it left instructions to be carried out immediately following his death with grand admiral karl donitz and joseph goebbels assuming hitler s roles as head of state and chancellor respectively he signed these documents at 04 00 and then went to bed some sources say that he dictated last will and testament

executed by italian partisans bodies of mussolini and his mistress clara petacci had been strung up by their heels corpses were later cut down and thrown into gutter where they were mocked by italian dissenters these events may have strengthened hitler s resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be made a spectacle of as he had earlier recorded in his testament doubting efficacy of cyanide capsules distributed by ss physician dr ludwig stumpfegger hitler ordered dr haase to test one on his dog blondi who died as a result suicide hitler and braun lived together as husband and wife in

quarters late in morning with soviets less than from bunker hitler had a meeting with general helmuth weidling commander of berlin defence area he told hitler that garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night and that fighting in berlin would inevitably come to an end within next 24 hours weidling asked hitler for permission for a break out this was a request he had unsuccessfully made before hitler did not answer and weidling went back to his headquarters in at about 13 00 he received hitler s permission to try a break out that night hitler two secretaries and his personal
