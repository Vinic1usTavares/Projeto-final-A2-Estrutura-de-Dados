sir matthew hale 1 november 1609 25 december 1676 was an influential english barrister judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise historia placitorum coronae or history of pleas of crown born to a barrister and his wife who had both died by time he was 5 hale was raised by his father s relative a strict puritan and inherited his faith in 1626 he matriculated at magdalen hall oxford now hertford college intending to become a priest but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a serjeant at law in a dispute over his estate on 8 november 1628 he joined lincoln s inn where he was called to bar on 17 may 1636 as a barrister hale represented a variety of royalist figures during prelude and duration of english civil war including thomas wentworth and william laud it has been hypothesised that hale was to represent charles i at his state trial and conceived defence charles used despite royalist loss hale s reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions and under commonwealth of england he was made chairman of hale commission which investigated law reform following commission s dissolution oliver cromwell made him a justice of common pleas as a judge hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld law he sat in parliament either in commons or upper house in every parliament from first protectorate parliament to convention parliament and following declaration of breda was member of parliament who moved to consider charles ii s reinstatement as monarch sparking english restoration under charles hale was made first chief baron of exchequer and then chief justice of king s bench in both positions he was again noted for his integrity although not as a particularly innovative judge following a bout of illness he retired on 20 february 1676 dying ten months later on 25 december 1676 hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist with his central legacy coming through his written work published after his death his historia placitorum coronae dealing with capital offences against crown is considered of highest authority while his analysis of common law is noted as first published history of english law and a strong influence on william blackstone s commentaries on laws of england hale s jurisprudence struck a middle ground between edward coke s appeal to reason and john selden s appeal to contract while refuting elements of thomas hobbes s theory of natural law his thoughts on marital rape expressed in historia continued in english law until 1991 and he was cited in court as recently as 2009 life early life and education hale was born on 1 november 1609 in west end house now known as grange or alderley grange in alderley gloucestershire to robert hale a barrister of lincoln s inn and joanna poyntz hostettler 2002 p 1 his father gave up his practice as a barrister several years before hale s birth because he could not understand reason of giving colour in pleadings burnet 1820 p 2 this refers to a process through which defendant would refer a case over validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury through claiming a false allegation about this right such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact and as such decided by judge with no reference to jurors hostettler 2002 p 2 although in common use robert hale apparently saw this as deceptive and contrary to exactness of truth and justice which became a christian so that he withdrew himself from inns of court to live on his estate in country john hostettler in his biography of matthew hale points out that his father s concerns about giving colour in pleadings could not have been very strong since he not only retired to his estate at alderley where he managed to live on his wife s inherited income but also directed in his will that matthew should make a career in law both of hale s parents died before he was five joanna in 1612 berman 1994 p 1703 and robert in 1614 cromartie 1995 p 1 it was then revealed that robert had been so generous in giving money to poor that at his death his estate provided only ps100 of income a year of which ps20 was to be paid to local poor hale thus passed into care of anthony kingscot one of his father s relatives burnet 1820 p 3 a strong puritan kingscot had hale taught by a mr stanton vicar of wotton known as scandalous vicar due to his extremist puritan views hostettler 2002 p 4 on 20 october 1626 cromartie 1995 p 2 at age of 16 hale matriculated at university of oxford as a member of magdalen hall with goal of becoming a priest both kingscot and stanton had intended this to be his career and his education had been conducted with that in mind flanders 1908 p 385 he was taught by obadiah sedgwick another puritan and excelled in both his studies and fencing hale also regularly attended church private prayer meetings and was described as simple in his attire and rather aesthetic campbell 2005 p 408 after a company of actors came to oxford hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer and he began to turn away from puritanism in light of this he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier his relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest or even a lawyer with hale describing lawyers as a barbarous set of people unfit for anything but their own trade his plans to become a soldier died after a legal battle concerning his estate in which he consulted john glanville glanville successfully persuaded hale to become a lawyer and after leaving oxford at age of 20 before obtaining a degree he joined lincoln s inn on 8 november 1628 hostettler 2002 p 5 fearing that theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at oxford he swore never to see a stage play again campbell 2005 p 409 at around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted hale prayed to god to forgive and save his friend and forgive him for his previous excesses his friend recovered and hale was restored to his puritan faith never drinking to someone s health again not even drinking to king and going to church every sunday for 36 years he instead settled into his studies working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at lincoln s inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns hostettler 2002 p 6 as well as reading law reports and statutes hale also studied roman civil law and jurisprudence campbell 2005 p 411 outside of law hale studied anatomy history philosophy and mathematics he refused to read news or attend social events and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church flanders 1908 p 387 civil war commonwealth and protectorate barrister thumb left 140px william noy whom hale served as a pupil alt an image of william noy top portion of image is taken up by a portrait of noy who wears a ruffed collar and has a handlebar moustache and goatee bottom of image has an inscription which reads william noy attorney general to king charles first on 17 may 1636 hale was called to bar by lincoln s inn and immediately became pupil of william noy hostettler 2002 p 12 hale and noy became close friends to point where he was referred to as young noy burnet 1820 p 12 and more crucially he also met and befriended john selden a man of almost universal learning whose theories were to dominate much of hale s later thought cromartie 1995 p 3 selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside law and much of hale s written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory holdsworth 1923 p 403 hale gained a good legal practice although he allowed his christian faith to govern his work he sought to help court reach a just verdict whatever his client s concerns and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate hostettler 2002 pp 15 6 he refused to accept unjust cases and always tried to be on right side of any case john campbell wrote that if he saw that a cause was unjust he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so if parties after that would go on they were to seek another counsellor for he would assist none in acts of injustice campbell 2005 p 412 13 despite this he was wealthy enough to purchase land worth ps4 200 in 1648 he was in great demand law reporters began recording his cases and in 1641 he advised thomas wentworth first earl of strafford over his attainder for high treason although unsuccessful hale was then called to represent william laud archbishop of canterbury during his impeachment by house of lords in october 1644 hostettler 2002 p 19 hale along with john herne argued that none of laud s alleged offences constituted treason and that treason act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons john wilde arguing for prosecution admitted that none of laud s actions amounted to treason but argued that all of them together did herne in his arguments written by hale retorted that i crave your mercy wilde i never understood before this time that two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse case against laud began to fail but parliament issued an act of attainder which declared him guilty and sentenced him to death hostettler 2002 p 20 after capture of charles i hale was expected to defend him and indeed offered to do so king refused to submit to court claiming he did not recognise its jurisdiction burnet 1820 p 20 edward foss writes based on statement of charles that it was hale who actually provided king with this defence and that it was only because defence prevented any counsel being called for king that hale did not appear in court foss 2000 p 320 when it became clear that king was losing civil war and only oxford held out hale decided to act as a commissioner to negotiate its surrender fearing that city might otherwise be destroyed campbell 2005 p 414 thanks to his intercession honourable terms were reached and libraries preserved campbell 2005 p 415 despite practising in politically charged environment of english civil war and primarily defending opponents of resulting commonwealth of england hale s reputation did not suffer first he largely kept out of war even ignoring news of its progress and instead translating life and death of pomponious atticus into english hostettler 2002 p 25 second he was acknowledged as universally able and of high integrity during his cases retorting to those who complained of his defence of royalists that he was pleading in defence of laws which they professed they would maintain and preserve and that he was doing his duty to his client and was not to be daunted by such hostettler 2002 p 29 hale commission during rule of both commonwealth and protectorate there was considerable desire for law reform many judges and lawyers were corrupt and criminal law followed no real reason or philosophy any felony was punishable by death proceedings were in a form of norman french and judges regularly imprisoned juries for reaching a verdict they disagreed with hostettler 2002 p 37 oliver cromwell and rump parliament aimed to establish a new society which included reforming law to that end on 30 january 1652 hale was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate law reform which soon became known as hale commission commission s official remit was defined by commons taking into consideration what inconveniences there are in law and how which grow from delays and irregularities in proceedings in law may be prevented and speediest way to reform same and to present their opinions to such committee as parliament shall appoint hostettler 2002 p 39 commission consisted of eight lawyers and 13 laymen which sat from 23 january approximately three times a week hostettler 2002 p 40 commission recommended various changes such as reducing use of death penalty allowing defendants access to legal counsel legal aid and abolition of peine forte et dure as a torture mechanism hostettler 2002 p 43 dissolved on 23 july 1652 after producing 16 bills none of commission s recommendations immediately made it into law although two to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages were brought into force through statutes by barebone s parliament fritze 1996 p 221 almost all of recommendations eventually became part of english law with john hostettler in his biography of hale writing that if measures had been put into law immediately we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and concept of justice hostettler 2002 p 50 justice of common pleas oliver cromwell noting hale s abilities asked him to become a justice of common pleas burnet 1820 p 21 although hale considered that taking this commission would make others think he supported commonwealth he was persuaded to do so replacing john puleston burnet 1820 p 22 only serjeants at law could become judges and as such hale was made a serjeant on 25 january 1653 hostettler 2002 p 53 he was formally appointed a justice of court of common pleas one of three principal westminster courts on 31 january 1653 sainty 1993 p 76 on condition that he would not be required to acknowledge usurper s authority he also refused to put people to death for offences against government he believed that because government authorising him to do so was an illegal one putting men to death on that account was murder burnet 1820 p 23 william blackstone later wrote that if judgment of death be given by a judge not authorized by lawful commission and execution is done accordingly judge is guilty of murder and upon this argument sir matthew hale himself though he accepted place of a judge of common pleas under cromwell s government yet declined to sit on crown side at assizes and try prisoners having very strong objections to legality of usurper s commission burnet 1820 p 24 hale also made decisions which negatively impacted on commonwealth executing a soldier for murdering a civilian in 1655 burnet 1820 p 26 and actively refusing to attend a court hearing outside term time burnet 1820 p 28 on another occasion cromwell personally selected a jury in a trial he was concerned with something contrary to law as a result hale dismissed jury and refused to hear case hostettler 2002 p 54 on 15 may 1659 hale chose to retire and was replaced by john archer foss 1865 p 64 member of parliament right thumb richard cromwell who summoned third protectorate parliament alt a circular portrait of richard cromwell cromwell has shoulder length blonde hair and is wearing silver armour on 3 september 1654 first protectorate parliament was called of 400 english members only two were lawyers hooke a baron of exchequer and hale who was elected member of parliament for his home county of gloucestershire history of parliament online hale matthew hale was an active mp persuading commons to reject a motion to destroy tower of london s archives and introducing several motions to preserve authority of parliament hostettler 2002 p 64 first was that government should be in a parliament and a single person limited and restrained as parliament should think fit and he later proposed that english council of state be subject to re election every three years by house of commons that militia should be controlled by parliament and that supplies should only be granted to army for limited periods while these proposals got support cromwell refused to allow any mps into commons until they signed an oath recognising his authority which hale refused to do as such none of them were passed dissatisfied with first protectorate parliament cromwell dissolved it on 22 january 1655 hostettler 2002 p 65 a second protectorate parliament was called on 17 september 1656 which wrote a constitution titled humble petition and advice that called for creation of an upper house to perform job of former house of lords cromwell accepted this constitution and in december 1657 nominated upper house s members hale as a judge was called to it this new house s extensive jurisdiction and authority was immediately questioned by commons and cromwell responded by dissolving parliament on 4 february 1658 hostettler 2002 p 69 on 3 september 1658 oliver cromwell died and was replaced by his son richard cromwell richard cromwell summoned a new parliament on 27 january 1659 and hale was returned as mp for oxford university richard cromwell was a weak leader however and ruled for only 8 months before resigning on 16 march 1660 general monck forced parliament to vote for its own dissolution and call new elections hostettler 2002 p 71 2 at same time charles ii made declaration of breda and when convention parliament met on 25 april 1660 with hale a member from gloucestershire again it immediately began negotiations with king hale moved in commons that a committee might be appointed to look into overtures that had been made and concessions that had been offered by charles i and from thence to digest such propositions as they should think fit to be sent over to charles ii who was still in breda hostettler 2002 p 73 on 1 may parliament restored king and charles ii landed in dover three weeks later prompting english restoration hostettler 2002 p 74 english restoration chief baron and chief justice left thumb hale as chief justice of king s bench alt a black and white head and shoulders portrait of hale as chief justice he is wearing robes and has a chain fastened around his shoulders an inscription under image reads sir matthew hale chief justice of king s bench born in alderley under edge in nov 1 1609 hale s first task in new regime was as part of special commission of 37 judges who tried 29 regicides not included in declaration of breda between 9 and 19 october 1660 hostettler 2002 p 76 all were found guilty of treason and 10 of them were hanged drawn and quartered sitting as a judge in this trial led to some viewing hale as hypocritical with f a later writing i confess to a feeling of pain at finding hale in october 1660 sitting as a judge at old bailey trying and condemning to death batches of regicides men under whose orders he had himself acted who had been his colleagues in parliament with whom he had sat on committees to alter law hostettler 2002 p 77 perhaps as reward for this he became chief baron of exchequer on 7 november 1660 replacing sir orlando bridgeman sainty 1993 p 96 hale had no wish to receive knighthood that accompanied this appointment and so tried to avoid being near king in response lord chancellor lord clarendon invited him to his house where king was present hale was knighted on spot hostettler 2002 p 78 there were many instances of parties to a case attempting to bribe hale when a duke approached him before a case to help judge understand a case that was to come before him hale said that he would only hear about cases in court in another case he was sent venison by a party after noticing man s name and verifying that he had indeed sent hale some venison hale refused to let case proceed until he had paid man for food hostettler 2002 p 84 when sir john croke suspected in engaging in a conspiracy sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case hale remarked that i cannot think that sir john believes that king s justices come into country to take bribes some other person having a design to put a trick upon him sent them in his name hostettler 2002 p 85 hale returned loaves and refused to continue until croke appeared before him hostettler 2002 p 86 hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety and through doing so secured confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen flanders 1908 p 393 his knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of law and lord nottingham considered father of equity worshipped hale as a great master corbett 1942 p 166 on 2 september 1666 great fire of london broke out hostettler 2002 p 109 over 100 000 people were made homeless and by time fire ended over 13 000 houses and 400 streets had been destroyed hostettler 2002 p 111 an act of parliament enacted on 8 february 1667 constituted a court of fire tasked with dealing with property disputes over ownership liability and rebuilding of city hostettler 2002 p 112 hale was tasked with sitting in this court which met in clifford s inn and heard 140 of 374 cases court dealt with during its first year in operation hostettler 2002 p 113 on 18 may 1671 hale was made chief justice of king s bench after death of john sainty 1993 p 11 edward turnour replaced him as chief baron of exchequer foss 1865 p 67 hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative roger north wrote that i have known court of king s bench sitting every day from eight to 12 and lord chief justice hale s managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to students and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride he encouraged arguing when it was to purpose and used to debate with counsel so that court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as seat of justice hostettler 2002 p 136 he was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up hostettler 2002 p 135 he disliked eloquence writing that if judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but a waste of time and loss of words and if they are weak and easily wrought upon it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and their affections as a judge however he was noted by lord nottingham as greatest orator on bench hostettler 2002 p 138 retirement and death by 1675 hale had begun to suffer from ill health his arms became swollen and although a course of bloodletting relieved pain temporarily by next february his legs were so stiff he could not walk hostettler 2002 p 141 his initial attempts to resign as chief justice were declined by king but when hale applied for a writ of ease king reluctantly allowed him to retire on 20 february 1676 flanders 1908 p 394 granting him a pension of ps1 000 a year hostettler 2002 p 142 he was replaced as chief justice by richard foss 1865 p 66 after suffering for ten more months hale died on 25 december 1676 at his country home lower house now site of present day alderley house he was buried next to his first wife s tomb in churchyard of st kenelm s church which adjoined his home at alderley with a monument erected that reads his estate was largely left for his widow with his legal texts given to his grandson gabriel if gabriel chose to study law and his more valuable manuscripts and books given to lincoln s inn hostettler 2002 p 146 male line of his family died out in 1784 with death of matthew hale his great grandson also a barrister hostettler 2002 p 148 personal life in 1642 hale married anne moore daughter of sir henry moore a royalist soldier and granddaughter of sir francis moore a serjeant at law under james i hostettler 2002 p 18 moore and hale had 10 children but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman with hale warning his children that an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain though she bring a great portion geis 1978 p 29 moore died in 1658 and in 1667 hale married anne bishop his housekeeper descriptions of bishop differ roger north wrote that hale was unfortunate in his family for he married his own servant made and then for an excuse said there was no wisdom below girdle hostettler 2002 p 117 richard baxter on other hand described anne as one of hale s own judgment and temper prudent and loving and fit to please him and that would not draw on him trouble of much acquaintance and relations hale himself described her as a most dutiful faithful and loving wife who was appointed an executrix on his death hostettler 2002 p 118 legacy hale is universally considered an excellent judge and jurist particularly due to his writings edward foss wrote that he was an eminent judge whom all look up to as one of brightest luminaries of law as well for soundness of his learning as for excellence of his life foss 2000 p 319 similarly john campbell in his lives of chief justices of england wrote that hale was one of most pure most pious most independent and most learned of judges campbell 2005 p 407 henry flanders writing in university of pennsylvania law review describes hale during his lifetime as most learned most able most honorable man to be found in profession of law hale s writings have been cited as recently as 1993 in case of r v kingston where court of appeal relied on his statement that drunkenness is not a defence to uphold a conviction hostettler 2002 p 211 william holdsworth argues that it was his learning in roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively because he had seen other legal systems at work he could both criticise defects of english law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before holdsworth 1923 p 402 hale s political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed to his puritanism and his support of common law regimes come and go common law abides for hale legal continuity was vital for civic identity berman 1994 p 1704 much comparison has been made of hale with edward coke campbell considered hale to be superior lawyer because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science and maintained judicial independence and neutrality campbell 2005 p 456 hostettler while considering hale a better lawyer than coke and more influential says that coke was better overall while hale was in possession of judicial impartiality and his written works are considered highly important his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence hostettler 2002 p 208 coke s active intervention allowed him to breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice encouraging judges to be more independent and unfettered except by common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold hostettler 2002 p 209 j h corbett writing in alberta law quarterly notes that with hale s popularity at time parliamentary constituencies fought over privilege of returning him he could have been just as successful as coke if he had chosen to take an active role in public affairs corbett 1942 p 165 writings thumb upright james fitzjames stephen who praised hale s historia placitorum coronae alt a black and white photograph of james fitzjames stephen a balding man with sideburns he stands looking to left of camera near a curtain he is holding a cane in his left hand hale s posthumous legacy is his written work he wrote a variety of texts treatises and manuscripts most major of which are a history and analysis of common law of england published in 1713 and historia placitorum coronae or history of pleas of crown published in 1736 hostettler 2002 p 213 analysis was based on lectures he gave to students and was most likely not intended to be published it is considered first history of english law ever written berman 1994 p 1705 divided into 13 chapters book dealt with history of english law and some suggestions for reform william blackstone when writing his commentaries on laws of england noted in his preface that of all earlier schemes for digesting laws of england most natural and scientific as well as most comprehensive appeared to be that of sir matthew hale in his posthumous analysis of law hostettler 2002 p 187 hale proposed creation of county courts and also drew a strong distinction between written laws such as statutes and customary unwritten laws hostettler 2002 p 188 he also argued that common law was subject to parliament far before confirmation of parliamentary supremacy and that law should protect rights and civil liberties of king s subjects hostettler 2002 p 189 he also argued for confirmation of trial by jury which he described as best mode of trial in world while 13th chapter divided law into laws of persons and of property and dealt with rights wrongs and remedies recognised by law at time hostettler 2002 p 192 william holdsworth himself considered one of greatest common law historians described it as ablest introductory sketch of a history of english law that appeared till publication of pollock and maitland s volumes in 1895 hostettler 2002 p 193 thumb left upright title page of volume i of first edition of historia placitorum coronae 1736 historia is perhaps hale s most famous work pleas of crown were capital offences committed against peace of our lord king his crown and dignity as such book dealt with capital crimes and associated procedure hostettler 2002 p 150 710 page work followed pattern of coke s institutes of lawes of england but was far more methodical james fitzjames stephen said that hale s work was not only of highest authority but shows a depth of thought which puts it in quite a different category from coke s institute it is far more of a treatise and far less of an index or mere work of practice hostettler 2002 p 151 book dealt with criminal capacity of infants insanity and idiocy defence of drunkenness capital offences treason homicide and theft hostettler 2002 p 170 in 19th century andrew amos wrote a critique of historia titled ruins of time exemplified in sir matthew hale s history of pleas of crown which both criticised and praised hale s work while directing main criticism at judges and lawyers who cited historia without considering that it was dated hostettler 2002 p 179 hale also reorganised first of coke s institutes which dealt with thomas de littleton s treatise on tenures hale s edition was most commonly used and first to extract coke s broader philosophical points his written works however were fragmentary and did not individually lay out his jurisprudence berman 1994 p 1707 harold j berman writing in yale law journal notes that it is only possible by a study of entire corpus of hale s writings to reconstruct coherent legal philosophy that underlies them berman 1994 p 1708 hale s writings on witchcraft and marital rape were extremely influential in 1662 he was involved in one of most notorious of seventeenth century english witchcraft trials where he sentenced two women amy and rose callender to death for witchcraft sorcery and unnatural love geis 1978 p 26 judgment of hale in this case was extremely influential in future cases and was used in salem witch trials to justify forfeiture of accused s lands brown 1993 p 97 g geis writing in british journal of law and society ties hale s opinions on witchcraft in with his writings on marital rape which are found in historia geis 1978 p 27 hale believed that a marriage was a contract which merged legal entities of husband and wife into one body ryan 1995 p 944 as such husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife for by their mutual consent and contract wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract ryan 1995 p 947 this exception to law of rape existed in england and wales until 1991 primarily due to his influence until it was repealed by house of lords in r v r 1991 3 wlr 1992 p 265 although hale wrote he published little in his lifetime his writings were discovered and published by others after his death there are still dozens of volumes of his manuscripts that remain unpublished including numerous theological treatises cromartie 1995 pp 240 242 majority of these manuscripts are found in papers at lambeth palace library lambeth palace library london mss 3475 3516 his largest work in manuscript de deo ca 1662 1667 consists of ten books filling five volumes and is estimated to contain nearly a million words cromartie 1995 pp 156 157 there are also three copies of a treatise on natural law at british library add ms fols 41 147 1693 harley ms fols 1 266 1696 hargrave ms 485 late eighteenth century a critical edition of this treatise on natural law has been published as of law of nature 2015 which contains chapters on law in general and law of nature in same work hale criticizes reduction of natural law to self preservation as only cardinall law view normally associated with thomas hobbes cites john selden s de jure et gentium juxta repeatedly and appears to share conceptual continuities with both hugo grotius s de jure belli ac pacis and francisco suarez s tractatus de ac deo matthew hale of law of nature clp academic 2015 jurisprudence during hale s period as a barrister and judge general conclusion in england was that repository of law and conventional wisdom was not politics as in renaissance europe but common law cromartie 1995 p 11 this had been brought about thanks to sir edward coke who in his institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge made law coke asserted that judge made law had answer to any question asked of it and as a result a learned judge was natural arbiter of politics cromartie 1995 p 17 this principle was known as appeal to reason with reason referring not to rationality but method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws coke s theory meant that certainty of law and intellectual beauty was way to see if a law was just and correct and that system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable cromartie 1995 p 19 john selden held similar beliefs in that he thought that common law was proper law of england however he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect law was nothing more than a contract made by english people this is known as appeal to contract cromartie 1995 p 32 thomas hobbes argued against coke s theory along with francis bacon he argued for natural law created by king s authority not by any individual judge hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers and that law could be understood not through coke s reason method used by lawyers but through understanding king s instructions while judges did make law this was only valid because it was tacitly confirmed because not disapproved by king cromartie 1995 p 99 hale s legal theory was highly influenced by both coke and selden he argued that making of law was a contract but that it was subject to a test of reasonable character something that only judges could rule on in this way he sat in a middle ground between
