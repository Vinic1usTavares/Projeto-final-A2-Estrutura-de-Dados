wrote book of savonarola is dull stilted and from a dramatic point of view weak it is not however so crushingly tiresome as music fitted to it savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is

available on disc if not in live performance still has power to surprise in dibble s view frequent charge that stanford is brahms and water was disproved once symphonies concertos much of chamber music and many of songs became available for reappraisal when recorded for compact disc dibble p 464 in 2002 rodmell s study of stanford included a discography running to 16 pages rodmell appendix two unnumbered pages criticism most often made of stanford s music by writers from shaw onwards is that his music lacks passion rodmell p 415 shaw praised stanford celt and abominated stanford professor who reined in emotions of celt in stanford s church music critic nicholas temperley finds a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse in his operas and elsewhere grove parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so rodmell p 416 like parry stanford strove for seriousness and his competitive streak led him to emulate sullivan not in comic opera for which stanford had a real gift rodmell p 413 but in oratorio in what rodmell calls grand statements that only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity rodmell p 417 orchestral commentator richard whitehouse writes that stanford s seven symphonies embody both strengths and limitations of his music displaying a compositional rigour and expertise matched only by his older contemporary parry while seeming content to remain well within stylistic ambit of mendelssohn schumann and brahms whitehouse comments that although stanford s symphonic construction is conventional an often subtle approach to movement forms and resourceful orchestration make his symphonies worth exploring whitehouse richard 2008 notes to

performed in 1887 it was most popular of stanford s symphonies during his lifetime in his study of stanford s works john porte refers to it as full of spirit and tunes of his country with its contrasting expressions of jollity and sad beauty porte pp 32 33 in this as in many of his works stanford incorporated genuine irish folk tunes like parry and mackenzie but unlike sullivan and elgar stanford liked and respected folk songs stradling and hughes p 140 he generally avoided programmatic music but his sixth symphony composed in memoriam g f watts was stanford acknowledged inspired by watts s sculptures and paintings concerts times 19 january 1906 p 8 of stanford s other orchestral works his six irish rhapsodies all date from 20th century first from 1901 and last from year before his death two of set feature solo instruments along with orchestra third cello and sixth violin foreman lewis 1987 notes to chandos cd chan oclc in dibble s view some of concertante works such as first piano concerto 1894 and violin concerto of is second of his three violin concertos first from his leipzig years is unnumbered it pre dates by three years concerto in same key by brahms are in their orchestration and their lyricism as much in tradition of mendelssohn as of brahms with whom stanford s music is often compared chamber works stanford s chamber music which as dibble notes even shaw praised has not entered general repertoire but is well crafted dibble singles out three intermezzi for clarinet and piano 1879 serenade 1905 and clarinet sonata 1911 with its touching lament writing of first string quintet porte calls it a sonorous and warm hearted sort of work constructed on fairly classical lines and notes that character and construction are typical of composer porte comments similarly on other chamber works including second piano trio this is a typical work it is scored classical in outlook and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness there are no very special features to note but work is one that makes a useful and interesting item porte p 69 church music general neglect of stanford s music in years after his death did not extend to his ecclesiastical works in music in britain one of few books to deal with stanford s music in detail rodmell p 414 nicholas temperley writes that it is due to stanford that settings of anglican church services regained their full place beside anthem as a worthy object of artistic invention temperley p 204 vaughan williams ranked stabat mater as one of stanford s works of imperishable beauty in temperley s view stanford s services in a 1880 f 1889 and c 1909 are most important and enduring additions from those years to cathedral repertory temperley p 205 as with his concert works stanford s music is dominated by melody bass line in rodmell s view is always important yet secondary and anything in between was regarded as filling rodmell p 374 operas in a 1981 survey of stanford s operas critic nigel burton writes that shamus o brien lacks good tunes and that only memorable melody in it is not by stanford but is an english folk song glory of west burton p 349 burton is more dismissive of critic which he describes as a poor man s ariadne auf naxos dibble rates critic much higher considering it to be one of stanford s two best operas in 1921 porte wrote that it contains music that is remarkably fresh melodious and thoroughly individual in character and outlook vocal and instrumental writing is done with consummate skill porte p 107 burton praises much ado about nothing judging it to contain some of stanford s best operatic music he rates last of composer s operas travelling companion as his finest operatic achievement though burton credits much of its power to brilliant story adapted by henry newbolt from hans andersen porte writes that music is often solemn and romantic and curiously impressive porte p 111 christopher webber writes that it has an atmosphere not quite like any other travelling companion has timeless qualities which could go far to enhance stanford s reputation as an opera composer christopher webber charles
