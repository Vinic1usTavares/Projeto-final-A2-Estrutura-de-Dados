gymnopilus maritimus is a fungus species of family first collected in northern sardinia italy in 2006 species produces moderately sized sturdy mushrooms of a reddish orange colour cap which can measure up to across is covered in orange fibrils and sometimes has small scales yellowish stem measures up to in length by in width and sometimes shows remnants of partial veil mushrooms have thick gills of a variable colour ranging from yellow to rust but staining darker and yellow flesh has a mild taste mushrooms leave a rusty brown spore print while spores themselves measure from in length species is most similar in appearance to g arenophilus and g fulgens but can be differentiated from both morphologically despite similarities it is not closely related to either suggesting convergent evolution instead within genus gymnopilus it is most closely related to spectabilis imperialis clade however it is not particularly similar to any of its closest relatives species has been found only on coastal sand dunes near olbia in sardinia where it was observed growing at base of juncus maritimus sea rush between winter months of october and january however there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in europe mushrooms were seen growing from both sandy soil and decaying plants however as a saprotrophic feeder it is possible that species would be able to grow on other substrates mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts taxonomy gymnopilus maritimus was first described by mycologists laura guzman davalos a specialist in and vizzini 2009 p 9 antonio ortega marco contu and alfredo vizzini in 2009 in an article in journal mycological progress description was based on several specimens collected during field work by contu in sardinia between january 2006 and january 2007 guzman davalos et al 2009 p 195 holotype was collected on 15 january 2006 guzman davalos et al 2009 p 197 discovery has contributed to sardinia s reputation as an area of mycological significance description was later published in italian by contu and vizzini in journal e mediterranea along with description of g because original descriptions of both of these species were in english and difficult for non specialists to obtain specific epithet maritimus refers to typical habitat of coastal sand dunes on sandy soil or decomposing juncus maritimus holotype has been deposited in university of granada s herbarium within genus gymnopilus it is located in subgenus gymnopilus and section macrospori subgenus gymnopilus was proposed by henri romagnesi as while genus was known as in 1942 though name gymnopilus was given later by rolf singer subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils or veils that do not form rings section macrospori proposed by guzman davalos in 1995 is made up of large spored species with ringless mushrooms molecular analysis revealed that g maritimus forms a sister group to that is shares an immediate common ancestor with spectabilis imperialis clade a clade that includes g imperialis g spectabilis g junonius often considered synonymous with g spectabilis g pampeanus and others g maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with members of spectabilis imperialis while it produces smallest fruit bodies it shares with other members strong sturdy mushrooms caps with fibrils sometimes with scales and large warty spores that turn red in melzer s reagent or lugol s iodine description gymnopilus maritimus mushrooms have a cap of between in width that is convex to flattened convex in shape there is sometimes a broad umbo and in older specimens cap is depressed in centre margin of cap is somewhat wavey cap surface is dry and dull coloured red to red orange and yellow towards margin it is covered in fibrils of an orange colour and sometimes has minute scales dried cap turns blackish red when potassium hydroxide is applied guzman davalos et al 2009 p 198 stem is in length by in width it is attached centrally to cap and is either completely cylindrical with equal thickness throughout its length or slightly narrower towards base where whitish or cream mycelia are sometimes visible it is dry with fibres and furrows it is a yellowish colour bruising reddish brown traces of partial veil are sometimes visible on stem though it does not form a ring contu and vizzini 2009 p 10 yellow brown at bottom of stem flesh can be up to thick in cap and does not bruise it dries dark brown there is no distinctive odour and taste is mild or slightly bitter guzman davalos et al 2009 p 199 thick gills can be adnate connected to stem by entire depth of gill or sinuate wavy with gills becoming shallower than deeper they are subdistant neither close nor distant and swollen in middle in colour they are yellow in youngest mushrooms turning an ochre orange while oldest mushrooms they are rust gill edges are paler than faces and gills stain orange brown or darker no reference is made in original description to edibility of mushrooms guzman davalos et al 2009 microscopic characteristics gymnopilus maritimus leaves a rusty brown spore print basidiospores can measure in length though typical range is in width they typically measure but they can be up to 8 mm wide in shape they are ellipsoid or sometimes broadly ellipsoid top of spore side where it was once attached to sterigma connection between basidium and spore is rounded and blunt spores are covered with fairly large warts measuring from from main spore in height there is no germ pore or plage and there is no clear depression around hilum area where spore was attached to sterigma spores turn an orange yellow to orange brown colour in potassium hydroxide and turn reddish brown in melzer s reagent and in lugol s iodine but they are not four spored basidia typically measure in length by in width but can be as much as 10 5 mm wide they are club shaped but narrower in middle they are hyaline translucent and yellow to yellowish brown sterigmata are between 1 6 and 7 mm long cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of gill are typically 30 to 42 though sometimes as much as 50 mm long by wide they are shaped like a flask or wine skin top of cell suddenly widens and cell as a whole is thin walled hyaline and yellowish and sometimes appears to contain small grains caulocystidia cystidia on stem can be found in tufts at top of stem and measure from by they are cylindrical or narrowly flask shaped sometimes with a long neck they are again yellow and hyaline guzman davalos et al 2009 p 200 yellowish hyphae are between 15 and 13 5 mm wide with a wall of variable thickness there are clamp connections at septa walls dividing individual hypha cells flesh in cap is radial and is made up of yellowish hyphae of between 2 4 and 20 mm wide pileipellis outermost layer of hyphae forms a cutis and on older specimens and on small scales forms a trichoderm similar species thumb right alt a side view of a thick sturdy looking brown mushroom with a prominent ring on stem although closely related g junonius pictured is different from g maritimus in a number of ways including presence of a well developed ring there are five species similar in appearance to g maritimus g arenophilus g decipiens g flavus g fulgens and g pseudofulgens g arenophilus and particularly g fulgens are most similar guzman davalos et al 2009 p 202 though g maritimus and g arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology typically slightly smaller g arenophilus differs from g maritimus morphologically while g maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales g arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth and spore ornamentation differs with g maritimus typically displaying larger warts like g maritimus g fulgens has been recorded growing on sand dune heathland further spores are similar in appearance to those of g maritimus however g fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss moreover there are a number of morphological differences g maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker there are never remains of partial veil on g fulgens stems shape of top of spores differs between two species and cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on g maritimus g fulgens var is even more distinct from g maritimus than nominate variety guzman davalos et al 2009 pp 202 3 despite similarities between three species three have been shown to be in different clades within gymnopilus suggesting ecological convergence between g arenophilus and g maritimus and morphological convergence between g fulgens and g maritimus gymnopilus flavus despite also appearing on land near mediterranean can be differentiated from g maritimus as it lives among grass especially glomerata and it has distinctly smaller spores typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3 5 to 4 2 mm guzman davalos et al 2009 p 203 g pseudofulgens also collected in italy shows two major morphological differences it produces smaller mushrooms and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts g decipiens another species that grows on sandy soil again has spores that are markedly different american species g arenicola also favours sandy soil but has significantly smaller spores than g maritimus two other species of gymnopilus found around mediterranean are g corsicus and g spadiceus g corsicus has no veil remnants on stem and spores that do not turn red in melzer s reagent or lugol s iodine and so can easily be differentiated from g maritimus g spadiceus shows several similarities to g maritimus but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores maritimus is clearly a different species from other members of its clade despite their close relation all other species in clade grow upon dead wood and have well developed rings on their stems spores also differ in case of g junonius and g spectabilis often considered synonymous as well as g pampeanus they are narrower and in case of g imperialis they are wider of other members of clade only g junonius and g spectabilis also grow in europe habitat and distribution gymnopilus maritimus is known only from a single site in an area of olbia in sardinia italy which is type locality there mushrooms were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal sand dunes around from high tide line they were observed at base of live juncus maritimus sea rush plants growing on sandy soil or decaying plants where they were feeding as as such it is possible that species would be able to grow on other substrates they were observed growing from autumn to winter contu and vizzini 2009 p 12 between end of october and january in addition to collections in sardinia contu and vizzini speculate that reports of g fulgens growing in sand dune heaths on great britain an unusual habitat for that species may in fact show presence of g maritimus on island see also list of gymnopilus species references works cited further reading
