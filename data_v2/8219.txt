out that diana marshall jane badler earring was found at crime scene and andrew robinson jordan smith did not help himself with his attitude towards investigation of case mcgregor said brennan is in

kate was furious that he still had a hold on her life despite kate telling declan that she was over him declan saw mark as a threat mcgregor commented that mark put declan s nose out of joint declan became a nuisance and tried to control kate by telling her that mark had threatened and attacked him kate initially believed declan but when she discovered truth she had to work to get mark back

awkward mark liked kate as she was a pretty easy going girl who doesn t let too much get to her but mcgregor told tv week that mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of declan and his commitment to his work he was also hesitant because of age gap between them mcgregor told holy soap kate s 19 and my character is about 25 it s funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it but i think it s because of what they do and where they are in life at one point kate s having driving lessons and i m working as a detective who s moved up through ranks quickly so we do seem

statement during paul s investigation mcgregor told inside soap that mark did not stop loving kate and that since he had time to think about it issue was not as black and white as he first thought
