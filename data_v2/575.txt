channel at northern end bleadon lies on river axe and there was for many years a small harbour sometimes known as lympsham wharf arrival of bristol and exeter railway in 1841 which crossed axe on a bridge obstructed river traffic beyond wharf making it limit of navigation for coastal vessels an act of 1915 authorised drainage of river and installation of a flood gate at bleadon although attempts to control water had occurred on bleadon level since medieval times including an early windmill in 1613 to pump water into sea from behind a sea wall burnham on sea population 18 401 is at mouth of river parrett where it enters bridgwater bay position of town on edge of somerset levels has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since roman times burnham was seriously affected by bristol channel floods of 1607 and various flood defences have been installed since then a concrete sea wall was built in 1911 and after second world war further additions to defences were made using remains of a mulberry harbour present curved concrete wall was completed in 1988 highbridge which neighbours burnham is near mouth of river brue and villages of east and west

axbridge parrett was navigable up as far as langport in 1600 with 15 to 20 ton barges domesday book recorded that drainage of higher grounds was under way although moors at were said to be useless in middle ages monasteries of glastonbury athelney and muchelney were responsible for much of drainage in 1129 abbot of glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at lympsham efforts to control flooding on parrett were recorded around same date in 1234 were reclaimed near westonzoyland and from accounts in abbey s rent books this had increased to by 1240 drains alt straight watercourse surrounded by fields and crossed by metal and concrete structure thumb left sluice on king s sedgemoor drain flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during 13th century by construction

channel joining parrett upstream from its original confluence main drainage outlets flowing through moors and levels are rivers axe brue huntspill parrett tone and yeo together with king s sedgemoor drain an artificial channel into which river cary now runs previously cary ran into tone while brue ran through meare pool now drained and panborough gap and then into axe another accomplishment in middle ages was construction of tidal cut joining brue and axe in 1500 there was said to be of floodable land of which only had been reclaimed in 1597 of land were recovered near parrett estuary a few years later near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments and three further reclamations totalling had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 in early 17th century during time of king james i abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of sedgemoor which local lords supported but opposed by commoners who would have lost grazing rights in 1632 charles i sold crown s interest in scheme and it was taken over by a consortium that included sir cornelius vermuyden a dutch drainage engineer however work was delayed by english civil war and later defeated in parliament after local opposition in 1638 it was reported that nearly of tealham and tadham moors were not reclaimed with a total of being between 1785 and 1791 much of lowest part of peat moors was enclosed in 1795 john billingsley advocated enclosure and digging of rhynes a local name for drainage channels pronounced reens in east and rhyne to west between plots and wrote in his agriculture of county of somerset that had been enclosed in last 20 years in wedmore and meare at nyland at blackford at mark in shapwick and at westhay at westhay moor in early 19th century it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top dressed with silt deposited via flooding creating a very rich soil character of soil was also changed by spreading of clay and silt from digging of king s sedgemoor drain pumps alt brick building with large door and chimney thumb curry moor pumping station little attempt was made during 17th and 18th centuries to pump water possibly because coal driven newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical it is unclear why windmills were not employed as they were on fens of east anglia but only two examples have been recorded on levels one at bleadon at mouth of river axe where a sea wall had been built and other at common moor north of glastonbury which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 first steam pumping station was westonzoyland pumping station in 1830 followed by more effective ones from 1860 automatic electric pumps are used today man made huntspill river was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of process water it was intended that in summer when water supply was lower it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from moors and in winter serve as a drainage channel via gravity drainage geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity drainage of moors was not possible thus water is pumped up into river throughout year sowy river between river parrett and king s sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 levels and moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into drains water levels are managed by levels internal drainage boards idbs levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as east anglian fens historically a similar area of low marsh they are still liable to widespread fresh water flooding in winter one of approaches to reducing risk of flooding within catchment area of parrett is planting of new woodlands controversy about management of drainage and flood protection has previously involved activities of idbs however idbs have been actively participating with parrett catchment partnership a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed in particular looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders during 2009 and 2010 work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates watercourses and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of southlake moor during winter diverting water from sowy river onto moor it has capacity to hold 1 2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by parrett internal drainage board to restore ten floodplains in somerset in spring water is drained away to enable land to be used as pasture during summer scheme is also used to encourage water birds sea defences thumb left sea wall and defences at burnham on sea levels were frequently flooded by sea during high tides a problem that was not resolved until sea defences were enhanced in early 20th century in addition problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by unrestricted entry of tide along parrett which is only river in levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it discussions on whether a clyse is needed for parrett and whether it should be sited at bridgwater or nearer mouth of river date back to 1939 at start of world war ii and have not been resolved on 13 december 1981 a large storm hit north somerset coast meteorological conditions caused a large rising surge in sea level in bristol channel and wind was measured at over topping of sea defences along a stretch of somerset coast at 22 locations from clevedon to porlock began after 19 30 although there was no loss of life resultant flooding covered of land affecting 1 072 houses and commercial properties with ps150 000 worth of livestock killed and ps50 000 of feed and grain destroyed wessex water authority estimated total cost of damage caused at ps6m this resulted in a three year programme of sea defence assessment repair and improvement with 400 properties affected in burnham on sea after emergency repairs wessex water authority began planning new sea defences construction work started in 1983 on a ps7m scheme creating what was then britain s biggest wave return wall environment agency s current parrett catchment flood management plan published in december 2009 divides parrett catchment area into eight sub areas with somerset levels and moors falling into sub area 6 and bridgwater falling into sub area 7 as part of published flood risk assessments for both these sub areas it is recognised that at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on parrett this causes a funding dilemma and geomorphology studies of parrett and tone are needed to help address many of uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project flooding alt photograph from elevation of flooded river flowing between snow covered fields hills in distance thumb southlake moor during a

them clear under overall responsibility of environment agency with rising sea levels work required to maintain sea defences is likely to become more expensive and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created other studies have recommended maintaining current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options although environment agency have made plans for regular winter flooding still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages including langport muchelney and westonzoyland being cut off in november 2012 during 2012 great britain and ireland floods after six days somerset county council funded barb rescue boats reached muchelney on 29 november rescuing nearly 100 people rescue boats were again required during rain and storms from cyclone dirk in turn of year 2014 and subsequently during winter flooding of 2013 14 on somerset levels on 24 january 2014 in light of continued flooded extent of somerset moors and forecast new rainfall as part of winter storms of 2013 14 in united kingdom both somerset county council and sedgemoor district council declared a major incident at this time with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month environment minister owen paterson visited area on 27 january 2014 and after meeting local mps environment agency and various community representatives night before in taunton promised at a media only press conference at north moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed over next six weeks he would approve it such plan would likely include dredging of rivers tone and parrett and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater there

people to occupy seasonal camps on higher ground indicated by scatters of flints subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man s using levels only in summer hence county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete meaning land of summer people an alternative suggestion is that name derives from seo mere saetan meaning settlers by sea lakes neolithic people continued to exploit

morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood bracken rubble and clay investigation of meare pool indicates that it was formed by encroachment of raised peat bogs particularly during climatic period 1st millennium bc and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud two villages within meare pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on surface of dried peat such as tents and animal folds clay was later spread over peat providing raised stands for occupation industry and movement and in some areas thicker clay
