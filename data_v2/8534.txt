1946 atlantic hurricane season resulted in no fatalities in united states season officially began on june 15 1946 and lasted until november 15 1946 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin however first storm developed in gulf of mexico on june 13 while final system dissipated just offshore florida on november 3 there were seven tropical storm three of them attained hurricane status while none intensified into major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale this had not occurred since 1940 and would not again until 1968 operationally fifth tropical storm which existed near azores in early october was not considered a tropical cyclone but was added to hurdat in 2014 although every tropical storm impacted land effects overall were light with less than 10 million 1946 usd in damage and no deaths in united states throughout season season s most intense cyclone was fourth hurricane while storm was moving northeastward offshore east coast of united states norwegian tanker maril ii was destroyed at sea causing 16 drownings incident could not be directly attributed to hurricane second storm brought relatively minor damage to cape fear region of north carolina after striking state early in its duration while an extratropical cyclone remnants of fifth cyclone devastated a few islands of azores and left 120 fishermen missing florida hurricane severely damaged sugar cane in western cuba and caused five deaths in island nation additionally storm left 5 2 million in damage in florida mostly inflicting citrus crops final storm caused several millions of dollars in damage to crops near lake okeechobee toc season summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 16 1946 however tropical cyclogenesis began on june 13 three days before official start of season there was a total of seven tropical storms slightly below contemporaneous 20 year average of 8 5 per season three of those strengthened into hurricanes while none reached major hurricane status category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale for first time since 1940 and it was a phenomenon that would not occur again until 1968 one hurricane made landfall in united states while two other storms with winds of at least 74 mph 119 km h remained at sea during their strongest intensities overall in united states season resulted in less than 10 million in damage and no deaths collectively storms of season left at least 5 2 million in damage final cyclone of season dissipated on november 3 12 days before official end of season on november 15 1946 tropical cyclogenesis began with development of a tropical storm over gulf of mexico on june 13 next system formed offshore southeastern united states on july 5 activity then ceased for nearly seven weeks until august 25 when third storm originated in bay of campeche although september is climatological peak of hurricane season there was only one tropical cyclone that strengthened to tropical storm status that month season s most intense storm developed on september 12 and later peaked as a category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph 155 km h and a lowest known barometric pressure of additionally a tropical depression briefly existed near central america october was most active month of season with three tropical cyclones third storm in october which was last system of season lasted until november 3 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 20 lowest total since 1925 and until 1983 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm one a disturbance accompanied by a small area of convection developed into a tropical depression about 165 miles 265 km south southwest of cape san blas florida at 12 00 utc on june 13 moving slowly northwestward depression intensified into a tropical storm early on next day storm did not deepen beyond maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 km h while historical weather maps indicated a barometric pressure of on june 15 lowest in relation to storm later that day cyclone weakened to a tropical depression offshore louisiana storm made landfall just east of louisiana texas border on june 16 and rapidly dissipated it may have remained a tropical depression throughout its lifespan but data was inconclusive winds of were observed at grand isle louisiana while winds of gentle to moderate force occurred in texas hurricane two interaction between a frontal boundary and a tropical wave resulted in development of an extratropical cyclone on july 5 offshore southeastern united states throughout day storm acquired tropical characteristics around 00 00 utc on july 6 system transitioned into a tropical storm while located about 35 mi 55 km south southeast of myrtle beach south carolina cyclone moved northeastward and made landfall near oak island north carolina around 08 00 utc with winds of 50 mph 85 km h in state carolina beach and wrightsville beach observed sustained winds of and gusts of in wilmington area winds damaged plate glass windows and caused brief disruptions to electricity and communication services further inland heavy rainfall including in less than 24 hours in manteo resulted in considerable loss to crops with 15 20 damaged in some areas that was heaviest 24 hour precipitation total recorded in manteo since observations began in 1905 storm moved northeastward and reemerged into atlantic ocean near southern end of bodie island early on july 7 shortly thereafter cyclone began strengthening and became a category 1 hurricane by 12 00 utc after slightly further intensification hurricane reached peak intensity at 18 00 utc on july 7 with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h it then curved eastward and began losing tropical characteristics at 00 00 utc on july 9 hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about south southeast of cape sable island nova scotia extratropical remnants gradually curved northeastward and then north northeastward while slowly weakening late on july 10 extratropical storm dissipated near cape race newfoundland tropical storm three in late august a disturbance was monitored moving over western caribbean sea near great swan island despite favorable conditions further development did not occur until after it reached bay of campeche early on august 25 it is estimated that a tropical storm developed after a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that system acquired a well defined circulation peaking with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 km h storm moved quickly west northwestward and made near tampico tamaulipas at 19 00 utc by early next day cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated a wind gust of 60 mph 95 km h was observed in tampico tropical depression a tropical wave over western caribbean sea developed into a tropical depression about 40 mi 65 km north of swan islands on september 9 however by following day historical weather maps no longer indicated a tropical depression it is uncertain whether system dissipated or made landfall in central america hurricane four early on september 12 northern portion of a tropical wave spawned a tropical storm about 75 mi 120 km east andros island storm strengthened while moving northeastward into northern bahamas striking andros island later that day with winds of 65 mph 100 km h late on september 12 cyclone strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall on south abaco with winds of 75 mph 120 km h hurricane intensified further after entering open atlantic becoming on september 13 shortly thereafter it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph 155 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of both of which were observed during a reconnaissance aircraft flight storm accelerated and weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures falling to tropical storm status early on september 15 shortly thereafter cyclone became extratropical about south of cape sable island extratropical remnants moved across newfoundland and northern atlantic until dissipating well north of azores on september 17 in bahamas hope town observed sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and stronger gusts as well as a barometric pressure of norwegian tanker maril ii sank after splitting in two drowning sixteen people however because maril ii was over away from storm at time incident could not be directly attributed to hurricane some areas of nova scotia experienced strong winds with sustained winds up to observed throughout province and a gust of recorded at sable island heavy rain was also reported with measured in halifax high seas during royal nova scotia yacht squadron race hood cup forced yachts to return to port when radar image was taken it was only third time in history that a hurricane passed close enough to a radar site to reveal its structure tropical storm five a low pressure area initially associated with two frontal systems developed into a tropical depression about southwest of flores island in azores at 12 00 utc on october 1 after six hours depression intensified into a tropical storm it intensified further while moving east northeastward on october 2 system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of both of which were observed by ships storm then began losing tropical characteristics and merged with a frontal boundary around 12 00 utc on october 3 while situated about 275 mi 445 km south southwest of pico island in azores this storm was not included in hurdat until 2014 although system became extratropical it continued to deepen further with sustained winds reaching 90 mph 150 km h late on october 4 additionally it expanded significantly in size reaching a diameter of about 1 035 mi 1 665 km on october 5 around that time storm passed through azores near faial island before weakening and dissipating north of island chain on october 6 rough seas at santa maria island left 120 fishermen missing while 12 fishing vessels 2 tugboats and several launches were destroyed four fishing boats were also missing strong wind gusts up to caused catastrophic damage on santa maria and sao miguel islands homes crops and pineapple greenhouses were demolished while communications were knocked out additionally lajes field on terceira island was practically destroyed hurricane six a disturbance from intertropical convergence zone developed into a tropical storm late on october 5 while located over western caribbean sea near belize mexico border it moved northeastward and strengthened reaching category 1 hurricane status next day at 04 00 utc on october 7 storm made landfall in western cuba near boca de pinar del rio province with winds of a barometric pressure of was observed lowest in relation to system additionally a station recorded a wind gust of several sugar cane fields were flattened with millions of tons of crop destroyed in many towns telephone and telegraphic communications were cut off five deaths occurred in cuba after emerging into gulf of mexico on october 7 storm curved north northeastward and strengthened to a category 2 peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph 155 km h after becoming a category 2 hurricane on october 7 cyclone weakened to a category 1 just six hours later around 04 00 utc on following day it made another landfall near bradenton beach florida with winds of 85 mph 135 km h in florida gusty winds and rainfall produced by storm inflicted damage mostly on crops about 2 of state s total citrus crop was lost with damage totaling 5 million only about 200 000 in property damage occurred which was mostly due to coastal flooding in cities such as everglades fort myers and punta gorda moving inland hurricane weakened to a tropical storm later on october 8 early on october 9 system became extratropical over south carolina however extratropical remnants persisted for several days moving in a semicircular path over eastern atlantic until dissipating well north of hispaniola on october 14 tropical storm seven a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression late on october 31 over bahamas about halfway between acklins and little inagua depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on november 1 and moved northwestward striking several islands including acklins long island exuma and andros late on november 1 storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of system then made landfall near lake worth florida at same intensity around 22 00 utc early on november 2 storm weakened to a tropical depression and recurved northeastward over central florida shortly after reemerging into atlantic ocean near ponte vedra beach early on november 3 depression dissipated about 45 mi 75 km east northeast of fernandina beach due to weak nature of storm no wind damage occurred however flooding occurred around lake okeechobee due to rainfall reaching along main highways several cars stalled while a number of canals overflowed between 50 70 of early fall crops in area were damaged with as much as 60 of snap bean crops lost damage was in several millions range season effects see also list of tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricane seasons references external links category 1946 meteorology category 1946 natural disasters
