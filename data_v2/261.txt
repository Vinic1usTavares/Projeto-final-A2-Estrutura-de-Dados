comet hale bopp formally designated c 1995 o1 is a comet that was perhaps most widely observed of 20th century and one of brightest seen for many decades alan hale and thomas bopp discovered comet hale bopp separately on july 23 1995 before it became visible to naked eye it is difficult to predict maximum brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty but hale bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on april 1 1997 it was visible to naked eye for a record 18 months twice as long as great comet of 1811 previous record holder accordingly hale bopp was dubbed great comet of 1997 discovery comet was discovered independently on july 23 1995 by two observers alan hale and thomas bopp both in united states hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success and was tracking known comets from his driveway in new mexico when he chanced upon hale bopp just after midnight comet had an apparent magnitude of 10 5 and lay near globular cluster m70 in constellation of sagittarius hale first established that there was no other deep sky object near m70 and then consulted a directory of known comets finding that none were known to be in this area of sky once he had established that object was moving relative to background stars he emailed central bureau for astronomical telegrams clearing house for astronomical discoveries bopp did not own a telescope he was out with friends near stanfield arizona observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across comet while at eyepiece of his friend s telescope he realized he might have spotted something new when like hale he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep sky objects were known to be near m70 and found that there were none he alerted central bureau for astronomical telegrams through a western union telegram brian g marsden who had run bureau since 1968 laughed nobody sends telegrams anymore i mean by time that telegram got here alan hale had already e mailed us three times with updated coordinates following morning it was confirmed that this was a new comet and it was given designation c 1995 o1 discovery was announced in international astronomical union circular early observation hale bopp s orbital position was calculated as 7 2 astronomical units au from sun placing it between jupiter and saturn and by far greatest distance from earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs most comets at this distance are extremely faint and show no discernible activity but hale bopp already had an observable coma a precovery image taken at anglo australian telescope in 1993 was found to show then unnoticed comet some 13 au from sun a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable halley s comet was more than 100 times fainter at same distance from sun analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60 20 kilometres in diameter approximately six times size of halley its great distance and surprising activity indicated that comet hale bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997 however comet scientists were wary comets can be extremely unpredictable and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later comet kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a comet of century and turned out to be unspectacular perihelion thumb right upright comet became a spectacular sight in early 1997 thumb star map of path with 14 day motion marked hale bopp became visible to naked eye in may 1996 and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during latter half of that year scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright it was too closely aligned with sun to be observable during december 1996 but when it reappeared in january 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it even from large cities with light polluted skies internet was a growing phenomenon at time and numerous websites that tracked comet s progress and provided daily images from around world became extremely popular internet played a large role in encouraging unprecedented public interest in comet hale bopp as comet approached sun it continued to brighten shining at 2nd magnitude in february and showing a growing pair of tails blue gas tail pointing straight away from sun and yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit on march 9 a solar eclipse in china mongolia and eastern siberia allowed observers there to see comet in daytime hale bopp had its closest approach to earth on march 22 1997 at a distance of 1 315 au as it passed perihelion on april 1 1997 comet developed into a spectacular sight it shone brighter than any star in sky except sirius and its dust tail stretched 40 45 degrees across sky comet was visible well before sky got fully dark each night and while many great comets are very close to sun as they pass perihelion comet hale bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers after perihelion after its perihelion passage comet moved into southern celestial hemisphere comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers than it had been in northern hemisphere but southerners were able to see comet gradually fade from view during second half of 1997 last naked eye observations were reported in december 1997 which meant that comet had remained visible without aid for 569 days or about 18 and a half months previous record had been set by great comet of 1811 which was visible to naked eye for about 9 months comet continued to fade as it receded but is still being tracked by astronomers in october 2007 10 years after perihelion and at distance of 25 7 au from sun comet was still active as indicated by detection of co driven coma herschel space observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet hale bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer hale bopp was again detected in december 2010 when it was 30 7 au away from sun and on august 7 2012 at a 33 2 au distance from sun astronomers expect that comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020 by which time it will be nearing 30th magnitude by this time it will become very difficult to distinguish comet from large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness orbital changes thumb right hale bopp at perihelion on april 1 1997 comet likely made its previous perihelion 4 200 years ago in july 2215 bce estimated closest approach to earth was 1 4 au and it may have been observed in ancient egypt during 6th dynasty reign of pharaoh pepi ii reign c 2216 bce pepi s pyramid at saqqara contains a text referring to an nhh star as a companion of pharaoh in heavens where is hieroglyph for long hair lost tomb kent weeks page 198 hale bopp may have had a near collision with jupiter in early june 2215 bc which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit and 2215 bc may have been its first passage through inner solar system comet s current orbit is almost perpendicular to plane of ecliptic so further close approaches to planets will be rare however in april 1996 comet passed within 0 77 au of jupiter close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by planet s gravity comet s orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2 533 years and it will next return to inner solar system around year its greatest distance from sun aphelion will be about 370 au reduced from about 525 au pre perturbation orbit semi major axis period estimated probability of hale bopp s striking earth in future passages through inner solar system is remote about 2 5x10 9 per orbit however given that comet nucleus is around 60 km in diameter consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic weissman conservatively estimates diameter at 35 km an estimated density of 0 6 g cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1 g at a probable impact velocity of 52 5 km s impact energy can be calculated as 1 ergs or 4 megatons about 44 times estimated energy of k t impact event over many orbits cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce perihelion distance to very small values hale bopp has about a 15 chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process scientific results comet hale bopp was observed intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations dust production rate of comet was very high up to 2 0 kg s which may have made inner coma optically thick based on properties of dust grains high temperature high albedo and strong 10 mm silicate emission feature astronomers concluded dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet hale bopp showed highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet such polarization is result of solar radiation getting scattered by dust particles in coma of comet and depends on nature of grains it further confirms that dust grains in coma of comet hale bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet sodium tail thumb right comet hale bopp s neutral sodium tail straight tail extending up to left from nucleus one of most remarkable discoveries was that comet had a third type of tail in addition to well known gas and dust tails hale bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets but had not been shown to come from a tail hale bopp s sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms not ions and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length source of sodium appeared to be inner coma although not necessarily nucleus there are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms including collisions between dust grains surrounding nucleus and sputtering of sodium from dust grains by ultraviolet light it is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating hale bopp s sodium tail and narrow and diffuse components of tail may have different origins while comet s dust tail roughly followed path of comet s orbit and gas tail pointed almost directly away from sun sodium tail appeared to lie between two this implies that sodium atoms are driven away from comet s head by radiation pressure deuterium abundance abundance of deuterium in comet hale bopp in form of heavy water was found to be about twice that of earth s oceans if hale bopp s deuterium abundance is typical of all comets this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be source of a significant amount of water on earth they cannot be only source deuterium was also detected in many other hydrogen compounds in comet ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds rather than in solar nebula theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet hale bopp formed at temperatures of around 25 45 kelvins organics spectroscopic observations of hale bopp revealed presence of many organic chemicals several of which had never been detected in comets before these complex molecules may exist within cometary nucleus or might be synthesised by reactions in comet detection of argon hale bopp was first comet where noble gas argon was detected noble gases are chemically inert and highly volatile and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures they can be used for probing temperature histories of cometary ices krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16 20 k and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to solar abundance while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to solar abundance together these observations indicate that interior of hale bopp has always been colder than 35 40 k but has at some point been warmer than 20 k unless solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed this suggests that comet formed beyond neptune in kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to oort cloud rotation comet hale bopp s activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus but instead came from several specific jets observations of material streaming away from these jets allowed astronomers to measure rotation period of comet which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes binary nucleus question in 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised existence of a binary nucleus to fully explain observed pattern of comet hale bopp s dust emission observed in october 1995 paper was based on theoretical analysis and did not claim an observational detection of proposed satellite nucleus but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30 km with main nucleus being about 70 km across and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180 km this analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using wide field planetary camera 2 of hubble space telescope which had taken images of comet that revealed satellite although observations using adaptive optics in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double peak in brightness of nucleus controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus discovery of satellite was not confirmed by other observations also while comets have been observed to break up before no case had been found of a stable binary nucleus until subsequent discovery of given very small mass of this comet orbit of binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by gravity of sun and planets ufo claims in november 1996 amateur astronomer chuck shramek 1950 2000 of houston texas took a ccd image of comet which showed a fuzzy slightly elongated object nearby his computer sky viewing program did not identify star so shramek called art bell radio program coast to coast am to announce that he had discovered a saturn like object following hale bopp ufo enthusiasts such as remote viewing proponent courtney brown soon concluded that there was an alien spacecraft following comet several astronomers claimed that object was simply 8 5 magnitude star including alan hale they noted that star did not appear on shramek s computer program because user preferences were set incorrectly art bell claimed to have obtained an image of object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery however astronomers olivier hainaut and david tholen of university of hawaii stated that alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images thirty nine members of heaven s gate cult committed mass suicide in march 1997 with intention of teleporting to a spaceship which they believed was flying behind comet nancy lieder claims to receive messages from aliens through an implant in her brain and she stated that hale bopp was a fiction designed to distract population from coming arrival of nibiru or planet x a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt earth s rotation causing global cataclysm her original date for apocalypse was may 2003 which passed without incident but various conspiracy websites continued to predict coming of nibiru most of whom tied it to 2012 phenomenon legacy thumb right comet hale bopp in 2001 at a distance of nearly two billion kilometres from sun credit lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in media meant that hale bopp was probably most observed comet in history making a far greater impact on general public than return of halley s comet in 1986 and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of halley s previous appearances for instance 69 of americans had seen hale bopp by april 9 1997 hale bopp was a record breaking comet farthest comet from sun discovered by amateurs with largest well measured cometary nucleus known after chiron and it was visible to naked eye for twice as long as previous record holder it was also brighter than magnitude 0 for eight weeks longer than any other recorded comet carolyn shoemaker and her husband gene both famous for co discovering comet shoemaker levy 9 were involved in a car crash after photographing comet gene died in crash and his ashes were sent to moon aboard nasa s lunar prospector mission along with an image of hale bopp last comet that shoemakers observed together see also comet hyakutake references external links comet hale bopp cometography com comet hale bopp nasa hale bopp
