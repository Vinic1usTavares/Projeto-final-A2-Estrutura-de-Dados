two sicilies in present day southern italy she was daughter of king don francesco i francis i of italian branch of house of bourbon and his wife maria isabel maria isabella it was long believed by historians that princess was raised in an ultra conservative intolerant atmosphere which resulted in a timid and unassertive character in public and an ability to be contented with very little materially or emotionally recent studies revealed a more complex character who despite having respected social norms of era was able to assert a limited independence due to her strongly opinionated personality as well as her interest in learning sciences and culture princess was married by proxy to pedro ii in 1843 her spouse s expectations had been raised when a portrait was presented that depicted teresa cristina as an idealized beauty but he was displeased by his bride s plain looks upon their first meeting later that year despite a cold beginning couple s relationship improved as time passed due primarily to teresa cristina s patience kindness generosity and simplicity these traits also helped her win hearts of brazilian people and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism she also sponsored archaeological studies in italy and italian immigration to brazil marriage between teresa cristina and pedro ii never became passionately romantic although a bond based upon family mutual respect and fondness did develop empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported emperor s positions and never interposed with her own views in public she remained silent on topic of his suspected extra marital relationships including a liaison with her daughters governess in turn she was treated with unfailing respect and her position at court and home was always secure of four children teresa cristina bore emperor two boys died in infancy and a daughter of typhoid fever at age of 24 teresa cristina along with remaining members of imperial family was sent into exile after a coup d etat staged by a clique of army officers in 1889 being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on teresa cristina s spirit and health grieving and ill she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest little more than a month after monarchy s collapse she was greatly loved by her subjects both during her lifetime and

character and behavior but also for her sponsorship of brazilian culture early life birth teresa cristina was daughter of then duke of calabria who later became king don francesco i francis i of two

orphan when her father died in 1830 her mother is said to have neglected her after marrying a young officer in 1839 historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation in an environment of religious superstition intolerance and conservatism it has also described teresa cristina as a soft and timid character unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother she has even been depicted as unassertive and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself some historians have more recently held to a modified view of both neapolitan bourbon court as a reactionary regime and of extent of teresa cristina s passivity historian aniello angelo avella states that maligned interpretation of neapolitan bourbons traces its origin to perspectives generated during 19th century il risorgimento italian unification following 1861 conquest of kingdom of two sicilies by kingdom of sardinia teresa cristina is revealed in her personal papers as a strong headed character she was not a submissive woman but instead a person who respected roles imposed by ethics and values of her own times marriage thumb right 200px alt a half length painted portrait of a young

cristina that enticed pedro ii to accept marriage proposal upon learning that young emperor of brazil dom pedro ii sought a wife government of two sicilies offered hand of teresa cristina see it also sent pedro ii a painting that greatly embellished princess which prompted him to accept proposal see a proxy wedding was held on 30 may 1843 in naples pedro ii being represented by his fiancee s brother prince leopold count of syracuse a small brazilian fleet composed of a frigate and two corvettes departed for two sicilies on 3 march 1843 to escort new empress of brazil she arrived on rio de janeiro on 3 september 1843 see pedro ii immediately rushed to board ship and greet his bride upon seeing this impetuous gesture crowds cheered and guns fired deafening salutes teresa cristina fell in love with her new husband at first sight 17 year old pedro ii was for his part clearly and greatly disappointed see his first impressions were only of her physical flaws and of how much her appearance differed from portrait which had been sent to him physically she had dark brown hair and brown eyes was short slightly overweight walked with a pronounced limp and while not ugly neither was she pretty see according to historian pedro calmon teresa cristina had no true limp but her odd way of walking was instead result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked pedro ii s high expectations were crushed and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show after a short interval he left ship perceiving his disillusionment she burst into tears lamenting that emperor did not like me see although a proxy marriage had already been performed an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 september at cathedral in rio de janeiro see although marriage had been strained from beginning teresa cristina continued striving to be a good wife her constancy toward fulfilling her duty along with birth of children softened pedro ii s attitude two discovered shared interests and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness that they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by series of pregnancies which ensued after birth of their first son in february 1845 empress bore children in july 1846 july 1847 and july 1848 named afonso isabel leopoldina and pedro respectively empress consort of brazil domestic life thumb left 200px alt photographic portrait of a woman seated and wearing a dark dress trimmed in dark lace with her hair pulled back into a bun and no jewelry except for a simple ring on her left hand teresa cristina around age 29 c 1851 teresa cristina had grown to be a vital part of pedro ii s family life and routine she never filled roles of romantic lover or intellectual partner however her devotion to emperor remained firm though she feared being supplanted she continued to appear with emperor in public and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration she was not rejected or slighted but relationship had changed pedro ii treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife long held view is that empress accepted circumscribed role in which she found herself and that her life duty and purpose were tied to her position as emperor s wife however her personal letters reveal that she could be sometimes at odds with her husband and had a life of her own albeit somewhat restricted in a letter written on 2 may 1845 she stated i wait for moment when we will meet good pedro and seek forgiveness for all that i did to you during these days in another letter of 24 january 1851 she acknowledged her difficult temperament i am not irritated at you pedro ii and you should forgive me because this is my character her friendships were limited to her ladies in waiting and in particular dona josefina da fonseca costa she was well liked by her attendants a good judge of character of visitors and courtiers unpretentious generous kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother she dressed and acted modestly only wearing jewelry for occasions of state and gave impression of being somewhat sad she had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters reading doing needlework and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects she possessed a beautiful voice and often practiced her singing skills her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls teresa cristina did not lack intellectual interests and she had developed passions for arts music and in particular archaeology empress began assembling a collection of archaeological artifacts from her earliest days in brazil and she exchanged hundreds of others with her brother king don ferdinando ii ferdinand ii she also sponsored archaeological studies in italy and many of artifacts dated from etruscan civilization and ancient roman period found were brought to brazil empress also aided in recruiting italian physicians engineers professors pharmacists nurses artists artisans and qualified workers with goal of improving public education and public health in brazil rivalry with countess of barral thumb right 200px alt

of table and one at right side of table leopoldina pedro ii teresa cristina around age 41 and isabel c 1863 relationship between teresa cristina and pedro ii never became passionately romantic however a bond based upon family mutual respect and fondness did develop empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported emperor s positions she was silent on subject of his relationships with other women suspected or otherwise in turn she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever being threatened or called into question no more children were born after july 1848 even after death of her two sons in infancy a likely reason for halt to childbearing is that emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty wit and intelligence which empress could not provide teresa cristina found ignoring her husband s secret infidelities hidden from public though not always from empress more difficult after pedro ii named an aia governess for their daughters on 9 november 1856 person chosen was luisa de barros countess of barral brazilian born wife of a french nobleman barral possessed all traits that pedro ii most admired in a woman she was charming vivacious elegant sophisticated educated and confident charged with education and upbringing of young princesses barral soon captured hearts of both pedro ii and his eldest daughter isabel leopoldina was not won over and disliked countess although barral may not have escaped pedro ii s embraces she certainly avoided his bed nonetheless emperor s infatuation with countess sometimes put teresa cristina in an awkward position as when her younger daughter leopoldina naively asked her why pedro ii kept nudging barral s foot during their class countess s increasing intimacy with her husband and daughter was painful and vexing to teresa cristina although she feigned ignorance of situation it did not pass unnoticed she wrote in her diary that barral wished to make me tell her that i did not like her but i did not say either yes or no historian tobias monteiro wrote that empress could not disguise that she detested barral later years end of empire and banishment thumb left alt a

death of her daughter leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 february 1871 devastated small imperial family pedro ii decided on a trip to europe that same year to cheer up his wife among other reasons as stated in his own words and to pay a visit to leopoldina s four small boys who had lived in coburg with their parents since late 1860s imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887 teresa cristina preferred her ordinary life in brazil dedicating herself to her family religious devotions and charitable works in fact visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories her family had been dethroned in 1861 and kingdom of two sicilies had been annexed to what would later become unified kingdom of italy everyone she had known from her youth was gone as she wrote in 1872 i do not know how to tell what was impression i had upon seeing again after 28 years my fatherland and not to find anyone for whom i cared empress remained strong willed even after years of marriage pedro ii revealed in a letter written to countess of barral in early 1881 that container with earrings which you mentioned has been cause for much recrimination on part of someone teresa cristina who thinks that i have been to blame for their disappearance her son in law prince gaston count of eu wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in october 1885 on monday 26 when crossing library on way to dinner with emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps and with whom i infer from what she told us she was arguing as she sometimes does she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward nonetheless she continued to express undiminished love for her husband tranquil domestic routine ended when an army faction rebelled and deposed pedro ii on 15 november 1889 ordering entire imperial family to leave brazil upon hearing order to depart an officer told empress resignation my lady she replied to him i have it always but how not to weep having to leave this land forever according to historian roderick j barman events of november 15 1889 broke her emotionally and physically empress loved brazil and its inhabitants she desired nothing more than to end her days there aged 66 and plagued by both cardiac asthma and arthritis she now faced prospect of accompanying her husband in unceasing movement across face of europe spending her last years virtually alone in alien and uncomfortable lodgings having been ill during almost entire voyage across atlantic teresa cristina and her family arrived in lisbon portugal on 7 december death thumb right alt a photographic portrait of a seated woman with graying hair who is dressed in a dark and elaborate late victorian style dress and wearing a flowered bonnet teresa

banished forever from country up until that point they had only been requested to leave with no indication as to how long they were to stay away news broke d teresa cristina s will to live pedro ii wrote in his journal on 28 december 1889 hearing empress complain i went to see what it was she is cold with a pain in her sides but she does not have any fever as day passed teresa cristina s breathing became increasingly labored and failure of her respiratory system led to cardiac arrest and death at 2 00 pm as she lay dying teresa cristina said to maria isabel de andrade pinto baroness of sister in law of joaquim marques lisboa marquis of tamandare maria isabel i do not die of illness i die of sorrow and of regret her last words were i miss my daughter isabel and my grandchildren i

cristina s body was carried to church of sao vicente de fora near lisbon where it was interred in braganza pantheon her remains along with pedro ii s were later repatriated to brazil in 1921 with much fanfare and pomp they were given a final resting place in cathedral of petropolis in 1939 news of her death produced sincere mourning in brazil brazilian poet and journalist artur azevedo wrote of general view toward teresa cristina after her death i never spoke to her but also never passed her without removing my hat and bowing myself not to empress but to sweet and honest figure of a poor almost humble bourgeoise i saw many extremist republicans do same he continued they called her mother of brazilians and we all really attributed to her a kind of a filial veneration that is truth newspapers in brazil also reported her death gazeta de noticias news gazette commented who was this saintly lady we do not need to repeat it all brazil knows that in this blow which hurt former emperor profoundly it is remembered that she was justly and universally proclaimed mother of brazilians jornal do commercio commercial journal wrote for forty and six years dona teresa cristina lived in brazilian fatherland which she sincerely loved and during that long time never anywhere in this vast country was her name pronounced except in praise and words of regard it concluded next to her husband who was for a long time head of brazilian nation her influence was known to be felt only for good legacy thumb left 220px alt inside a gothic chapel a marble effigy of a bearded emperor in uniform and his wife lies atop an intricately carved stone sarcophagus tomb of teresa cristina and pedro ii within cathedral of petropolis brazil teresa cristina has been given a less than prominent place in brazil s history historian aniello angelo avella said that empress nicknamed by her contemporaries as mother of brazilians is completely unknown in italy and little studied in brazil according to his view few existing sources relegate her to having lived in shadow of her husband dedicating herself to her daughters education to home affairs to charity resulting image is of a woman of limited culture blank silent who compensated with kindness and virtues of heart lack of physical attributes and this is view that has come to be enshrined in history and popular imagination despite being not quite a true representation of teresa cristina since she was a well learned and willful woman according to historian eli behar teresa cristina became notable for her discretion which kept her far from being associated with any political movement and for her tenderness and charity which earned her cognomen mother of brazilians a similar opinion is voiced by historian antunes who said that she was beloved by brazilians who defined her for her discretion as silent empress and yet regarded her as mother of brazilians he also praised empress for her sponsorship of cultural and scientific development she promoted culture in various ways bringing from italy artists intellectuals scientists botanists musicians thus contributing to progress and enrichment of nation s cultural life this view is shared by historian eugenia zerbini who argued that thanks to her brazil now has largest classical archaeological collection in latin america just prior to his own death pedro ii donated most of his possessions to brazilian government which were later divided between brazilian national archives imperial museum of brazil national library of brazil and brazilian historic and geographic institute pedro ii imposed only one condition that gift was to be named in honor of his late wife and so it is known as teresa cristina maria collection collection is registered by unesco
