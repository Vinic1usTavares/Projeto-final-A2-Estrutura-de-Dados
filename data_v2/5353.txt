background after release of carey s second studio album emotions 1991 critics began wondering whether carey would finally embark on a worldwide tour having not toured to promote her self titled debut album although carey had done several sporadic award show appearances as well as television program performances critics began accusing carey of being a studio artist not capable of delivering or replicating same quality vocals live especially her whistle register during several televised interviews carey addressed accusations claiming that she did not tour out of fear of long travel times and distances as well as strain on her voice performing her songs back to back however in hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest carey and walter afanasieff decided to book an appearance on mtv unplugged a television program aired by mtv show s purpose was to present name artists and feature them unplugged or stripped of studio equipment while live show allowed several musicians and back up vocalists while recorded in an acoustic setting issues carey faced once show was booked was content she didn t know what material to present at intimate concert while carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included days prior to show s taping carey and afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song in order to provide something different and unexpected they chose i ll be there a song made popular by jackson 5 in 1970 rehearsing it few times before night of show synopsis

next song i wrote with one of my idols carole king beginning performance shortly after for someday cole returned to stage replacing afanasieff on keyboard during song carey would often place her index finger over her left ear especially while using whistle register she later explained to audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note once again as carey began vision of love her first single ever afansieff swapped positions with cole performance varied heavily from studio version as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form without any heavy instrumentation prior to beginning fifth song on set list make it happen afanasieff shared organ with cole playing bass while latter handled treble after song began back up began piling their vocals over carey s according to author chris nickson and allowed song to attain a more churchy feel he felt song was superior to studio version due to its stripped performance and vocals roughness of this version succeeded in a way recorded version on emotions could never manage in sterile atmosphere of a studio where perfection technology and overdubbing were rules spontaneity had no place on stage it was valued and this performance had it everyone pushed everyone just a little further to create something wonderful and judging by response audience realized it as did mariah when song was finished soon after completing make it happen carey eagerly presented final song on set list i ll be there way song was arranged carey took michael jackson s lead while trey lorenz sang second lead originally sung by jermaine jackson after performing sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals back up singers began humming to tune of can t let go leading carey to present another final song for show several days after concert carey sat down with melinda newman from billboard telling her of experience recording show as well as her view on it from a creative perspective she said unplugged taught me a lot about myself because i tend to nitpick everything i do and make it a bit too perfect because i m a perfectionist i
