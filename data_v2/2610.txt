hemiptera or true bugs are an order of insects comprising some 50 000 to 80 000 species of groups such as cicadas aphids planthoppers leafhoppers and shield bugs they range in size from to around and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts name true bugs is sometimes limited to suborder heteroptera many insects commonly known as bugs belong to other orders for example is a fly and may bug and ladybug are beetles most hemipterans feed on plants using their sucking and piercing mouthparts to extract plant sap some are parasitic while others are predators that feed on other insects or small invertebrates they live in a wide variety of habitats generally terrestrial though some species are adapted to life in or on surface of fresh water hemipterans are hemimetabolous with young nymphs that somewhat resemble adults many aphids are capable of parthenogenesis producing young from unfertilised eggs this helps them to reproduce extremely rapidly in favourable conditions humans have interacted with hemiptera for millennia some species including many aphids are significant agricultural pests damaging crops by direct action of sucking sap but also harming them indirectly by being vectors of serious viral diseases other species have been used for biological control of insect pests hemipterans have been cultivated for extraction of dyestuff cochineal also known as carmine and for shellac bed bug is a persistent parasite of humans cicadas have been used as food and have appeared in literature from iliad in ancient greece diversity hemiptera is largest order of hemimetabolous insects not undergoing complete metamorphosis though some examples such as male scale insects do undergo a form of complete metamorphosis containing over 75 000 named species insect orders with more species all have a pupal stage i e they do undergo complete metamorphosis or coleoptera 370 000 described species lepidoptera 160 000 diptera 100 000 and hymenoptera 100 000 group is very diverse majority of species are terrestrial including a number of important agricultural pests but some are found in freshwater habitats these include water boatmen pond skaters and giant water bugs taxonomy and phylogeny thumb upright fossil fulgoromorpha from early cretaceous crato formation of brazil c 116 mya fossil record of hemipterans goes back to carboniferous oldest fossils are of from lower permian and are thought to be basal to auchenorrhyncha and appear in upper permian as do sternorrhyncha of and aphids and appear in triassic coleorrhyncha extend back to lower jurassic heteroptera first appeared in triassic present members of order hemiptera sometimes referred to as were historically placed into two orders so called homoptera and heteroptera hemiptera based on differences in wing structure and position of rostrum order is now divided into four or more suborders after homoptera were established as paraphyletic now auchenorrhyncha and sternorrhyncha cladogram is based on one analysis of phylogeny of by hu li and colleagues in 2015 using mitochondrial genome sequences and homogeneous models it places sternorrhyncha as sister clade to thysanoptera and lice making hemiptera as traditionally understood non monophyletic however when heterogeneous models were used hemiptera was found to be monophyletic result where hemiptera was found to be non monophyletic is likely due to phylogenetic artifacts such as elevated substitution rates in sternorrhyncha compared with other suborders of hemiptera english names are given in parentheses where possible hemiptera suborders suborder no of species first appearance examples characteristics auchenorrhyncha over 42 000 lower permian cicadas leafhoppers treehoppers planthoppers froghoppers plant sucking bugs many can jump many make calls some loud coleorrhyncha fewer than 30 lower jurassic moss bugs evolved in southern continent of gondwana heteroptera 25 000 triassic shield bugs seed bugs assassin bugs flower bugs bugs water bugs larger bugs often predatory sternorrhyncha 12 500 upper permian aphids whiteflies scale insects plant sucking bugs some major horticultural pests most are sedentary or fully sessile biology mouthparts thumb hemipteran mouthparts are distinctive with mandibles and maxillae modified to form a piercing stylet sheathed within a modified labium defining feature of hemipterans is their beak in which modified mandibles and maxillae form a stylet which is sheathed within a modified labium stylet is capable of piercing tissues and sucking liquids while labium supports it stylet contains a channel for outward movement of saliva and another for inward movement of liquid food a salivary pump drives saliva into prey a cibarial pump extracts liquid from prey both pumps are powered by substantial dilator muscles in head beak is usually folded under body when not in use diet is typically plant sap but some hemipterans such as assassin bugs are blood suckers and a few are predators both herbivorous and predatory hemipterans inject enzymes to begin digestion before food is taken into body these enzymes include amylase to hydrolyse starch to weaken tough cell walls of plants and to break down proteins although hemiptera vary widely in their overall form their mouthparts form a distinctive rostrum other insect orders with mouthparts modified into anything like rostrum and stylets of hemiptera include some phthiraptera but for other reasons they generally are easy to recognize as non hemipteran similarly mouthparts of siphonaptera some diptera and thysanoptera superficially resemble rostrum of hemiptera but on closer inspection differences are considerable aside from mouthparts various other insects can be confused with hemiptera but they all have biting mandibles and maxillae instead of rostrum examples include cockroaches and both of which have longer many segmented antennae and some beetles but these have fully hardened forewings which do not overlap wing structure forewings of hemiptera are either entirely membranous as in sternorrhyncha and auchenorrhyncha or partially hardened as in most heteroptera name hemiptera is from greek half and wing referring to forewings of many heteropterans which are hardened near base but membranous at ends wings modified in this manner are termed singular by analogy with completely hardened elytra of beetles and occur only in suborder heteroptera in all suborders hindwings if present at all are entirely membranous and usually shorter than forewings forewings may be held over body typical of sternorrhyncha and auchenorrhyncha or held flat on back with ends overlapping typical of heteroptera antennae in hemiptera typically consist of four or five segments although they can still be quite long and tarsi of legs have two or three segments sound production many hemipterans can produce sound for communication song of male cicadas loudest of any insect is produced by organs on underside of abdomen and is used to attract mates are disks of cuticle which are clicked in and out repeatedly making a sound in same way as popping metal lid of a jam jar in and out stridulatory sounds are produced among aquatic corixidae and notonectidae backswimmers using tibial combs rubbed across rostral ridges life cycle thumb upright left an ant mimicking predatory bug gracilis hemipterans are hemimetabolous meaning that they do not undergo metamorphosis complete change of form between a larval phase and an adult phase instead their young are called nymphs and resemble adults to a greater or lesser degree nymphs moult several times as they grow and each instar resembles adult more than previous one wing buds grow in later stage nymphs final transformation involves little more than development of functional wings if they are present at all and functioning sexual organs with no intervening pupal stage as in holometabolous insects parthenogenesis and viviparity thumb aphid giving birth to live female young many aphids are parthenogenetic during part of life cycle such that females can produce unfertilized eggs which are clones of their mother all such young are females thelytoky so 100 of population at these times can produce more offspring many species of aphid are also viviparous young are born live rather than laid as eggs these adaptations enable aphids to reproduce extremely rapidly when conditions are suitable locomotion thumb upright 0 8 pondskaters are adapted to use surface tension to keep above a freshwater surface hemipterans make use of a variety of modes of locomotion including swimming skating on a water surface and jumping as well as walking and flying like other insects swimming and skating several families of heteroptera are water bugs adapted to an aquatic lifestyle such as water boatmen corixidae water scorpions and backswimmers notonectidae they are mostly predatory and have legs adapted as paddles to help animal move through water pondskaters or water are also associated with water but use surface tension of standing water to keep them above surface they include sea skaters in genus only truly marine group of insects thumb upright 0 9 adult and nymph microvelia water bugs using marangoni propulsion marangoni propulsion marangoni effect propulsion exploits change in surface tension when a soap like surfactant is released on to a water surface in same way that a toy soap boat propels itself water bugs in genus microvelia can travel at up to 17 cm s twice as fast as they can walk by this means flight thumb bicolor wings in flight position flight is well developed in hemiptera although mostly used for short distance movement and dispersal wing development is sometimes related to environmental conditions in some groups of hemiptera there are variations of winged short winged and wingless forms within a single species this kind of polymorphism tends is thought to be helpful when habitats are temporary with more energy put into reproduction when food is available and into dispersal through flight when food becomes scarce in aphids both winged and wingless forms occur with winged forms produced in greater numbers when food resources are depleted aphids and whiteflies can sometimes be transported very long distances by atmospheric updrafts and high altitude winds wing length polymorphism is notably rare in tree living hemiptera jumping many auchenorrhyncha including representatives of cicadas leafhoppers treehoppers planthoppers and froghoppers are adapted for jumping saltation treehoppers for example jump by rapidly depressing their hind legs before jumping hind legs are raised and femora are pressed tightly into curved indentations in coxae treehoppers can attain a take off velocity of up to 2 7 metres per second and an acceleration of up to 250 g instantaneous power output is much greater than that of normal muscle implying that energy is stored and released to catapult insect into air cicadas which are much larger extend their hind legs for a jump in under a millisecond again implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release sedentary instead of relying on any form of locomotion most sternorrhyncha females are sedentary or completely sessile attached to their host plants by their thin feeding stylets which cannot be taken out of plant quickly ecological roles feeding modes herbivores thumb leaf galls formed by plant lice var most hemipterans are phytophagous using their sucking and piercing mouthparts to feed on plant sap these include cicadas leafhoppers treehoppers planthoppers froghoppers aphids whiteflies scale insects and some other groups some are being host specific and only found on one plant taxon others are feeding on a few plant groups while others again are less discriminating and feed on many species of plant relationship between hemipterans and plants appears to be ancient with piercing and sucking of plants evident in early devonian period hemipterans can dramatically cut mass of affected plants especially in major outbreaks they sometimes also change mix of plants by predation on seeds or feeding on roots of certain species some sap suckers move from one host to another at different times of year many aphids spend winter as eggs on a woody host plant and summer as parthogenetically reproducing females on a herbaceous plant thumb upright left a twig wilting bug piercing and sucking sap from a phloem sap which has a higher concentration of sugars and nitrogen is under positive pressure unlike more dilute xylem sap most of sternorrhyncha and a number of groups feed on phloem phloem feeding is common in fulgoromorpha most and in heteroptera cicadellids specialize in feeding on non vascular mesophyll tissue of leaves which is more nutritious than leaf epidermis most heteroptera also feed on mesophyll tissue where they are more likely to encounter defensive secondary plant metabolites which often leads to evolution of host specificity obligate xylem feeding is a special habit that is found in auchenorrhyncha among cicadoidea cercopoidea and in cicadellids some phloem feeders may take to xylem sap facultatively especially when facing dehydration xylem feeders tend to be polyphagous to overcome negative pressure of xylem requires a special cibarial pump phloem feeding hemiptera typically have symbiotic micro organisms in their gut that help to convert amino acids phloem feeders produce honeydew from their anus a variety of organisms that feed on honeydew form symbiotic associations with phloem feeders phloem sap is a sugary liquid low in amino acids so insects have to process large quantities to meet their nutritional requirements xylem sap is even lower in amino acids and contains monosaccharides rather than sucrose as well as organic acids and minerals no digestion is required except for hydrolysis of sucrose and 90 of nutrients in xylem sap can be utilised some phloem sap feeders selectively mix phloem and xylem sap to control osmotic potential of liquid consumed a striking adaptation to a very dilute diet is found in many hemipterans a filter chamber a part of gut looped back on itself as a countercurrent exchanger which permits nutrients to be separated from excess water residue mostly water with sugars and amino acids is quickly excreted as sticky honey dew notably from aphids but also from other and sternorrhyncha some sternorrhyncha including psyllids and some aphids are gall formers these sap sucking hemipterans inject fluids containing plant hormones into plant tissues inducing production of tissue that covers to protects insect and also act as sinks for nutrition that they feed on hackleberry gall psyllid for example causes a woody gall on leaf petioles of hackleberry tree it infests and nymph of another psyllid produces a protective lerp out of hardened honeydew predators most other hemipterans are predatory feeding on other insects or even small vertebrates this is true of many aquatic species which are predatory either as nymphs or adults predatory shield bug for example stabs caterpillars with its beak and sucks out body fluids saliva of predatory heteropterans contains digestive enzymes such as proteinase and phospholipase and in some species also amylase mouthparts of these insects are adapted for predation there are toothed stylets on mandibles able to cut into and tissues of their prey there are further stylets on maxillae adapted as tubular canals to inject saliva and to extract pre digested and liquified contents of prey some species attack pest insects and are used in biological control one of these is spined soldier bug that sucks body fluids from larvae of colorado beetle and mexican bean beetle haematophagic parasites a few hemipterans are haematophagic often described as parasites feeding on blood of larger animals these include and kissing bugs of assassin bug family reduviidae which can transmit dangerous chagas disease first known hemipteran to feed in this way on vertebrates was extinct assassin bug dominicana found fossilized in amber and dating back about twenty million years faecal pellets fossilised beside it show that it transmitted a disease causing trypanosoma and amber included hairs of likely host a bat as symbionts thumb upright 0 6 leafhoppers protected by meat ants some species of ant protect and farm aphids sternorrhyncha and other sap sucking hemipterans gathering and eating honeydew that these hemipterans secrete relationship is mutualistic as both ant and aphid benefit ants such as yellow ant lasius flavus breed aphids of at least four species utricularia ulmi forda marginata and forda taking eggs with them when they found a new colony in return these aphids are obligately associated with ant breeding mainly or wholly asexually inside ants may also protect plant bugs from their natural enemies removing eggs of predatory beetles and preventing access by parasitic wasps some leafhoppers auchenorrhyncha are similarly milked by ants in corcovado rain forest of costa rica wasps compete with ants to protect and milk leafhoppers leafhoppers preferentially give more honeydew more often to wasps which are larger and may offer better protection as prey defences against predators and parasites thumb left masked hunter nymph has camouflaged itself with sand grains hemiptera form prey to predators including vertebrates such as birds and other invertebrates such as ladybirds in response hemipterans have evolved antipredator adaptations may feign death others such as secrete toxic fluids to ward off arthropod predators some such as are able to direct these fluids at an attacker toxic compounds are accumulated by fasciatus when it consumes while stinkbug rubiginosus acquires 2 from its food plant eucalyptus some long legged bugs mimic twigs rocking to and fro to simulate motion of a plant part in wind nymph of masked hunter bug itself with sand grains using its hind legs and tarsal fan to form a double layer of grains coarser on outside amazon rain forest cicada display bright red deimatic flash coloration on their hindwings when threatened sudden contrast helps to startle predators giving cicadas time to escape coloured patch on hindwing is concealed at rest by an olive green patch of same size on forewing enabling insect to switch rapidly from cryptic to deimatic behaviour thumb firebugs protect themselves from predators with bright aposematic warning coloration and by aggregating in a group some hemipterans such as firebugs have bold aposematic warning coloration often red and black which appear to deter passerine birds many hemipterans including aphids scale insects and especially planthoppers secrete wax to protect themselves from threats such as fungi parasitoidal insects and predators as well as abiotic factors like desiccation hard waxy coverings are especially important in sedentary sternorrhyncha such as scale insects which have no means of escape from predators other sternorrhyncha evade detection and attack by creating and living inside plant galls nymphal cicadoidea and cercopoidea have glands attached to malpighian tubules in their proximal segment that produce mucopolysaccharides which form froth around offering a measure of protection parental care is found in many species of hemiptera especially in members of and numerous heteroptera in many species of shield bug females stand guard over their egg clusters to protect them from egg parasitoids and predators in aquatic females lay their eggs on back of male which guards eggs protection provided by ants is common in auchenorrhyncha interaction with humans thumb colony of cottony cushion scale a pest of citrus fruits as pests although many species of hemiptera are significant pests of crops and garden plants including many species of aphid and scale insects other species are harmless damage done is often not so much deprivation of plant of its sap but fact that they transmit serious viral diseases between plants they often produce copious amounts of honeydew which encourages growth of sooty mould significant pests include cottony cushion scale a pest of citrus fruit trees green peach aphid and other aphids which attack crops worldwide and transmit diseases and jumping plant lice which are often host plant specific and transmit diseases for pest control members of families reduviidae and are obligate predators some predatory species are used in biological pest control these include various and even some members of families that are primarily phytophagous such as genus geocoris in family lygaeidae other hemipterans are omnivores alternating between a plant based and an animal based diet for example hesperus is used to control on tomatoes but also sucks sap and if deprived of plant tissues will die even if in presence of whiteflies insect products

are used as food in asian countries such as china and they are much esteemed in malawi and other african countries insects have a high protein content and good food conversion ratios but most hemipterans are too small to be a useful component of human diet at least nine species of hemiptera are eaten worldwide in art and literature cicadas have featured in literature since time of homer s iliad and as motifs in decorative art from chinese shang dynasty 1766 1122 b c they are described by aristotle in his history of animals and by pliny elder in his natural history their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by hesiod in his poem works and days when flowers and tuneful sitting on his tree in weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song in mythology and folklore among bugs cicadas in particular have been used as money in folk medicine to forecast weather to provide song in china and in folklore and myths around world threats large scale cultivation
