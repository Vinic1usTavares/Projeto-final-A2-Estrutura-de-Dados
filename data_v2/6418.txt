operation sana was a military offensive undertaken by army of republic of bosnia and herzegovina armija republike bosne i hercegovine arbih in western bosnia and herzegovina during bosnian war it was launched from area of bihac on 13 september 1995 against army of republika srpska vojska republike srpske vrs and involved advances towards bosanski petrovac sanski most and bosanska krupa at same time croatian army hrvatska vojska hv and croatian defence council hrvatsko vijece obrane hvo were engaging vrs in operation maestral 2 further to southeast after an initial advance vrs reinforcements managed to stop arbih short of sanski most and novi grad and reversed some of arbih s territorial gains in a counterattack after a part of arbih 5th corps was threatened with defeat around town of kljuc arbih requested assistance from hv hv and hvo launched operation southern move in response removing vrs pressure from kljuc and allowing 5th corps reinforced by 7th corps to resume its advance and capture sanski most on 12 october by which time a comprehensive ceasefire was to come into effect throughout country combat continued for another eight days without significant changes to frontlines fighting did not resume and war ended following month following negotiation and acceptance of dayton agreement operation commenced during a nato bombing campaign against vrs codenamed operation deliberate force which targeted bosnian serb air defences artillery and storage facilities initially in area of sarajevo but also elsewhere in country operation sana alongside concurrent hv and hvo offensives sparked debate among military analysts as to whether ground assaults or nato s airstrikes were more responsible for ending bosnian war also in question was to what extent advances of arbih hvo and hv were assisted by airstrikes and conversely to what extent they hampered vrs background as yugoslav people s army jugoslovenska narodna armija jna withdrew from croatia following acceptance and start of implementation of vance plan its 55 000 officers and soldiers born in bosnia and herzegovina were transferred to a new bosnian serb army which was later renamed army of republika srpska vojska republike srpske vrs this re organisation followed declaration of serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina on 9 january 1992 ahead of referendum on independence of bosnia and herzegovina that took place between 29 february and 1 march 1992 this declaration would later be cited by bosnian serbs as a pretext for bosnian war bosnian serbs began fortifying capital sarajevo and other areas on 1 march 1992 on following day first fatalities of war were recorded in sarajevo and doboj in final days of march bosnian serb forces bombarded bosanski brod with artillery resulting in a cross border operation by croatian army hrvatska vojska hv 108th brigade on 4 april 1992 jna artillery began shelling sarajevo there were other examples of jna directly supported vrs such as during capture of zvornik in early april 1992 when jna provided artillery support from serbia firing across drina river at same time jna attempted to defuse situation and arrange negotiations elsewhere in country jna and vrs in bosnia and herzegovina faced army of republic of bosnia and herzegovina armija republike bosne i hercegovine arbih and croatian defence council hrvatsko vijece obrane hvo reporting to bosniak dominated central government and bosnian croat leadership respectively as well as hv which occasionally supported hvo operations in late april vrs was able to deploy 200 000 troops hundreds of tanks armoured personnel carriers apcs and artillery pieces hvo and croatian defence forces hrvatske obrambene snage hos could field approximately 25 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons while arbih was largely unprepared with nearly 100 000 troops small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons arming of various forces was hampered by a united nations un arms embargo introduced in september 1991 by mid may 1992 when those jna units which had not been transferred to vrs withdrew from bosnia and herzegovina to newly declared federal republic of yugoslavia vrs controlled approximately 60 percent of bosnia and herzegovina extent of control was extended to about 70 percent of country by end of year prelude by 1995 arbih and hvo had developed into better organised forces employing comparably large numbers of artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications vrs was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics for instance in battle of orasje in may and june 1995 in august 1995 after fall of most of croatian serb controlled areas of croatia during operation storm hv shifted its focus to western bosnia shift was motivated by desire to create a security zone along croatian border establish croatia as a regional power and gain favours with west by forcing an end to bosnian war government of bosnia and herzegovina welcomed move as it contributed to their goal of securing western bosnia as well as largest bosnian serb held city banja luka in final days of august 1995 nato launched an air campaign targeting vrs codenamed operation deliberate force it was launched in response to second markale massacre of 28 august which came on heels of srebrenica massacre airstrikes began on 30 august initially targeting vrs air defences and striking targets near sarajevo campaign was briefly suspended on 1 september and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around city bombing resumed on 5 september and its scope extended to vrs air defences near banja luka by 9 september as nato had nearly exhausted its list of targets near sarajevo on 13 september bosnian serbs accepted nato s demand for establishment of an exclusion zone around sarajevo and campaign ceased as nato bombing generally targeted vrs around sarajevo western bosnia remained relatively calm following operation storm except for probing attacks launched by vrs hvo or arbih near bihac drvar and glamoc at time hv hvo and arbih were planning a joint offensive in region hv and

advance northeast of sanski most engaging bulk of vrs 43rd motorised brigade in a series of clashes this fighting resulted in little change to territory held by either side by 20 october when fighting died down aftermath thumb 300px right areas captured in september october 1995 and operation sana as well as operation maestral 2 were crucial in applying pressure on vrs in final weeks of bosnian war a central intelligence agency analysis comparing effects of operation deliberate force sana and maestral 2 on vrs noted that nato campaign did not degrade combat capability of vrs as much as was initially assumed because airstrikes were never primarily directed at field deployed units rather they targeted command and control infrastructure of bosnian serb military analysis concluded that while nato degraded capabilities of vrs final hv hvo and arbih offensives inflicted most damage it further noted that those offensives rather than nato bombing were responsible for bringing bosnian serbs to negotiating table and ending war author robert c owen argues that hv hvo and arbih would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had nato not intervened and denied vrs its long range communications operation sana and operation southern move established 51 49 distribution of territory controlled by arbih and hvo on one hand and vrs on other as envisaged in plans put forward by contact group arbih hvo and hv ultimately consented to maintenance of ceasefire of 12 october according to british historian marko attila hoare their acquiescence was secured following massive diplomatic pressure from west and alleged threat of us airstrikes against arbih if it breached ceasefire bosnian war ended with acceptance of dayton agreement by all sides in november 1995 offensive resulted in 178 dead 588 wounded and 41 captured arbih troops bosnian serb losses were 900 killed and more than 1 000 wounded in september and october 6 500 bosniak and croat civilians living in area of banja luka or prijedor were expelled from their homes by bosnian serb forces changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near sanski most believed to contain bodies of 300 civilians killed by bosnian serb forces in april 1992 operation sana along with near concurrent operation maestral 2 created a large number of serb refugees from areas previously controlled by vrs bosnian serb sources document approximately 40 000 refugees in september 1995 encompassing entire contemporary bosnian serb populations of towns of jajce sipovo mrkonjic grad and donji vakuf having fled or been evacuated at time un spokesman in sarajevo estimated number of refugees at 20 000 fighting in october caused a further 30 000 40 000 refugees to flee sanski most and another 10 000 to
