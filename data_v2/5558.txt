station closes rail issue 289 9 october 1996 page 6 first station filton first station at filton opened on 8 september 1863 when services began on bristol and south wales union railway bswur which ran from to north of bristol on banks of river severn at new passage passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross severn to continue on into wales line engineered by isambard kingdom brunel was built as single track broad gauge with a platform on western side of line station was situated in county of gloucestershire from bristol temple meads and immediately south of modern bridge over a4174 avon ring road bswur was amalgamated with great western railway who had from beginning operated all bswur services in 1868 and in 1873 line was converted to standard gauge although line made travel from bristol to wales easier change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient and so a tunnel was built under river severn to cope with anticipated increase in demand line through filton was doubled with a new platform built on eastern side of new track complete with waiting room new track was first used on 1 september 1886 when severn tunnel opened station continued in use until 1 july 1903 when it was closed and replaced by a new station further north there is no trace remaining of original station second station filton junction thumb a train for wales passes through filton junction in 1962

platform faces two outer platforms and two inner platforms sharing an island between southbound line from patchway and westbound line to london western platforms served trains between bristol and wales while eastern platforms served trains on new line platforms were linked by a subway which led to booking office situated on ground level by main entrance on east side of station approach road led south from main entrance towards a4174 there were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of platforms there were goods facilities to south of road on west side of line and covering site of first station there was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop as well as a north facing covered loading platform and a south facing siding an additional south facing siding for coal traffic

northbound platform via a footpath from car park to north there were metal and glass shelters on each platform and a small rarely used booking office on southbound platform initial services at station included local stopping services from bristol to south wales and services between and services towards bath were of particular importance to mod as many of their staff had been based there prior to

and also students and staff at university of west of england when railway was privatised in 1997 local services were franchised to wales west which was succeeded by wessex trains in 2001 line through filton closed for two weeks in june 2004 to enable construction of a new platform and third running line on west side of station separating trains towards bristol parkway from trains towards wales before station and so allowing through trains to pass stopping trains project cost ps16 million and caused complete suspension of severn beach line services to allow longer distance services to use it
