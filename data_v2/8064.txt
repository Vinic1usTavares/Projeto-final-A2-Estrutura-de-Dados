watched as a child and by his childhood ambition to become a martial artist a senior hollywood executive said chow was forced to grind through four successive scripts and found it very laborious chow s first priority was to design main location of film pig sty alley later in an interview chow remarked that he had created location from his childhood basing design on crowded apartment complexes of hong kong where he had lived 1973 shaw brothers studio film house of 72 tenants was another inspiration for pig sty alley designing alley began in january 2003 and took four months to complete many of props and furniture in apartments were antiques from all over china casting kung fu hustle features several prolific hong kong action cinema actors from 1970s yuen wah a former student of china drama academy peking opera school who appeared in over a hundred hong kong films and was a stunt double for bruce lee played landlord of pig sty alley wah considered starring in kung fu hustle to be peak of his career in spite of film s success he worried that nowadays fewer people practice martial arts auditions for role of landlady began in march 2003 yuen qiu who did not audition was spotted during her friend s screen test smoking a cigarette with a sarcastic expression on her face which won her part qiu a student of yu jim yuen sifu of china drama academy had appeared in 1974 james bond film

have no dialogue in film so that she could stand out only with her body gestures filming thumb cgi construction of buddhist palm right filming took place in shanghai from june 2003 to november 2003 two thirds of time was spent shooting fight sequences those scenes were initially choreographed by sammo hung who quit after two months due to illness tough outdoor conditions interest in another project and arguments with production crew hung was replaced by yuen woo ping an action choreographer with experience ranging from 1960s hong kong action cinema to more recent films like crouching tiger hidden dragon and matrix yuen promptly accepted offer yuen drew on seemingly outdated wuxia fighting styles like deadly melody and buddhist palm he remarked that despite comedic nature of film shooting process was a serious matter due to tight schedule most of special effects in film created by hong kong computer graphics company centro digital pictures limited which had previously worked on films such as shaolin soccer and kill bill included a combination of computer generated imagery and wire work centro digital performed extensive tests on cgi scenes before filming started and treatment of preliminary shots began immediately afterwards cgi crew edited out wire effects and applied special effects in high resolution legendary martial arts mentioned in wuxia novels were depicted and exaggerated through cgi but actual people were used for final fight between chow s character and hundreds of axe wielding gangsters after a final calibration of colour data of processed scenes was sent to us for production of final version a group of six people followed production crew throughout shooting music majority of film s original score was composed by raymond wong and performed by hong kong chinese orchestra score imitates traditional chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films one of wong s works nothing ventured nothing gained provides a stark contrast between villainous axe gang and peaceful neighbourhood of pig sty alley depicted by a chinese folk song fisherman s song of east china sea along with wong s compositions and various traditional chinese songs classical compositions are featured in score including excerpts from by pablo de sarasate and sabre dance by aram khachaturian song huo zhi yao wei ni huo yi tian only want to live one day for you is

landlady says at one point tomorrow is another day which is a line from 1936 novel gone with wind and its 1939 film adaptation a major element of plot is based on wuxia film series palm of ru lai ru lai shen zhang released in 1964 kung fu hustle sing studied fighting style used in palm of ru lai buddhist palm style from a young age and used it at end of kung fu hustle in reality buddhist palm fighting style does not leave palm shaped craters and holes on impact instead user delivers powerful punches using his palm beast s name in chinese huo yun xie shen evil deity of fiery cloud and fight

1987 film untouchables kung fu hustle dialogue that beast says while negotiating with axe gang for killing landlady and landlord then young friend i will make an offer you cannot refuse is a reference of dialogue from movie godfather also landlady s comment to brother sum we brought a gift you cannot refuse is an obvious parody of same to which sum replies in dubbed version of film ha with beast on our side we shall see for whom bell tolls a reference to 1943 film final fight between sing who has been reborn into one which pays homage to bruce lee by wearing his costume in enter dragon and using his fighting style and hundreds of gangsters imitates fight between neo and hundreds of agent smiths in matrix reloaded scene in which beast prompts an axe member to punch him harder is reminiscent of
