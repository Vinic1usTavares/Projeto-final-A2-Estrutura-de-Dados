freedom party of austria fpo is a right wing populist national conservative political party in austria party led by norbert hofer since september 2019 is a member of identity and democracy group in european parliament as well as of identity and democracy party fpo was founded in 1956 as successor to short lived federation of independents vdu representing third camp of austrian politics i e pan germanists and national liberals opposed to both socialism and catholic clericalism party s first leader was anton reinthaller a former nazi functionary and ss officer fpo a third party with modest support was admitted to liberal international li in 1979 and participated in a government led by social democratic party spo following 1983 legislative election when jorg haider was chosen as new fpo leader in 1986 party started an ideological turn towards right wing populism this new political course soon resulted in a strong surge in electoral support although it also led spo to break ties in 1993 after a controversial proposal on immigration issues adherents of a position closer to classical liberalism broke away from fpo and formed liberal forum lif which took over fpo s membership in li since fpo considered itself forced to leave and would later eventually merge into neos among other things party supports unification of south tyrol italy with tyrol austria and therefore south tyrolean secessionist movement which notably includes its south tyrolean sister party die in 1999 legislative election fpo placed second and won 26 9 of vote its best ever result in a nationwide election and for first time came ahead of austrian people s party ovp by a small margin fpo eventually reached a coalition agreement with ovp in 2000 but ceded chancellorship to ovp to appease international opinion fpo soon became uncomfortable with governing and fell sharply in 2002 legislative election in which it obtained only 10 of vote however two parties agreed to continue their coalition following election in 2005 increasing internal disagreements in fpo led haider and several leading members including all party s ministers to defect and form alliance for future of austria bzo which replaced fpo as government partner under leadership of heinz christian strache 2005 2019 party gradually re gained and increased popular support in 2013 legislative election fpo won 20 5 of vote and more recently it came ahead either of spo or ovp in some state elections entered in an spo led government in burgenland and gained more than 30 of vote in vienna finally in 2016 presidential election fpo member norbert hofer won first round receiving 35 1 but was defeated by greens candidate alexander van der bellen 53 8 against 46 2 in final run off an earlier run off was invalidated in nationwide legislative snap elections in october 2017 fpo won 26 of vote a narrow third place and entered coalition government as a junior partner with ovp leader sebastian kurz as chancellor ibiza affair that broke out on 17 may 2019 has led strache to tender his resignation next day as both vice chancellor and party leader strache als und fpo chef fpo chef heinz christian strache aus der ibiza affare seine auf dem heimlich video er habe sich aber nichts kommen lassen trotzdem habe er kurz seinen der spiegel 18 may 2019 which in turn led to collapse of coalition with ovp and subsequent new elections scandal was triggered by video of a july 2017 meeting in ibiza spain published on 17 may 2019 appearing to show strache and gudenus discussing underhanded political practices in video both politicians appeared receptive to proposals by a woman posing as niece of a russian oligarch discussing providing fpo positive news coverage in return for business contracts strache and gudenus also hinted at corrupt political practices involving other wealthy donors to fpo elsewhere in a snap election held on 29 september 2019 freedom party won 16 percent of vote results represent a loss of about one third of party s seats in parliament history political background fpo is a descendant of pan german and national liberal camp lager dating back to revolutions of 1848 in habsburg areas during interwar era national liberal camp gathered in greater german people s party fought against mutually hostile christian social and marxist camps in their struggles to structure new republic according to their respective ideologies after a short civil war federal state of austria an authoritarian christian social dictatorship was established in 1934 by 1938 with anschluss of austria into nazi germany national liberal camp which had always striven for an inclusion of austria into a greater germany had been swallowed whole by austrian national socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into nazi totalitarianism both socialists and christian were persecuted under nazi regime and national liberal camp was scarred after war due to guilt by association with national socialism in 1949 federation of independents vdu was founded as a national liberal alternative to main austrian parties social democratic party spo and austrian people s party ovp successors to interwar era marxist and christian social parties vdu was founded by two liberal salzburg journalists former nazi germany prisoners who wanted to stay clear of mainstream socialist and catholic camps and feared that hostility following hastily devised postwar denazification policy which did not distinguish between party members and actual war criminals might stimulate a revival of nazism aiming to become a political home to everyone not a member of two main parties vdu incorporated an array of political movements including free market liberals populists former nazis and german nationalists all of whom had been unable to join either of two main parties vdu won 12 of vote in 1949 general election but saw its support beginning to decline soon afterward it evolved into fpo by 1955 56 after merging with minor freedom party in 1955 a new party was formed on 17 october 1955 and its founding congress was held on 7 april 1956 early years 1956 1980 first fpo party leader was anton reinthaller a former nazi minister of agriculture and ss officer he had been asked by ovp chancellor julius raab to take over movement rather than let it be led by a more socialist leaning group while majority of former nazis had probably joined two main parties in absolute numbers they formed a greater percentage of fpo members due to party s small size nevertheless none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic non ideological policies fpo served as a vehicle for them to integrate in second republic party was a welcome partner with both spo and ovp in regional and local politics although it was excluded at national level ovp and fpo ran a joint candidate for 1957 presidential election who lost reinthaller was replaced as leader in 1958 by friedrich peter also a former ss officer who led party through 1960s and 1970s and moved it towards political centre in 1966 ovp spo grand coalition which had governed austria since war was broken was put to an end when ovp gained enough votes to govern alone spo leader bruno kreisky himself a jew defended peter s past and initiated a political relationship and a personal friendship with peter in 1970 fpo was for first time able to tolerate an spo minority government in 1967 more extreme faction in fpo broke away and established national democratic party seen by some observers as a final shedding of party s nazi legacy under influence of kreisky a new generation of liberals brought fpo into liberal international in 1978 during years under peter party never won more than 8 of national vote in general elections and generally did not have much political significance steger leadership 1980 1986 liberal norbert steger was chosen as new fpo party leader in 1980 in an effort to gain popularity he helped fpo become established as a moderate centrist liberal party his vision was to transform fpo into an austrian version of german free democratic party focusing on free market and anti statist policies in 1980s austrian political system began to change dominance of spo and ovp started to erode and austrian electorate began to swing to right spo leader bruno kreisky had encouraged fpo s move to centre in order to establish an spo fpo alliance against ovp 1983 general election was a watershed spo lost its absolute majority in parliament which resulted in formation of an spo fpo small coalition ironically 1983 election result was worst for fpo in its history it received slightly less than 5 of vote and during next few years party saw 2 3 support or even less in opinion polls as a consequence party was soon torn by internal strife in 1983 right wing jorg haider took over leadership of fpo s significant carinthia branch its importance dated to defensive struggle following world war i and subsequent anti slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by yugoslavia encouraged by mass media a struggle soon developed between steger and haider over future of party in 1985 reder case for instance haider staunchly supported fpo minister of defence friedhelm when latter welcomed convicted waffen ss war criminal walter reder in person when reder arrived at graz airport after his release from italy while fpo struggled with its low support at national level in mid 1980s this was in sharp contrast to party s position in haider s carinthia where party had increased its support from 11 7 in 1979 provincial election to 16 in 1984 during 1986 national convention in innsbruck internal struggle developed into an open conflict this led haider to victory as new fpo party leader with 58 of vote supported by conservative and pan german factions however incoming spo chancellor franz vranitzky who also entered office in 1986 had strong negative feelings towards haider who he felt was too far right vranitzky subsequently announced an election in 1986 in process disbanding spo fpo small coalition and after election entered into a coalition with ovp under haider s leadership fpo increased its vote to 9 7 while party gradually became more right wing and its former liberal influence waned as fpo increased its electoral support with haider s radical populist rhetoric party reduced its chances of forming coalitions with other parties haider leadership 1986 2000 thumb 170px jorg haider 2007 with jorg haider as new party leader 1989 carinthia provincial election caused a sensation spo lost its majority and ovp was relegated to third party status as fpo finished second with 29 of vote fpo formed a coalition with ovp with haider as governor of carinthia at this point his greatest political triumph by 1990 general election party had moved away from liberal mainstream course instead focusing on immigration and becoming increasingly critical of political establishment and eu following a remark made by haider in 1991 about decent employment policy of nazi germany in contrast to that of current austrian government he was removed as governor by a joint spo ovp initiative and replaced by ovp s christof later that year however fpo saw gains made in three provincial elections most notably in vienna while haider often employed controversial rhetoric his expressed political goals included small government with more direct democracy rather than centralized totalitarianism following increasing importance of immigration as a political issue in 1993 party decided to launch austria first initiative calling for a referendum on immigration issues initiative was controversial and five fpo mps including heide schmidt left party and founded liberal forum lif fpo s relations with liberal international also became increasingly strained and later that year fpo left li which was preparing to expel it in turn lif soon joined liberal international instead in 1999 haider was again elected governor of carinthia coalition government 2000 2005 in 1999 general election fpo won 27 of votes more than in any previous election beating ovp for first time by a small margin in february 2000 ovp agreed to form a coalition government with fpo normally haider should have become federal chancellor however it soon became apparent that haider was too controversial to be part of government let alone lead it amid intense international criticism of fpo s participation in government fpo ceded chancellorship to wolfgang schussel of ovp as a concession to fpo party was given power to appoint ministers of finance and social affairs later that month haider stepped down as party chairman replaced by susanne riess passer having threatened a diplomatic boycott of austria other fourteen european union eu countries introduced sanctions after government had been formed other than formal eu meetings contacts with austria were reduced measures were justified by eu which stated that admission of fpo into a coalition government extreme right in europe party had been kept on sidelines for most of second republic except for its brief role in government in 1980s along with party s origins and its focus on issues such as immigration and questions of identity and belonging party had been subjected to a strategy of cordon sanitaire by spo and ovp eu sanctions were lifted in september after a report had found that measures were effective only in short term in long run they might give rise to an anti eu backlash some observers noted an inconsistency in that there had been no sanctions against italy when post fascist italian social movement national alliance had entered government in 1994 fpo struggled with its shift from an anti establishment party to being part of government which led to decreasing internal stability and electoral support its blue collar voters became unhappy with party s need to support some neo liberal ovp economic reforms government s peak in unpopularity occurred when tax reform was postponed at same time that government was planning to purchase new interceptor jets internecine strife erupted in party over strategy between party members in government and haider who allied himself with party s grassroots several prominent fpo government ministers resigned in 2002 putsch after strong attacks by haider which led to new elections being called in subsequent election campaign party was deeply divided and unable to organise an effective political strategy it changed leaders five times in less than two months and in 2002 general election decreased its share of vote to 10 2 almost two thirds less than its previous share most of its voters sided with ovp which became largest party in austria with 43 of vote nevertheless coalition government of ovp and fpo was revived after election however there was increasing criticism within fpo against party s mission of winning elections at any cost haider s departure for bzo after an internal row had threatened to tear fpo apart former chairman jorg haider then chairwoman and his sister ursula vice chancellor hubert and all of fpo ministers left party and on 4 april 2005 founded a new political party called alliance for future of austria bzo austria s chancellor wolfgang schussel followed changing his coalition with fpo into cooperation with bzo in haider s stronghold of carinthia local fpo branch became carinthia branch of bzo strache s early leadership 2005 2017 fpo fared much better than bzo in polls following 2005 split with first tests in regional elections in styria and burgenland on 23 april 2005 heinz christian strache was elected as new chairman of fpo taking over from interim leader as most of party s office seeking elite had gone over to bzo fpo was again free from responsibility under strache party s ideology grew more radical and it returned to its primary goal of vote maximising fpo did reasonably well in october s vienna election in which strache was leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration it took a 14 9 share while bzo won just 1 2 by 2006 general election fpo returned to promoting anti immigration anti islam and eurosceptic issues it won 11 of vote and 21 seats in parliament while bzo only barely passed 4 threshold needed to enter parliament subsequent coalition between spo and ovp left both parties in opposition in 2008 general election both fpo and bzo rose significantly at expense of spo and ovp both parties increased their percentage of vote by about 6 5 with fpo at 17 4 and bzo at 10 7 together gaining 28 2 and thus both breaking record vote for fpo in 1999 election in 2009 european parliament election fpo doubled its 2004 results winning 12 8 of vote and 2 seats thumb left 220px

after latter had introduced a moderate right wing liberal and more economically oriented ideology in 2010 vienna elections fpo increased its vote to 25 8 slightly less than record result of 1996 this was seen as a victory for strache due to his popularity among young people this was only second time in postwar era that spo lost its absolute majority in city after its convention in early 2011 midway between general elections fpo had a support in opinion polls of around 24 29 at par with spo and ovp and above bzo among people under 30 years of age fpo had support of 42 in 2013 legislative

sebastian kurz became leader of ovp and polling still predicted it would reach second place despite fpo s decline in support during election campaign it still achieved an ideological victory as austria s governing parties particularly ovp under kurz but also spo shifted noticeably to right adopting much of fpo s policies fpo entered coalition talks with ovp and in december 2017 they reached an agreement and created a coalition government fpo gained control over six ministries including defense interior and foreign affairs ibiza affair may 2019 in mid may 2019 secretly made footage was released apparently showing strache soliciting funds for party from a purported russian national in video strache also suggests his intention to censor austrian media in a way that would favor fpo citing media landscape of orban s hungary footage led to collapse of coalition with ovp on may 20 2019 ideology under leadership of heinz christian strache fpo has focused on describing itself as a heimat and social party this means that party promotes its role as a guarantor of austrian identity and social welfare economically it supports regulated liberalism with privatisation and low taxes combined with support for welfare state however it maintains that it will be impossible to uphold welfare state if current immigration policies are continued present fpo has variously been described as right wing populist national conservative right conservative right national and far right party has traditionally been part of national liberal camp and generally identifies with a libertarian profile leading current party members such as andreas and harald have considered themselves as national liberal cultural germans while barbara rosenkranz has considered her ideology as national conservative individual freedom principle of individual freedom in society was already one of central points in fpo and vdu s programme during 1950s party did not regard its liberalism and its pan german nationalist positions as contradictory from late 1980s through 1990s party developed economically supporting tax reduction less state intervention and more privatisation starting in late 2000s party has taken a more populist tack combining this position with support for welfare state it criticised unemployment and alleged welfare state abuse by immigrants which it said threatened welfare state and pensioners benefits anti establishment during 1980s and 1990s austrian voters became increasingly disaffected with rule by two major parties spo and ovp this coincided with leadership of haider who presented fpo as only party which could seriously challenge two parties dominance party strongly criticised power concentrated in hands of elite until fpo joined government in 2000 in 1990s party advocated replacing present second austrian republic with a third republic since it sought a radical transformation from a party state to a citizens democracy party wanted to provide more referendums directly elect federal president significantly reduce number of ministries and devolve power to federal states and local councils surveys have shown that anti establishment positions were one of top reasons for voters to vote for fpo its anti establishment position proved incompatible with being in government during first half of 2000s but was renewed after most of parliamentary group left to join bzo in 2005 immigration and islam immigration was not a significant issue in austria until 1980s under haider s leadership immigration went from being practically non existent on list of most important issues for voters before 1989 to 10th most important in 1990 and second most important in 1992 in 1993 controversial austria first initiative attempted to collect signatures for a referendum on immigration restrictions and asserted that austria is not a country of immigration party maintained that protection of cultural identity and social peace in austria requires a stop to immigration maintaining that its concern was not against foreigners but to safeguard interests and cultural identity of native austrians although during late 1990s party attacked influence of islamic extremism this was later expanded to include islamisation and increasing number of muslims in general according to economist hostility to muslims is a strategy that resonates with voters of serbian background whom party has assiduously cultivated party has also vowed to outlaw distribution of free copies of koran during period of ovp fpo government many amendments were introduced to tighten country s immigration policies number of new asylum applications for example was reduced from 32 000 in 2003 to 13 300 in 2006 heimat from mid 1980s concept of heimat a word meaning both homeland and a more general notion of cultural identity has been central to ideology of fpo although its application has slightly changed with time initially heimat indicated feeling of national belonging influenced by a pan german vision party assured voters in 1985 that overwhelming majority of austrians belong to german ethnic and cultural community although it was noted then that austria was mother country which held national traditions this would later be favoured more explicitly over pan german concept in 1995 haider declared an end to pan germanism in party and in 1997 party manifesto former community of german people was replaced with austrian people under leadership of strache concept of heimat has been promoted and developed more deeply than it had been previously after his reelection as chairman in 2011 german aspects of party s programme were formally reintroduced foreign policy at end of cold war fpo became more eurosceptic which was reflected by its change from pan germanism to austrian patriotism party s opposition to european union grew stronger in 1990s fpo opposed austria s joining eu in 1994 and promoted a popular initiative against replacement of austrian schilling with euro in 1998 but to no avail owing to perceived differences between turkish and european culture party opposes accession of turkey to eu it has declared that should this happen austria must immediately leave eu party s views on united states and middle east have evolved over time despite anti american views of some right wing forums in 1970s and 1980s that chiefly were rooted in worries over us cultural expansion and hegemonic role in world politics at expense of europe fpo were more positively inclined towards united states under haider s leadership in late 1980s and 1990s however this changed in 2003 following haider visiting saddam hussein on eve of iraq war he subsequently condemned us foreign policy and derided george w bush as not being very different from hussein this move was strongly criticised by fpo which was part of then current government nevertheless in mid to late 2000s fpo too criticised us foreign policy as promoted by bush which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in middle east party also became more critical of israel s part in conflict by 2010 under heinz christian strache s leadership party became more friendly towards israel in december 2010 fpo along with representatives of like minded rightist parties visited israel where they issued jerusalem declaration which affirmed israel s right to exist and defend itself particularly against islamic terror party also recognises jerusalem as israel s capital at fpo s invitation israeli deputy minister ayoob kara of likud party subsequently visited vienna strache at about same time said he wanted to meet with front figures of american tea party movement which he described as highly interesting he has also declared himself a friend of serbs who constitute one of largest immigrant groups in austria siding with serbia fpo rejects independence of kosovo fpo also call to lift damaging and pointless international sanctions against russia approved by eu presently fpo advocates introduction of a hard north euro and a soft south euro international relations while fpo is currently not a member of any european or international organisations party has ties with several european political parties and groupings additionally according to political analyst thomas hofer party s policies and brash style helped inspire like minded parties across europe from 1978 to 1993 under party s liberal leadership party was a member of liberal international in early years of haider s leadership meetings were held with figures such as jean marie le pen of french national front and franz of german republicans in late 1990s however he chose to distance himself from le pen and refused to join le pen s project following fpo s entrance in government in 2000 haider sought to establish his own alliance of right wing parties for his project haider tried to establish stable cooperations with vlaams blok party in belgium and northern league party in italy as well as some other parties and party groupings in end efforts to establish a new alliance of parties were not successful under leadership of strache party has cooperated mainly with northern league vlaams belang successor to vlaams blok which it has traditionally maintained good ties with and pro germany citizens movement in germany fpo also has contacts with danish people s party slovak national party sweden
