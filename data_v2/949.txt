mwng english mane is fourth studio album by welsh rock band super furry animals and first by group to have lyrics written entirely in welsh language mwng was released on 15 may 2000 on band s own record label placid casual following demise of their former label creation album includes single ysbeidiau heulog and reached number 11 on uk albums chart following its release first welsh language album to reach top 20 this success led to mwng being mentioned in house of commons of united kingdom by elfyn llwyd who described record as a celebration of a new wave of confidence in welsh nation super furry animals had attempted to make a hit record with a commercial sound with their previous release 1999 s guerrilla record s singles failed to hit top 10 of uk singles chart so band decided to go on pop strike group had written several welsh language songs during sessions for guerrilla and opted to release them as a coherent album rather than issue token welsh songs as b sides reasoning that if their english pop songs were not going to be played on radio they may as well release welsh pop songs that would not get played on radio singer gruff rhys stated that although decision to release a welsh language album was not an explicitly political statement he does feel record is a stand against globalisation recording largely took place at ofn studios llanfaelog anglesey in 1999 with band sharing production duties with gorwel owen lo fi album cost just to make in contrast with excessive expense of guerrilla and was recorded almost entirely live mwng is an understated rock record inspired by band s love of anglo american pop culture of 60s 70s and 80s album has a wintery persona that is best summed up by track ymaelodi a r ymylon rhys feels that record marks first time band managed to escape their influences and clearly establish their own sound album s lyrics deal with a diverse set of subjects such as death of rural communities old school teachers and sarn helen a roman road built in wales rhys has stated that many of mwngs songs are highly personal reflections on what were difficult years for him rhys has also expressed belief that album is accessible to non welsh speakers as they can pick up on mood of songs even if they cannot understand lyrics critical reception was generally positive although some reviewers criticised album for its bare boned production mwng was included in both melody maker and nme best album of 2000 lists with latter calling record band s best release band were surprised by album s commercial success entering number 11 in uk charts and going on to become biggest selling welsh language album origins and recording super furry animals made a conscious decision to make a commercial sounding pop jukebox record with 1999 s guerrilla band had written album s intended singles with hope that they would become radio hits and were disappointed with limited success they received first single northern lites charted just outside top 10 of uk singles chart at number 11 while subsequent releases fire in my heart and do or die reached numbers 25 and 20 respectively band blamed their record label creation for relative failure of singles particularly northern lites which they felt could have been bigger if label had produced a better music video and conducted a more successful marketing campaign as a result group became tired of playing chart games and went on pop strike deciding to release music just for joy of it with no agenda super furry animals had written several welsh language songs while they were working on guerrilla and decided that rather than releasing token welsh songs as b sides and album tracks they would issue them together as a coherent record these tracks would be augmented by dacw hi a song written by rhys in 1987 that he had never had a chance to do before and a cover of track y teimlad which group wanted to record because of their admiration for welsh language band datblygu who originally wrote and recorded song in 1984 according to rhys super furry animals reasoned that if their english language pop songs were not getting played on radio they may as well make a welsh language album featuring songs that would not be played on radio rhys has said that although decision to release a welsh language album was not an explicitly political statement he does see mwng as a stand against globalisation railing against advanced capitalism and lack of interest shown in minority cultures by large companies who just want to make money rhys has also stated that his boredom with writing songs in english inspired him to write mwng and that it is a very personal album rather than a celebration of welsh culture lo fi mwng was recorded over two weeks in late 1999 and in contrast with excessive expense of guerilla cost just to make band chose gorwel owen as co producer having previously worked with him on their first two albums 1996 s fuzzy logic and 1997 s radiator majority of mwng was recorded with owen at ofn studios in llanfaelog wales according to rhys band had to play in separate rooms to avoid sound of one instrument bleeding onto track of another during recording due to ofn s small size y gwyneb iau and ysbeidiau heulog were recorded at famous studios in cardiff and were engineered by greg haver while y teimlad was recorded at real world studios box wiltshire and was engineered by michael brennan jr sarn helen was recorded and engineered by keyboardist cian ciaran in his living room overdubs for all songs were added at ofn with owen who also mixed album at studio along with super furry animals songs were recorded almost entirely live with band wanting to make a really immediate record as a reaction against drawn out recording sessions for guerilla and 1997 s radiator which had taken several months and proved frustrating for group version of nythod cacwn that appears on album is original demo with rhys on drums band felt that although demo did not sound very professional there was a warmth to it that would be impossible to recreate were group to record song again album s title translates into english as mane according to rhys band did not have mane of a particular animal in mind but felt it could be an extension of a super furry animal musical style mwng is a lo fi raw and understated record of rock songs stripped of bleeps and squelches that appear on super furry animals other releases although album s lyrics are in welsh singer rhys has said that musically there s nothing welsh about it at all going on to state that record s only real welsh influences are datblygu writers of y teimlad and meic stevens instead record is a tribute to band s obsession with anglo american pop culture of 60s 70s and 80s and is an album that can be understood on a musical level anywhere in westernised world regardless of whether or not listener can understand lyrics bassist guto pryce said that he feels mwng sounds like an album rather than a collection of individual songs due to fact it was recorded live and over a short period of time according to rhys mwng marks a refining of group s sound with band having sieved off their influences to truly sound like super furry animals for first time rhys has said that although keyboardist cian ciaran did not explore digital frontiers on album he was still able to deconstruct songs even when playing harmonium band had previously thought of saxophone as instrument of satan but actually used one on this record for first time reasoning that it was appropriate as mwng is a album rhys described album as band s monochrome record stating that it is less dressed up than their other releases and that it is a good introduction to group s songwriting rhys said that if there s a song that sums up album in terms of mood perhaps it is ymaelodi a r ymylon typifying its wintery persona track has been described by rhys as a celebration of band s love of beach boys love and ennio morricone featuring layered vocal harmonies pan ddaw r wawr features a wheezing harmonium and perishing trumpet swirl and has been compared to music of xtc ennio morricone and psychedelic era rolling stones according to rhys music of sarn helen was written to provide soundtrack to a fictional journey cruising down a5 to rome in a two door chariot song has been called evil personified and dark and has been likened to sound of an approaching roman army folky eerily melancholic nythod cacwn has been compared to tori amos single girl y gwyneb iau has been described as a brass soaked cross between music of herb alpert and doors featuring maudlin horns and military beats while rhys has said that song is a combination of nick drake gladys knight and velvet underground s third album ysbeidiau heulog and album s opening track drygioni have been singled out as only songs on mwng that are distinctly cheery both display glam rock influences and have been compared to roxy music with rhys describing ysbeidiau heulog as old time pop music with vocal harmonies that are a tribute to late 1960s groups such as west coast pop art experimental band and os mutantes lyrical themes right thumb singer gruff rhys has described mwngs lyrics as some of best he has written lyrically album deals with subjects as diverse as isolated communities old school teachers and roman roads but maintains a warped coherency according to rhys mwngs lyrics which he considers to be some of his best were written very simply and convey simple messages singer made an effort to be economical with his words not communicating a lot of information with them rhys feels that album is accessible to non welsh speakers citing his own experience of listening to nirvana if i listen to a nirvana record i don t understand most of their lyrics cos he s just screaming away but i just understand frustration and passion in his voice i think equally people can get off on this record by just hitting on mood of song or connecting to mood of song several of songs on mwng feature quite solemn personal lyrics which reflect on a difficult few years for rhys single ysbeidiau heulog is about looking back at a bad time which had odd good moment while pan ddaw r wawr deals with death of rural communities singer claims to have wept rather than sung album s last track ar y which features lyrics so bleak it s almost comic about being rooted to a sad piece of land being doomed to live somewhere and that s all you have and that s what you re stuck with rhys has described datblygu s y teimlad as being about not knowing what love is or what love means drygioni is a song about sleaze about good versus evil and a person s need for both and y gwyneb iau is a moody song about war whose title is a welsh insult that translates into english as in contrast nythod cacwn is a comedic song based on an incident involving drummer dafydd ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach it features lyrics that were made up on spot by rhys dacw hi is inspired by one of rhys s former teachers who claimed she had eyes in back of her head sarn helen is about decline of roman road of same name that was built between north and south wales ymaelodi a r ymylon is partly inspired by band felt from some areas of welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in english on earlier albums track s lyrics feature old welsh idiom y canu which means demon in music and refers to friction this can create between people release and legacy super furry animals had originally intended to issue mwng in march 2000 but release was delayed due to demise of band s uk record label creation group have variously stated that creation originally planned to issue mwng but allowed group to buy rights from them for around and that company didn t want to take record in first place band decided to put album out on their own label placid casual as they were worried that a label that did not understand group might do something horrific such as putting a welsh flag on cover mwng logo on cover is based on logo for mwng was eventually released on 15 may 2000 in united kingdom on cd cassette and vinyl and reached number 11 in uk albums chart in united states mwng was released on 20 june 2000 by flydaddy with a bonus cd entitled mwng bach english little mane

recordings beggars banquet us ysbeidiau heulog was released as only single from album and failed to chart inside uk singles top 75 although super furry animals had no commercial expectations for album mwng became first welsh language record to reach top 20 of uk album charts and has frequently been called biggest selling welsh language album of all time as a result of record s success mwng was mentioned in house of commons of united kingdom by plaid cymru s elfyn llwyd who called on his fellow politicians to congratulate band on their chart topping new album and recognise mwng as a celebration of a new wave of confidence in welsh nation rhys dismissed llwyd s statement saying that record is very personal and has bugger all to do with a celebration in 2015 fifteen years after its

stated that band s decision to release an all welsh record was courageous and proof that they are great eccentric band of their time drowned in sound called album a poignant dark curling bundle of songs but expressed sadness that band s usual skewed play on words are missed by all but welsh speakers in contrast rolling stone said that album s tight arrangements of melodic bliss manage to cross welsh language barrier yahoo music stated that mwng cemented super furry animals position as figureheads of futuristic rock review went on to state that mwng is a theoretically disorientating and complex but triumphantly audacious experience and said that initial reservations about not being able to understand lyrics were lost when it became clear that rhys was always unintelligible on record anyway matt lemay reviewing mwng on its initial release for pitchfork described album as being not as fully realised or inventive as 1999 s guerrilla and said that although record highlights rhys s talents for songwriting lack of any electronic wizardry from keyboard player ciaran is disappointing lemay went on to state however that mwng is still a damned enjoyable listen and said that record couples cultural pride with unforgettable melodies in a way few bands have ever attempted on album s re release in 2005 pitchfork writer marc hogan stated that mwng s sinuous pop melodies and organic arrangements make for an exciting discovery despite lack of band s usual studio wizardry q said that while tracks such as ymaelodi a r ymylon and y gwyneb iau are strangely charming chiming pop music with a twist mwng is hampered by its bare boned production mojo however described album as a sensuous sonic journey with an organic woody mystical atmosphere that compares favourably with overly produced sounds of band s previous records magazine went on to suggest album s only flaw is that it manages to lose its way for a while in middle thanks to poor sequencing of its tracks nude as news stated that although record is more reserved than band s previous releases it conjures up images of welsh winter in which songs were recorded and fits in with group s unique vision melody maker described album as a sad beautiful record but expressed concern that super furry animals had moved away from pop of guerilla and called on them to deliver another release in vein of band s 1996 single man don t give a fuck nevertheless mwng was ranked number 24 in magazine s albums of year 2000 feature website described record as a slightly retro album that sees super furry animals refashion past into present art sperl writing for rock s backpages in december 2000 stated that although album gathers from past band s influences are channelled into a truly organic maverick pop nme described mwng as an antidote to preservative pumped junk music that they felt was prevalent at time of album s release and placed it at number nine in their album of year list for 2000 calling it group s best
