born or even dying getting flushed into something that you know nothing about hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was opposite it still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold i was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in in a 1994 pulse magazine interview cornell said that inspiration for album s title came from his misreading of a video entitled he added i thought it was a cool title i d never heard it before never saw it before and it inspired me album also saw a limited release on 12 colored vinyl blue orange
