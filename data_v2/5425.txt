a touchdown days before super bowl work daily news first jim last farber date february 3 2012 accessdate february 4 2012 ref michael cragg from guardian felt that track was not bad musically it s a pretty joyful four minutes featuring bouncing beats acoustic riffs and gwen stefani style cheerleader chants but there s something a bit flat about madonna s delivery given all love she s demanding you d think she d be more excited speaking of rap part he thought that minaj certainly does her best her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10 second space as possible while mia s more laconic drawl loses momentum chris willman of reuters called it risible and infectious everything here is as dumb as titular spelling but campiness has its charm at least if you like old musicals that some of tracking shots here are paying homage to medium s richard labeau dismissed it as an age inappropriate ditty which unnecessarily incorporates cheerleaders a marching band and raps mtv news journalist bradley stern wrote about hey mickey comparisons complimenting guest rapping of minaj and m i a even though he felt it was one of album s least compelling moments in a review of mdna neil mccormick of daily telegraph felt that prime purpose of lightest frothiest track from album was to represent next generation s female pop stars emily mackay of quietus wrote in detail about song andrew hampp from billboard negatively reviewed signing of minaj and m i a as guest artists adding that it s a subpar effort from all parties particularly madonna who hasn t sounded this robotic since more tweaked out moments on hard candy in another review keith caulfield from same magazine deemed track as a commercial for madonna s super bowl appearance rather than being a promotional tool for mdna criticizing it for misleading listener about vibe of album gareth grundy from guardian shared this view while describing track as clumsy rave pop jody rosen of rolling stone rated it two out of five stars describing its lyrics and composition as dashed off and in doldrums and was displeased by track s aggressive assaultive sal cinquemani from slant magazine described song as decidedly vapid and catchy but also stated that its few charms 60s surf pop guitar vintage video game effects and references to her past songs are fleeting at best he felt that minaj and m i a were tacked on for added marketability and that song actually lacked authenticity while reviewing mdna new york times critic jon pareles described song as one of album s weakest tracks joey guerra from houston chronicle wrote that song s shiny happy sound is nowhere near representative of full album alexis petridis from guardian listed song as weakest effort on mdna adding that its position as album s lead single seems to have had more to do with showing off presence of nicki minaj and m i a than its featherweight melody a writer for virgin media gave song three out of five stars writing like most madonna singles it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye but self references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard nick levine writing for national relegated track as a lighter pop morsel matthew from pitchfork media panned song saying that solveig s production on track was paired with equally bland lyrics brad o from popjustice declared that track was proof that sometimes you can listen to something many many times and still not have any idea whether it s any good or not chicago tribune journalist greg kot was disappointed with song and its lyrics which he found to be meaningless while bernard zuel of sydney morning herald relegated it as trite and disposable alex macpherson from fact found song to be sheer misconceived awfulness jude rogers from guardian criticized its unforgivable spelling and pointed out that candy pop chorus really fizzes but minaj and m i a s cheerleading whoops and raps quickly dissolve she placed song at number 66 on her ranking of madonna s singles in honor of her 60th birthday in august 2018 billboard picked it as singer s 95th greatest single madonna s undeniably squad captain on this surf rock inspired
