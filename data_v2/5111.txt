thumb upright 1 2 girih pattern with inlaid floral decoration from shah i zinda in samarkand uzbekistan girih knot also written gereh is a decorative islamic geometric artform used in architecture and handicraft objects consisting of angled lines that form an interlaced strapwork pattern girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by syrian roman knotwork patterns from 2nd century ad earliest girih dates from around 1000 ad and artform flourished until 15th century girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways including traditional compass and straightedge construction of a grid of polygons and use of a set of girih tiles with lines drawn on them lines form pattern patterns may be elaborated by use of two levels of design as at 1453 darb e imam shrine square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as templates and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way 15th century topkapi scroll explicitly shows girih patterns together with tilings used to create them a set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic penrose tilings though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens as at fatehpur sikri plasterwork as at mosques and madrasas such as kayseri metal as at sultan hassan mosque cairo and in wood as at great mosque of cordoba history origins thumb upright 0 9 2nd century roman mosaic in with curvilinear knot patterns girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century ad syrian roman knotwork patterns these had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three fold rotational symmetry umayyad mosque 709 715 in damascus syria has window screens made of interlacing undulating strapwork in form of six pointed stars early examples of islamic geometric patterns made of straight strap lines can be seen in architecture of surviving gateway of i malik caravanserai uzbekistan built in 1078 wild application of girih on architectures should credit to close relationship between islamic architecture geometry and craft architecture was classified in field of practical geometry in early islamic period and building projects always involve a geometer in additional no clear border was established between science and craft thus craftsmen usually followed mathematicians principles and guidelines directly early islamic forms earliest form of girih on a book is seen in frontispiece of a koran manuscript from year 1000 found in baghdad it is illuminated with interlacing octagons and calligraphy in woodwork one of earliest surviving examples of islamic geometric art is 13th century minbar pulpit of ibn tulun mosque in cairo girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways in one a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created holes can be left as they are or filled with some material in other called gereh chini small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually and combined to create an elaborate design in 10th century a systematic investigation of geometric patterns was conducted by persian mathematician and astronomer abu al wafa in house of wisdom in his treatise a book on those geometric constructions which are necessary for a craftsman he explained geometric structure and illustrates methods of drawing polygons within other shapes mostly circles for craftsmen and artisans this book laid groundwork for designing girih by explaining fundamental grammar for construction girih patterns term girih was used in turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as late 15th century in same period artisans compiled girih pattern books such as topkapi scroll while curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in 10th century fully developed girih patterns were not seen before 11th century in iran it became a dominant design element in 11th and 12th centuries as in carved stucco panels with interlaced girih of towers 1067 near qazvin iran stylized plant decorations were sometimes co ordinated with girih after safavid period use of girih continued in seljuk and ilkhanid periods in 14th century girih became a minor element in decorative arts it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during timurid era but continued to be important in decorative arts in central asian monuments after that time construction compass and straight edge girih consists of geometric designs often of stars and polygons which can be constructed in a variety of ways girih star and polygon patterns with 5 and 10 fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as 13th century such figures can be drawn by compass and straightedge first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a regular grid pattern was drawn with compass and straightedge today artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of dividers to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in sun to make it brittle straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge girih patterns made this way are based on tessellations tiling plane with a unit cell and leaving no gaps because tiling makes use of translation and rotation operations unit cells need to have 2 3 4 or 6 fold rotational symmetry polygons in contact one of early western students of islamic patterns ernest hanbury hankin defined a geometrical arabesque as a pattern formed with help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact he observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as residual spaces between polygons are reasonably symmetrical for example a grid of octagons in contact has squares of same side as octagons as residual spaces every octagon is basis for an 8 point star as seen at akbar s tomb sikandra 1605 1613 hankin considered skill of arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons almost astounding girih tiles by 15th century some girih patterns were no longer periodic and may have been constructed using girih tiles this method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them when used to tile plane with no gaps lines on tiles form a girih pattern it is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge but it was probably at start of 13th century lu and steinhardt supplementary figures methods of ornamentation were extremely diverse however and idea that one method was used for all of them has been criticised as anachronistic two level design girih patterns on darb e imam shrine built in 1453 at isfahan had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen details of pattern indicate that girih tiles rather than compass and straightedge were used for decorating shrine patterns appear aperiodic within area on wall where they are displayed they do not form a regularly repeating pattern and they are drawn at two different scales a large scale pattern is discernible when building is viewed from a distance and a smaller scale pattern forming part of larger one can be seen from closer up although there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a subdivision rule to draw a two level pattern there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times for example pattern used in spandrel of darb i imam shrine see figure consists only of decagons and bowties while subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes therefore this design lacks self similarity between two levels aperiodicity a periodic tiling of plane is regular repetition of a unit cell in manner of a wallpaper without any gaps such tilings can be seen as a two dimensional crystal and because of crystallographic restriction theorem unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold and 6 fold it is therefore impossible to tile plane periodically with a figure that has five fold rotational symmetry such as a five pointed star or a decagon patterns with infinite perfect quasi periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes these quasi crystalline tilings contain shapes with five fold symmetry that repeat periodically in between other shapes that do not repeat one way to create quasi periodic patterns is to create a penrose tiling girih tiles can be subdivided into penrose tiles called dart and kite but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans another way to create patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule in limit plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that islamic artisans of 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves however no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two level design there would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived it appears that medieval islamic artisans were using a tool that had potential of creating highly complex patterns but they never realized it as e makovicky argues topkapi scroll topkapi scroll from late 15th century documents use of girih tiles to create girih patterns drawings in this pattern book show girih lines superimposed on tiles used to generate pattern making construction fully evident templates once a repeating pattern has been constructed regardless of method used pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it like pattern of a wallpaper as a paper template pattern can then simply be pricked through on to surface to be decorated topkapi scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates anonymous compendium contains square repeat units for many girih patterns ibn al al jazari s compendium of science and useful practice in mechanical arts contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors girih in varied materials girih on various surfaces girih on windows thumb upright 0 6 colourful window of abad garden girih has been widely applied on architecture patterns on persian geometric windows meet need of persian architecture as of windows indicated social and economic status of owner a good example is azad a garden in iran with girih patterns on its window architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers first layer is actual garden which people can see when they open window and second layer is artificial garden as girih patterns are on outside of window is carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden multi colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with real layer outside window and gives audience enough space of imagination girih on domes thumb nasr ol molk mosque vault ceiling in addition to plain platforms like windows girih patterns on domes are very popular as well however due to curve shapes of domes they need special techniques one of most important techniques is called garden method this method refers to that number of star polygons applied to pattern are highly dependent on change of dome curvature decreasing curvature of a dome surface leads to decreasing of number of points on a star polygon thus shapes of girih pattern are heavily relying on dome same method can be applied to other surfaces even irregular surface girih on walls thumb dome of jams mosque patterns are very likely to be all over walls of some islamic architectures decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across entire tiling with edges combine together in addition girih patterns vary a lot on surface with different geometric shapes including decagons hexagons bowties and rhombuses among all these patterns a special technique is shared self similar transformation mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate edge difference of these patterns and reduce edge mismatches to lowest degree extensive use of girih for interior decoration corresponds to islam belief repetitive patterns of girih are capable of expanding in every direction thus girih has an indefinite nature this characteristic resembles muslim s belief that human who is not measure of world can never comprehend infinite meaning of world created by un definable god girih patterns also have visual function of helping viewers to transcend monocular vision as viewers
