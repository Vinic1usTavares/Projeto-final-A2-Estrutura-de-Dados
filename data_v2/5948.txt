protomycena is an extinct monotypic genus of gilled fungus in family mycenaceae of order agaricales at present it contains single species protomycena electra known from a single specimen collected in an amber mine in cordillera septentrional area of dominican republic fruit body of fungus has a convex cap that is in diameter with distantly spaced gills on underside curved stipe is smooth and cylindrical measuring thick by long and lacks a ring it resembles extant currently living species of genus mycena protomycena is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in fossil record and second to be described from dominican amber discovery and classification genus is known only from holotype specimen a single fruit body mushroom currently residing in private collection owned by ettore of turin italy specimen was collected in one of amber mines in cordillera septentrional area of island of hispaniola in dominican republic amber is believed to date from miocene burdigalian stage about 20 to 16 million years before present it was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of david hibbett and michael donoghue from harvard university with david grimaldi of american museum of natural history hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in american journal of botany generic name protomycena is noted as first and mycena a modern genus that it resembles specific epithet electra was coined by authors from latin or greek word for amber in reference to mode of preservation when it was reported protomycena electra was third species of fossil agaric fungus to be described two species coprinites dominicana and aureofungus yaniguaensis are also known from amber mines of dominican republic while fourth species archaeomarasmius is from older cretaceous age new jersey amber with 2007 publication of a fifth extinct agaric species palaeoagaracites antiquus minimum age for agaricales order was pushed back to albian approximately 100 ma description thumb 180px right protomycena is similar in appearance to modern mycena species such as m shown here holotype of protomycena is a single fruit body without any associated structures preserved in a piece of clear light yellow polished amber approximately wide pileus is in diameter and has a convex shape sporting a raised central region an umbo pale flesh appears yellowish in amber and is smooth and glossy changing to striate and slightly translucent towards margin pileus margin is striated and slightly flared gills on underside of pileus are broadly attached adnate to top of stipe and distantly spaced between six and eight gills extend completely from pileus margin to stipe these full length gills are anastomosed with lamellulae short gills which do not reach edge of stipe from pileus margin of varying lengths pileus is centered on curved stipe which is smooth and cylindrical measuring thick by long stipe lacks a ring and rhizoids mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and gas filled bubble possibly originating from mushroom itself which indicates amber to be very solid and well sealed in hibbett and colleagues 1997 publication protomycena was placed in subfamily which at time was considered part of tricholomataceae family mycena is currently classified in mycenaceae family placement was based solely on visible structures or macromorphology of fruit body many of features which are typically used to classify species into fungal families and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in amber specimen consequently assignment to mycena is provisional authors also note certain similarities with extant members of marasmius and describing authors leave open option of treating genus placement as incertae sedis uncertain placement within agaricales protomycena is distinct from other amber preserved mushroom taxa such as coprinites in grooved surface of its pileus and its anastomosing gills references external links botanical society of america image of amber specimen protomycena protomycena category prehistoric fungi category natural history of hispaniola category fossil taxa described in 1997 category miocene life category natural history of dominican republic category neogene fungi category monotypic agaricales genera
