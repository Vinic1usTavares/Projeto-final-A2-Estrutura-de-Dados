harbottle and stephen holland quality of magazine began to improve significantly with stories by e c tubb kenneth bulmer fearn himself and barrington bayley whose first story combat s end had appeared in may 1954 issue however sf historian mike ashley suggests that despite fearn s efforts only e c tubb stories published under pseudonym george holt were a noticeable improvement in quality when circulation began to fall dragon press quickly cut fearn s budget in half from 25 shillings to only 12 6 per thousand words this was half word rate on offer at other british science fiction magazines of era and left fearn unable to compete for best stories fearn printed material of his own that he had been unable to sell elsewhere harbottle 2001 p 9 and was also able to save some money by
