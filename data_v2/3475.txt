chadwick s words stripped gore s arguments bare chadwick p 147 he argued from historical examples that appointments made at church s instigation were partisan and disastrous and that crown and prime minister were able to take an unbiased view in national interest despite public support for him controversy revived henson s feelings of isolation chadwick p 150 appointment was described as sending

for friction as dean of durham james welldon who had once been a bishop himself was temperamentally and politically at odds with his new superior given to making public statements that henson found infuriating welldon in henson s view could neither speak with effect nor be silent with dignity lyttelton hart davis pp 17 18 they clashed on several occasions most conspicuously when welldon a strong

well with miners individually and conversed with many of them as they walked through extensive grounds of auckland castle it was said of him that he got on easily with everyone except other dignitaries in gaiters chadwick p 157 friction arose from henson s belief that strikes were morally wrong because of harm they did to other working people chadwick p 161 and he had in grimley s words a violent almost obsessional dislike of trade unions his early concern for welfare of poor remained unchanged but he regarded socialism and trade unionism as negations of individuality for same reason he was against state provision of social welfare though a strong advocate of voluntary spending on it later in his bishopric henson denounced jarrow march in 1936 as revolutionary mob pressure and condemned action of his subordinate suffragan bishop of jarrow who had given march his blessing bartley p 89 he loathed class distinction and was not antipathetic to social reformers but he was strong in his criticism of christian campaigners who maintained that first duty of church was social reform to henson church s principal concern was each individual man or woman s spiritual welfare chadwick

pompous and to which henson responded and to which of those epithets does your grace take exception chadwick p 244 grimley remarks that on occasion each of those unflattering adjectives applied just as much to henson nonetheless henson ranked lang among greater figures of ecclesiastical history lockhart p 295 most conspicuous cause with which henson was involved during his time at durham was in anglican terms of national and even international rather than diocesan concern as a broad churchman he gave strong support in mid 1920s to a major revision and modernising of book of common prayer church s prescribed forms of worship used at all services evangelical wing of church opposed revision which some low church factions dubbed popish prayer book revision times 1 may 1928 p 18 henson now

laity in favour of revision house of commons refused to authorise it and voted it down in 1927 and again in 1928 henson s colleague cyril garbett wrote that commons had made it plain that church does not possess full spiritual freedom to determine its worship garbett p 194 church instituted damage limitation measures by permitting parishes to use new unauthorised text where there was a local consensus to do so but henson was horrified at what he saw as parliament s betrayal of its duty to preside impartially over governance of church giving in to pressure from what he termed an army of illiterates chadwick p 193 thumb upright 1922 sketch of henson with durham cathedral in background together with suspicions he had started to harbour that a socialist government might misuse ecclesiastical patronage prayer book debacle turned henson from a strong proponent of establishment to its best known critic he spent much time and energy fruitlessly campaigning for disestablishment he was as he had often been earlier in his career an isolated figure few of his colleagues agreed with him even those dismayed by parliamentary vote he was less isolated in some other causes he took up in 1920s and 30s he was one of many wary of ultra liberalism of modern churchmen s union in 1934 he was among senior clerics who censured dean dwelly for inviting a unitarian to preach in liverpool cathedral and bishop david for permitting it kennerley p 138 he was critical of american evangelism as practised by frank buchman and oxford group henson wrote of buchman s oracular despotism and

henson 1951 p 123 last years winston churchill was impressed by henson grimley comments that they had much in common both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed at time and later vindicated as prime minister churchill persuaded henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a canon of westminster abbey after overcoming momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue he retired from abbey in 1941 in his later years henson s lifelong sense of loneliness was compounded by growing deafness of his wife making their conversation difficult peart binns p 188 he found some solace in friendship of her companion fearne booker who lived with hensons for more than thirty years he occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography published in three volumes under title retrospect of an unimportant life both at time and subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing work they thought he had done his reputation a disservice despite what williams calls peculiar interest and vivacity of books his survey of his many campaigns and controversies seemed to others to be self justifying and wilfully to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career in williams s view posthumous publication of henson s edited letters were a better legacy delightful in both form and content and barbed though they often are they do him fuller justice he was offered masonic position of provincial grand master in his retirement but declined it believing himself too old in his writings henson referred to his two regrets in life first was that he had not been at a public school a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider second regret was that he and his wife had been unable to have children they unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education at least one of them became a priest and was ordained by henson henson died at hintlesham on 27 september 1947 at age of eighty four at
