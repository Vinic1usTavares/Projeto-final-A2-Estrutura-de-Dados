intermittent in miss you added sex appeal and complimented of born on bayou and hound dog associated press contributor gene bright wrote a positive review of album but was disappointed with james cover of miss you writing song just can t be slowed and manipulated with any success people magazine contributors felt that motorcycle sound in introduction was unnecessary and considered album to be more full throated gospel rock than blues however they wrote that james sounded as sexy and full of sass as she did nearly half a century ago with james sons contributing to album bill milkowski of

inimitable depth and for making no apologies and needing no permission to sing it like she feels it parke puterbaugh of rolling stone named don t let my baby ride hawg for ya and come back baby as
