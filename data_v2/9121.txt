designs used by marimekko including albatrossi albatross jellyfish and oyster her patterns were by now being widely reproduced to facilitate this process and to keep patterns accurate isola maintained a set of pattern books these were handwritten exercise books containing precise details of her pattern repeats each one such as her 1968 lovelovelove was drawn to scale on a pattern book page coloured

and she created over 500 prints during her long and colorful employment her work enabled company to become a world leading international fashion trendsetter ivar ekman writing in new york times quotes marianne aav director of helsinki design museum what we understand as marimekko style is very much based on what maija isola was doing ekman comments range of prints that isola produced for marimekko is astounding as patterns span minimalistic geometric toned down naturalistic and explosion of colors marion hume writing in time magazine explains that isola was able to mastermind an astonishing range from intricate and folkloric 1962 which remains one of most popular prints for home market to radically simple dramatically enlarged asymmetrical unikko poppy 1964 originally in red and in blue which may be one of most widely recognized prints on earth according to tamsin blanchard writing in observer designs of maija isola one of company s most original and longest standing designers have stood test of time blanchard describes as timeless isola s 1972 wind design with its feathery organic tree skeletons in silhouette her 1957 spiky black and white print her 1963 melon and her 1956 stones hannah booth writing in guardian explains that marimekko s founder armi ratia recruited maija isola first and most important of many young female designers to create original prints she describes isola as unconventional leaving her daughter kristina to grow up with her grandmother so she could travel world to find inspiration for her textiles booth quotes finnish novelist as saying isola was a dangerously original character she belonged to a trailblazing generation which enabled young women to move freely into arts lesley jackson in a chapter titled op pop and psychedelia writes that from finland exuberant all conquering marimekko burst on to international scene in 1960s she illustrates this with one pattern by and three by isola lokki and inevitably unikko of lokki jackson writes isola revolutionized design with her simple bold flat patterns printed on a dramatic scale design whose title means seagull evokes lapping of waves and flapping of birds wings of famous unikko jackson explains this huge exploded poppy pattern embodies unbridled design confidence of mid 1960s and presages ebullience and sizzling colours of flower power era hanna liisa notes that themes of many marimekko designs are also very finnish portraying finnish nature for example maija isola created her luonto nature design series using actual plant specimens legacy thumb upright 1 6 a finnair
