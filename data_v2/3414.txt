1985 pacific typhoon season has no official bounds it ran year round in 1985 but most tropical cyclones tend to form in northwestern pacific ocean between may and november these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northwestern pacific ocean tropical storms formed in entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by joint typhoon warning center tropical depressions that enter or form in philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration or pagasa this can often result in same storm having two names a total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in western pacific of which 28 became tropical storms 17 storms reached typhoon intensity of which one typhoon reached super typhoon strength strongest cyclone of season dot reached category 5 on saffir simpson scale to east of philippines typhoon cecil was deadliest storm of season accounting for nearly half of deaths from western pacific tropical cyclones in 1985 season summary a total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in western pacific of which 28 became tropical storms 17 storms reached typhoon intensity of which 1 reached super typhoon strength only four tropical cyclones moved through philippines this season while eight moved into china three moved into vietnam and three moved into japan tropical cyclones brought hong kong 40 percent of its annual rainfall hong kong royal observatory 1986 meteorological results 1985 part iii tropical cyclone summaries retrieved on 2009 01 20 strongest cyclone of season dot reached category 5 on saffir simpson scale however it weakened slightly before moving into philippines at high end of category 3 status typhoon cecil was deadliest storm of season accounting for nearly half of deaths from western pacific tropical cyclones in 1985 systems severe tropical storm fabian atring initial tropical disturbance formed on west end of near equatorial or monsoon trough due to strong high pressure due its north and associated high winds associated with northern asian monsoon strongest winds within system were on its western periphery strong southerly winds aloft led to persistent vertical wind shear which limited its intensification is it moved west to northwest it passed nearby yap and caused crop damage as it passed by island group joint typhoon warning center 1986 chapter iii summary of western north pacific and indian ocean tropical cyclones united states navy retrieved 2009 01 18 tropical storm elsie this was first tropical cyclone to form in northwest pacific basin in january in six years forming along near equatorial trough two circulations formed on either side of guam elsie formed from eastern circulation appearing southwest of pohnpei on january 4 on january 5 further convective development occurred which formed a low level circulation on january 6 becoming a tropical depression late that day and a tropical storm on january 7 system moved northwest reaching its peak intensity late in day thereafter strong southerly winds aloft arrested development and weakening began tropical depression status was regained on january 8 and its circulation dissipated early january 9 joint typhoon warning center 1986 tropical storm elsie united states navy retrieved on 2007 02 04 tropical depression a tropical depression formed east of luzon on april 22 moving east northeast for a couple days system dissipated on april 24 north northwest of guam typhoon gay bining gay was third tropical cyclone and first typhoon of 1985 pacific typhoon season after over four months of inactivity on may 16 a strong atmospheric circulation formed west of koror now part of palau circulation began to develop convection and by may 20 had organized into a depression heading north storm took two days to gain tropical storm strength likely because a tropical upper tropospheric trough tutt was so close to north restricting outflow however trough soon weakened and outflow improved and storm began to intensify faster gay became a typhoon early on may 23 continuing to intensify gay came under influence of a frontal boundary to northwest and began to recurve to northeast through a weakness in subtropical ridge created by trough associated with frontal boundary this trough began to build and dig southeastward pouring fuel into gay s engine typhoon gay reached its peak intensity of 100 knots 115 mph 185 km h on may 24 as cool dry air became entrained within gay s circulation cyclone began to weaken gay underwent extratropical transition as it interacted with frontal boundary gay became extratropical shortly after weakening to a tropical storm early on may 26 tropical storm 04w this system formed within northern portion of monsoon trough on june 16 strong northeast winds aloft kept its circulation center on northeast side of its stronger thunderstorm activity system drifted generally northwest making landfall on hainan island before dissipating while never upgraded by joint typhoon warning center japanese meteorological agency considered system a weak tropical storm japanese

tropical cyclones to form in west pacific in august it formed from a disturbance at north end of a monsoon trough disturbance quickly gained organization and formed into a tropical depression on august 2 storm moved steadily to northwest and steadily intensified depression became tropical storm kit on august 4 storm became a typhoon as it made a temporary jog to north before continuing its northwest motion typhoon small in size reached its peak intensity of 85 knots 90 mph 157 km h while south of kyushu on august 8 kit recurved in east china sea in face of an approaching trough which caused a weakness in subtropical ridge kit made landfall on south western tip of south korea as a weak typhoon storm killed twelve people from resultant flooding and caused significant property damage on cheju island and southern coast of south korea kit became an extratropical cyclone in sea of japan a total of us 3 7 million 1985 dollars of damage were caused by kit across south korea and japan severe tropical storm lee huling lee formed within monsoon trough and was initially influenced by kit to its north kit s movement to north reoriented trough into a more north south orientation and a broad circulation formed 890 km south of okinawa moving north northeast convection around system began to organize into a more consolidated tropical storm system turned northwest but development was halted by northerly vertical wind shear its circulation center remained fairly broad while it continued to deepen more like a monsoon depression than a tropical cyclone as system passed close to okinawa winds remained fairly light however winds increased as it pulled away due to pressure gradient strongest winds being well removed from center continuing to move north into a break in subtropical ridge lee moved through east china sea to about 445 km west of kyushu and stayed about 220 km offshore western korean peninsula by this time system was evolving into a more typical tropical cyclone with stronger winds closer to center accelerating across yellow sea on august 14 lee began to recurve across north korea and subsequently weakened rapidly across mountainous terrain

pat developed from monsoon trough situated to east of taiwan on august 27 pat quickly was upgraded to tropical storm status and was named due to a probable fujiwara interaction between pat and typhoon
