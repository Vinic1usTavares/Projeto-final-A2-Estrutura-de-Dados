radiocarbon dating also referred to as carbon dating or carbon 14 dating is a method for determining age of an object containing organic material by using properties of radiocarbon a radioactive isotope of carbon method was developed in late 1940s at university of chicago by willard libby who received nobel prize in chemistry for his work in 1960 it is based on fact that radiocarbon is constantly being created in atmosphere by interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen resulting combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis animals then acquire by eating plants when animal or plant dies it stops exchanging carbon with its environment and from that point onwards amount of it contains begins to decrease as undergoes radioactive decay measuring amount of in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when animal or plant died older a sample is less there is to be detected and because half life of period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed is about 5 730 years oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50 000 years ago although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples research has been ongoing since 1960s to determine what proportion of in atmosphere has been over past fifty thousand years resulting data in form of a calibration curve is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of sample s calendar age other corrections must be made to account for proportion of in different types of organisms fractionation and varying levels of throughout biosphere reservoir effects additional complications come from burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil and from above ground nuclear tests done in 1950s and 1960s because time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than time it takes for its to decay below detectable levels fossil fuels contain almost no and as a result there was a noticeable drop in proportion of in atmosphere beginning in late 19th century conversely nuclear testing increased amount of in atmosphere which attained a maximum in about 1965 of almost twice what it had been before testing began measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta counting devices which counted amount of beta radiation emitted by decaying atoms in a sample more recently accelerator mass spectrometry has become method of choice it counts all atoms in sample and not just few that happen to decay during measurements it can therefore be used with much smaller samples as small as individual plant seeds and gives results much more quickly development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology in addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as radiocarbon revolution radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated such as end of last ice age and beginning of neolithic and bronze age in different regions background history in 1939 martin kamen and samuel ruben of radiation laboratory at berkeley began experiments to determine if any of elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research they synthesized using laboratory s cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that atom s half life was far longer than had been previously thought taylor bar yosef 2014 p 268 this was followed by a prediction by serge a korff then employed at franklin institute in philadelphia that interaction of thermal neutrons with in upper atmosphere would create taylor bar yosef 2014 p 269 it had previously been thought that would be more likely to be created by deuterons interacting with at some time during world war ii willard libby who was then at berkeley learned of korff s research and conceived idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating in 1945 libby moved to university of chicago where he began his work on radiocarbon dating he published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that carbon in living matter might include as well as non radioactive carbon bowman 1995 pp 9 15 libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in baltimore and after isotopically enriching their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained by contrast methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age results were summarized in a paper in science in 1947 in which authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin libby and james arnold proceeded to test radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages for example two samples taken from tombs of two egyptian kings and sneferu independently dated to 2625 bc plus or minus 75 years were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 bc plus or minus 250 years these results were published in science in 1949 aitken 1990 pp 60 61 within 11 years of their announcement more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide in 1960 libby was awarded nobel prize in chemistry for this work physical and chemical details in nature carbon exists as two stable nonradioactive isotopes carbon 12 and carbon 13 and a radioactive isotope carbon 14 also known as radiocarbon half life of time it takes for half of a given amount of to decay is about 5 730 years so its concentration in atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years but is constantly being produced in lower stratosphere and upper troposphere primarily by galactic cosmic rays and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays these generate neutrons that in turn create when they strike nitrogen 14 atoms following nuclear reaction is main pathway by which is created n p where n represents a neutron and p represents a proton bianchi 2011 p 35 once produced quickly combines with oxygen in atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide and ultimately carbon dioxide o oh h carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in atmosphere is dissolved in ocean and is taken up by plants via photosynthesis animals eat plants and ultimately radiocarbon is distributed throughout biosphere ratio of to is approximately 1 25 parts of to 1012 parts of 1997 p 343 in addition about 1 of carbon atoms are of stable isotope equation for radioactive decay of is by emitting a beta particle an electron e and an electron antineutrino one of neutrons in nucleus changes to a proton and nucleus reverts to stable non radioactive isotope taylor bar yosef 2014 p 33 principles during its life a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with atmosphere or through its diet it will therefore have same proportion of as atmosphere or in case of marine animals or plants with ocean once it dies it ceases to acquire but within its biological material at that time will continue to decay and so ratio of to in its remains will gradually decrease because decays at a known rate proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon older sample less will be left equation governing decay of a radioactive isotope is where n0 is number of atoms of isotope in original sample at time t 0 when organism from which sample was taken died and n is number of atoms left after time t l is a constant that depends on particular isotope for a given isotope it is equal to reciprocal of mean life i e average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay mean life denoted by t of is 8 267 years so equation above can be rewritten as aitken 1990 p 59 sample is assumed to have originally had same ratio as ratio in atmosphere and since size of sample is known total number of atoms in sample can be calculated yielding n0 number of atoms in original sample measurement of n number of atoms currently in sample allows calculation of t age of sample using equation above half life of a radioactive isotope usually denoted by t1 2 is a more familiar concept than mean life so although equations above are expressed in terms of mean life it is more usual to quote value of s half life than its mean life currently accepted value for half life of is 5 730 40 years this means that after 5 730 years only half of initial will remain a quarter will remain after 11 460 years an eighth after 17 190 years and so on above calculations make several assumptions such as that level of in atmosphere has remained constant over time in fact level of in atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result values provided by equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources aitken 1990 pp 61 66 this is done by calibration curves discussed below which convert a measurement of in a sample into an estimated calendar age calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called radiocarbon age which is age in radiocarbon years of sample an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used calculations for radiocarbon years assume that atmospheric ratio has not changed over time calculating radiocarbon ages also requires value of half life for in libby s 1949 paper he used a value of 47 years based on research by et al this was remarkably close to modern value but shortly afterwards accepted value was revised to 5568 30 years and this value was in use for more than a decade it was revised again in early 1960s to 5 730 40 years which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect error in half life is about 3 for consistency with these early papers it was agreed at 1962 radiocarbon conference in cambridge uk to use libby half life of 5568 years radiocarbon ages are still calculated using this half life and are known as conventional radiocarbon age since calibration curve intcal also reports past atmospheric concentration using this conventional age any conventional ages calibrated against intcal curve will produce a correct calibrated age when a date is quoted reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years it may differ substantially from best estimate of actual calendar date both because it uses wrong value for half life of and because no correction calibration has been applied for historical variation of in atmosphere over time aitken 1990 pp 92 95 bowman 1995 p 42 carbon exchange reservoir right thumb upright 1 8 simplified version of carbon exchange reservoir showing proportions of carbon and relative activity of in each reservoir carbon is distributed throughout atmosphere biosphere and oceans these are referred to collectively as carbon exchange reservoir aitken 2003 p 506 and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir different elements of carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store and in how long it takes for generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them this affects ratio of to in different reservoirs and hence radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir atmosphere which is where is generated contains about 1 9 of total carbon in reservoirs and it contains mixes in less than seven years 2000 p 690 ratio of to in atmosphere is taken as baseline for other reservoirs if another reservoir has a lower ratio of to it indicates that carbon is older and hence that either some of has decayed or reservoir is receiving carbon that is not at atmospheric baseline ocean surface is an example it contains 2 4 of carbon in exchange reservoir but there is only about 95 as much as would be expected if ratio were same as in atmosphere time it takes for carbon from atmosphere to mix with surface ocean is only a few years polyakov 2012 p 372 but surface waters also receive water from deep ocean which has more than 90 of carbon in reservoir water in deep ocean takes about 1 000 years to circulate back through surface waters and so surface waters contain a combination of older water with depleted and water recently at surface with in equilibrium with atmosphere creatures living at ocean surface have same ratios as water they live in and as a result of reduced ratio radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 400 years bowman 1995 pp 24 27 cronin 2010 p 35 organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with atmosphere and have same ratio as atmosphere these organisms contain about 1 3 of carbon in reservoir sea organisms have a mass of less than 1 of those on land and are not shown on diagram accumulated dead organic matter of both plants and animals exceeds mass of biosphere by a factor of nearly 3 and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment it has a ratio lower than that of biosphere dating considerations variation in ratio in different parts of carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of age of a sample based on amount of it contains will often give an incorrect result there are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered errors are of four general types variations in ratio in atmosphere both geographically and over time isotopic fractionation variations in ratio in different parts of reservoir contamination atmospheric variation thumb atmospheric for northern and southern hemispheres showing percentage excess above pre bomb levels partial test ban treaty went into effect on 10 october 1963 in early years of using technique it was understood that it depended on atmospheric ratio having remained same over preceding few thousand years to verify accuracy of method several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested results of testing were in reasonable agreement with true ages of objects over time however discrepancies began to appear between known chronology for oldest egyptian dynasties and radiocarbon dates of egyptian artefacts neither pre existing egyptian chronology nor new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate but a third possibility was that ratio had changed over time question was resolved by study of tree rings bowman 1995 pp 16 20 suess 1970 p 303 taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 50 52 comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed construction of a continuous sequence of tree ring data that spanned 8 000 years since that time tree ring data series has been extended to 13 900 years in 1960s hans suess was able to use tree ring sequence to show that dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with dates assigned by egyptologists this was possible because although annual plants such as corn have a ratio that reflects atmospheric ratio at time they were growing trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year while inner tree rings don t get their replenished and instead start losing through decay hence each ring preserves a record of atmospheric ratio of year it grew in carbon dating wood from tree rings themselves provides check needed on atmospheric ratio with a sample of known date and a measurement of value of n number of atoms of remaining in sample carbon dating equation allows calculation of n0 number of atoms of in sample at time tree ring was formed and hence ratio in atmosphere at that time equipped with results of carbon dating tree rings it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct errors caused by variation over time in ratio bowman 1995 pp 43 49 these curves are described in more detail below coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during 19th century both are sufficiently old that they contain little or no detectable and as a result released substantially diluted atmospheric ratio dating an object from early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than true date for same reason concentrations in neighbourhood of large cities are lower than atmospheric average this fossil fuel effect also known as suess effect after hans suess who first reported it in 1955 would only amount to a reduction of 0 2 in activity if additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout carbon exchange reservoir but because of long delay in mixing with deep ocean actual effect is a 3 reduction aitken 1990 pp 71 72 a much larger effect comes from above ground nuclear testing which released large numbers of neutrons and created from about 1950 until 1963 when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned it is estimated that several tonnes of were created if all this extra had immediately been spread across entire carbon exchange reservoir it would have led to an increase in ratio of only a few per cent but immediate effect was to almost double amount of in atmosphere with peak level occurring in 1964 for northern hemisphere and in 1966 for southern hemisphere level has since dropped as this bomb pulse or bomb carbon as it is sometimes called percolates into rest of reservoir isotopic fractionation photosynthesis is primary process by which carbon moves from atmosphere into living things in photosynthetic pathways is absorbed slightly more easily than which in turn is more easily absorbed than differential uptake of three carbon isotopes leads to and ratios in plants that differ from ratios in atmosphere this effect is known as isotopic fractionation bowman 1995 pp 20 23 maslin swann 2006 p 246 to determine degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant amounts of both and isotopes are measured and resulting ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as pdb ratio is used instead of because former is much easier to measure and latter can be easily derived depletion of relative to is proportional to difference in atomic masses of two isotopes so depletion for is twice depletion of fractionation of known as is calculated as follows 0 where 0 sign indicates parts per thousand because pdb standard contains an unusually high proportion of most measured values are negative thumb upright 1 35 left north ronaldsay sheep on beach in north ronaldsay in winter these sheep eat seaweed which has a higher content than grass samples from these sheep have a value of about 13 0 which is much higher than for sheep that feed on grasses material typical 0 0 marine plankton 22 0 to 17 0 c3 plants 30 0 to 22 0 c4 plants 15 0 to 9 0 atmospheric 8 0 marine 32 0 to 13 0 for marine organisms details of photosynthesis reactions are less well understood and values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature at higher temperatures has poor solubility in water which means there is less available for photosynthetic reactions under these conditions fractionation is reduced and at temperatures above 14 degc values are correspondingly higher while at lower temperatures becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms value for animals depends on their diet an animal that eats food with high values will have a higher than one that eats food with lower values animal s own biochemical processes can also impact results for example both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of than is found in animal s diet though for different biochemical reasons enrichment of bone also implies that excreted material is depleted in relative to diet 2010 p 446 since makes up about 1 of carbon in a sample ratio can be accurately measured by mass spectrometry typical values of have been found by experiment for many plants as well as for different parts of animals such as bone collagen but when dating a given sample it is better to determine value for that sample directly than to rely on published values carbon exchange between atmospheric and carbonate at ocean surface is also subject to fractionation with in atmosphere more likely than to dissolve in ocean result is an overall increase in ratio in ocean of 1 5 relative to ratio in atmosphere this increase in concentration almost exactly cancels out decrease caused by upwelling of water containing old and hence depleted carbon from deep ocean so that direct measurements of radiation are similar to measurements for rest of biosphere correcting for isotopic fractionation as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of biosphere gives an apparent age of about 400 years for ocean surface water reservoir effects libby s original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that ratio in exchange reservoir is constant all over world libby 1965 p 6 but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in ratio across reservoir marine effect in atmosphere transfers to ocean by dissolving in surface water as carbonate and bicarbonate ions at same time carbonate ions in water are returning to air as this exchange process brings from atmosphere into surface waters of ocean but thus introduced takes a long time to percolate through entire volume of ocean deepest parts of ocean mix very slowly with surface waters and mixing is uneven main mechanism that brings deep water to surface is upwelling which is more common in regions closer to equator upwelling is also influenced by factors such as topography of local ocean bottom and coastlines climate and wind patterns overall mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than mixing of atmospheric with surface waters and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years upwelling mixes this old water with surface water giving surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years after correcting for fractionation this effect is not uniform average effect is about 400 years but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other these deviations can be accounted for in calibration and users of software such as can provide as an input appropriate correction for location of their samples effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells and marine mammals such as whales and seals which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old hemisphere effect northern and southern hemispheres have atmospheric circulation systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between two atmospheric ratio is lower in southern hemisphere with an apparent additional age of about 40 years for radiocarbon results from south as compared to north this is because greater surface area of ocean in southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between ocean and atmosphere than in north since surface ocean is depleted in because of marine effect is removed from southern atmosphere more quickly than in north hogg et al 2013 p 1898 effect is strengthened by strong upwelling around antarctica other effects if carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon such as rocks then result will be a reduction in ratio in water for example rivers that pass over limestone which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate will acquire carbonate ions similarly groundwater can contain carbon derived from rocks through which it has passed these rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable so this carbon lowers ratio of water it enters which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both affected water and plants and freshwater organisms that live in it this is known as hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions which are characteristic of hard water other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results and can also reduce apparent age if they are of more recent origin than sample effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied additional research is usually needed to determine size of offset for example by comparing radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 74 75 volcanic eruptions eject large amounts of carbon into air carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable so ratio in vicinity of volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower ratios for example plants in neighbourhood of caldera in azores were found to have apparent ages that ranged from 250 years to 3320 years pasquier et al 1999 pp 200 201 contamination any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age will cause measured date to be inaccurate contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is effect is greater for older samples if a sample that is 17 000 years old is contaminated so that 1 of sample is modern carbon it will appear to be 600 years younger for a sample that is 34 000 years old same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4 000 years contamination with old carbon with no remaining causes an error in other direction independent of age a sample contaminated with 1 old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it truly is regardless of date of sample aitken 1990 pp 85 86 samples samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring content this can mean conversion to gaseous liquid or solid form depending on measurement technique to be used before this can be done sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents bowman 1995 pp 27 30 this includes removing visible contaminants such as rootlets that may have penetrated sample since its burial alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination but care has to be taken to avoid removing part of sample that contains carbon to be tested aitken 1990 pp 86 89 material considerations it is common to reduce a wood sample to just cellulose component before testing but since this can reduce volume of sample to 20 of its original size testing of whole wood is often performed as well charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants unburnt bone can be tested it is usual to date it using collagen protein fraction that remains after washing away bone s structural material hydroxyproline one of constituent amino acids in bone was once thought to be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone but it has since been detected in groundwater for burnt bone depends on conditions under which bone was burnt if bone was heated under reducing conditions it and associated organic matter may have been carbonized in this case sample is often usable shells from both marine and land organisms consist almost entirely of calcium carbonate either as aragonite or as calcite or some mixture of two calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallized material will contain carbon from sample s environment which may be of geological origin if testing recrystallized shell is unavoidable it is sometimes possible to identify original shell material from a sequence of tests 2004 p 166 it is also possible to test an organic protein found in shell but it constitutes only 1 2 of shell material three major components of peat are humic acid humins and acid of these humins give most reliable date as they are insoluble in alkali and less likely to contain contaminants from sample s environment a particular difficulty with dried peat is removal of rootlets which are likely to be hard to distinguish from sample material soil contains organic material but because of likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin it is very difficult to get satisfactory radiocarbon dates it is preferable to sieve soil for fragments of organic origin and date fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes other materials that have been successfully dated include ivory paper textiles individual seeds and grains straw from within mud bricks and charred food remains found in pottery preparation and size particularly for older samples it may be useful to enrich amount of in sample before testing this can be done with a thermal diffusion column process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise but it allows more precise measurement of ratio in old material and extends maximum age that can be reliably reported bowman 1995 pp 37 42 once contamination has been removed samples must be converted to a form suitable for measuring technology to be used bowman 1995 pp 31 37 where gas is required is widely used aitken 1990 pp 76 78 for samples to be used in liquid scintillation counters carbon must be in liquid form sample is typically converted to benzene for accelerator mass spectrometry solid graphite targets are most common although gaseous can also be used trumbore 1996 p 318 quantity of material needed for testing depends on sample type and technology being used there are two types of testing technology detectors that record radioactivity known as beta counters and accelerator mass spectrometers for beta counters a sample weighing at least is typically required accelerator mass spectrometry is much more sensitive and samples containing as little as 0 5 milligrams of carbon can be used taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 103 104 measurement and results thumb measuring is now most commonly done with an accelerator mass spectrometer for decades after libby performed first radiocarbon dating experiments only way to measure in a sample was to detect radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms in this approach what is measured is activity in number of decay events per unit mass per time period of sample this method is also known as beta counting because it is beta particles emitted by decaying atoms that are detected walker 2005 p 20 in late 1970s an alternative approach became available directly counting number of and atoms in a given sample via accelerator mass spectrometry usually referred to as ams ams counts ratio directly instead of activity of sample but measurements of activity and ratio can be converted into each other exactly for some time beta counting methods were more accurate than ams but ams is now more accurate and has become method of choice for radiocarbon measurements walker 2005 p 23 2014 p 166 in addition to improved accuracy ams has two further significant advantages over beta counting it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting and it is much faster an accuracy of 1 can be achieved in minutes with ams which is far quicker than would be achievable with older technology 2010 p 96 beta counting libby s first detector was a geiger counter of his own design he converted carbon in his sample to lamp black soot and coated inner surface of a cylinder with it this cylinder was inserted into counter in such a way that counting wire was inside sample cylinder in order that there should be no material between sample and wire any interposing material would have interfered with detection of radioactivity since beta particles emitted by decaying are so weak that half are stopped by a 0 01 mm thickness of aluminium libby s method was soon superseded by gas proportional counters which were less affected by bomb carbon additional created by nuclear weapons testing these counters record bursts of ionization caused by beta particles emitted by decaying atoms bursts are proportional to energy of particle so other sources of ionization such as background radiation can be identified and ignored counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding to eliminate background radiation and to reduce incidence of cosmic rays in addition anticoincidence detectors are used these record events outside counter and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored other common technology used for measuring activity is liquid scintillation counting which was invented in 1950 but which had to wait until early 1960s when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed to become competitive with gas counting after 1970 liquid counters became more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by beta particles emitted by as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to benzene like gas counters liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters 1996 p 24 l annunziata kessler 2012 p 424 for both gas proportional counter and liquid scintillation counter what is measured is number of beta particles detected in a given time period since mass of sample is known this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon cpm g c or per kg bq kg c in si units each measuring device is also used to measure activity of a blank sample a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity this provides a value for background radiation which must be subtracted from measured activity of sample being dated to get activity attributable solely to that sample s in addition a sample with a standard activity is measured to provide a baseline for comparison eriksson stenstrom et al 2011 p 3 accelerator mass spectrometry thumb upright 1 8 simplified schematic layout of an accelerator mass spectrometer used for counting carbon isotopes for carbon dating ams counts atoms of and in a given sample determining ratio directly sample often in form of graphite is made to emit c ions carbon atoms with a single negative charge which are injected into an accelerator ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper which removes several electrons so that ions emerge with a positive charge ions which may have from 1 to 4 positive charges c to c4 depending on accelerator design are then passed through a magnet that curves their path heavier ions are curved less than lighter ones so different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions a particle detector then records number of ions detected in stream but since volume of and needed for calibration is too great for individual ion detection counts are determined by measuring electric current created in a faraday cup aitken 1990 pp 82 85 large positive charge induced by stripper forces molecules such as which has a weight close enough to to interfere with measurements to dissociate so they are not detected 1995 p 16 most ams machines also measure sample s for use in calculating sample s radiocarbon age 2004 p 395 use of ams as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry is necessary because of need to distinguish carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass such as and as with beta counting both blank samples and standard samples are used two different kinds of blank may be measured a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing to detect any machine background and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly same way as sample which is being dated any signal from machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed expected path inside detector or by carbon hydrides such as or a signal from process blank measures amount of contamination introduced during preparation of sample these measurements are used in subsequent calculation of age of sample calculations calculations to be performed on measurements taken depend on technology used since beta counters measure sample s radioactivity whereas ams determines ratio of three different carbon isotopes in sample to determine age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting ratio of its activity to activity of standard must be found to determine this a blank sample of old or dead carbon is measured and a sample of known activity is measured additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for most common standard sample material is oxalic acid such as standard 1 000 lb of which was prepared by national institute of standards and technology nist in 1977 from french beet harvests 1984 p 5 l annunziata 2007 p 528 results from ams testing are in form of ratios of and which are used to calculate fm fraction modern this is defined as ratio between ratio in sample and ratio in modern carbon which is in turn defined as ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect both beta counting and ams results have to be corrected for fractionation this is necessary because different materials of same age which because of fractionation have naturally different ratios will appear to be of different ages because ratio is taken as indicator of age to avoid this all radiocarbon measurements are converted to measurement that would have been seen had sample been made of wood which has a known d value of 25 0 once corrected ratio is known a radiocarbon age is calculated using calculation uses 8 033 mean life derived from libby s half life of 5 568 years not 8 267 mean life derived from more accurate modern value of 5 730 years libby s value for half life is used to maintain consistency with early radiocarbon testing results calibration curves include a correction for this so accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured errors and reliability reliability of results can be improved by lengthening testing time for example if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of 80 years with 68 confidence then doubling counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much to be measured with same error term of 80 years bowman 1995 pp 38 39 radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50 000 years old as samples older than that have insufficient to be measurable older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques large samples and very long measurement times these techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60 000 and in some cases up to 75 000 years before present radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one standard deviation usually represented by greek letter sigma as 1s on either side of mean however a date range of 1s represents only 68 confidence level so true age of object being measured may lie outside range of dates quoted this was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by british museum radiocarbon laboratory in which weekly measurements were taken on same sample for six months results varied widely though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in measurements and included multiple date ranges of 1s confidence that did not overlap with each other measurements included one with a range from about to about years ago and another with a range from about 4520 to about taylor 1987 pp 125 126 errors in procedure can also lead to errors in results if 1 of benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years bowman 1995 pp 40 41 calibration left thumb stump of a very old bristlecone pine tree rings from these trees among others are used in building calibration curves calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years i e dates that represent age sample would be if ratio had been constant historically taylor bar yosef 2014 p 155 although libby had pointed out as early as 1955 possibility that this assumption was incorrect it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates aitken 1990 p 66 67 to produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age study of tree rings led to first such sequence individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as amount of rainfall in a given year these factors affect all trees in an area so examining tree ring sequences from old wood allows identification of overlapping sequences in this way an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into past first such published sequence based on bristlecone pine tree rings was created by wesley ferguson hans suess used this data to publish first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967 curve showed two types of variation from straight line a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9 000 years and a shorter term variation often referred to as wiggles with a period of decades suess said he drew line showing wiggles by cosmic by which he meant that variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces it was unclear for some time whether wiggles were real or not but they are now well established taylor bar yosef 2014 p 59 these short term fluctuations in calibration curve are now known as de vries effects after hessel de vries taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 53 54 a calibration curve is used by taking radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory and reading across from that date on vertical axis of graph point where this horizontal line intersects curve will give calendar age of sample on horizontal axis this is reverse of way curve is constructed a point on graph is derived from a sample of known age such as a tree ring when it is tested resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for graph thumb northern hemisphere curve from intcal13 as of 2014 this is most recent version of standard calibration curve diagonal line shows where curve would lie if radiocarbon ages and calendar ages were same over next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches these were superseded by intcal series of curves beginning with published in 1998 and updated in 2004 2009 and 2013 improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings varves coral plant speleothems and foraminifera intcal13 data includes separate curves for northern and southern hemispheres as they differ systematically because of hemisphere effect southern curve is based on independent data where possible and derived from northern curve by adding average offset for southern hemisphere where no direct data was available there is also a separate marine calibration curve for a set of samples forming a sequence with a known separation in time these samples form a subset of calibration curve sequence can be compared to calibration curve and best match to sequence established this wiggle matching technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates walker 2005 pp 35 37 wiggle matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on calibration curve and hence can provide a much more accurate date than intercept or probability methods are able to produce aitken 1990 pp 103 105 technique is not restricted to tree rings for example a stratified tephra sequence in new zealand believed to predate human colonization of islands has been dated to 1314 ad 12 years by wiggle matching walker 2005 pp 207 209 wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer this occurs when curve wiggles up and down enough that radiocarbon age intercepts curve in more than one place which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges corresponding to two parts of curve that radiocarbon age intercepted bayesian statistical techniques can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated for example if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a stratigraphic sequence bayesian analysis can be used to evaluate dates which are outliers and can calculate improved probability distributions based on prior information that sequence should be ordered in time when bayesian analysis was introduced its use was limited by need to use mainframe computers to perform calculations but technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers such as oxcal taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 148 149 reporting dates several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since first samples were dated as of 2019 standard format required by journal radiocarbon is as follows uncalibrated dates should be reported as laboratory year range bp where laboratory identifies laboratory that tested sample and sample id year is laboratory s determination of age of sample in radiocarbon years range is laboratory s estimate of error in age at 1s confidence bp stands for before present referring to a reference date of 1950 so that 500 bp means year 1450 ad for example uncalibrated date utc 2020 3510 60 bp indicates that sample was tested by utrecht van der graaff where it has a sample number of 2020 and that uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present 60 years related forms are sometimes used for example 10 ka bp means 10 000 radiocarbon years before present i e 8 050 bc and yr bp might be used to distinguish uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as thermoluminescence calibrated dates are frequently reported as cal bp cal bc or cal ad again with bp referring to year 1950 as zero date taylor bar yosef 2014 p 29 radiocarbon gives two options for reporting calibrated dates a common format is cal date range confidence where date range is range of dates corresponding to given confidence level confidence indicates confidence level for given date range for example cal 1220 1281 ad 1s means a calibrated date for which true date lies between 1220 ad and 1281 ad with confidence level given as 1s or one standard deviation calibrated dates can also be expressed as bp instead of using bc and ad curve used to calibrate results should be latest available intcal curve calibrated dates should also identify any programs such as oxcal used to perform calibration in addition an article in radiocarbon in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that information should be provided about sample treatment including sample material pretreatment methods and quality control measurements that citation to software used for calibration should specify version number and any options or models used and that calibrated date should be given with associated probabilities for each range use in archaeology interpretation a key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is archaeological association what is true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site it frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from object of interest but there are also many cases where this is not possible metal grave goods for example cannot be radiocarbon dated but they may be found in a grave with a coffin charcoal or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at same time in these cases a date for coffin or charcoal is indicative of date of deposition of grave goods because of direct functional relationship between two there are also cases where there is no functional relationship but association is reasonably strong for example a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to rubbish pit mook 1985 pp 48 49 contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in specimen selection and preparation in 2014 thomas higham and co workers suggested that many of dates published for neanderthal artefacts are too recent because of contamination by young carbon as a tree grows only outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment so age measured for a wood sample depends on where sample is taken from this means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than date at which tree was felled in addition if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes there may be a significant delay between felling of tree and final use in context in which it is found bowman 1995 pp 53 54 this is often referred to as old wood problem one example is bronze age trackway at withy bed copse in england trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re used in trackway another example is driftwood which may be used as construction material it is not always possible to recognize re use other materials can present same problem for example bitumen is known to have been used by some neolithic communities to waterproof baskets bitumen s radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by laboratory regardless of actual age of context so testing basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken a separate issue related to re use is that of lengthy use or delayed deposition for example a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than actual age of context in which it is deposited use outside archaeology archaeology is not only field to make use of radiocarbon dating ability to date minute samples using ams has meant that and can use radiocarbon dating on pollen samples radiocarbon dates can also be used in geology sedimentology and lake studies for example dates on organic material recovered from strata of interest can be used to correlate strata in different locations that appear to be similar on geological grounds dating material from one location gives date information about other location and dates are also used to place strata in overall geological timeline radiocarbon is also used to date carbon released from ecosystems particularly to monitor release of old carbon that was previously stored in soils as a result of human disturbance or climate change recent advances in field collection techniques also allow radiocarbon dating of methane and carbon dioxide which are important greenhouse gases notable applications pleistocene holocene boundary in two creeks fossil forest pleistocene is a geological epoch that began about 2 6 million years ago holocene current geological epoch begins about 11 700 years ago when pleistocene ends taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 34 37 establishing date of this boundary which is defined by sharp climatic warming as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists for much of 20th century bousman 2012 p 4 at two creeks in wisconsin a fossil forest was discovered two creeks buried forest state natural area and subsequent research determined that destruction of forest was caused by ice readvance last southward movement of ice before end of pleistocene in that area before advent of radiocarbon dating fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at two creeks with sequences in scandinavia this led to estimates that trees were between 24 000 and 19 000 years old and hence this was taken to be date of last advance of wisconsin glaciation before its final retreat marked end of pleistocene in north america macdougall 2008 pp 94 95 in 1952 libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from two creeks site and two similar sites nearby dates were averaged to 11 404 bp with a standard error of 350 years this result was uncalibrated as need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood further results over next decade supported an average date of 11 350 bp with results thought to be most accurate averaging 11 600 bp there was initial resistance to these results on part of ernst palaeobotanist who had worked on scandinavian varve series but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists in 1990s samples were tested with ams yielding uncalibrated dates ranging from 11 640 bp to 11 800 bp both with a standard error of 160 years subsequently a sample from fossil forest was used in an test with results provided by over 70 laboratories these tests produced a median age of 11 788 8 bp 2s confidence which when calibrated gives a date range of 13 730 to 13 550 cal bp two creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing modern understanding of north american glaciation at end of pleistocene dead sea scrolls thumb part of great isaiah scroll one of dead sea scrolls in 1947 scrolls were discovered in caves near dead sea that proved to contain writing in hebrew and aramaic most of which are thought to have been produced by essenes a small jewish sect these scrolls are of great significance in study of biblical texts because many of them contain earliest known version of books of hebrew bible taylor bar yosef 2014 pp 38 42 a sample of linen wrapping from one of these scrolls great isaiah scroll was included in a 1955 analysis by libby with an estimated age of 1 917 200 years libby 1965 p 84 based on an analysis of writing style estimates were made of age of 21 of scrolls and samples from most of these along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated were tested by two ams laboratories in 1990s results ranged in age from early 4th century bc to mid 4th century ad in all but two cases scrolls were determined to be within 100 years of palaeographically determined age isaiah scroll was included in testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2s confidence level because of shape of calibration curve at that point there is a 15 chance that it dates from 355 295 bc and an 84 chance that it dates from 210 45 bc subsequently these dates were criticized on grounds that before scrolls were tested they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make writing easier to read it was argued that failure to remove castor oil sufficiently would have caused dates to be too young multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing criticism impact soon after publication of libby s 1949 paper in science universities around world began establishing radiocarbon dating laboratories and by end of 1950s there were more than 20 active research laboratories it quickly became apparent that principles of radiocarbon dating were valid despite certain discrepancies causes of which then remained unknown taylor bar yosef 2014 p 288 development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on described as radiocarbon revolution taylor 1997 p 70 in words of anthropologist r e taylor data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local regional and continental boundaries it provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from e g of stone tools or pottery it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with samples to be tested these improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a date was incorrect taylor also suggests that availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from need to focus so much of their energy on determining dates of their finds and led to an expansion of questions archaeologists were willing to research for example from 1970s questions about evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology taylor 1987 pp 143 146 dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric europe researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through continent or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them as radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally this has been described as a second radiocarbon revolution and with regard to british prehistory archaeologist richard atkinson has characterized impact of radiocarbon dating as radical therapy for progressive disease of more broadly success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data taylor has also described impact of ams and ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution renfrew 2014 p 13 occasionally radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest for example shroud of turin a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of jesus christ after his crucifixion three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from shroud in 1988 results pointed to 14th century origins raising doubts about shroud s authenticity as an alleged 1st century relic researchers have studied other radioactive isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest such isotopes include and with development of ams in 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be basis of useful dating techniques which have been primarily applied to dating rocks walker 2005 pp 77 79 naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form basis of dating methods as with potassium argon dating argon argon dating and uranium series dating walker 2005 pp 57 77 other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include thermoluminescence optically stimulated luminescence electron spin resonance and fission track dating as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers such as dendrochronology tephrochronology and varve chronology walker 2005 pp 93 162 see also dating methodologies in archaeology notes references sources external links
