philadelphia and was twice recast by local workmen john pass and john stow whose last names appear on bell in its early years bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens about public meetings and proclamations although no immediate announcement was made of second continental congress s vote for independence and so bell could not have rung on july 4 1776 related to that vote bells were rung on july 8 to mark reading of united states declaration of independence while there is no contemporary account of liberty bell ringing most historians believe it was one of bells rung after american independence was secured bell fell into relative obscurity until in 1830s bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies who dubbed it liberty bell bell acquired its distinctive large crack some time in early 19th century a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after death of chief justice john marshall in 1835 bell became famous after an 1847 short story claimed that an aged bellringer rang it on july 4 1776 upon hearing of second continental congress vote for independence despite fact that bell did not ring for independence on that july 4 tale was widely accepted as fact even by some historians beginning in 1885 city of philadelphia which owns bell allowed it to go to various expositions and patriotic gatherings bell attracted huge crowds wherever it went additional cracking occurred and pieces were chipped away by souvenir hunters last such journey occurred in 1915 after which city refused further requests after world war

tradition of bell casting stow on other hand was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder at stow s foundry on second street bell was broken into small pieces melted down and cast into a new bell two founders decided that metal was too brittle and augmented bell metal by about ten percent using copper bell was ready in march 1753 and norris reported that lettering that included founders names and year was even clearer on new bell than on old nash p 7 10 city officials scheduled a public celebration with free food and drink for testing of recast bell when bell was struck it did not break but sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together mocked by crowd pass and stow hastily took bell away and again recast it when fruit of two founders renewed efforts was brought forth in june 1753 sound was deemed satisfactory though norris indicated that he did not personally like it bell was hung in steeple of state house same month nash pp 10 11 reason for difficulties with bell is not certain whitechapel foundry took position that bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer who incautiously sent clapper flying against rim rather than body of bell nash p 9 in 1975 winterthur museum conducted an analysis of metal in bell and concluded that a series of errors made in construction reconstruction and second reconstruction of bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap hanson p 7 museum found a considerably higher level of tin in liberty bell than in other whitechapel bells of that era and suggested that whitechapel made an error in alloy perhaps by using scraps with a high level of tin to begin melt instead of usual pure copper hanson p 5 analysis found that on second recasting instead of adding pure tin to bell metal pass and stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content and incompletely mixed new metal into mold hanson p 4 result was an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from rim hanson p 3 early days 1754 1846 thumb

also used to summon people to public meetings and in 1772 a group of citizens complained to assembly that bell was being rung too frequently kimball pp 31 32 despite legends that have grown up about liberty bell it did not ring on july 4 1776 at least not for any reason connected with independence as no public announcement was made of declaration of independence when declaration was publicly read on july 8 1776 there was a ringing of bells and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing most authorities agree that liberty bell was among bells that rang kimball pp 32 pp 17 p 754 however there is some chance that poor condition of state house bell tower prevented bell from ringing according to john c paige who wrote a historical study of bell for national park service we do not know whether or not steeple was still strong enough to permit state house bell to ring on this day if it could possibly be rung we can assume it was whether or not it did it has come to symbolize all of bells throughout united states which proclaimed independence paige p 18 if bell was rung it would have been most likely rung by andrew mcnair who was doorkeeper both of assembly and of congress and was responsible for ringing bell as mcnair was absent on two unspecified days between april and november it might have been rung by william hurry who succeeded him as doorkeeper

bell had long been cracked but had been put in order by having sides of crack filed paper reported that around noon it was discovered that ringing had caused crack to be greatly extended and that old independence bell now hangs in great city steeple irreparably cracked and forever dumb kimball pp 43 45 most common story about cracking of bell is that it happened when bell was rung upon 1835 death of chief justice of united states john marshall this story originated in 1876 when volunteer curator of independence hall colonel frank announced that he had ascertained truth of story while there is little evidence to support this view it has been widely accepted and taught other claims regarding crack in bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming lafayette on his return to united states in 1824 that it cracked announcing passing of british catholic relief act 1829 and that some boys had been invited to ring bell and inadvertently damaged it david kimball in his book compiled
