deadliest terrorist attack in human history and single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in history of united states with 343 and 72 killed respectively suspicion quickly fell on al qaeda united states responded by launching war on terror and invading afghanistan to depose taliban which had failed to comply with u s demands to extradite osama bin laden and expel al qaeda from afghanistan many countries strengthened their anti terrorism legislation and expanded powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks although osama bin laden al qaeda s leader initially denied any involvement in 2004 he claimed responsibility for attacks al qaeda and bin laden cited u s support of israel presence of u s troops in saudi arabia and sanctions against iraq as motives after evading capture for almost a decade bin laden was located in pakistan and killed by seal team six of u s navy in may 2011 during obama administration destruction of world trade center and nearby infrastructure seriously harmed economy of new york city and had a significant effect on global markets which resulted in closing of wall street until

intelligence these 28 pages contain information regarding material and financial assistance given to hijackers and their affiliates leading up to attacks by saudi arabian government as a consequence of attacks united states has been in a state of national emergency ever since 2001 background al qaeda origins of al qaeda can be traced to 1979 when soviet union invaded afghanistan osama bin laden traveled to afghanistan and helped organize arab mujahideen to resist soviets under guidance of ayman al zawahiri bin laden became more radical in 1996 bin laden issued his first fatwa calling for american soldiers to leave saudi arabia in a second fatwa in 1998 bin laden outlined his objections to american foreign policy with respect to israel as well as continued presence of american troops in saudi arabia after gulf war bin laden used islamic texts to exhort muslims to attack americans until stated grievances were reversed muslim legal scholars have throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that jihad is an individual duty if enemy destroys muslim countries according to bin laden osama bin laden thumb upright osama bin laden at about 40 years of age in 1997 bin laden orchestrated attacks and initially denied involvement but later recanted his false statements al jazeera broadcast a statement by bin laden on september 16 2001 stating i stress that i have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation in november 2001 u s forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in jalalabad afghanistan in video bin laden is seen talking to khaled al harbi and admits foreknowledge of attacks on december 27 2001 a second bin laden video was released in video he said but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for attacks shortly before u s presidential election in 2004 bin laden used a taped statement to publicly acknowledge al qaeda s involvement in attacks on united states he admitted his direct link to attacks and said they were carried out because bin laden said he had personally directed his followers to attack world trade center and pentagon another video obtained by al jazeera in september 2006 shows bin laden with ramzi bin al shibh as well as two hijackers hamza al ghamdi and wail al as they make preparations for attacks u s never formally indicted bin laden for 9 11 attacks

jazeera reported that in april 2002 khalid sheikh mohammed admitted his involvement in attacks along with ramzi bin al shibh 2004 9 11 commission report determined that animosity towards united states felt by mohammed principal architect of 9 11 attacks stemmed from his violent disagreement with u s foreign policy favoring israel 9 11 commission report 2004 p 147 mohammed was also an adviser and financier of 1993 world trade center bombing and uncle of ramzi yousef lead bomber in that attack mohammed was arrested on march 1 2003 in rawalpindi pakistan by pakistani security officials working

khaled sheikh mohammed in u s district court manhattan on 26 july 2019 indicated that he was interested in testifying about saudi arabia s role in 9 11 attacks and helping victims and families of victims of 9 11 in exchange for united states not seeking death penalty against him james one of lawyers for victims raised question over usefulness of mohammed other al qaeda members in substitution for testimony of khalid sheikh mohammed from trial of zacarias moussaoui five people are identified as having been completely aware of operation s details they are bin laden khalid sheikh mohammed

hamburg cell chapter of 9 11 commission report detailing history of hamburg cell 9 11 commission motives osama bin laden s declaration of a holy war against united states and a 1998 fatwa signed by bin laden and others calling for killing of americans are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation pp 61 62 in bin laden s november 2002 letter to america he explicitly stated that al qaeda

of philippines against muslims in moro conflict support for israeli aggression against muslims in lebanon support of russian atrocities against muslims in chechnya pro american governments in middle east who act as your agents being against muslim interests support of indian oppression against muslims in kashmir presence of u s troops in saudi arabia plotz david 2001 what does osama bin laden want slate sanctions against iraq after attacks bin laden and al zawahiri released additional videotapes and audio recordings some of which repeated those reasons for attacks two particularly important publications were bin laden s 2002 letter to america and a 2004 videotape by bin laden bin laden interpreted muhammad as having banned permanent presence of infidels in arabia in 1996 bin laden issued a fatwa calling for american troops to leave saudi arabia in 1998 al qaeda wrote for over seven years united states has been occupying lands of islam in holiest of places arabian peninsula plundering its riches dictating to its rulers humiliating its people terrorizing its neighbors and turning its bases in peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight neighboring muslim peoples in a december 1999 interview bin laden said he felt that americans were too near to mecca and considered this a provocation to entire muslim world one analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without u s troops in saudi arabia al qaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions in 1998 fatwa al qaeda identified iraq sanctions as a reason to kill americans condemning protracted blockade among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against allah his messenger and muslims fatwa declared that ruling to kill americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate al aqsa mosque and holy mosque of mecca from their grip and in order for their americans armies to move out of all lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim see also 1998 al qaeda fatwa ruling to kill americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate al aqsa mosque and holy mosque mecca from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim quoted from in 2004 bin laden claimed that idea of destroying towers had first occurred to him in 1982 when he witnessed israel s bombardment of high rise apartment buildings during 1982 lebanon war summers and swan 2011 pp 211 lawrence 2005 p 239 some analysts including mearsheimer and walt also claimed that u s support of israel was one motive for attacks in 2004 and 2010 bin laden again connected september 11 attacks with u s support of israel although most of letter expressed bin laden s disdain for president bush and bin laden s hope to destroy and bankrupt u s in his taped broadcast from january 2010 bin laden said our attacks against you united states will continue as long as u s support for israel continues message sent to you with attempt by hero nigerian umar farouk is a confirmation of our previous message conveyed by heroes of september 11 quoted from bin laden attacks on u s to go on as long as it supports israel in haaretz com other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin laden and al qaeda some authors suggested humiliation that resulted from islamic world falling behind western world this discrepancy was rendered especially visible by globalization lewis 2004 in bernard lewis s 2004 book crisis of islam holy war and unholy terror he argues that animosity toward west is best understood with decline of once powerful ottoman empire compounded by import of western ideas arab socialism arab liberalism and arab spirit of terrorism jean baudrillard described 9 11 as first global event that questions very process of globalization and a desire to provoke u s into a broader war against islamic world in hope of motivating more allies to support al qaeda similarly others have argued that 9 11 was a strategic move with objective of provoking america into a war that would incite a pan islamic revolution in an essay entitled somebody else s civil war michael scott doran argues attacks are best understood as part of a religious conflict within muslim world and that bin laden s followers consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity hoping that u s retaliation would unite faithful against west bin laden sought to spark revolutions in arab nations and elsewhere doran argues osama bin laden videos attempt to provoke a visceral reaction in middle east and ensure that muslim citizens would react as violently as possible to an increase in u s involvement in their region reprinted in in osama bin laden i know peter bergen argues attacks were part of a plan to cause united states to increase its military and cultural presence in middle east thereby forcing muslims to confront idea of a non muslim government and to eventually establish conservative islamic governments in region planning thumb left alt ground zero and surrounding area as seen from directly above depicting where two

such as u s bank tower in los angeles for lack of time thumb upright diagram showing attacks on world trade center bin laden provided leadership and financial support and was involved in selecting participants he initially selected nawaf al hazmi and khalid al mihdhar both experienced jihadists who had fought in bosnia hazmi and mihdhar arrived in united states in mid january 2000 in early 2000 hazmi and mihdhar took flying lessons in san diego california but both spoke little english performed poorly in flying lessons and eventually served as secondary or muscle hijackers mcdermott 2005 pp 191 92 in late 1999 a group of men from hamburg germany arrived in afghanistan group included mohamed atta marwan al shehhi ziad jarrah and ramzi bin al shibh bin laden selected these men because they were educated could speak english and had experience living in west new recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al qaeda leaders consequently discovered that hani hanjour already had a commercial pilot s license mohammed later said that he helped hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in western clothing hanjour arrived in san diego on december 8 2000 joining hazmi they soon left for arizona where hanjour took refresher training marwan al shehhi arrived at end of may 2000 while atta arrived on june 3 2000 and jarrah arrived on june 27 2000 bin al shibh applied several times for a visa to united states but as a yemeni he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa bin al shibh stayed in hamburg providing coordination between atta and mohammed three hamburg cell members all took pilot training in south florida in spring of 2001 secondary hijackers began arriving in united states in july 2001 atta met with bin al shibh in spain where they coordinated details of plot including final target selection bin al shibh also passed along bin laden s wish for attacks to be carried out as soon as possible some of hijackers received passports from corrupt saudi officials who were family members or used fraudulent passports to gain entry prior intelligence in late 1999 al qaeda associate walid bin attash khallad contacted mihdhar telling him to meet him in kuala lumpur malaysia hazmi and abu bara al yemeni would also be in attendance nsa intercepted a telephone call mentioning meeting mihdhar and name nawaf hazmi while agency feared something nefarious might be afoot it took no further action cia had already been alerted by saudi intelligence about status of mihdhar and hazmi as al qaeda members and a cia team broke into mihdhar s dubai hotel room and discovered that mihdhar had a u s visa while alec station alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact it did not share this information with fbi malaysian special branch observed january 5 2000 meeting of two al qaeda members and informed cia that mihdhar hazmi and khallad were flying to bangkok but cia never notified other agencies of this nor did it ask state department to put mihdhar on its watchlist an fbi liaison to alec station asked permission to inform fbi of meeting but was told this is not a matter for fbi by late june senior counter terrorism official richard clarke and cia director george tenet were convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come although cia believed attacks would likely occur in saudi arabia or israel in early july clarke put domestic agencies on full alert telling them something really spectacular is going to happen here soon he asked fbi and state department to alert embassies and police departments and defense department to go to threat condition delta clarke would later write somewhere in cia there was information that two known al qaeda terrorists had come into united states in fbi there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in united states they had specific information about individual terrorists none of that information got to me or white house on july 13 tom wilshire a cia agent assigned to fbi s international terrorism division emailed his superiors at cia s counterterrorism center ctc requesting permission to inform fbi that hazmi was in country and that mihdhar had a u s visa cia never responded same day in july gillespie an fbi analyst working in ctc was told to review material about malaysia meeting she was not told of participants presence in u s cia gave gillespie surveillance photos of mihdhar and hazmi from meeting to show to fbi counterterrorism but did not tell her their significance database informed her not to share intelligence material on meeting to criminal investigators when shown photos fbi were refused more details on their significance and they were not given mihdhar s date of birth nor passport number in late august 2001 gillespie told ins state department customs service and fbi to put hazmi and mihdhar on their watchlists but fbi was prohibited from using criminal agents in search for duo which hindered their efforts also in july a phoenix based fbi agent sent a message to fbi headquarters alec station and to fbi agents in new york alerting them to possibility of a coordinated effort by osama bin laden to send students to united states to attend civil aviation universities and colleges agent kenneth williams suggested need to interview all flight school managers and

moussaoui who had asked suspicious questions fbi found that moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to pakistan and ins arrested him for overstaying his french visa their request to search his laptop was denied by fbi headquarters due to lack of probable cause failures in intelligence sharing were attributed to 1995 justice department policies limiting intelligence sharing combined with cia and nsa reluctance to reveal sensitive sources and methods such as tapped phones testifying before 9 11 commission in april 2004 then attorney general john ashcroft recalled that single greatest structural cause for september 11th problem was wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents clarke also wrote there were failures in organizations failures to get

investigated collapses of twin towers and 7 wtc investigations examined why buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction investigation into collapse of 1 wtc and 2 wtc was concluded in october 2005 and that of 7 wtc was completed in august 2008 nist found that fireproofing on twin towers steel infrastructures was blown off by initial impact of planes and that had this not occurred towers likely would have remained standing a 2007 study of north tower s collapse published by researchers of purdue university determined that since plane s impact had stripped off much of structure s thermal insulation heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened exposed girders and columns enough to initiate collapse regardless of number of columns cut or damaged by impact director of original investigation stated that towers really did amazingly well terrorist aircraft didn t bring buildings down it was fire which followed it was proven that you could take out two thirds of columns in a tower and building would still stand fires weakened trusses supporting floors making floors sag sagging floors pulled on exterior steel columns causing exterior columns to bow inward with damage to core columns buckling exterior columns could no longer support buildings causing them to collapse additionally report found towers stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above impact zones nist concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7 wtc caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought building down alleged saudi
