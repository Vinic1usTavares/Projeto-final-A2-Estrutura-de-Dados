h lownsdale reserved park blocks for public use in his 1848 platting of portland but didn t actually donate land to city as historian e maccoll stated by no stretch of imagination could he be cited as a philanthropist he was greedy like most of his partners record is clear daniel lownsdale was a visionary but shifty character whose land speculation helped to spawn more litigation in portland than in any other western city of comparable size chet orloff wrote an editorial in 2001 stating six crucial blocks were lost to greed government reluctance poor estate planning and an adverse court decision park land was previously used for surface parking and contained an early food cart institution snow white house developer tom moyer wanted to redevelop block since 1970s city club of portland

space 12 story parking structure in 1995 which was to be called park avenue plaza neil goldschmidt said parking structure would be like putting lipstick on a dead corpse and bill naito said that a 12

portland planning director gil kelley s 2001 recommendation for area which favored a new midtown park block as well as thematically consistent development along blocks foundation raised 500 000 from 20 patrons and had an agreement from building owner joe weston to donate a building to make way for park blocks others including portland chapter of american institute of architects vera katz laurie olin and michael powell of powell s books were against plan with powell saying i was sort of under impression that people came downtown to work and shop not to gain a rural experience by 2004 idea to reunite park blocks through midtown was dead due to neil goldschmidt moving out of spotlight during his sex abuse scandal vera katz s disapproval of plan and because moyer was tired of swimming upstream against city council park was originally titled south park block 5 it was designed by laurie olin and zgf architects olin also designed bryant park in new york as well as redesigns of
