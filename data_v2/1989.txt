s longest and most complex work highly experimental and non linear book lacks traditional narrative transitions and features magic realist storytelling hernandez has stated that his intention was to create an epic a complex graphic novel of luba s life putting everything he possibly had going on in his head into work cold war era political tensions form a prominent backdrop to story in which right wing gangsters and others brutally target leftists such as ofelia and her communist sympathizer friends who burn us president eisenhower in effigy few details of luba s pre palomar life surfaced in earlier stories act of contrition 1984 flashes back to her teenage nightclubbing days and hernandez recreates a panel from these flashbacks in poison river story traces first eighteen years of luba s life known to long time love and rockets fans as bath giver of fictional latin american village of palomar luba rarely takes center stage in narrative rather she provides a focal point around which stories of otherwise unrelated large cast of characters come together characters lives are intertwined in ways they are never aware of an example a terrorist attack forces ofelia luba and ofelia s mother hilda to flee and permanently injures ofelia s back coordinators of attack are associates of peter rio whom luba meets and marries in city luba and hilda eventually make their way to over course of love and rockets hernandez brothers made increasing using of what joseph witek calls uncued closure frequent use of abrupt ellipsis to pack large amounts of narrative into a small number of panels relying on readers to fill in gaps in poison river gaps between panels which readers normally processed unconsciously come to forefront in a slow staccato rhythm panels are crowded with abundant dialogue stretching out their perceived duration in time while transitions from one panel to another are sudden as are transitions from scene to scene which can happen several times per page hernandez limits narrative only to important details showing rapid growth in his characters and situations in limited space rather than relating story in a traditional step by step manner he compresses great a great deal of action into a minimum of panels as in a two panel sequence which critic jordan raphael says delineates both entirety action and consequences of a shootout between rival gangs even as reveals each character s guiding motivation narrative s chronology is fluid with frequent jumps in time such as an uncued 16 page flashback sequence hernandez avoids using captions leaving such jumps to reader to sort out copious compact dialogue gives reader an impression of what is going on at a given moment but filtered through speaker poison rivers dark tone and chauvinistic male dominated social background set it apart from hernandez s earlier stories while women take prominent roles in social and political life of palomar a patriarchal mood dominates poison rivers crime ridden cities men exclude women from men s decision making and shield them from larger social issues such as controversies regarding abortion which peter insists should not be discussed in luba s presence hernandez renders his cartoons in a high contrast balance of blacks and whites with a line jordan described as alternatively loose and tight his expressionistic style ranges from naturalism to exaggerated cartoon distortion a highly stylized approach that nonetheless captures nuances of expression and individuality of his characters features stronger emotion his characters express more exaggerated and cartoony drawing becomes his style assimilates an eclectic variety of influences from comic strips and both mainstream and underground comics drawing most strongly from dynamic cartooning of harvey kurtzman steve ditko and robert crumb reception and legacy poison river has earned a reputation as hernandez s most complex and difficult work readers of love and rockets found story s complexity and non linearity confusing and hard to follow new readers to love and rockets had an especially difficult time orienting themselves to story during serialization hernandez turned to other outlets to take pressure off completing poison river such as in pornographic birdland series in which two dimensional carefree characters have promiscuous sex without fear of aids or pregnancy poor reader reception of poison river contributed to hernandez brothers decision to bring love and rockets to an end in 1996 by which point gilbert had already returned to more self contained palomar stories that were easier for a serial readership to consume during poison rivers serialization love and rockets was among a number of publications marked adults only and wrapped in plastic that were seized by south african vice squad it was cited for nudity and explicit sex judgment found it indecent under section 47 2 a of south african publications act 42 of 1974 and declared there appears to be no merit to it and that it would transgress tolerance of reader who will regard this as a blatant intrusion upon privacy of human body as well as sex act thumb upright alt gilbert hernandez in 2010 hernandez found serialization an impediment to type of storytelling he was attempting with poison river since its completion he has chosen to serialize certain works such as julio s day 2012 and me for unknown in second volume of love and rockets and to publish others as stand alone graphic novels such as sloth 2006 and chance in hell 2007 in 2013 hernandez returned to story of maria with maria m volumes in which takes a approach with luba s half sister fritz re enacting their mother s life in a b movie critic anne rubenstein found jumps in time and physical similarity of many characters many related to each other to be particularly hard to keep track of especially compared to love and rockets x whose chronology was straightforward and whose characters were much easier to tell apart visually tight plot she says was particularly demanding for readers as careless reading early on could easily result in a lack of understanding later teachers such as derek parker royal have commented that their students are often confused by or resistant to complexity of poison river latin american cultural references largely unfamiliar to english speaking audiences such as to lucha libre frida kahlo and memin pinguin may also have played in a role in book s cold reception in 1997 publishers weekly described work as an epic latin american melodrama of lost identity political violence and polymorphous sexuality whose complex plotting is occasionally confusing but with characterizations dialogue and relationships that are vividly emotionally engaging charles hatfield
