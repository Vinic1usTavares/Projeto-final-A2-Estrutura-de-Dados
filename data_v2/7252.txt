screen programmer greg omi developed a method of rendering tires as camera based two dimensional sprites turbo system that gives player boosts of speed during power slides and by gathering hang time was added to make crash team racing feel more interactive and involving than older kart racing games central antagonist character oxide was never intended to be playable in game due to playstation

in promotion of game a playable demonstration was included on a promotional compilation disc released by pizza hut on november 14 1999 reception crash team racing received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator metacritic official playstation magazine described crash team racing as game that made kart racing cool and proclaimed that nothing has ever matched its quality electronic gaming monthly noted that game was heavily inspired by mario kart but still an amazing multiplayer racer doug perry of ign stated that game was rock solid in playability and graphics but was critical of insanely smile of crash jeff gerstmann of gamespot called game a great mario kart clone and that it succeeded where similar games like mega man battle chase bomberman fantasy race diddy kong racing chocobo racing and mario kart had failed johnny liu of game revolution concluded that despite fact that game doesn t add much to tired genre it manages to do everything well game s controls were well received d pad destroyer of gamepro praised controls as nearly perfect and explained that transparent controls allow you to concentrate on racing and blasting your opponents and so races are faster more fluid and more fun johnny liu of game revolution concluded that controls feel very natural with an emphasis on maintaining speed rather than fighting lousy controls however joe ottoson of allgame all game guide at time said that inability to reconfigure controls was only real drawback to crash s presentation graphics of game were positively received d pad destroyer of gamepro while noting that graphics were not too complex cited cartoony look and ingenious use of textures and colors as high points in graphics department doug perry of ign commended sharp looking environments as clean and fully formed and characters are full of funny animations and cleanly designed jeff gerstmann of gamespot said that environments are reasonably large and they convey cartoon like attitude of game very nicely johnny liu of game revolution stated that graphics were smooth and seem to push playstation s limits critics expressed mixed opinions of game s audio d pad destroyer of gamepro said that whimsical background music is quite enjoyable and character sound bites are varied enough to avoid becoming annoying doug perry of ign had a more mixed take saying that classic bouncy xylophone heavy beat is not necessarily great and that after a few courses you either stop hearing it or incessant simplicity of it makes you want to cry or pull your hair out on subject of voice acting he concluded that there is nothing really that cute clever or memorable in game and noted that crash s voice in game is extremely similar to that of luigi from mario kart series jeff gerstmann of gamespot wrote that while music and sound effects push game s cartoon theme themes were not too over top or incessant johnny liu of game revolution passed music off as standard kitschy fare and added that while sound effects add to cartoon quality of game some of character voices were unsatisfactory joe ottoson of allgame noted that characters are all quite vocal and music sets off whimsical mood nicely crash team racing has sold 1 90 million units in united states and over 300 000 units in japan as a result of its success game was re released for sony greatest hits line up in
