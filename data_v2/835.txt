razed this condition was accepted by japanese commander and sudirman and his troops began searching for rebels although kusaeri s men initially shot at commander after sudirman used a loudspeaker to tell them they would not be harmed they backed down kusaeri surrendered on 25 april this garnered support for sudirman within occupation forces although several high ranking japanese officers expressed concern over sudirman s support for indonesian independence sudirman and his men were soon sent to a camp in bogor ostensibly for training however they were tasked with hard labour as a way

instead offering to lead forces in kroya he left for his former command on 19 august 1945 at same time allied forces were in process of retaking indonesian archipelago for netherlands first british forces arrived on 8 september 1945 in late august sukarno established people s safety bureau or bkr which united troops from former peta heiho and knil bkr served mostly as a police organisation partly because political leadership were intent on using diplomacy to garner international recognition of new country and partly to avoid appearing overly aggressive to japanese forces still in archipelago sudirman and several of his fellow peta soldiers formed a bkr branch in banyumas in late august after stopping at kroya and discovering that his battalion had been disbanded in a meeting with japanese commander for region saburo tamura and resident of banyumas sudirman and forced japanese to surrender and hand over their weapons while a crowd of armed indonesians encircled japanese camp many of these weapons were later used by sudirman s bkr unit making it one of best equipped in country surplus weapons were distributed to other battalions as newly independent nation did not yet

to serve as chief of staff under him in accordance with his new role sudirman was promoted to general after meeting sudirman returned to banyumas to await confirmation as leader of tkr and began developing strategies on how repel allied advances indonesians feared that dutch through netherlands indies civil administration or nica would attempt to retake archipelago soldiers of dutch british alliance had landed in java in september and a large battle had occurred in surabaya during late october and early november this instability as well as sukarno s uncertainty about sudirman s qualifications led to a delay in sudirman s confirmation while waiting for his appointment to be confirmed in late november sudirman ordered fifth division to attack allied forces stationed in ambarawa once again with isdiman in charge city was considered strategically important owing to its military barracks and training facilities dating from colonial period this assault was countered by an air strike and use of tanks which forced division to retreat isdiman died in battle killed by a strafing p 51 mustang sudirman then led division in another assault against allied forces indonesian troops were armed with a variety of weapons ranging from bamboo spears and confiscated katanas to rifles while british were armed with modern equipment sudirman led from front wielding a katana allies

attention at a national level and generally silenced whispers that he was unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher ultimately sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted while oerip s former pledge of loyalty to dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion sudirman was confirmed as commander of armed forces on 18 december 1945 he was replaced as head of fifth division by colonel and began to focus on strategic problems this was done partly by establishing a board of advisors which gave general advice on both political and military issues oerip handled many of military matters together sudirman and oerip were able to reduce differences and mistrust between former knil and peta troops although some troops were reluctant to be subordinated to a central command instead choosing to follow their popularly selected battalion commanders government renamed army twice in january 1946 first to peoples salvation armed forces then to republic of indonesia military forces or tri this was followed by formal establishment of a navy and air force in early 1946 in meantime indonesian government had moved from

military for political disappointed both sudirman and oerip who were at time busy ensuring equal treatment for soldiers from different military backgrounds however rumours among populace had spread that sudirman was preparing for a coup d etat although an attempt did occur in early july 1946 sudirman s role if any is not certain in july sudirman addressed these rumours through a speech broadcast on radio republik indonesia rri stating that he like all indonesians was a servant of state and that if he were offered presidency he would refuse it in his later career he stated that military had no

himself obliged to follow his orders in early 1947 with linggadjati agreement granting relative peace sudirman began work on consolidating tkr with various laskar as part of a committee sudirman began reorganising military they reached an agreement in may 1947 and on 3 june 1947 indonesian national armed forces or tni was formalised it consisted of tkr forces and various laskar groups which

be commander in chief shortly afterwards sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in renville agreement and new prime minister mohammad hatta worked to implement rationalisation programme this led to a several months long debate between pro and anti rationalisation groups sudirman served as a rallying point and driving force for soldiers including numerous older commanders who were against programme sudirman was formally reinstated on 1 june 1946 upon which he effectively rescinded command to rationalise he chose colonel abdul haris nasution as his deputy but remained a lieutenant general as rationalisation programme was winding down sjarifuddin began gathering soldiers from socialist party communist party and members of all indonesia centre of

hope that it would stop spread of disease during his time at hospital he delegated most of his duties to nasution however two continued to discuss plans for war against dutch and sudirman continued to receive status reports they agreed that guerrilla warfare which had been applied on raids into dutch held territory since may would be best suited for their needs towards this goal sudirman issued a general order on 11 november with nasution handling most of preparations sudirman was released from hospital on 28 november 1948 although he continued to issue orders sudirman only returned to active

he and his group travelled east along south coast to before dutch attack it had already been decided that sudirman would be able to better control guerrillas from eastern java where there were still

were suspicious as sudirman s convoy carried maps and notes on indonesian military movements things which may have belonged to spies when group s commander major zainal fanani came to check situation he realised that sudirman was with them and apologised told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently fanani called a post in kediri and ordered that a car be sent to pick up general and his troops after a time in kediri they continued further east as they left city on 24 december dutch planes attacked kediri constant dutch attacks led sudirman perhaps at suggestion of one of his men

set to convey orders to local tni troops if he believed that region was secure feeling weaker because of physical hardships he had faced including travelling through forests and a lack of food and believing area to be safe sudirman decided that sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters local commander lieutenant colonel hutagalung served as his go between with other tni leaders aware that international opinion which was beginning to condemn dutch actions in indonesia could bring indonesia greater recognition sudirman and hutagalung discussed possible terms of action before agreeing on a large scale assault meanwhile dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured sudirman this claim was intended to break morale of guerrillas sudirman ordered hutagalung to begin planning a full scale assault in which tni soldiers in uniform would attack dutch and show their strength in front of foreign reporters and united nations investigative teams hutagalung together with officers under his commander colonel bambang sugeng and government officials under governor spent several days discussing ways to ensure attack could be successful discussion may have resulted in general offensive of 1 march 1949 which saw tni soldiers attack dutch outposts throughout central java troops under lieutenant colonel suharto retook yogyakarta for six hours before withdrawing a

and his group returned to yogyakarta where they were greeted by thousands of civilians and warmly received by political elite there reporter rosihan anwar who was present when letter was delivered wrote in 1973 that sudirman had to return to yogyakarta to avoid any perceptions of a rift among republic s top leaders post war and death in early august sudirman approached sukarno and asked him to continue guerrilla war sudirman did not expect dutch to abide by roem agreement based on failings of previous agreements sukarno disagreed which was a blow to sudirman when sudirman threatened to resign his post blaming government s inconsistency for his tuberculosis and oerip s death in november 1948 sukarno threatened to do so as well as he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect sudirman stayed his hand and a java wide cease fire came into effect on 11 august 1949 continuing to suffer from tuberculosis sudirman was checked into panti rapih hospital where
