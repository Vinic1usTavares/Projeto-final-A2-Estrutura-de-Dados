inter continental ideologies self respect movement also came under influence of leftist philosophies and institutions e v ramasamy after establishing self respect movement as an independent institution began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially to accomplish this he studied history and politics of different countries and personally observed these systems at work e v ramasamy toured malaya for a month from december 1929 to january 1930 to propagate self respect philosophy embarking on his journey from nagapattinam with his wife and his followers e v ramasamy was

ills of country thus on socio economic issues periyar was marxist but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership diehl p 69 immediately after his return e v ramasamy in alliance with enthusiastic communist m began to work out a socio political scheme incorporating socialist and self respect ideals this marked a crucial stage of development in self respect movement which got politicised and found its compatibility in tamil nadu opposition to hindi in 1937 when chakravarthi rajagopalachari became chief minister of madras presidency he introduced hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools thereby igniting a series of anti hindi agitations tamil nationalists justice party under sir a t and e v ramasamy organised anti hindi protests in 1938 which ended with numerous arrests by rajaji government during same year slogan tamil nadu for tamilians saraswathi pp 118 119 was first used by e v ramasamy in protest against introduction of hindi in schools he claimed that introduction of hindi was a dangerous mechanism used by aryans to infiltrate dravidian culture he reasoned that adoption of hindi would make tamils subordinate to hindi speaking north indians e v ramasamy claimed that hindi would not only halt progress of tamil people but would also completely destroy their culture and nullify progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through tamil in recent decades cutting across party lines south indian politicians rallied together in their opposition to hindi saraswathi pp 88 89 there were recurrent anti hindi agitations in 1948 1952 and 1965 diehl p 79 as president of justice party 1938 1944 a political party known as south indian libertarian federation commonly referred to as justice party was founded in 1916 principally to oppose economic and political power of brahmin groups party s goal was to render social justice to non brahmin groups to gain support of masses non brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non brahmin castes brahmanical priesthood and sanskritic social class value hierarchy were blamed for existence of inequalities among non brahmin caste groups in 1937 when government required that hindi be taught in school system e v ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through justice party after 1937 dravidian movement derived considerable support from student community in later years opposition to hindi played a big role in politics of tamil nadu fear of hindi language had its origin in conflict between brahmins and non brahmins to tamils acceptance of hindi in school system was a form of bondage when justice party weakened in absence of mass support e v ramasamy took over leadership of party after being jailed for opposing hindi in 1939 under his tutelage party prospered but party s conservative members most of whom were rich and educated withdrew from active participation dravidar kazhagam 1944 onwards formation of dravidar kazhagam at a rally in 1944 periyar in his capacity as leader of justice party declared that party would henceforth be known as dravidar kazhagam or dravidian association however a few who disagreed with periyar started a splinter group claiming to be original justice party this party was led by veteran justice party leader p t rajan and survived until 1957 dravidar kazhagam came to be well known among urban communities and students villages were influenced by its message hindi and ceremonies that had become associated with brahmanical priesthood were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from tamil culture brahmins who were regarded as guardians of such symbols came under verbal attack from 1949 onwards dravidar kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward fact that superstitions were cause for degeneration of dravidians dravidar kazhagam vehemently fought for abolition of untouchability amongst dalits it also focused its attention on liberation of women women s education willing marriage widow marriage orphanages and mercy homes international tamil language foundation 2000 of tamil culture and heritage chicago p 1346 split with annadurai in 1949 e v ramasamy s chief lieutenant natarajan annadurai established a separate association called dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk or dravidian progressive federation this was due to differences between two while periyar advocated a separate independent dravidian or tamil state annadurai compromised with delhi government at same time claiming increased state independence diehl p 29 e v ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake task of eradicating social evils in indian sub continent have to pursue goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from path and with uncompromising zeal thus if they contest elections aiming to assume political power they would lose vigour and a sense of purpose but among his followers there were those who had a different view wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running government they were looking for an opportunity to part with e v ramasamy thus when e v ramasamy married maniammai on 9 july 1948 they quit dravidar kazhagam stating that e v ramasamy married who was daughter of when he was 70 and she 32 those who parted company with e v ramasamy joined dmk though dmk split from dravidar kazhagam organisation made efforts to carry on e v ramasamy s self respect movement to villagers and urban students dmk advocated thesis that tamil language was much richer than sanskrit and hindi in content and thus was a key which opened door to subjects to be learned dravidar kazhagam continued to counter brahminism indo aryan propaganda and uphold dravidians right of self determination geetha v s v 1987 towards a non brahmin

advocate eradication of caste system in his last meeting at nagar chennai on 19 december 1973 periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life on 24 december 1973 periyar died at age of 94 principles and legacy periyar spent over fifty years giving speeches propagating realisation that everyone is an equal citizen and differences on basis of caste and creed were man made to keep innocent and ignorant as underdogs in society although periyar s speeches were targeted towards illiterate and more mundane masses scores of educated people were also swayed gopalakrishnan pp 59 60 periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool according to him all were blessed with this tool but very few used it thus periyar used reasoning with respect to subjects of social interest in his presentations to his audiences communal differences in tamil society were considered by many to be deep rooted features until periyar came to scene gopalakrishnan pp 45 49 rationalism bedrock of e v ramasamy s principles and movements that he started was rationalism he thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting majority and trying to keep it in a subordinate position forever he wanted exploited to sit up and think about their position and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people if they started thinking they would realise that they were human beings like rest that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot likewise e v ramasamy explained that wisdom lies in thinking and that spear head of thinking is rationalism on caste he stated that no other living being harms or degrades its own class but man said to be a rational living being does these evils differences hatred enmity degradation poverty and wickedness now prevalent in society are due to lack of wisdom and rationalism and not due to god or cruelty of time e v ramasamy had written in his books and magazines dozens of times of various occasions that british rule is better than self 2005 p 511 e v ramasamy also blamed capitalists for their control of creating difficulties for workers according to his philosophy rationalism which has to lead way for peaceful life to all had resulted in causing poverty and worries to people because of dominating forces he stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self respect or scientific knowledge an example he gave was west sending messages to planets while tamil society in india were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through brahmins in a message to brahmin community periyar stated in name of god religion and you have duped us we were ruling people stop this life of cheating us from this year give room for rationalism and humanism veeramani 2005 p 504 he added that any opposition not based on rationalism science or experience will one day or another reveal fraud selfishness lies and conspiracies self respect periyar s philosophy of self respect was based on his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one his philosophy preaches that human actions should be based on rational thinking further outcome of natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery thus philosophy of self respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under all circumstances freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered right by human beings on basis of reason there is not much difference between freedom and self respect saraswathi p 2 periyar s foremost appeal to people was to develop self respect he preached that brahmins had monopolised and cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self respect he stated that most brahmins claimed to belong to a superior community with reserved privilege of being in charge of temples and performing he felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by using their superior caste status to claim exclusive privilege to touch idols or enter sanctum sanctorum women s rights as a rationalist and ardent social reformer periyar advocated forcefully throughout his life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as equals of men and that they should be given good education and have right to property he thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women he was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country gopalakrishnan p 70 periyar fought against orthodox traditions of marriage as suppression of women in tamil nadu and throughout indian sub continent though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life it was manipulated to enslave women veeramani 1992 p 22 much worse was practice of child marriages practised throughout india at time it was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty veeramani 1992 p 37 another practice which is prevalent today is dowry system where bride s family is supposed to give husband a huge payment for bride purpose of this was to assist newly wedded couple financially but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms outcome of this abuse turned to exploitation of bride s parents wealth and in certain circumstances lead to dowry deaths veeramani 1992 p 65 there have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered mutilated and burned alive because father of bride was unable to make dowry payment to husband periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women veeramani 1992 p 50 women in india also did not have rights to their families or husbands property periyar fought fiercely for this and also advocated for women to have right to separate or divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances while birth control remained taboo in society of periyar s time he advocated for it not only for health of women and population control but for liberation of women veeramani 2005 p 570 he criticised hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued that it should either apply also to men or not at all for both genders veeramani 1992 p 41 while fighting against this periyar advocated getting rid of devadasi system in his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for entertainment of others and as temple prostitutes gopalakrishnan p 32 further for liberation of women periyar pushed for their right to have an education and to join armed services and police force veeramani 1992 p 45 according to biographer m d gopalakrishnan periyar and his movement achieved a better status for women in tamil society periyar held that in matters of education and employment there should be no difference between men and women gopalakrishnan states that periyar s influence in state departments and even center made it possible for women to join police departments and army periyar also spoke out against child marriage talks about inflation sc leaders in tamil nadu have for long accused periyar of saying contemptuously in a meeting that cloth prices had gone up because lower caste women started wearing jackets in 1963 many magazines in tamil nadu reported this speech anbu a venerated historian who had meticulously documented lives of sc leaders and spiritual personalities had written that as a keen observer of periyar from 1939 he was one of those who were shocked when he heard periyar claiming that lower caste women wearing jackets and lower caste men becoming literate were reasons for rise in cloth prices and unemployment 2 march 1963 a chennai based magazine ambedkar in its 1963 november december issue pointed out that sc leaders had strongly condemned evr s statement proof for statement came from themselves when dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk magazine published a cartoon highlighting anti sc mindset of periyar social reform and eradication of caste periyar wanted thinking people to see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform he wanted government political parties and social workers to identify evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them gopalakrishnan p 66 periyar s philosophy did not differentiate social and political service saraswathi pp 164 165 according to him first duty of a government is to run social organisation efficiently and philosophy of religion was to organise social system periyar stated that while christian and islamic religions were fulfilling this role hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress he argued that government was not for people but in a topsy turvy manner people were for government he attributed this situation to state of social system contrived for advantage of a small group of people one of areas of periyar s focus was on upliftment of rural communities in a booklet called village uplift periyar pleaded for rural reform at that time rural india still formed largest part of indian subcontinent in spite of ongoing process of urbanisation thus distinction between rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants periyar wanted to eradicate concept of village as a discrimination word among places just as concept of outcast among social groups periyar advocated for a location where neither name nor situation or its conditions imply differences among people diehl p 68 he further advocated for modernisation of villages by providing public facilities such as schools libraries radio stations roads bus transport and police stations saraswathi p 193 periyar felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions to dominate indian society so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally according to periyar a self respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this menace gopalakrishnan pp 60 61 periyar stated that caste system in south india is due to indo aryan influence linked with arrival of brahmins from north ancient tamil nadu part of had a different stratification of society in four or five regions determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living diehl p 61 periyar also argued that birds animals and worms which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes or differences of high and low in their own species but man considered to be a rational being was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination veeramani 2005 pp 72 73 equality village social equality system introduced by government of tamil nadu in late 1990s is named after ramasamy tamil language and writing periyar claimed that tamil telugu malayalam and kannada came from same mother language of old tamil he explained that tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different dravidian states nevertheless current understanding of dravidian languages contradicts such claims for example currently known classification of dravidian languages provides following distinct classes southern including tamil malayalam kannada and central including telugu kui and and northern including and with relation to writing periyar stated that using tamil script about arts which are useful to people in their life and foster knowledge talent and courage and propagating them among masses will enlighten people further he explained that it will enrich language and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for tamil veeramani 2005 pp 550 552 periyar also stated that if words of north indian origin sanskrit are removed from telugu kannada and malayalam only tamil will be left on brahmin usage of tamil he stated that tamil spoken by andhras and malayali people was far better than tamil spoken by brahmins periyar believed that tamil language will make dravidian people unite under banner of tamil culture and that it will make kannadigas andhras and malayalees be vigilant with regards to a dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language periyar stated that a time will come for unity this will go on until there is an end to north indian domination we shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us veeramani 2005 p 503 at same time periyar was also known to have made controversial remarks on tamil language and people from time to time on one occasion he referred to tamil people as barbarians and tamil language as language of barbarians however anita diehl explains that periyar made these remarks on tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms periyar s ideas on tamil alphabet reforms included those such as reasons for vowel ii i having a cursive and looped representation of short form i i in stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago many tamil letters are found in other shapes as a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters reduce number of letters and alter a few signs he further explained that older and more divine a language and its letters were said to be more they needed reform because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into tamil quite easily just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in kaa kee ka ke periyar questioned why other compound characters like ki kii ku kuu ki ki ku ku indicated integrally as of now shouldn t also have separate signs further changing shape of letters creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly dropping those that are redundant were quite essential according to periyar thus glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else thoughts on thirukkural periyar hailed thirukkural as a valuable scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths he also praised secular nature of work periyar praised thiruvalluvar for his description of god as a formless entity with only positive attributes he also suggested that one who reads thirukkural will become a self respecter absorbing knowledge in politics society and economics according to him though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today it permitted such changes for modern society veeramani 2005 pp 505 508 on caste he believed that kural illustrates how vedic laws of manu were against sudras and other communities of dravidian race on other hand periyar opined that ethics from kural was comparable to christian bible dravidar kazhagam adopted thirukkural and advocated that thiruvalluvar s kural alone was enough to educate people of country one of periyar s quotes on thirukkural from veeramani s collected works of periyar was when dravida nadu was a victim to indo aryan deceit thirukkural was written by a great dravidian thiruvalluvar to free dravidians periyar also asserted that due to secular nature of thirukkural it has capacity to be common book of faith for all humanity and can be kept on par or above holy books of all religions self determination of dravida nadu thumb 350px periyar with muhammad ali jinnah and b r ambedkar dravidian aryan conflict was believed to be a continuous historical phenomenon that started when aryans first set their foot in dravidian lands even a decade before idea of separation appeared periyar stated that as long as aryan religion indo aryan domination propagation of aryan vedas and aryan existed there was need for a dravidian progressive movement and a self respect movement saraswathi pp 89 90 periyar became very concerned about growing north indian domination over south which appeared to him no different from foreign domination he wanted to secure fruits of labour of dravidians to dravidians and lamented that fields such as political economic industrial social art and spiritual were dominated by north for benefit of north indians thus with approach of independence from britain this fear that north india would take place of britain to dominate south india became more and more intense saraswathi p 95 periyar was clear about concept of a separate nation comprising tamil areas that is part of then existing madras presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities including religious linguistic and cultural freedom of people a separatist conference was held in june 1940 at kanchipuram when periyar released map of proposed dravida nadu but failed to get british approval on contrary periyar received sympathy and support from people such as bhimrao ramji ambedkar and muhammad ali jinnah for his views on congress and for his opposition to hindi they then decided to convene a movement to resist congress concept of dravida nadu was later modified down to tamil nadu saraswathi p 98 this led to a proposal for a union of tamil people of not only south india but including those of ceylon as well ghurye g s 1961 caste class and occupation popular book depot bombay p 318 in 1953 periyar helped to preserve madras as capital of tamil nadu which later was name he substituted for more general dravida nadu diehl p 76 in 1955 periyar threatened to burn national flag but on chief minister kamaraj s pledge that hindi should not be made compulsory he postponed action in his speech of 1957 called tamil nadu en why an independent tamil nadu he criticised central government of india inducing thousands of tamilians to burn constitution of india reason for this action was that periyar held government responsible for maintaining caste system after stating reasons for separation and turning down opinions against it he closed his speech with a war cry to join and burn map of india on 5 june periyar was sentenced to six months imprisonment for burning indian constitution diehl p 30 advocacy of such a nation became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957 regardless of these measures a dravida nadu separation day was observed on 17 september 1960 resulting in numerous arrests bhaskaran r 1967 sociology of politics tradition of politics in india asia publishing house new york p 48 however periyar resumed his campaign in 1968 he wrote an editorial on tamil nadu for tamilians in which he stated that by nationalism only brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish rights of tamils he advocated that there was need to establish a tamil nadu freedom organization and that it was necessary to work towards it saraswathi p 9 anti brahmanism vs anti brahmin periyar was a radical advocate of anti brahmanism periyar s ideology of anti brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti brahmin even a non brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism periyar called on both brahmins and non brahmins to shun brahmanism in 1920 when justice party came to power brahmins occupied about 70 percent of high level posts in government after reservation was introduced by justice party it reversed this trend allowing non brahmins to rise in government of madras presidency periyar through justice party advocated against imbalance of domination of brahmins who constituted only 3 percent of population over government jobs judiciary and madras university his self respect movement espoused rationalism and atheism and movement had currents of anti brahminism furthermore periyar stated that our dravidian movement does not exist against brahmins or banias a north indian merchant caste if anyone thinks so i would only pity him but we will not tolerate ways in which brahminism and is degrading whatever support they may have from government neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice veeramani 2005 p 495 periyar also criticised bharathi in journal for portraying mother tamil as a sister of sanskrit in his poems they say bharati is an immortal poet even if a rat dies in an they would declare it to be immortal of tamilnadu praises him why should this be so supposedly because he sang fulsome praises of tamil and tamilnadu what else could he sing his own mother tongue sanskrit has been dead for years what other language did he know he cannot sing in sanskrit he says tamilnadu is land of comparisons with gandhi in vaikom satyagraha of 1924 periyar and gandhi ji both cooperated and confronted each other in socio political action periyar and his followers emphasised difference in point of view between gandhi and himself on social issues such as fighting untouchability laws and eradication of caste system according to booklet gandhi and periyar periyar wrote in his paper kudi arasu in 1925 reporting on fact that gandhi was ousted from because he opposed resolutions for maintaining of caste and untouchability laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about hindu muslim unity from this gandhi learned need for pleasing brahmins if anything was to be achieved diehl pp 86 88 in his references to gandhi used opportunities to present gandhi as on principle serving interests of brahmins in 1927 periyar and gandhi met at bangalore to discuss this matter main difference between them came out when periyar stood for total eradication of hinduism to which gandhi objected saying that hinduism is not fixed in doctrines but can be changed in kudi arasu periyar explained that with all his good qualities gandhi did not bring people forward from foolish and evil ways his murderer was an educated man therefore nobody can say this is a time of high culture if you eat poison you will die if electricity hits body you will die if you oppose brahmin you will die gandhi did not advocate eradication of dharma structure but sees in it a task for of society and social change possible within its structure consequence of this would be continued high caste leadership gandhi adapted brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership gandhi accepted karma in sense that untouchables reap reward of their karma but was against discrimination against them using term harijans as shown in negotiations at vaikom his methods for abolishing discrimination were to stress on orthodox inhumane treatment of untouchables to secure voluntary lifting of ban by changing hearts of caste hindus and to work within a hindu framework of ideas on temple entry issue gandhi never advocated opening of garbha griha to harijans in consequence of his hindu belief these sources which can be labelled pro periyar with exception of m and d s sharma clearly show that periyar and his followers emphasised that periyar was real fighter for removal of untouchability and true upliftment of whereas gandhi was not this did not prevent periyar from having faith in gandhi on certain matters religion and atheism thumb periyar e v ramasamy periyar was generally regarded as a pragmatic propagandist who attacked evils of religious influence on society mainly what he regarded as brahmin domination at a young age he felt that some people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and regarded it as his life s mission to warn people against superstitions and priests anita diehl explains that periyar cannot be called an atheist philosopher periyar however qualified what term atheist implies in his address on philosophy he repudiated term as without real sense talk of atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous thing i call god that makes all people equal and free god that does not stop free thinking and research god that does not ask for money flattery and temples can certainly be an object of worship for saying this much i have been called an atheist a term that has no meaning evr periyar a born hindu vehemently opposed hinduism and christianity he did not criticize islam anita diehl explains that periyar saw faith as compatible with social equality and did not oppose religion itself diehl p 16 in a book on revolution published in 1961 periyar stated be of help to people do not use treachery or deceit speak truth and do not cheat that indeed is service to god diehl p 58 on hinduism periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book gita or origins but an imaginary faith preaching superiority of brahmins inferiority of shudras and untouchability of dalits maria misra a lecturer at oxford university compares him to philosophes stating his contemptuous attitude to baleful influence of hinduism in indian public life is strikingly akin to anti catholic diatribes of enlightenment philosophes misra maria 2008 vishnu s crowded temple india since great rebellion new haven yale university press p 181 in 1955 periyar was arrested for his public action of burning pictures of rama in public places as a symbolic protest against indo aryan domination and degradation of dravidian leadership according to ramayana epic periyar also shoed images of krishna and rama stating that they were aryan gods that considered dravidian shudras to be sons of prostitutes veeramani 2005 pp 218 219 periyar openly suggested to those who were marginalised within hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as islam christianity or buddhism on islam he stated how it was good for abolishing disgrace in human relationship based on one of his speeches to railway employees at tiruchirapalli in 1947 periyar also commended islam for its belief in one invisible and formless god for proclaiming equal rights for men and women and for advocating social unity diehl p 52 at rally in periyar said muslims are following ancient philosophies of dravidians arabic word for dravidian religion is islam when brahmanism was imposed in this country it was mohammad nabi who opposed it by instilling dravidian religion s policies as islam in minds of people periyar viewed christianity as similar to monotheistic faith of islam he explained that christian faith says that there can be only one god which has no name or shape periyar took an interest in martin luther both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of european reformer thus christian views as expressed for example in precepts of jesus 1820 by ram mohan roy had at least an indirect influence on periyar diehl p 92 apart from islam and christianity periyar also found in buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion it was again an alternative in search for self respect and object was to get liberation from discrimination of hinduism saraswathi p 125 through periyar s movement temple entry acts of 1924 1931 and up to 1950 were created for non brahmins another accomplishment took place during 1970s when tamil replaced sanskrit as temple language in tamil nadu while dalits finally became eligible for priesthood controversies factionism in justice party when b munuswamy naidu became chief minister of madras presidency in 1930 he endorsed inclusion of brahmins in justice party saying so long as we exclude one community we cannot as a political speak on behalf of or claim to represent all people of our presidency if as we hope provincial autonomy is given to provinces as a result of reforms that may be granted it should be essential that our federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities what objection can there be to admit such brahmins as are willing to subscribe to aims and objects of our federation it may be that brahmins may not join even if ban is removed but surely our federation will not thereafter be open to objection on ground that it is an exclusive organisation ralhan p 166 though certain members supported resolution a faction in justice party known as ginger group opposed resolution and eventually voted it down periyar who was then an observer in justice party criticised munuswamy naidu saying at a time when non brahmins in other parties were gradually coming over to justice party being fed up with brahmin s methods and ways of dealing with political questions it was nothing short of folly to think of admitting him into ranks of justice party this factionism continued until 1932 when munuswamy naidu stepped down as chief minister of madras and raja of became chief minister ralhan p 197 followers and influence thumb left 290px mgr paying respects to periyar s mortal remains after death of periyar in 1973 conferences were held
