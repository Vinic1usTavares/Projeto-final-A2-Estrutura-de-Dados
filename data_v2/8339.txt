is an arcade game released by nintendo in 1981 an early example of platform game genre gameplay focuses on maneuvering main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles in game mario originally named mr video and then jumpman must rescue a damsel in distress named pauline originally named lady from a giant ape named donkey kong hero and ape later became two of nintendo s most popular and recognizable characters donkey kong is one of most important games from golden age of arcade video games as well as one of most popular arcade games of all time game was latest in a series of efforts by nintendo to break into north american market hiroshi yamauchi nintendo s president at time assigned project to a first time video game designer named shigeru miyamoto drawing from a wide range of inspirations including popeye beauty and beast and king kong miyamoto developed scenario and designed game alongside nintendo s chief engineer gunpei yokoi two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization including cutscenes to advance game s plot and integrating multiple stages into gameplay although nintendo s american staff was initially apprehensive donkey kong succeeded commercially and critically in north america and japan nintendo licensed game to coleco who developed home console versions for numerous platforms other companies cloned nintendo s hit and avoided royalties altogether miyamoto s characters appeared on cereal boxes television cartoons and dozens of other places a lawsuit brought on by universal city studios later universal studios alleging donkey kong violated its trademark of king kong ultimately failed success of donkey kong and nintendo s victory in courtroom helped to position company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until late 1990s gameplay thumb left gameplay of donkey kong in first stage with mario holding a hammer following 1980 s space panic donkey kong is one of earliest examples of platform game genre even prior to term being coined u s gaming press used climbing game for games with platforms and ladders as first platform game to feature jumping donkey kong requires player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies setting template for future of platform genre with its four unique stages donkey kong was most complex arcade game at time of its release and one of first arcade games to feature multiple stages following 1980 s phoenix and 1981 s and scramble competitive video gamers and referees stress game s high level of difficulty compared to other classic arcade games winning game requires patience and ability to accurately time mario s ascent in addition to presenting goal of saving pauline game also gives player a score points are awarded for following leaping over obstacles destroying objects with a hammer power up collecting items such as hats parasols and purses presumably belonging to pauline removing rivets from platforms and completing each stage determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for 7 000 points although this can be modified via game s built in dip switches one life is lost whenever mario touches donkey kong or any enemy object falls too far through a gap or off end of a platform or lets bonus counter reach zero game is divided into four different single screen stages each represents 25 meters of structure donkey kong has climbed one stage being 25 meters higher than previous final stage occurs at 100 meters stage one involves mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by donkey kong stage two involves climbing a five story structure of conveyor belts each of which transport cement pans third stage involves player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs fourth and final stage requires mario to remove eight rivets from platforms supporting donkey kong removing final rivet causes donkey kong to fall and hero to be reunited with pauline these four stages combine to form a level upon completion of fourth stage level then increments and game repeats stages with progressive difficulty for example donkey kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally and fireballs speed up victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2 fourth level however consists of 5 stages with final stage at 125 meters 22nd level is colloquially known as kill screen due to an error in game s programming that kills mario after a few seconds effectively ending game plot thumb on final screen of each level mario and pauline are reunited donkey kong is considered to be earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen eponymous donkey kong character is game s de facto villain hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in japanese arcade release later named jumpman and then mario donkey kong kidnaps mario s girlfriend originally known as lady but later renamed pauline player must take role of mario and rescue her this is first occurrence of damsel in distress scenario that would provide template for countless video games to come game uses graphics and animation as vehicles of characterization donkey kong smirks upon mario s demise pauline has a pink dress and long hair and a speech balloon crying help appears frequently beside her mario depicted in red overalls and a red cap is an everyman character a type common in japan graphical limitations and low pixel resolution of small sprites prompted his design drawing a mouth with such few pixels is infeasible so character was given a mustache programmers could not animate hair so he got a cap and to make his arm movements visible he needed colored overalls artwork used for cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon like character designs even more explicit pauline for example is depicted to be disheveled like king kong fay wray in a torn dress and stiletto heels donkey kong is first example of a complete narrative told in video game form and like 1980 s pac man it employs cutscenes to advance its plot game opens with gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to top of a construction site he sets pauline down and stomps his feet causing steel beams to change shape he moves to his final perch and sneers a melody plays and level or stage starts this brief animation sets scene and adds background to gameplay a first for video games upon reaching end of stage another cutscene begins a heart appears between mario and pauline but donkey kong grabs her and climbs higher causing heart to break narrative concludes when mario reaches end of rivet stage he and pauline are reunited and a short intermission plays gameplay then loops from beginning at a higher level of difficulty without any formal ending development thumb small model based on original arcade cabinet as of late 1980 to early 1981 nintendo s efforts to expand to north america had failed culminating with attempted export of otherwise successful radar scope they were left with a large number of unsold radar scope machines so company president hiroshi yamauchi thought of simply converting them into something new he approached a young industrial designer named shigeru miyamoto who had been working for nintendo since 1977 to see if he could design such a replacement miyamoto said that he could yamauchi appointed nintendo s head engineer gunpei yokoi to supervise project nintendo s budget for development of game was 100 000 some sources also claim that ikegami tsushinki was involved in some of development company ikegami tsushinki game developer research institute retrieved on may 17 2009 2005 they played no role in game s creation or concept but were hired to provide mechanical programming assistance to fix software created by nintendo at time nintendo was also pursuing a license to make a game based on popeye comic strip when this license attempt failed nintendo took opportunity to create new characters that could then be marketed and used in later games miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts but he eventually settled on a love triangle between a gorilla a carpenter and a girlfriend that mirrors rivalry between bluto and popeye for olive oyl bluto became an ape which miyamoto said was nothing too evil or repulsive he would be pet of main character a funny hang loose kind of guy miyamoto has also named beauty and beast and 1933 film king kong as influences although its origin as a comic strip license played a major part donkey kong marked first time that storyline for a video game preceded game s programming rather than simply being appended as an afterthought unrelated popeye games would eventually be released by nintendo for game watch following month and for arcades in 1982 yamauchi wanted primarily to target north american market so he mandated that game be given an english title though many of their games to this point had english titles anyway miyamoto decided to name game for ape whom he felt was strongest character story of how miyamoto came up with name donkey kong varies a false urban myth says that name was originally meant to be monkey kong but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection another more credible story claims miyamoto looked in a japanese english dictionary for something that would mean stubborn gorilla or that donkey was meant to convey silly or stubborn kong was common japanese slang for gorilla a rival claim is that he worked with nintendo s export manager to come up with title and that donkey was meant to represent stupid and goofy in end miyamoto stated that he thought name would convey thought of a stupid ape miyamoto himself had high hopes for his new project he lacked technical skills to program it alone so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians to see if they were possible he wanted to make characters different sizes move in different manners and react in various ways yokoi thought miyamoto s original design was too complex though he had some difficult suggestions himself such as using see saws to catapult hero across screen eventually found too hard to program though a similar concept would appear in aforementioned popeye arcade game miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms barrels and ladders when he specified that game would have multiple stages four man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make game repeatedly nevertheless they followed miyamoto s design creating a total of approximately 20 kilobytes of content yukio kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for levels and story events circuit board of radar scope was restructured for donkey kong radar scope hardware originally inspired by namco galaxian hardware was designed for a large number of enemies moving around at high speeds which donkey kong does not require so development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced scale of circuit board making famicom a reality nikkei electronics

too different from maze and shooter games common at time and judy and lincoln expressed reservations over strange title still arakawa adamantly believed that it would be a hit american staff began translating storyline for cabinet art and naming characters they chose pauline for lady after polly james wife of nintendo s redmond washington warehouse manager don james name of jumpman a name originally chosen for its similarity to popular brands walkman and pac man was eventually changed to mario in likeness of mario landlord of original office space of nintendo of america these character names were printed on american cabinet art and used in promotional materials donkey kong was ready for release stone and judy convinced managers of two bars in seattle washington to set up donkey kong machines managers initially showed reluctance but when they saw sales of 30 a day or 120 plays for a week straight they requested more units in their redmond headquarters a skeleton crew composed of arakawa his wife yoko james judy phillips and stone set about gutting 2 000 surplus radar scope machines and converting them with donkey kong motherboards and power supplies from japan game officially

makers of video game consoles were also interested taito offered a considerable sum to buy all rights to donkey kong but nintendo turned them down after three days of discussion within company rivals coleco and atari approached nintendo in japan and united states respectively in end yamauchi granted coleco exclusive console and tabletop rights to donkey kong because he believed that it was company in addition arakawa believed that as a more established company in u s coleco could better handle marketing in return nintendo would receive an undisclosed lump sum plus 1 40 per game cartridge sold and 1 per tabletop unit on december 24 1981 howard lincoln drafted contract he included language that coleco would be held liable for anything on game cartridge an unusual clause for a licensing agreement arakawa signed document next day and on february 1 1982 yamauchi persuaded coleco representative in japan to sign without review by company s lawyers coleco did not offer game cartridge
