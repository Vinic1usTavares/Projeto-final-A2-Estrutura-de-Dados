video attracted attention from press because of clash between spears wholesome image and dark s unwholesome back catalogue a spears representative spoke to sunday sport and revealed as far as i m aware director just does music videos this is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all dark responded to negative reviews saying i don t deny that i did adult films it s just that i also like people to know that i don t currently and haven t in a long time billboard reporter carla hay also noted i don t think people who buy records are too concerned about background of video s director lucy o brien author of she bop ii definitive history of women in rock pop and soul noted that hiring dark as video director implied that spears was not that innocent time journalists briton hadden and henry robinson luce said that spears may be queen of pop but her new video from bottom of my broken heart is an entirely wholesome affair while chris ryan of mtv considered it a suitably soft focus affair video was also added to mtv s 2000 yearbook a list with biggest best most memorable music videos of every year since beginning of mtv alec hanley bemis of la weekly highly criticized spears and music video he thought that singer s lack of musical talent had begun to affect her career after dark was selected as director of video bemis commented however that spears already had a history of questionable decisions and cited her rolling stone photoshoot done in early 1999 which was condemned by american family association as an example he continued to state that plotline set singer on fast track to adulthood and questioned who s in bed with britney now while a tv tabloid recently reported that an old bayou beau in louisiana has mother spears approval fantasizing fans want to believe britney s dallying with that braided from n sync or a member of backstreet boys but only verifiable fact we have to work with is that spears has started running with a darker l a crowd
