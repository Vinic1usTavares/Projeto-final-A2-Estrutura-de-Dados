blackburn firebrand was a british single engine strike fighter for fleet air arm of royal navy designed during world war ii by blackburn aircraft originally intended to serve as a pure fighter its unimpressive performance and allocation of its napier sabre piston engine by ministry of aircraft production for hawker typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load carrying capability development was slow and first production aircraft was not delivered until after end of war only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front line service in 1953 development in general fleet air arm had required fighters that were capable of navigating long ranges over sea and speed differential over attackers was not critical defence of british naval bases was a raf commitment but provision had not been made for this and so admiralty accepted that it would have to take on duty for this it needed an interceptor fighter and experience in norwegian campaign of early 1940 had also shown a high performance carrier based single seat fighter would be an advantage blackburn tendered their b 37 design using napier sabre 24 cylinder h type engine and this was accepted by june 1940 with a proposal to order off drawing board meaning without prototypes air ministry specification n 11 40 stating a minimum top speed of was raised to cover this design and an order placed in january 1941 for three prototypes buttler 2004 p 173 b 37 given service name firebrand on 11 july 1941 was a low winged all metal monoplane aft of cockpit fuselage was an oval shaped stressed skin semi monocoque but forward it had a circular section tubular steel frame that housed main fuel tank and auxiliary fuel tank behind engine radiators for neatly cowled sabre engine were housed in wing root extensions large wing consisted of a two spar centre section with manually folded outer panels with five degrees of dihedral to allow more compact storage in hangar decks of aircraft carriers to increase lift and reduce landing speed wing was fitted with large hydraulically powered fairey youngman flaps that extended to edges of frise ailerons fixed armament of four hispano autocannon was fitted in outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun fin and rudder were positioned forward of elevator to ensure spin recovery and that rudder would retain its effectiveness mainwheels of conventional landing gear were mounted at ends of centre wing section and retracted inwards brown p 27 jackson pp 440 41 firebrand was unusual in fact that there was an airspeed gauge mounted outside of cockpit so that during landing pilot would not have to look down into cockpit to take instrument readings foreshadowing modern heads up display brown p 29 unarmed first prototype first flew on 27 february 1942 using sabre ii first of two armed prototypes following on 15 july initial flight trials were a disappointment as aircraft could only reach below blackburn s estimated maximum speed replacement of sabre ii with a sabre iii an engine built specifically for firebrand improved its top speed to at 17 000 ft 5 182 m second prototype dd810 conducted deck landing trials with commander dennis at controls aboard fleet carrier in february 1943 brown pp 26 28 sabre engine was also used in hawker typhoon a fighter already in production and ministry of air production map decided that typhoon had priority for sabre sabre was also experiencing production problems and so a new engine was needed along with necessary airframe adaptations to use time and effort invested in design map decided to convert firebrand into an interim strike fighter to meet a fleet air arm requirement for a single seat torpedo bomber capable of carrying bombs rockets and being capable of air to air combat nine production f mk i aircraft were built to original specifications and were retained for trials and development work friedman p 279 jackson pp 441 42 after it was badly damaged during an emergency landing dd810 was converted into a prototype of first strike variant firebrand t f mk ii with company designation b 45 that flew on 31 march 1943 it was an adaptation of mk i with wing centre section widened by to make room for torpedo on centreline between mainwheels like mk i tf mk ii only saw a very limited production run of 12 aircraft and they were also allocated for development work including those assigned to 708 naval air squadron a shore based trials unit blackburn proposed several versions of sabre powered aircraft including one for raf as b 41 a version with a high lift wing as b 42 and b 43 floatplane none of which were accepted for further development jackson pp 442 43 a new specification was issued as s 8 43 to cover development of firebrand t f mk iii b 45 with bristol centaurus vii radial engine two prototypes were converted from incomplete f mk is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered completing first batch of 50 aircraft first prototype flew on 21 december 1943 but construction of new aircraft was very slow with first flight not being made until november 1944 most changes were related to installation of larger diameter centaurus engine including air intakes for carburetor and oil cooler in wing root extensions that formerly housed engine s radiators spring loaded trim tabs were also fitted to all control surfaces production aircraft after first 10 were fitted with improved centaurus ix engine jackson pp 443 44 mk iii was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons new engine produced more torque than sabre and rudder control was insufficient on takeoff with full flaps needed for carrier use visibility while landing was very poor tailhook attachment to airframe was too weak and aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at stall while landing so development continued to rectify these issues t f mk iv b 46 as new development was designated featured larger tail surfaces for better low speed control enlarged rudder was horn balanced and vertical stabilizer was offset three degrees to port to counteract four bladed propeller s torque wings now featured hydraulically operated dive brakes on both upper and lower surfaces aircraft s wings were now stressed to carry one bomb under each wing or a drop tank or eight rp 3 rockets frame that held torpedo was connected to undercarriage so that it pivoted nose downward to increase ground clearance with landing gear extended and pivoted upward to reduce drag while in flight a fuel tank could be fitted on centreline in lieu of torpedo mk iv first flew on 17 may 1945 and was first version of firebrand to enter mass production brown p 30 jackson p 445 with 170 built although 50 more aircraft were cancelled later firebrand t f mk 5 featured minor aerodynamic improvements and 123 were converted from mk ivs final version was firebrand t f mk 5a with hydraulically boosted ailerons to increase aircraft s rate of roll two mk 5s and five mk ivs were converted to mk 5a standard operational history thumb left a prototype firebrand tf mk ii taxiing along flight deck of with its flaps extended during trials firebrand did not see action in world war ii as tf 4s were not issued to 813 naval air squadron until 1 september 1945 squadron was disbanded 30 september 1946 without deploying to sea it was reformed with tf 5s on 1 may 1947 and flew them from carrier later until it was re equipped with turboprop westland wyvern attack aircraft in february 1953 827 naval air squadron received their tf 5 and 5as on 13 december 1950 and flew them primarily off carrier until it disbanded on 19 november 1952 a variety of second line squadrons were issued firebrands of various marks for training or trials at one time or another sturtivant 1984 pp 212 214 280 282 437 in test pilot and naval aviator captain eric brown s opinion aircraft was short of performance sadly lacking in manoeuvrability especially in rate of roll brown p 30 position of cockpit even with trailing edge of wing gave pilot a very poor view over nose inhibited his ability to view his target and to land his aircraft aboard a carrier sufficient for brown to call it a disaster as a deck landing aircraft brown pp 31 46 47 variants blackburn b 37 three prototypes ordered to meet specification n 11 40 named firebrand on 11 july 1941 second prototype re built
