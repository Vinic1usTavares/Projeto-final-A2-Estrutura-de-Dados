of sullivan s island greene p 184 second continental congress had established continental navy in late 1775 morison pp 57 58 by february 1776 first ships of fleet were ready for their maiden voyage commodore esek hopkins was to lead a fleet of eight ships on an expedition to bahamas where british were known to have military stores in early march fleet was reduced by one due to tangled riggings en route landed marines on island of new providence and captured town of nassau morison pp 67 p 117 fleet sailed north on march 17 now including two captured prize ships all loaded up with cargo captured from military stores one ship was dispatched to philadelphia while rest of fleet sailed for block island channel field pp 118 119 fleet s cruise was marked by outbreaks of a variety of diseases including fevers and smallpox which significantly reduced crew s effectiveness by april 4 fleet reached waters off long island and proceeded to capture which was also laden with supplies next day brought a second prize in bolton field p 120 hopkins continued to cruise off block island that night hoping to catch more easy prizes he organized fleet into a scouting formation of two columns right or eastern column was headed by uss cabot and was followed by hopkins flagship uss alfred which had 20 guns and was largest ship of fleet left column was headed by uss andrew doria and was followed by uss columbus behind these came uss providence with uss fly and uss wasp trailing farther behind as escorts for prizes need to provide crews for prize ships further reduced fighting effectiveness of fleet battle thumb right block island is highlighted in this satellite image battle was fought to its southeast battle took place on an exceptionally clear night with a nearly full moon uss andrew doria and hms glasgow spotted each other between 1 00 and 2 00 am on april 6 about eight leagues 20 to 24 nautical miles southeast of block island with fleet headed in a generally southerly direction gentleman s magazine p pp 70 71 glasgow was heading west destined for charleston captain howe came about to investigate fleet and closed to within hailing distance over next 30 minutes commodore hopkins gave no signals during this time so fleet formed no battle line this resulted in a battle that captain nicholas biddle of andrew doria later described as helter skelter morison p 70 howe first came upon uss cabot whose captain was esek hopkins son john glasgow hailed cabot for identification to which younger hopkins replied uss columbus and uss alfred a 22 gun frigate an overzealous seaman on his ship then tossed a grenade onto glasgows deck and battle was engaged cabot a lightly armed brig fired one ineffective broadside of six pound cannon shot glasgow countered with two broadsides from its heavier weaponry killing cabot master wounding hopkins and disabling ship s steering as cabot drifted away uss alfred came up to engage glasgow and two commenced a broadside duel a shot from glasgow early in action broke lines to alfred tiller causing her to lose steering and exposing her to raking fire her drift also made it difficult for biddle s andrew doria to join action because ship also had to maneuver to avoid drifting cabot morison p 72 uss providence held back uss columbus was able to join action late but her fire was so wild that little to no damage was done to glasgow morison p 73 however glasgow was now exposed to fire from three ships so howe decided to break off battle in order to avoid being boarded and made sail for newport despite extensive damage to sail and rigging he pulled away from pursuing fleet which was fully laden with its captured goods hopkins called off chase after several hours in order to avoid an encounter with british squadron at newport his only prize was glasgow tender morgan p 44 which fleet brought to anchor in new london connecticut on april 8 morgan p 45 aftermath hms glasgow suffered one killed and three wounded a low number which some consider to be evidence of poor quality in continental fleet s gunnery all of casualties were due to musket fire four were killed and seven wounded aboard cabot uss alfred had six killed and six wounded and andrew dorias drummer was wounded coggins p 29 thumb left columbus in a later action painting by william van powell continental congress president john hancock praised hopkins for fleet s performance while its failure to capture glasgow provided opportunities for criticism to opponents of navy both in and out of congress nicholas biddle wrote of action a more imprudent ill conducted affair never happened thomas p 52 uss columbus captain abraham whipple endured accusations of cowardice for a time and eventually asked for a court martial to clear his name on may 6 1776 a panel consisting of officers who had been on cruise cleared whipple of cowardice but criticized him for errors in judgment morgan p 47 uss providence captain john hazard was not so fortunate he was charged with a variety of offenses by his subordinate officers including neglect of duty during glasgow action he was convicted by court martial and forced to surrender his commission morgan pp 47 48 commodore hopkins came under scrutiny from congress over matters unrelated to block island action he had violated his written orders to sail to virginia and carolinas traveling to nassau instead he also distributed goods taken during cruise in connecticut and rhode island without consulting congress morgan p 49 he was censured for these transgressions a number of fleet s ships suffered from crew shortages and became trapped at providence rhode island by british occupation of newport late in 1776 and thus failed to sail again morgan pp 49 52 in january 1778 hopkins was dismissed from navy hms glasgow returned to newport suffering from battle and having dumped her dispatches she was found to be in bad shape she was made as seaworthy as possible and sent to portsmouth for repairs her mission was reassigned to hms nautilus another ship in newport squadron clarke volume 4 pp 681 1157 notes references reprints howe s report
