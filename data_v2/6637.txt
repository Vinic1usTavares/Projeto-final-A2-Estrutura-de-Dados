french navy until 1930s when she was broken up for scrap design design for konigsbergs was prepared in 1913 design was an incremental improvement over previous with a larger hull and greater displacement but with same armament speed and armor protection by 1916 thirteen german light cruisers had been lost in course of world war i after they were commissioned ships of konigsberg class took

konigsberg design was also starting point for light cruiser built by reichsmarine in 1920s since blueprints for karlsruhe were still available this was a result of personnel shortages in design staff and closure of navy s ship testing institute which prevented development of a new design general characteristics and machinery ships of class were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft ships had a designed displacement of and at full combat load they displaced their hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames hulls were divided into eighteen watertight compartments and incorporated a double bottom that extended for forty five percent of length of keel ships had a complement of 17 officers and 458 enlisted men they carried several smaller vessels including one picket boat one barge one cutter two yawls and two dinghies german navy regarded ships as good sea boats having gentle motion ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius and but lost speed going into a turn in hard turns they lost up to sixty percent speed ships were stern heavy propulsion systems for konigsberg emden and nurnberg consisted of two steam turbines while karlsruhe was outfitted with two sets of high pressure geared turbines turbines for all four ships were powered by ten coal fired boilers and two oil fired double ended boilers turbines drove a pair of three bladed screws which were in diameter engines were rated at for a top speed of on trials konigsberg reached and a top speed of while karlsruhe made and emden reached and 27 7 kn trials figures are not recorded trials were conducted in shallow water due to war in deep water ships would have exceeded coal storage was as designed though up to could be carried fuel oil was initially and could be similarly increased to at a cruising speed of ships could steam for approximately at a higher speed of range fell considerably to electrical power was provided by two turbo generators and one diesel generator with a total output of 300 kilowatts at 220 volts steering was controlled by a single large rudder armament and armor ship was armed with eight 15 cm sk l 45 guns in single pedestal mounts two were placed side by side forward on forecastle four were located amidships two on either side and two were arranged in a super firing pair aft these guns fired a shell at
