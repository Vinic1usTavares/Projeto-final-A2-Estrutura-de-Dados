power of box ugo networks alex zalben wrote two weeks in fringe is still best damn show currently on tv zalben loved serial aspects of plot praised anna torv s performance but disliked how no one has realized fauxlivia s true identity josh wigler from mtv enjoyed episode particularly because although he found parallel universe a compelling world sometimes it s nice to just kick your feet up on table and know that you re home two episodes down and it s safe to say that third season of fringe is off to a very strong start ken tucker of entertainment weekly thought it was a terrific episode with a tremendously clever game changer of an ending this fringe was a good example of how far series has come since its first season dominated by pre credits scare scenarios for fringe division to investigate some of which spilled over into show s mythology now fringe is a seamless whole a v club s noel murray graded it with a b sfscope contributor sarah stegall wrote tightly written well acted and directed with a sure hand this second episode of season bears out my original prediction this year is going to rock andrew hanson from los angeles times praised episode s use of a harold in which three separate plots working off a central theme converge together he also loved climatic scene involving a gunshot induced deaf peter and subway i hope more people were watching this episode for so many reasons to see how good fringe has become to get addicted to show and most important to see that they quoted my blog in promo for next week thursday night has become fringe night awards and
