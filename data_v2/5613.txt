tropical storm beryl made landfall just south of united states mexico border in mid august 2000 causing minimal damage second named storm of 2000 atlantic hurricane season beryl originated from a tropical wave near african coastline tracking westward wave failed to organize substantially until entering bay of campeche at which time it developed into a tropical storm beryl rapidly deepened while in gulf of mexico and it initially was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane under favorable conditions for development instead beryl remained at moderate tropical storm intensity and failed to intensify any further it made landfall in mexican state of tamaulipas as a weak tropical storm with winds of 50 mph 85 km h on august 15 and dissipated over mountainous terrain shortly thereafter one death was reported in mexico due to drowning otherwise no significant damage was reported associated with beryl as it affected a sparsely populated area of mexico meteorological history a tropical wave emerged from african coast with a closed circulation on august 3 it tracked westward across tropical waters of atlantic ocean and broke into two distinct parts northern portion eventually became hurricane alberto southern portion continued to track westward into caribbean sea while producing little or no deep convection wave reached mexico s yucatan peninsula on august 12 and only then did deep convection redevelop mostly due to diurnal heating wave emerged over bay of campeche early on august 13 as a large area of low pressure wave was upgraded to tropical depression five later that day based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an air force reserve reconnaissance aircraft six hours after developing depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on august 16 due to warm waters of gulf of mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development tropical depression traveled to northwest across southwest gulf of mexico it strengthened rapidly and there was evidence of deep convection as it passed over warm waters it was upgraded to tropical storm beryl late on august 14 with surface winds of 50 mph 85 km h based on reconnaissance aircraft observation six hours later storm accelerated to near 9 mph 15 km h meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected preventing time for beryl to strengthen to a hurricane however beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast as it maintained an intensity of 50 mph 85 km h lack of intensification could be due to moderate wind shear and entrainment over gulf of mexico
