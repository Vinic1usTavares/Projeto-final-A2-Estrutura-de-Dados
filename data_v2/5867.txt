bela supports this story audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to deal to escape abuse from her father now desperate because her time is running out bela tries to

trading colt once she gave it up however deal changed so she had to kill sam as well though dean refuses her pleas for help she reveals to him demon lilith holds all contracts brokered by crossroads demons including his own bela s death and her soul s resulting descent into hell is inevitable but not shown characterization described by her actress lauren cohan as a female humphrey bogart bela is a little bit manipulative and she always wants to be in control according to series creator eric kripke writers conceptualized character as someone winchesters have really never come across before because though she moves throughout supernatural world bela has no interest in altruistic or obsessed or revenge minded motives of hunting writer and producer sera gamble summarized writing team s characterization of bela as a greedy mercenary that sic just doesn t give a shit about cause essential supernatural on road with sam and dean winchester knight p 70 gamble believed that bela finds it quite amusing that winchesters use their knowledge of supernatural to help people on this aspect gamble added i always suspect when someone is that blase that there s something underneath and we re finally getting into that cohan viewed bela as a young woman trying to make a living and find some kind of reason in her world who was a little damaged actress shared gamble s opinion of bela s behavior being a facade and incorporated into her performance idea of bela hiding her true self with cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from real strong connections this defensiveness prevented her from opening up to winchesters with whom cohan believed bela would have loved to be able to have a normal relationship contrary to kripke and gamble s assessment of bela as amoral and uncaring cohan envisioned character as having fits of conscience offscreen throughout third season in actress s opinion bela would have loved to go around fighting evil with those boys development supernatural producers originally intended for bela to be a recurring character having already created a new female lead in form of demon ruby they chose to upgrade bela to series regular after dawn ostroff at time cw president of entertainment requested a second female lead for season because they loved bela and already planned for her to return in future episodes to avoid mistake they had made in previous season in introducing jo harvelle as a love interest writers planned to introduce bela as a character in her own right who would act as an antagonist with her own interests and her own motives they were however willing to add in a romantic involvement with sam or dean should they and fans both want it writers also planned for bela to be very separate and very different from ruby and for characters to serve very different storylines cohan auditioned for ruby but ultimately received part of bela upon learning of cohan s british accent a really psyched kripke reworked character to be british actress herself later pictured bela that way feeling she has some kind of cool shading and which fits british accent at time of cohan s casting however she had been given little exposure to character script wise and was unaware she would play a nasty person it was not until cw up fronts that kripke gave her a good spiel about bela because she would be interviewed knight 3 p 118 actress later turned down an offer from him to provide more of character s backstory and instead opted to learn it as episodes were filmed in order to prepare for her role cohan received training in weaponry to be well equipped with swords and a lot of instruments sharp instruments and in kickboxing alongside ruby s actress katie cassidy cohan and cassidy also decided to catch up on supernatural before filming for third season began by watching first two seasons together due to protective and occasionally nervous fans kripke meant for bela to be introduced in small doses he wanted fans to know show would always be just about sam and dean winchester and stated ruby and bela are there for important plot elements but it s not ruby and bela show nor is it about four of them cruising around in impala together it s about guys however he felt writers pushed it too far in episode red sky at morning stating his opinion that it was by far least successful episode this year because it really kind of became bela show writers also did not take time to consider how to tie her into winchesters storylines as kripke pointed out it s a road show and we re in a different town every week so if you re going to run into same character over and over again you better have a damn good reason they were eventually crushed under weight of absurdity of it because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within narrative knight pp 10 11 another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for brothers writers so taken with a woman who could screw boys over at every turn ended up making bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance any chance for a funny effervescent episode where they all work together was lost after character attempts to have winchesters killed on multiple occasions they eventually decided to drop character from series opting to send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way which would show a couple of cards they have been holding onto all season by revealing her backstory in a way that will surprise audience and kind of tie her into story reception critical response to character has been mixed buddytv staff columnist don williams deemed addition of bela a cheap ploy to attract teen male viewers believing character distracts viewers from brotherly bond that made show so special in first place as well he felt her sexy cat burglar act coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before and he likened her to a combination of catwoman and equally annoying electro gwen from angel however he later admitted bela was a great comic foil diana steenbergen of ign became increasingly frustrated with unlikable and manipulative bela throughout her appearances http tv ign com articles 876 html she found character s tragic backstory to be too little too late but was surprised writers were able to make her feel even a tiny bit sorry for bela during her death scene writing that bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died http www ign com articles 2008 08 06 supernatural flashback shadow review steenbergen wished character had been written differently not either annoying or downright contemptible and deemed her a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for boys karla peterson of san diego union tribune expressed similar sentiments voicing her belief in her review of third season finale no rest for wicked that bela got gone just as she was getting interesting in same review peterson deemed character to be a decent traveling companion although tv guide s tina charles was annoyed that bela continuously steals from winchesters and makes them look ridiculous she really liked character overall she felt cohan did one hell of a job from start fans were very wary of bringing in female characters to male dominated show they feared bela was brought on to be arm candy or a sidekick to make matters worse when coming up with scenes for auditions for bela executive producer robert singer spent an hour writing a lackluster script not intended to be used in show mere hours after script was given to casting director show s fans had found them on casting websites and were obsessively going over these scenes according to kripke fan reaction was characters really look like they suck bela s overly antagonistic actions throughout season did not calm viewers fears bela screwed over boys so badly kripke explained that she became unlikeable to fans because she was irredeemable kripke has confessed part of decision to kill character off was due to negative reaction
