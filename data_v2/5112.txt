haunting chapel is an extended play ep released by american thrash metal band slayer in 1984 through metal blade and enigma records slayer s debut album show no mercy became metal blade s highest selling leading to producer brian slagel wanting to release an ep recorded in hollywood recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet although it resulted in drummer dave lombardo meeting gene hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed it was during recording of this session that lombardo first had double bass added to his kit hoglan working for slayer at time sat at kit and played a double bass for first time lombardo was impressed and although hoglan never gave him lessons he did give him tips regarding use of double kick drum although originally featuring three songs record evidences a marked evolution from style of their previous album show no mercy and is considered first demonstration of band s classic style displayed on later albums and is often described as a stepping stone songs captor of sin and chemical warfare are regularly featured on band s live set list chemical warfare appears in guitar hero warriors of rock recording slayer s previous album show no mercy had sold over 40 000 copies worldwide and band were performing songs chemical warfare and captor of sin live which made producer brian slagel want to release an ep album was recorded in hollywood with sound engineer bill metoyer in a studio with no carpet which was a problem while recording drums slagel was acting as executive producer metoyer is christian and lyrics from show no mercy did not bother him however first words araya sang when recording haunting chapel were holy cross symbol of lies intimidates lives of christian born and other anti religious lyrics metoyer thought he would go to hell for his part in recording lyrics these lyrical themes were inspired by band venom who influenced king and was also into satanic image slayer drummer dave lombardo set his drum kit on concrete and kit went all over place while playing lombardo asked gene hoglan to hold his kit together while recording chemical warfare with hoglan thinking i hope he does this in one or two takes because this is rough hoglan was coaching lombardo how to use double bass drums to improve his drumming ability and speed lombardo asserts hoglan was an amazing double bass player even back then although it was hoglan s first time playing double bass eddy schreyer provided audio mastering and digital remastering with cover art design created by vince gutierrez haunting chapel was darker and more thrash oriented than show no mercy and laid groundwork for future direction in band s sound touring hoglan worked as a roadie for band after their lighting guy did not show up one night and performed lombardo s soundchecks slayer and hoglan would play dark angel songs during soundchecks which is how hoglan eventually joined dark angel hoglan approached dark angel guitarist jim durkin he came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of band he said we needed to be more evil and then he goes by way i m a better drummer than guy you have in dark angel right now hoglan was fired as he thought a roadie only did lighting while vocalist tom araya s brother johnny araya would do all roadie duties such as moving equipment working with sound and lights and setting up stage band performed a show in seattle in front of a crowd of 1500 largest show they performed at time supporting metal church and in texas played with a band also called slayer in san antonio however it was san antonio slayer s goodbye show reception although ep did not enter any charts eduardo rivadavia of allmusic awarded ep three out of five stars rivadavia said haunting chapel was a stepping stone that offers important clues about this transition period which saw slayer s rock based song structures give way to non linear genre defining style thereafter regarded as thrash metal s signature sound tracks chemical warfare and captor of sin are played at slayer s live shows regularly vocalist karl of death metal band bolt thrower asserts record was an inspiration for band when slayer s haunting chapel came out i had never heard anything like that before with that style of guitar playing we were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing and other bands we heard like venom slaughter and metallica so we took elements of musicianship from metal and aggression of punk and poured it all together chuck of band death said record was life changing at time asserting that was some of early stuff that gave me that push black metal band covered chemical warfare on a tribute cd to slayer titled gateway to hell vol
