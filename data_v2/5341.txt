typhoon zola struck japan during august 1990 an area of disturbed weather developed during mid august to west of guam disturbance developed into a tropical depression on august 16 while tracking eastward decreased wind shear aided in intensification and it is estimated that depression strengthened into a tropical storm on august 17 continuing to intensify zola turned northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to its east before obtaining typhoon intensity on august 20 typhoon zola reached its peak intensity next day after weakening slightly storm moved ashore on honshu on august 23 system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over sea of japan typhoon dropped heavy rains across much of japanese archipelago near where storm moved over ashore in kochi prefecture three people were injured thirty eight homes were damaged or destroyed further north 7 people were injured in hiroshima prefecture where 30 houses were damaged or destroyed and 19 others were flooded power lines were cut in 84 000 locations and 2 100 ha 5 190 acres of farmland were damaged in prefecture nationwide six people were killed while twenty four others were hurt a total 67 houses were destroyed while 420 others were flooded a total of 16 ships and 4 560 acres 1 845 ha of farmland were damaged over 250 flights were called off in all damage totaled y 15 1 billion equal to us 104 million meteorological history following formation of typhoon yancy there was a pronounced surge of southwesterly flow in western pacific monsoon trough west of guam thunderstorm activity began to persist east of yancy but further development was slow to occur because of strong vertical wind shear early on august 15 joint typhoon warning center jtwc started watching a persistent area of disturbed weather west of guam initially disturbance tracked west northwest and then eastward but further development was inhibited by strong vertical wind shear at 00 00 utc on august 16 japan meteorological agency jma upgraded disturbance into a tropical depression banding quickly wrapped around center around a low level circulation as disturbance passed through mariana islands by evening of august 16 jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and following morning upgraded system into a tropical depression depression turned west northwest in response to a shortwave trough that tracked north of system at noon on august 17 jma upgraded it to a tropical storm although jtwc did not follow suit until early on august 18 when ship reports indicated a tighter pressure gradient and winds of tropical storm zola continued northwest and tracked through region of divergence aloft which aided intensification at 06 00 utc on august 18 jma upgraded zola into a severe tropical storm further intensification was initially halted because storm remained embedded in monsoon trough but on august 19 zola began to detach from monsoonal trough coinciding with an expansion of storm s equatorial outflow channel cyclone subsequently resumed intensification while turning northwest in response to a subtropical ridge between china and japan following appearance of a ragged eye on weather satellite imagery and a dvorak classification of t4 0 zola was classified as a typhoon at 00 00 utc on august 20 by jtwc jma followed suit later that same morning further intensification was aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough that provided an excellent poleward outflow channel based an increase in storm s organization jtwc raised intensity of storm to at 06 00 utc on august 21 its peak intensity around this time jma estimated that zola peaked in intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of increased southwesterly wind shear took toll on typhoon and storm weakened slightly prior as it passed between kyushu and shikoku with jtwc and jma reporting winds of and respectively at time of landfall on western honshu after recurving to northeast over sea of japan zola weakened to a tropical storm on august 22 and transitioned into a mid latitude cyclone while interacting with westerlies early on august 23 both agencies ceased tracking system at this time impact
