court after murder of a police inspector in eastbourne with no witnesses and little forensic evidence edgar power a former medical student told police that his friend john williams had committed murder power helped police conduct a sting operation to catch williams police also interrogated williams s girlfriend florence seymour who then confessed to having helped williams hide murder weapon however seymour later recanted her story and another man came forth claiming to know identity of real killer this new evidence along with behaviour of judge in both initial case and appeal made case controversial enough that members of parliament from three major political parties directly questioned home secretary on matter despite many requests for clemency all appeals were denied and williams was executed in 1913 case was one of first investigations in britain to use emerging science of ballistics background on 9 october 1912 driver of a horse drawn carriage noticed a man crouching near front door of house of countess flora sztaray located on south cliff avenue executed 1913 in eastbourne hyde 1960 p 39 sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich hungarian nobleman driver who was sztaray s coachman informed sztaray of man s presence whereupon sztaray telephoned police wilson 2003 p 321 inspector arthur walls was sent to investigate when walls arrived on scene he observed a man lying on portico above front door walls called out now then my man you just come down quoted in wilson 2003 p 321 man fired two shots first of which struck and killed walls hastings 1950 p 185 police had only two clues some footprints in garden and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter police took moulds of footprints and endeavoured to trace hat but with no success however during routine questioning of local residents police learned that earlier in afternoon of murder a man had been seen sitting with a heavily pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of south cliff avenue man had also been seen wandering street while young woman sat on bench alone leading police to suspect that man was assessing lay of land following day a former medical student named edgar power visited police claiming that he knew identity of murderer power said that murderer was one george mckay who was living in eastbourne under name john williams with his pregnant girlfriend florence seymour power knew williams through williams s brother not named in any sources beyond his real family name of mckay who was power s best friend williams s brother had received a note that morning from williams which he had passed on to power power gave note to police it read if you would save my life come here at once to 4 road ask for seymour bring some cash with you very urgent power told police that letter had been written by williams and that williams had tried to burgle sztaray s house and killed inspector walls according to power williams met with his girlfriend florence seymour after murder and two decided to bury gun on beach and send a letter to williams brother asking for money to return to london which was then given to power power s motive in coming to police was that he was in love with seymour in order to trap williams power asked williams to meet him at moorgate street station following day police were lying in wait and arrested both power and williams at moorgate station police covered williams s head with an apron to prevent him from being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses whiteley 1942 p 28 however no one had glimpsed murderer s face and no one selected williams from an identity parade power was immediately released upon his release power went to seymour and told her that police knew what had happened and that only way to save williams was to dig up gun and move it somewhere safer hyde 1960 p 40 seymour and power retrieved gun on 15 october several police officers were lying in wait and immediately arrested both seymour and power power was released a few hours later seymour was retained for questioning seymour was pregnant and in poor condition both physically and mentally after a few hours of questioning she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated williams in her statement seymour stated that williams had left her for half an hour near countess s house on night of murder returning without his trilby hat and afterwards throwing away a burglar s rope with a hook on end of it also with him burying a revolver on beach he had broken in two despite seymour s statement williams maintained that he was innocent of murder and burglary saying that whoever did that did it to get to sztaray s papers for political purposes no doubt she is mixed up in some foreign political business i would not commit a crime like that williams appeared at magistrates court in eastbourne for an initial hearing he was not represented by either a solicitor or a barrister and pleaded not guilty on his way to and from court williams s head was again covered with an apron to prevent him from being photographed press accordingly dubbed him hooded man wilson 2003 p 322 police decided that seymour should take witness stand as soon as possible to avoid her going back on what she had told police as such she was called to witness box by cecil whiteley who was treasury counsel at time to go through her statement line by line she was physically exhausted and fainted four times in witness box this and other interruptions meant that initial hearing took four days eventually case was referred to assizes for trial hyde 1960 p 41 trial trial of john williams for murder of inspector arthur walls began on 12 december 1912 at lewes assizes with arthur channell sitting as a judge by this time williams had found a solicitor who had arranged for patrick hastings and c f baker to represent him in court crown was represented by sir frederick low and cecil whiteley trial proved a popular one with crowds of people outside court house trying to see defendants or barristers involved a local newspaper described it as most sensational murder trial within living history hyde 1960 p 43 florence seymour was first person called to witness box she said that her statement was false and that she had only made it because edgar power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not hyde 1960 p 44 this immediately disrupted case for prosecution frederick low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on seymour s testimony low received permission from judge to treat seymour as a hostile witness despite this she refused to say anything that would incriminate williams hastings did not cross examine her only asking if what she had said in court was true she said that it was and then burst into tears after calling a number of minor witnesses including cab driver and owner of building williams and seymour lived in prosecution called edgar power power testified that williams had bragged about shooting walls in response to powers him about being a poor shot according to power williams responded to chaff by saying well that was a good shot anyhow referring to shot that had killed walls williams barrister hastings later described power as most utterly contemptible human being i have ever met hastings 1950 p 191 and during his cross examination hastings highlighted power s betrayal of his close friends williams and seymour defendant john williams was called next williams claimed that package containing rope and gun had been given to him by a fellow thief called freddy mike who had asked him to keep package until mike came to collect it hyde 1960 p 47 after murder williams was scared that he would be suspected since he had a gun and had been arrested previously for burglary following testimony of seymour power and williams it became clear jury could not convict williams based on witness testimony alone there was however some circumstantial evidence an empty holster found by police among williams possessions showed evidence of a revolver recently being inside it hyde 1960 p 46 police enlisted aid of an expert in new science of forensic ballistics robert churchill it was one of first times police made use of ballistics in a case skinner fido and moss churchill was able to prove by firing a different gun of same design that bullet that killed police officer had been fired from a revolver of same make and calibre as gun reported to be williams wilson 2003 p 323 however prosecution needed proof that bullet had been fired from that particular revolver at suggestion of chief bower photographers attempted to photograph inside of gun barrel in order to prove that bullet had been fired from that particular revolver attempts were unsuccessful and churchill instead made a cast of inside of gun from dental wax method has been called far from satisfactory but it was sufficient to convict williams in his summing up judge channell commented that acts of defendant in hiding gun and fleeing eastbourne were acts which a guilty man would be very likely to do he also told jury that while there was no direct evidence linking williams to murder many cases had resulted in a conviction with even less evidence after around fifteen minutes of deliberations jury returned a verdict of guilty and channell sentenced williams to death hyde 1960 p 48 court of criminal appeal immediately after verdict was read williams solicitor announced that he would appeal verdict he asked hastings again to represent defendant this time in court of criminal appeal hyde 1960 p 49 court met on 13 january 1913 and consisted of lord alverstone mr justice phillimore and mr justice ridley hastings argued that mr justice channell had misdirected jury in initial case and that therefore their decision was void lord alverstone dismissed appeal without hearing other side of argument saying that he could find no evidence of misdirection hastings felt that alverstone had been biased from start later writing that from outset of hearing it was apparent that he was satisfied with prisoner s guilt and no legal argument seemed to make least impression on him hastings 1950 p 192 further appeals and execution shortly after appeal was dismissed williams received a letter from freddy mike who stated that not only did he know real murderer but that murderer was his twin brother who had killed police inspector before fleeing to france hyde 1960 p 50 williams immediately showed letter to his solicitor who contacted scotland yard accompanied by chief inspector bower williams solicitor visited freddy mike who again told same story a copy of letter was sent to home secretary reginald mckenna along with a statement by florence seymour in which she claimed that her confession had been given after threats by police when freddy mike s statement became known to public various petitions and campaigns to free williams were organised throughout country a petition containing 35 000 signatures requesting a reprieve was sent to home secretary as soon as house of commons opened on 23 january 1913 mckenna was questioned by labour conservative and liberal mps robert munro mp for wick burghs made a speech asking home secretary to take into account conflicting accounts lack of any direct evidence and way judge had directed jury and pardon williams hyde 1960 p 51 in this he was supported by will crooks marquess of and ian macpherson mckenna replied that house will understand that there is no part of home secretary s duty which throws greater responsibility upon him or is indeed more painful then that which has to be exercised in connection with prerogative of mercy of course any man would be only too glad to find a of evidence or reason or i might say to invent a reason which would enable him to save a human life but my duty as i understand it is to act in accordance with law and traditions of my office i have investigated story of freddy mike to its very foundation i have traced family history of man who calls himself freddy mike and i find beyond question and i may say even on his own admission that there is not a shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end he said that he had a twin brother he had no twin brother he said that twin brother or a friend of twin brother was in eastbourne that night there were no such people and whole story is an invention because having known john williams in past he did not like to think of his being hanged hyde 1960 p 52 mckenna concluded by saying that law must take its course and refused to grant a pardon williams applied to home secretary mckenna for permission to marry florence seymour mckenna denied williams s request and did so again when williams petitioned a second time williams was executed on 30 january 1913 references bibliography hastings patrick
