thumb right one of main symbols of ona order of nine angles ona o9a is a satanic and left hand path occult group based in united kingdom but with associated groups in various other parts of world claiming to have been established in 1960s it rose to public recognition in early 1980s attracting attention for its neo nazi ideologies and activism describing its approach as traditional satanism it has been identified by academic researchers as also exhibiting hermetic and modern pagan elements in its beliefs according to order s own account it was established in welsh marches of western england during late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre christian sect surviving in region this account also states that in 1973 a man named anton long was initiated into group subsequently becoming its grand master several academic commentators to have studied ona express view that name anton long is probably pseudonym of british neo nazi activist david myatt although myatt has denied that this is case from late 1970s onward long authored a number of books and articles propagating order s ideas and in 1988 it began production of its own journal fenrir through these ventures it established links with other neo nazi satanist groups around world furthering its cause through embracing internet in 2000s ona promotes idea that human history can be divided into a series of aeons each of which contain a corresponding human civilization it expresses view that current aeonic civilization is that of western but claims that evolution of this society is threatened by magian nazarene influence of judeo christian religion which order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order termed imperium according to order teachings this is necessary in order for a galactic civilization to form in which aryan society will colonise milky way it advocates a spiritual path in which practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society committing crimes embracing political extremism and violence and carrying out an act of human sacrifice ona members practice magick believing that they are able to do so through channeling energies into our own causal realm from an acausal realm where laws of physics do not apply with such magical actions designed to aid in ultimate establishment of imperium ona lacks any central authority or structure instead operating as a broad network of associates termed kollective who are inspired by texts originally authored by long and other members of inner ona group comprises largely of clandestine cells termed nexions with first nexion based in shropshire western england majority of groups have been established in british isles and germany although others have been formed elsewhere in europe russia south africa australia and north america some academic estimates suggest that number of individuals broadly associated with order falls in low thousands various killings and terroristic activities have been perpetrated by politically extreme activists influenced by ona s teachings it has been described as one of most extreme and dangerous satanist groups in world history origins thumb right ona s first cell nexion zero was established in shropshire pictured academics have found it difficult to ascertain exact and verifiable information about ona s origins given secrecy with which group shields itself as with many other occult organisations order shrouds its history in mystery and legend creating a mythical narrative for its origins and development ona claims to be descendant of pre christian pagan traditions which survived christianisation of britain and which were passed down from middle ages onward in small groups or temples based in welsh marches a border area between england and wales which were each led by a grand master or grand mistress according to order in late 1960s a grand mistress of one such group united three of these temples temple of sun and to form ona before welcoming outsiders into tradition according to order s account one of those whom grand mistress initiated into group was anton long an individual who described himself as a british citizen who had spent much of his youth visiting africa asia and middle east long claimed that prior to his involvement in ona he had been interested in occultism for several years having contacted a coven based in fenland in 1968 before moving to london and joining groups that practiced ceremonial magic in style of hermetic order of golden dawn and aleister crowley he also claimed a brief involvement in a satanic group based in manchester orthodox temple of prince run by ray bogart during which time he encountered ona grand mistress according to order s account long joined ona in 1973 first to have done so in five years and became grand mistress heir he later recalled that at that time group held rituals at henges and stone circles around solstices and equinoxes this account further states that when order s grand mistress migrated to australia long took over as group s new grand master group claimed that long implemented next stage of sinister strategy to make teachings known on a large scale from late 1970s onward long encouraged establishment of new ona groups which were known as temples and from 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for tradition codifying and extending its teachings mythos and structure these texts are typically written in english although they include passages of classical greek as well as terms from sanskrit and arabic reflecting long s fluency in such languages after examining these texts historian nicholas goodrick clarke stated that in them long evokes a world of witches outlaw peasant sorcerers orgies and blood sacrifices at lonely cottages in woods and valleys of this area shropshire and herefordshire where he has lived since early 1980s thumb left david myatt pictured 1998 is often cited as central ideologue in ona real identity of anton long remains a mystery to both members of order and to academics who have studied it however in a 1998 issue of anti fascist magazine searchlight it was claimed that anton long was a pseudonym of david myatt a prominent figure in british neo nazi movement born in early 1950s myatt had been involved in various neo nazi groups initially serving as a bodyguard for colin jordan of british movement before joining combat 18 militia and becoming a founding member and leader of national socialist movement his text on a practical guide to aryan revolution in which he advocated violent militancy in aid of neo nazi cause was cited as an influence on nail bomber david copeland in 1998 myatt converted to islam and remained a practicing muslim for eight years in which time he encouraged violent jihad against zionism and israel s western allies in 2010 he announced that he had renounced islam and was practicing an esoteric tradition that he termed numinous way goodrick clarke supported idea that myatt was long with religious studies scholar jacob c senholt adding that role of david myatt is paramount to whole creation and existence of ona senholt presented additional evidence that he believed confirmed myatt s identity as long writing that myatt s embrace of neo nazism and radical islamism represented insight roles which myatt had adopted as part of ona s sinister strategy to undermine western society a view endorsed by scholar of satanism per faxneld in 2015 an ona member known as r parker argued in favour of idea that myatt was long as a result of page s publication sociologist of religion massimo introvigne stated that ona has more or less acknowledged that myatt and long are same person which claim about myatt ona has disputed myatt himself has repeatedly denied allegations that he has any involvement with ona and that he has used pseudonym anton long furthermore challenging arguments used to connect him with long by claiming that they are based on insufficient evidence religious studies scholar george sieg expressed concern with this association stating that he found it to be implausible and untenable based on extent of variance in writing style personality and tone between myatt and long jeffrey kaplan an academic specialist in far right has also suggested that myatt and long are separate people while religious studies scholar connell r monette posited possibility that anton long was not a singular individual but rather a pseudonym used by several different people public emergence ona arose to public attention in early 1980s during 1980s and 1990s it spread its message through articles in various magazines such as stephen s nox infernal texts nox liber falcon publications 1997 third edition original falcon press 2009 as well as through publication of such volumes as black book of satan black book of satan 1984 press british library general reference collection cup 815 51 bnb and naos naos a practical guide to modern magick press 1990 british library general reference collection 1993 a bnb in 1988 it began publication of its own in house journal titled fenrir among written material that it has publicly issued have been philosophical tracts ritual instruction letters poetry and gothic fiction its core ritual text is titled black book of satan it has also issued its own music painted tarot set known as sinister tarot and a three dimensional board game known as star game ona established links with other neo nazi satanist groups its international distributor was new zealander kerry bolton founder of black order who is described as an ona adept in group s published letter correspondence and it has access to a private library of occult and far right material owned by order of jarls of according to monette group now have associates and groups in united states europe brazil egypt australia and russia one of these associate groups is u s based tempel ov blood which has published a number of texts through press while another is california based white star acception which has been designated as ona s flagship nexion in united states despite diverting from mainstream ona teachings on a number of issues during early 1990s order stated that it was entering second stage of its development in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that ona had become defunct in 2000 ona established a presence on internet using it as a medium to communicate with others and to distribute its writings in 2008 ona announced that it was entering third phase in its history in which it would once again focus heavily on promotion utilising such social media as online blogs forums facebook and youtube to spread its message in 2011 old guard a group of longstanding members of order stated that they would withdraw from active public work with group in march 2012 long announced that he would be withdrawing from public activity although he appears to have remained active in order beliefs and structure ona describes its beliefs as belonging to a sinisterly numinous mystic tradition adding that it is not now and never was either strictly satanist or strictly left hand path but uses satanism and as causal forms that is as techniques experiences ordeals challenges to aid practitioner s spiritual advancement monette described ona as a fascinating blend of both hermeticism and traditional satanism with some pagan elements faxneld described ona as a dangerous and extreme form of satanism and as one of most extreme satanist groups in world https www telegraph co uk news uknews crime pony mutilated in suspected satanic act in dartmoor html jeffrey kaplan and leonard weinberg characterised it as a national socialist oriented satanist group while nicholas goodrick clarke similarly deemed it to be a satanic nazi cult which combine d paganism with praise for hitler he added that ona celebrated dark destructive side of life through anti christian elitist and social darwinist doctrines considering manner in which ona had syncretized both satanism and heathenry historian of religion mattias gardell described its spiritual perspective as a heathen satanic path scholar george sieg however argued that ona should be categorised as post satanic because it has surpassed without fully abandoning identification with its original satanic paradigm traditional satanism and paganism ona describe their occultism both as traditional satanism and as a mystical sinisterly numinous tradition according to jesper aagaard petersen an academic specialist of satanism order present a recognizable new interpretation of satanism and left hand path and for those involved in group satanism is not simply a religion but a way of life order postulates satanism as an arduous individual achievement of self mastery and nietzschean self overcoming with an emphasis on individual growth through practical acts of risk prowess and endurance therefore t he goal of satanism of ona is to create a new individual through direct experience practice and self development with grades of ona system being highly individual based on initiates own practical and real life acts instead of merely performing certain ceremonial rituals thus satanism ona assert requires venturing into realm of forbidden and illegal in order to shake practitioner loose of cultural and political conditioning intentionally transgressive order has been characterised as providing an aggressive and elitist spirituality religious studies scholar graham harvey claimed that ona fit stereotype of satanist better than other groups something which he thought was deliberately achieved by embracing deeply shocking and illegal acts ona are strongly critical of larger satanic groups like church of satan and temple of set whom they deem to be sham satanic because they embrace glamour associated with satanism but are afraid to experience its realness within and external to them in turn church of satan has criticised what they alleged was order s insistence that they are only upholders of satanic tradition with kaplan stating that these comments reflect intramural tensions that are common within world of satanism and about which criticism anton long wrote that ona does not claim to be a peer organization with a claim to some kind of authority when in past we and others like us have said things that others interpret as being against temple of set or la vey we were simply assuming role of adversary challenging what seemed to be becoming accepted dogma although conceiving of itself as having pre christian origins and describing satanism as militant paganism ona does not advocate re establishment of pre christian belief systems with one ona tract stating that all past gods of various western traditions are rendered obsolete by forces which satanism alone is unleashing however goodrick clarke noted that group s ideas and rituals draw upon a native tradition with references to pre christian anglo saxon concept of wyrd an emphasis on ceremonies performed at equinoxes and construction of incense using indigenous trees thus suggesting idea of in english nature practitioners undergo black pilgrimages to prehistoric ceremonial sites in area around shropshire and herefordshire in english midlands furthermore monette writes that a critical examination of ona s key texts suggests that satanic overtones could be cosmetic and that its core mythos and cosmology are genuinely hermetic with pagan influences aeonic cosmology and nazism ona states that cosmic evolution is guided by a sinister dialectics of alternating aeonic energies it divides history into a series of aeons believing that each was dominated by a human civilization that emerged evolved and then died it states that each aeon lasts for approximately 2000 years with its respective dominating human civilization developing within latter 1500 years of that period it holds that after 800 years of growth each civilization faces problems resulting in a time of troubles that lasts from between 398 and 400 years in each civilization s final stage is a period that lasts for approximately 390 years in which it is controlled by a strong military and imperial regime after which civilization falls ona claims that humanity has lived through five such aeons each with an associated civilization primal hyperborean sumerian hellenic and western both goodrick clarke and senholt have stated that this system of aeons is inspired by work of arnold j toynbee with senholt suggesting that it might also have been influenced by crowley s ideas regarding thelemic aeons however ona has stated that their concept has nothing to do with crowley but is based on work of both toynbee and spengler ona claim that current western civilization has a faustian ethos and that it has recently undergone its time of troubles with its final stage an imperium of militaristic governance due to commence at some point in 1990 2011 and last until 2390 this will be followed by a period of chaos from which will be established a sixth aeon aeon of fire which will be represented by galactic civilization in which an aryan society shall colonize milky way galaxy however order holds that unlike previous aeonic civilizations western has been infected with magian nazarene which they associate with judeo christian religion group s writings state that while western civilization had once been a pioneering entity imbued with elitist values and exalting way of warrior under impact of magian nazarene ethos it has become essentially neurotic inward looking and obsessed embracing humanism capitalism communism as well as sham of democracy and dogma of racial equality they believe that these magian nazarene forces represent a counter evolutionary trend which threaten to prevent emergence of western imperium and thus evolution of humanity opining that this cosmic enemy must be overcome through force of will both goodrick clarke and sieg note that these ideas regarding magian soul and cultural distortion brought about by jews were derived from work of oswald spengler and francis parker ona praise nazi germany as a practical expression of satanic spirit a burst of luciferian light of zest and power in an otherwise nazarene pacified and boring world embracing holocaust denial they claim that holocaust was a myth constructed by magian nazarene establishment in order to denigrate nazi administration following second world war and erase its achievements from psyche of west group believe that a neo nazi revolution is necessary to overthrow magian nazarene domination of western society and to establish imperium ultimately allowing humanity to enter galactic civilization of future accordingly positive references to nazism and neo nazism can be found within group s written material and it evokes nazi leader adolf hitler as a positive force in its text for performance of a black mass also known as mass of heresy however some ona texts stress that members should embrace neo nazism and racism not out of a genuine belief in nazi ideology but rather as part of a sinister strategy to advance aeonic evolution a version of black mass produced by an australian ona group temple of them replaces praise for hitler with praise for islamist militant osama bin laden while writings of chloe ortega and kayla key publicists for u s based white star acception express what sieg termed a left anarchist platform which lacked condemnation of zionism and endorsement of aryan racialism found in long s writings order is thus far more overtly political extreme in its aims than other satanic and left hand path organisations seeking to infiltrate and destabilise modern society through both magical and practical means initiation and seven fold way ona s core system is known as seven fold way or and is outlined in one of order s primary texts naos sevenfold system is reflected in group s symbolic cosmology tree of wyrd on which seven celestial bodies moon venus mercury sun mars jupiter and saturn are located term wyrd was adopted from old english where it referred to fate or destiny monette identified this as a hermetic system highlighting that use of seven planetary bodies had been influenced by medieval arabic texts al hakim and shams i seven fold way is also reflected in group s initiatory system which has seven grades through which member can gradually progress these are 1 neophyte 2 initiate 3 external adept 4 internal adept 5 master mistress 6 grand master mousa and 7 immortal group has revealed that very few of its members raise to fifth and sixth degrees and in a 1989 article ona stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached stage of master thumb right ona encourages its members to adopt insight roles in anarchist neo nazi and islamist groups in order to disrupt modern western society ona does not initiate members into group itself but rather expects an individual to initiate themselves it requires that initiates be in a good physical condition and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow newcomers are expected to take on a magical partner of opposite sex or of same sex if they are lesbian or gay thenceforth practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through different grades most of ordeals that allow initiate to proceed to next stage are publicly revealed by order in its introductory material as it is believed that true initiatory element lies in experience itself and can only be attained through performing them for instance part of ritual to become an external adept involves an ordeal in which prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lie there still for an entire night without moving or sleeping initiatory process for role of internal adept entails practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months from an equinox to a solstice or more usually for six months during which time they must live in wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation next stage ritual of abyss involves candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month according to jeffrey kaplan an academic specialist of far right these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect ona s conception of itself as a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of nietzschean elites within initiatory system of ona there is an emphasis on practitioners adopting insight roles in which they work undercover among a politically extreme group for a period of six to eighteen months thus gaining experience in something different from their normal life among ideological trends that ona suggests its members adopt insight roles within are anarchism neo nazism and islamism stating that aside from personal benefits of such an involvement membership of these groups has benefit of undermining magian nazarene socio political system of west and thus helping to bring about instability from which a new order imperium can emerge however monette noted a potential shift in insight roles recommended by group over decades he highlighted that while ona recommended criminal or military activities during 1980s and early 1990s by late 1990s and 2000s they were instead recommending buddhist monasticism as an insight role for practitioners to adopt therefore through practice of insight roles order advocates continuous transgression of established norms roles and comfort zones in development of initiate this extreme application of ideas further amplifies ambiguity of satanic and left hand path practices of antinomianism making it almost impossible to penetrate layers of subversion play and counter dichotomy inherent in sinister dialectics senholt suggested that myatt s involvement with both neo nazism and islamism represent such insight roles in his own life acausal realm magick and dark gods ona believe that humans live within causal realm which obeys laws of cause and effect however they also believe in an acausal realm in which laws of physics do not apply further promoting idea that numinous energies from acausal realm can be drawn into causal allowing for performance of magic believing in existence of magic which group spell magick following example of elias ashmole s 1652 work theatrum ona distinguish between external internal and aeonic magick external magic itself is divided into two categories ceremonial magick which is performed by more than two people to achieve a specific goal and hermetic magick which is performed either solitarily or in a pair and which is often sexual in nature internal magick is designed to produce an altered state of consciousness in participant in order to result in a process of individuation which bestows most advanced form of magick in ona system is aeonic magick practice of which is restricted to those who are already perceived to have mastered external and internal magick and attained grade of master purpose of aeonic magick is to influence large numbers of people over a lengthy period of time thus affecting development of future aeons in particular it is employed with intent of disrupting current socio political system of western world which ona believe has been corrupted by judeo christian religion thumb left 200px ona dark goddess baphomet has been described as having strong parallels with hindu goddess kali pictured ona utilises two methods in its performance of aeonic magick first entails rites and chants with intent of opening a gateway known as a nexion to acausal realm in order to manifest energies in causal realm that will influence existing aeon in practitioner s desired direction second method involves playing an advanced form of a board game known as star game game was devised by group with game pieces representing different aeons group believes that when an initiate plays game they can become a living nexion and thus a channel for acausal energies to enter causal realm and effect aeonic change an advanced form of game is used as part of training for grade of internal adept according to myatt he invented game in 1975 order promotes idea that dark gods exist within acausal realm although it is accepted that some members will interpret them not as real entities but as facets of human subconscious these entities are perceived as dangerous with ona advising caution when interacting with them among those dark gods whose identities have been discussed in order s publicly available material are a goddess named baphomet who is depicted as a mature woman carrying a severed head with ona stating that name is of ancient greek origin in addition there are entities whose names according to monette are borrowed from or influenced by figures from classical sources and astronomy such as and another of these acausal figures is termed vindex after latin word for avenger ona believe that vindex will eventually incarnate as a human although gender and ethnicity of this individual is unknown through successful of acausal energies within causal realm and that they will act as a messianic figure by overthrowing magian forces and leading ona to prominence in establishment of a new society sieg drew comparisons between this belief in vindex and ideas of savitri devi prominent esoteric regarding arrival of kalki an avatar of hindu god vishnu to earth ona also propagate idea that it is possible for practitioner to secure an afterlife within acausal realm through their spiritual activities it is for this reason that final stage of seven fold way is known as immortal constituting those initiates who have been able to advance to stage of dwelling in acausal realm human sacrifice ona s writings condone and encourage human sacrifice referring to their victims as opfers ona outline their views on human sacrifice in a number of documents a gift for prince a guide to human sacrifice culling a guide to sacrifice ii victims a sinister expose and guidelines for testing of opfers according to ona s beliefs killer must allow their victim to self select themselves this is achieved through testing victim to see if they expose perceived character faults if this proves to be case victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death and sacrifice can commence those deemed ideal for sacrifice by group include individuals perceived as being of low character members of what they deem sham satanic groups like church of satan and temple of set as well as zealous interfering and journalists business figures and political activists who disrupt group s operations ona explains that because of need for such self selection children must never be victims of sacrifice similarly ona despise animal sacrifice maintaining that it is much better to sacrifice suitable given abundance of human dross sacrifice is then carried out through either physical or magical means at which point killer is believed to absorb power from body and spirit of victim thus entering a new level of sinister consciousness as well as strengthening character of killer by heightening their connection with acausal forces of death and destruction such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by ona because they remove from society individuals whom group deems to be worthless human beings monette noted that no ona nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner but that members had joined police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing ona believe that there are historical precedents to their practice of human sacrifice expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named baphomet at spring equinox and to arcturus star in autumn however ona s advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other satanist groups like temple of set who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make satanism more socially acceptable within western nations term nine angles in its essays and other writings ona offers various differing explanations as to meaning of term nine angles one explanation is that it pertains to seven planets of group s cosmology seven angles added to system as a whole eighth angle and mystic themselves ninth angle a second explanation is that it refers to seven normal alchemical stages with an additional two processes a third is that it pertains to nine emanations of divine a concept originally found in medieval texts produced within islamic mystical tradition of sufism monette further suggested that it was a reference to a classical indian tradition which divided solar system into nine planets according to o9a they use term nine angles in reference to not only nine emanations and transformations of three basic alchemical substances mercury sulfur salt as occurs in their occult use of star game but also in reference to their hermetic journey with its seven spheres and its two acausal aspects organization ona is a secretive organization it lacks any central administration instead operating as a network of allied satanic practitioners which it terms kollective thus monette stated that order is not a structured lodge or temple but rather a movement a subculture or perhaps that its adherents choose to embody or identify with monette also suggested that this absence of a centralised structure would aid order s survival because its fate would not be invested solely in one particular leader ona dislikes term member instead favouring word associate in 2012 long stated that those affiliated with order fell into six different categories associates of traditional nexions niners gang and tribe members followers of rounwytha tradition and those involved with ona inspired groups group largely consists of autonomous cells known as nexions original cell based in shropshire is known as nexion zero with majority of subsequent groups having been established in britain ireland and germany however nexions and other associated groups have also been established in united states australia brazil egypt italy spain portugal poland serbia russia and south africa greek wing of ona goes by name miros tou zeus some of these groups such as u s based tempel ov blood describe themselves as being distinct from ona while both having been greatly influenced by it and having connections to it in ona s terminology terms and refer to folk based or gang based culture or individuals who support order s aims by practical including criminal means rather than esoteric ones one such group is white star acception who claim to have perpetrated rapes assaults and robberies in order to advance group s power sieg noted that reality of these actions has not been verified a is an artist or musician who contributes to group through their production of fine art rounwytha is a tradition of folk mystics deemed to exhibit gifted psychic powers reflecting their embodiment of sinister feminine archetype although a minority are men most rounwytha are female and they often live as part of small and often lesbian groups outer representative several academic commentators have highlighted existence of a position within ona called an outer representative who serves as an official spokesperson for group to outer world first to publicly claim to be group s outer representative was richard moult an artist and composer from shropshire who used pseudonym of christos beest moult was followed as outer representative by vilnius who held position from 1996 to 2002 and who has been identified by ona insiders as left hand path ideologue michael ford subsequently on blog of white star acception claim was made that group s member chloe ortega was ona s outer representative also this blog later became defunct by 2013 in 2013 a female american rounwytha using name of appeared claiming to be order s outer representative however according to long outer representative was an interesting and instructive example of o9a s a ploy and which was designed to intrigue select test confuse annoy mislead long wrote that ploy was for a candidate or an initiate to openly disseminate ona material and possibly give interviews about o9a to media under guise of having been given some sort of authority to do so even though such an authority and necessary hierarchy to gift such authority was in fact a contradiction of our raison d etre a fact we of course expected those incipiently of our kind to know or sense according to senholt ona does not award titles with monette writing that there is no central authority within ona within ona was a group of longstanding initiates known as old guard or inner ona whose experience with tradition led to them becoming influential over newer members who often sought their advice members of this old guard included christos beest sinister moon dark logos and pointy hat although in 2011 they stated that they would withdraw from public sphere membership thumb right 250px an issue of ona s original fenrir magazine while ona has stated that it is not an occult organization in conventional sense but an esoteric philosophy several academics have written about ona membership in a 1995 overview of british satanist groups harvey suggested that ona consisted of less than ten members and perhaps fewer than five in 1998 jeffrey kaplan and leonard weinberg stated that ona s membership was small with group acting primarily as a mail order ministry regarding question of membership anton long in a letter to aquino dated october 1990 wrote that once techniques and essence of ona are more widely available then membership as such is irrelevant since everything is available and accessible with individual taking responsibility for their own development their own experiences in 2013 senholt noted that because group has no official membership it is difficult if not impossible to estimate number of ona members senholt suggested that a rough estimate of total number of individuals involved with ona in some capacity from 1980 to 2009 was a few thousand he had come to this conclusion from an examination of number of magazines and journals about subject circulated and number of members of online discussion groups devoted to ona at same time he thought that number of longtime adherents is much smaller also in 2013 monette estimated that there were over two thousand ona associates broadly defined he believed that gender balance was roughly equal although with regional variation and differences among particular nexions introvigne noted that if monette s estimate was correct it would mean that ona is easily largest satanist organization in world according to a recent survey ona has more female supporters than either church of satan or temple of set more women with children more older supporters more supporters who are better established in socio economic terms and more who politically are further to right j r lewis satanic attitudes in asbjorn james r lewis jesper a petersen editors invention of satanism oxford university press 2015 p 191 pp 194 196 legacy and influence ona s main influence lies not with group itself but with its prolific release of written material according to senholt ona has produced more material on both practical and theoretical aspects of magic as well as more ideological texts on satanism and left hand path in general than larger groups such as church of satan and temple of set has produced in combination which makes ona an important player in theoretical discussion of what left hand path and satanism is and should be according to practitioners these writings were initially distributed to other satanist and neo nazi groups although with development of internet this was also used as a medium to propagate its writings with monette expressing view that they had attained a sizable presence in occult cyberspace and thus become one of most prominent left hand path groups by virtue of its public presence many of these writings were then reproduced by other groups kaplan considered ona to be an important source of satanic ideology theology for occultist fringe of national socialism namely neo nazi groups like black order group gained increased attention following growth in public interest in myatt s impact on terrorist groups during war on terror in 2000s historian of esotericism dave evans stated that ona were worthy of an entire phd thesis while senholt expressed view that it would be potentially dangerous to ignore these fanatics however limited their numbers might be according to a report by civil rights group southern poverty law center ona holds an important position in niche international nexus of occult esoteric and or satanic neo nazi groups ona influence extends to some black metal bands such as i kaos who according to a report in music section of la weekly attribute their purpose and themes to philosophies of order of nine angles although as of december 2018 band is no longer involved with ona french band is named after an o9a deity and takes direct lyrical influence from o9a album intra naos by italian band altar of perversion is named after o9a essay naos a practical guide to modern magick and showcases band members own path through numinous way some music associated with o9a has also been controversial quietus published a series of articles during 2018 exploring connections between far right politics music and ona beyond iron gates how nazi satanists infiltrated uk underground quietus november 27 2018 in february 2019 several newspapers reported that o9a was linked to a number of high profile figures from far right and to neo nazi groups such as atomwaffen division national action uk and division uk branch of atomwaffen division children
