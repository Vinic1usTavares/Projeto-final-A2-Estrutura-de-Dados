past decades between 1990 and 2010 access to improved sanitation increased from 67 to 82 but access to improved water source s increased only slightly from 89 to 94 in particular coverage in rural areas lags behind furthermore despite improvements quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate for example only 73 of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25 of wastewater generated in country underwent any kind of treatment overview a comprehensive sector policy introduced in 1994 aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in poorest parts of country where utilities were not performing well

sanitation regulation commission cra and superintendency of residential public services sspd a multi sector regulatory agency service provision is responsibility of 1 500 water and sanitation service providers in urban areas and probably more than 12 000 communal organizations providing services in rural and peri urban areas while most urban service providers are public in 2004 there were 125 private and 48 mixed public private water companies in country cost recovery in sector has improved substantially between 1990 and 2001 average tariff for water and sanitation in colombia increased from us 0 32 m3 to us 0 81 m3 equivalent to an increase of 153 p 34 as a result 24 of investments were self financed by utilities in 2004 other features of sector are existence of some large well performing public companies a strong and stable participation by local private sector in service provision and some well performing community based organizations in peri urban areas recently government of alvaro uribe has initiated a number of complementary policies to accelerate increases in access to water and sanitation services such as strengthening of roles of departments in governance of sector a program for marginal urban neighborhoods and an increase in investments for wastewater treatment p 65 access in 2015 in colombia 91 of population had access to improved water 97

especially in poor neighborhoods which results in combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows wastewater treatment in 2006 25 of wastewater generated in country underwent some kind of treatment remaining 75 is discharged without any treatment contaminating a significant part of natural water resources history water and sanitation sector in colombia underwent one cycle of centralization and decentralization within past several decades since enactment of a comprehensive new sector policy in 1994 various governments have pursued same set of basic policies including targeted transfers to municipalities private sector participation regulation cost recovery and a system of cross subsidies centralization 1950s to late 1980s in first half of 20th century municipalities were responsible for provision of basic water and sanitation services in colombia in 1950 similar to many other countries a centralized system was adopted and instituto de fomento municipal insfopal or municipal development institute was created empresas de acueducto y alcantarillado acuas or departmental water and sewerage companies were created consisting of departments municipalities and insfopal which took care of managing and maintaining infrastructure of member communities in that way investment at national level was channelled into this important area of public health in 1976 within framework of a change in sector policies acuas were transformed into empresas de obras sanitarias or sanitary works companies at regional or municipal level which were put in charge of financing planning developing and managing public services in most municipalities however some municipalities kept responsibility for service provision at local level and created municipal companies most notable case are empresas publicas de medellin epm a municipally owned multi sector utility created in 1955 at national level water sector institutionally depended on ministry of health p 58 decentralization late 1980s to 1993 in 1980s sector was in crisis characterized by low investment poor cost recovery and poor service quality in most of country as a result government decided to break up insfopal at end of 1980s and to devolve responsibility for service provision back to municipalities after four decades except for some cases like valle de cauca department where regional companies continued providing services furthermore institutional responsibility for sector was transferred from ministry of health to ministry of economic development this change was not only an administrative change but it introduced a different focus and perspective to sector new financing system and public private partnerships 1994 2006 two liberal governments of cesar gaviria 1990 1994 and ernesto 1994 1998 pursued a policy of economic opening and business modernization in spirit of these policies government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in poorest parts of country where public utilities were not performing well establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at national level increased cost recovery and protecting poorest through cross subsidies in form of area based tariffs basis of this sector policy was established by law 142 of july 1994 at end of president cesar gaviria s term of office with some modifications to that law in 2001 same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments in 1995 first water and sanitation concession in colombia was given to a mixed public private company in city of cartagena followed by a second concession in barranquilla in 1996 and more concessions in next years in 2002 government launched a program of business modernization to introduce private sector participation also in small and medium sized municipalities leading to significant improvements in quality and efficiency of service provision in some municipalities drinking water use has decreased by 25 between 1996 and 2001 tariff increases and inclusion of low income users who did not have access to piped water before influenced this trend p 7 creation of a vice ministry for water and sanitation and departmental plans since 2006 government of alvaro uribe wants to rapidly increase coverage overtaking millennium development goals for sector and to improve service quality especially in small towns and rural areas which have highest requirement of service improvement at end of 2006 a vice ministry for water and sanitation was created it has initiated four new programs departmental water and sanitation plans programa de saneamiento para spa or sanitation program for settlements within framework of an integral quarter improvement program municipal waste water sanitation program saver to increase rate of treated municipal water handwashing program water storage campaign departmental water and sanitation plans program provides such services as planning and harmonizing resources and has regional systems of service provision at level of each department of country program was first implemented in four departments which have some of most difficult conditions sucre cordoba magdalena and la guajira program also aimed to overcome sector s fragmentation into many small utilities to benefit from economies of scale in 2010 30 departmental plans were completed and published covering almost all of country s 32 departments in about 2011 responsibility for water supply and sanitation and with it vice ministry was transferred to newly created ministry of housing cities and territories as of august 2012 vice ministry s website made no more reference to departmental water and sanitation plans handwashing program spa and saver were still in place in addition two new programs were started a water culture cultura del agua program that combats apathy and lack of interest concerning water utilities promotes water reuse and protection of watersheds and fights water losses illegal connections and non payment of water bills a transparent water program to ensure greater visibility and a wider implication of various stakeholders in water projects especially during an early stage of implementation responsibility for water supply and sanitation 350px thumb a map of colombia current responsibilities and policies in water and sanitation sector in colombia are primarily defined in 1991 constitution and in law 142 of 1994 ley de servicios publicos domiciliarios or public housing services law policy and regulation vice ministry of water and sanitation created in october 2006 within ministry of environment housing and territorial development is in charge of setting sector policy this sector policy is defined in framework of national policy established by departamento nacional de dnp or national planning department responsibility for regulating water services is vested in two separate institutions at national level comision de de agua potable y saneamiento cra or potable water and basic sanitation regulatory commission defines criteria for efficient service provision and sets rules for tariff revision but is not in charge of controlling application of these rules latter is responsibility of superintendencia de servicios publicos domiciliarios sspd or superintendency for residential public services a multi sector regulatory agency government aims at improving performance of water and sanitation sector through 1 strengthening regulatory framework 2 implementing technical assistance programs 3 providing financial support to promote modernization and efficient management as well as to subsidize poor and 4 rationalizing institutional framework at national level to improve coordination in sector government also supports private sector participation in sector service provision colombian municipalities are responsible for ensuring that their inhabitants are given domestic services of water supply and sanitation in an efficient way by public companies therefore public utilities are directly responsible for service provision except for some special cases defined in law in which municipalities can offer services directly in rural areas and some marginal urban areas communal water boards also offer water supply services over last few years number of companies has increased and direct service provision by municipalities has decreased to simplify process of changing suppliers ownership structure municipal utilities were transformed into public stock corporations which allow private sector participation without a further change of legal status in 2006 53 of all suppliers were public companies remainder being direct municipal suppliers 15 private companies 12 official companies which are companies that are not specialized in water and sanitation 13 mixed companies 6 and authorized organizations 1 p 8 smaller utilities included there are more than 1 500 water and sanitation service providers of in urban areas and probably more than 12 000 communal organizations providing services in rural areas sector is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation which makes it difficult to realize economies of scale according to a world bank study to solve this problem creation of regional companies has been suggested urban areas most colombian cities including three largest ones bogota medellin and cali are served by public utilities however private sector also plays an important role including 125 private and 48 mixed public private water companies in 2004 out of 1 500 urban service providers public utilities thumb 240px headquarters of empresas publicas de medellin in medellin some of colombia s larger cities are home to well performing public utilities some of them providing multiple services others being specialized in water and sanitation only empresas publicas de medellin or public companies of medellin is a municipally owned multi sector utility in charge of water supply sanitation solid waste management electricity generation and distribution as well as local telecommunications in medellin and its surrounding areas another multi sector utility is empresas municipales de cali emcali which provides fixed line local telecoms internet potable water sewage and electricity services to some 600 000 clients emcali has suffered financially due to onerous payment obligations resulting from a power purchase agreement signed in 1997 with an independent power producer capital of colombia bogota is served by a water and sanitation utility empresa de acueducto y alcantarillado de bogota eaab private sector participation 300px thumb cartagena private sector participation in colombia s water and sanitation sector has been much more stable than in some other latin american countries for example private water concessions in buenos aires argentina many other cities in argentina as well as in la paz and cochabamba bolivia were terminated before their term expired in 2004 there were 125 private and 48 mixed public private water companies in colombia including large medium and small companies private sector involvement in colombian water sector began in 1995 in cartagena with support from world bank most important examples are in cartagena barranquilla santa marta monteria palmira and operators are to a large extent colombian overall performance of utilities with private sector participation has improved in some cases spectacularly and some such as barranquilla have had impressive successes in expanding coverage to urban poor according to a world bank report key to success of private sector participation in colombian water sector has been development of homegrown solutions and at times skillfully adapting models used elsewhere to particular circumstances and culture of colombia world bank s private participation in infrastructure database shows private investment commitments in water supply and sanitation of us 940 million from 1995 to 2006 through 51 transactions including 27 classified as concessions 22 as management and lease contracts and 2 as greenfield projects small towns and peri urban areas in some smaller towns and peri urban areas there are examples of successful provision of water supply and sanitation services by community organizations and regional companies which in some cases set an example in terms of community empowerment transparency and accountability an example of a regional association is s a esp which provides drinking water and sanitation to 582 000 inhabitants in 33 municipalities of valle del cauca department it was founded as a non profit public limited company in 1959 shareholders of company are valle del cauca department corporacion autonoma regional del valle del and 33 municipalities which are served by utility another example is junta del acueducto la sirena en el valle del cauca water board la sirena in southwestern outskirts of cali which manages 778 residential connections offering continuous service to some 4 200 users it operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant water consumption is metered average monthly tariff is us 3 5 for 28m3 there is no social stratification but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3 annual cash surplus is about us 10 000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance and in some cases in construction works in this way in last 3 years a water capture facility was constructed in quebrada epaminondas another one at melendez river was improved and a water tank with a capacity of was constructed another example is asociacion acueducto de rio negro de which was formed 10 years ago integrating 10 supply systems supplying 7 000 residential connections association is preparing its own water treatment plant and preparing to install meters with aid of colombian organization asociados en desarrollo rural adr or associates in rural development and united states agency for international development usaid rural areas coverage in rural areas is unusually low given level of economic development and sector development using a broad definition of access based on who definition of an improved water source access in rural areas in colombia was 71 while it was 81 in honduras a considerably poorer country and 89 in ecuador also a poorer country than colombia in addition to armed conflict there are other explanations for this situation municipalities tend to use their financial resources from sistema general de or general participation system law 715 of 2001 mainly in urban areas furthermore there is no institution or program at national level which offers technical assistance to 12 000 rural community organizations law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to departments but these have not carried out task in a satisfactory way so far 2002 rural isr or rural sanitary register confirms that situation only 21 of rural community organizations were considered able to carry out maintenance and only 10 to commercially operate service only 32 issued bills and only 10 used metering in 2005 government defined guidelines for basic water supply and sanitation policy in rural areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas in addition a gis study published in 2014 documented that for many rural areas time needed to drive to water testing labs than is longer than sample is viable innovative approaches since 1994 colombia has pioneered many innovative approaches for basic service provision in general and for water supply and sanitation in particular some of them were introduced at national level while others were initiated in one city or region notable innovations at national level are introduction of two autonomous economic regulatory agencies one cra to develop and fine tune regulatory tools in water and sanitation sector and another one sspd to implement them in across all basic services in 1994 introduction of socio economic strata as a basis for spatially differentiated tariffs also in 1994 and spatial aggregation of municipal service providers in small towns at departmental level to benefit from economies of scale since 2006 with strong support from national government a notable innovation initiated by a city or a region is creation of mixed public private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in cartagena followed by barranquilla and other northern and central cities and towns another innovation is an association of community based organizations cbos providing water supply in rural and peri urban areas in departments of el valle cauca and in southwestern colombia it began in late 1990s with assistance of universidad del valle in cali in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen cbos capacity to administrate operate and maintain their water systems global water partnership colombia association of community organizations and integrated water resources management without date in addition colombia boasts one of oldest and largest multi utilities in latin america empresas publicas de medellin epm created in 1955 efficiency average level of non revenue water physical and economic losses in colombia in 2006 is estimated to be 49 this level is higher than latin american average approximately 40 and regulatory goal of 30 in past national average of non revenue water was estimated 40 in 2001 which is almost same as in 1990 p 85 in largest cities of country levels of non revenue water are below national average 40 in bogota 35 in medellin and 39 in cali financial aspects tariffs colombian tariff system is defined in ley de servicios publicos or public services law from 1994 it is applied in public mixed and private companies tariff system aims at reconciling achievement of cost recovery with protection of poor basic tariff is calculated on basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at national level by cra law 287 of 2004 therefore in principle tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government s decisions to raise tariffs or not but only because of different costs of services p 19 base tariff of each service provider has to be adjusted by law for different geographic areas within city each assumed to correspond to one socio economic class according to adjustment factors that are specified by law this system of area based tariffs is supposed to provide cross subsidies from more affluent to poorer users every municipality has defined geographic areas that each correspond to one of six socio economic classes class 1 represents lowest income group while class 6 stands for highest as per 2007 tariff adjustment factors were following class tariff adjustment factor 1 30 2 60 3 85 4 100 5 120 6 120 there are many more citizens who live in areas corresponding to classes 1 3 than those who live in areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6 for example in bogota 73 of population live in zones of classes 1 3 whereas only 10 live in zones classified as 5 and 6 consequently tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by national government p 56 between 1990 and 2001 average tariff for water and sanitation in colombia increased from us 0 32 m3 to us 0 81 m3 equivalent to an increase of 153 in 2006 average monthly bill for residential customers was about us 6 80 for water supply and us 4 60 for sanitation services free basic water inspired by human right to water two important cities in colombia make a basic amount of water vital de agua potable available to their poorest residents free of charge in 2009 medellin made 2 5 cubic meters of water per month and per person or 10 cubic meters for a family of four available for free to all urban residents in class 1 city wants to reach 45 000 households and has budgeted 25 billion pesos usd 14 million to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns in february 2012 bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2 covering more than 1 5 million households or 39 of all households annual cost is estimated at 60 billion pesos usd 33

private financing increased from almost zero to become a significant share of total investment furthermore despite a drop in 2001 investment in sector has increased since 1999 figures were calculated on basis of data obtained from ministry of environment housing and territorial development general national budget budgets allocated through public hearings audiencia publica process and a business modernization program called plan pacifico program resources of fondo nacional de transfers established by law 715 sspd private utilities and a survey about investment climate sspd forecasts a total investment of us 2 2 billion 4 922 billion colombian pesos in water and sanitation sector from 2007 to 2017 p 24 it is however not clear if this forecast uses all sources of funding included in estimate of past investment so figures may not be comparable minister of environment housing and territorial development announced in may 2008 that us 5 2 million 9 2 billion colombian pesos1 colombian peso us 0 2008 05 01 will be spent in order to facilitate construction of facilities in areas without access to drinking water national government will control destination of resources and guarantees transparency in whole spending process according to minister colombia should already have reached full drinking water coverage given past investments in sector financing according to ministry investments were mainly financed through three sources self financing funding by national government and charges for extraction of petroleum and carbon a world bank study estimates an investment of us in 2004 which was financed as follows us 26 by companies through self financing us 61 by state funding through sgp us 49m 12 by regionales car or regional autonomous corporations us 5m 1 by other sources according to report average annual transfers from national government to municipalities for water supply and sanitation including solid waste were about us between 1998 and 2001 86 of that funding was allocated through sgp as defined in law 715 a certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation p 62 they mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels nevertheless many municipalities use funding through sgp dedicated for water supply and sanitation for other purposes p 61 car receive property tax electric
