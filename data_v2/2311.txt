holkham national nature reserve is england s largest national nature reserve nnr it is on norfolk coast between burnham overy staithe and blakeney and is managed by natural england with cooperation of holkham estate its comprise a wide range of habitats including grazing marsh woodland salt marsh sand dunes and foreshore reserve is part of north norfolk coast site of special scientific interest and larger area is additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa and ramsar listings and is part of both an area of outstanding natural beauty aonb and a world biosphere reserve holkham nnr is important for its wintering wildfowl especially pink footed geese eurasian wigeon and brant geese but it also has breeding waders and attracts many migrating birds in autumn a number of scarce invertebrates and plants can be found in dunes and reserve is one of only two sites in uk to have an antlion colony this stretch of coast originally consisted of salt marshes protected from sea by ridges of shingle and sand and holkham s iron age fort stood at end of a sandy spit surrounded by tidal wetland vikings navigated creeks to establish holkham village but access to former harbour was stopped by drainage and reclamation of marshes between coast and shingle ridge which started in 17th century and was completed in 1859 holkham estate has been owned by coke family later earls of leicester since 1609 and their seat at holkham hall is opposite reserve s lady anne s drive entrance 3rd earl planted pines on dunes to protect pastures reclaimed by his predecessors from wind blown sand national nature reserve was created in 1967 from of holkham estate and of foreshore belonging to crown reserve has over 100 000 visitors a year including birdwatchers and horse riders and is therefore significant for local economy nnr has taken steps to control entry to fragile dunes and other areas important for their animals or plants because of damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access dunes are an essential natural defence against projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast description thumb 400px publicly accessible part of nnr pasture

site of special scientific interest sssi notification document to be among best in europe flora is exceptionally diverse holkham also has good examples of sand dunes and pines planted on dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established making this only substantial area of woodland in north norfolk coast sssi dunes are created and altered by elements and sand islands in holkham bay have formed only within last 60 years flat ground inland from dunes is reclaimed salt marsh that was used as pasture until 1940s but converted to arable land during world war ii value of fields to wildlife was reduced by resulting lower water table but natural england s management measures have raised water levels attracting breeding and wintering birds water management can also be used to ensure a high water table in summer benefiting breeding waders and drier conditions in winter preferred by geese management of water levels and grassland increased numbers of breeding wetland birds from 120 pairs of ten species in 1986 to 795 pairs of 26 species in 1994 and number of wintering birds of four key wildfowl species rose from 1 215 to 17 305 in decade from 1983 84 history alt

modern and neanderthal people were present in area between 100 000 and 10 000 years ago before last glaciation and humans returned as ice retreated northwards archaeological record is poor until about 20 000 years ago partly because of then prevailing very cold conditions but also because coastline was much further north than at present as ice retreated during mesolithic 10 000 5 000 bce sea level rose filling what is now north sea this brought norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are now under sea in an area now known as doggerland retrieved 18 september

difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns and also for wintering geese plants can be trampled which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle liley 2008 pp 10 14 discovery of nationally rare tiny earthstar fungus at holkham led its finders to state that survival of this species in britain would undoubtedly benefit from construction of a boardwalk across this fragile and frequently visited habitat little tern colony at holkham holding seven per cent of british population is cordoned off in breeding season with signs explaining why people are excluded from area dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it leading to blowout rapid wind erosion of sand boardwalks and

september 2012 as climate becomes warmer in future there is likely to be more tourism pressure on coasts but effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower impact activities like bathing norfolk coast partnership a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies divide coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes holkham dunes along with holme dunes and blakeney point were considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure and were designated as red zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended rest

scolt head island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3 5 m 10 ft per year this may affect movement of sediment and lead to some erosion of dunes and beaches at holkham but should not destroy
