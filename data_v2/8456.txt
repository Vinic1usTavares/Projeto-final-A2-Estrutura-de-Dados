thumb b reactor in june 1944 in april 1941 matthias was called to active duty by united states army as a first lieutenant and joined construction division of army corps of engineers where he received rapid promotion on 14 december 1942 as a 34 year old lieutenant colonel he accompanied colonel kenneth nichols to wilmington delaware to discuss location of a proposed plutonium production plant with representatives of dupont at this point matthias had not yet been assigned to manhattan project whose mission was to build an atomic bomb but he had worked on some special studies for it and had worked with its director brigadier general leslie r groves jr on construction of pentagon he was already groves s choice for area engineer for plutonium project initially intention had been to locate plutonium plant with manhattan project s other production facilities at clinton engineer works in oak ridge tennessee but concerns had arisen about dangers of an atomic explosion and knoxville lay only away a larger site was required where facilities could be separated from each other it had to be in a sparsely populated but accessible area with access to abundant water and electric power when he returned from meeting matthias was met by groves who instructed him to take a survey team and find a suitable site matthias surveyed four sites in california and washington and chose area around richland washington matthias later recalled that thumb left hanford workers awaiting paychecks at western union office because of isolation of site known as hanford engineer works matthias exercised more administrative autonomy than manhattan project s other area engineers number of personnel assigned to his office grew to over 500 in 1944 construction work commenced on site in april 1943 size of construction work force eventually reached 44 900 in june 1944 over 150 000 workers were employed at site between 1943 and 1946 scale of task was enormous matthias supervised construction of 554 buildings of roads of railroad track three chemical separation plants and world s first three production scale nuclear reactors chemical separation plants where plutonium was separated from uranium slugs that had been irradiated in reactors were so large that they were known as queen marys after ocean liner because slugs were dangerously radioactive queen marys had concrete walls thick and operations were by remote control first production batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at separation plant on 26 december 1944 and in january 1945 matthias personally couriered first batch of plutonium nitrate to los angeles where he handed it over to another courier who took it to los alamos laboratory plutonium from hanford would be used in fat man bomb used in bombing of nagasaki for his wartime services he was awarded distinguished service medal later life matthias left army in 1946 and went to brazil as a project manager for construction for a hydroelectric facility eventually becoming manager of engineering at brazilian traction late in 1951 he joined aluminum company of canada alcan as project manager of engineering and construction of kemano kitimat hydroelectric dam and aluminum smelter project in northern british columbia in 1956 he moved to montreal as its director of engineering and worked on chute des passes project in 1960 he joined kaiser engineering in oakland california as its vice president for heavy construction and hydroelectric engineering and was its vice president of transportation projects from 1970 to 1973 he retired in 1973 at age of 65 matthias

including kaiser engineering pacific gas and electric louisiana pacific and bechtel he was a member of advisory board of california water resources association committee on large dams committee on construction of nuclear facilities and american society of civil engineers he also wrote chapter on construction services in handbook of heavy construction 1971 in 1993 he was informed that he had cancer of lungs liver and pancreas he died six week later on 3 december 1993 at a nursing home in walnut creek california he was survived by his son michael and younger brother carl his second wife
