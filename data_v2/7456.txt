hurricane marie is tied as seventh most intense pacific hurricane on record attaining a barometric pressure of 918 mbar hpa 27 11 inhg in august 2014 on august 10 a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa over atlantic ocean some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place but dry air soon impinged upon system and imparted weakening wave tracked westward across atlantic and caribbean for several days on august 19 an area of low pressure consolidated within wave west of central america with favorable atmospheric conditions convective activity and banding features increased around system and by august 22 system acquired enough organization to be classified as tropical depression thirteen e while situated about 370 mi 595 km south southeast of acapulco mexico development was initially fast paced as depression acquired tropical storm force winds within six hours of formation and hurricane force by august 23 however due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled and for a time it remained a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale on august 24 marie developed an eye and rapidly intensified to a category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph 260 km h at its peak hurricane s gale force winds spanned an area 575 mi 925 km across marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on august 25 which prompted steady weakening over next several days marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere on august 29 after having lost all signs of organized deep convection marie degenerated into a remnant low large system gradually wound down over following several days with winds subsiding below gale force on august 30 remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on september 2 about 1 200 mi 1 950 km northeast of hawaii although hurricane marie s center remained well away from land throughout its entire existence its large size brought increased surf to areas from southwestern mexico northward to southern california off coast of los cabos three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas in colima and oaxaca heavy rains from outer bands caused flooding resulting in two fatalities similar effects were felt across baja california sur toward end of august marie brought one of largest hurricane related surf events to southern california in decades swells of battered coastal areas with structural damage occurring on santa catalina island and in greater los angeles area a breakwater near long beach sustained 10 million worth of damage with portions gouged out one person drowned in surf near malibu hundreds of ocean rescues including over 100 in malibu alone were attributed to storm and overall losses reached 20 million meteorological history on august 10 national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a westward moving tropical wave emerging off west coast of africa centered along accompanied by disorganized convective activity development if any was expected to be slow a broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within wave about halfway between africa and cape verde islands embedded within an elongated trough weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on august 11 across a large area southwest of cape verde islands but surface low had dissipated by this time development was no longer expected over following days as dry air created a hostile area for storm organization wave continued westward across atlantic and entered caribbean sea on august 16 subsequent interactions with south america and an upper level trough inhibited improvement of system beginning on august 17 nhc anticipated that a low pressure area would form within five days to south of gulf of tehuantepec in east pacific with a 30 chance of tropical cyclogenesis by next day wave was located over panama and nhc upgraded potential for development to 60 wave crossed into eastern pacific with accompanying convection developing a low pressure area on august 19 conditions were favorable for further development and thunderstorms increased and became better organized on august 20 after an increase in rainbands and outflow around well defined center nhc classified system as tropical depression thirteen e early on august 22 about 370 mi 595 km south southeast of acapulco mexico a strong ridge over southern united states later expanding into northern mexico steered system on a west northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone conditions were favorable for nascent depression to strengthen statistical hurricane intensity prediction scheme model predicted system would become a category 4 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale when system was only a tropical depression only six hours after nhc issued its first advisory agency upgraded depression to tropical storm marie thirteenth named storm of 2014 season storm very quickly organized developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear on august 23 nhc upgraded marie to hurricane status and an eye began forming later that day on next day as storm rapidly intensified eye became much more distinct and was surrounded by a powerful eyewall during this phase storm wobbled shifting due west before resuming its previous motion at 18 00 utc on august 24 marie attained category 5 status on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale first such pacific hurricane since celia in 2010 nhc estimated peak sustained winds of 160 mph 260 km h based on a dvorak t number of 7 0 provided by and sab they also estimated marie s minimum barometric pressure at 918 mbar hpa 27 11 inhg ranking as seventh strongest in pacific east of international date line since records began in 1949 coincidentally hurricane odile attained same pressure just three weeks later at its peak marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm force winds covering an area 575 mi 925 km across shortly after marie attained peak intensity convection weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle in which an outer eye formed storm also weakened due to gradually decreasing water temperatures by early on august 26 eye became much less defined double eye feature persisted through that day although outer eyewall opened up as thunderstorms weakened further late on august 27 marie weakened to tropical storm status by which time circulation became exposed from convection a strengthening ridge near california caused storm to accelerate more to west northwest into an area of cooler waters and dry air failing to produce any additional convection marie degenerated into a remnant low late on august 28 residual circulation gradually wound down as it continued northwest through august 29 system continued to produce gale force winds turning west and later west southwest within a weak easterly flow marie slowly moved across open pacific while remaining a broad weak cyclone former cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on september 2 about 1 200 mi 1 950 km northeast of hawaii preparations and impacts mexico although core of hurricane marie remained well offshore a green alert was issued for guerrero and oaxaca and a blue minimal alert was issued for jalisco colima michoacan and chiapas heavy rains in oaxaca triggered flooding and landslides with districts of and being most affected five people were swept away by a swollen river all were wounded but later rescued a portion of federal highway 200 and a bridge were closed approximately 10 000 people were in need of assistance and a disaster declaration was requested for state of oaxaca storm surge in colima destroyed four buildings and damaged ten more flooding along and san nicolas rivers resulted in two fatalities minor flooding also occurred near acapulco and in colima where waves pounded coast in guadalajara numerous trees were downed and 12 shops were closed off coast of los cabos in baja california sur large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on august 25 four were able to swim back to shore while other three remained missing and were later presumed dead strong rain bands along outer fringes of hurricane marie brought heavy rain to parts of state landslides blocked several roads near los cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines owing to dangerous conditions all schools los cabos were closed on august 25 united states thumb large swells at wedge at newport beach california owing to size of marie increased surf was anticipated well north of hurricane high surf advisories were issued in california for greater los angeles area forecasters at local national weather service office warned residents in los angeles and ventura counties could potentially see largest surf in recent years generated by a hurricane swells of were anticipated with risk of coastal flooding and structural damage advisories were also issued for orange and santa barbara counties surf in region ultimately reached along south facing shores while west facing beaches only saw waves up to combination of large swells high tide and powerful south to north longshore currents impeded by bight formed by palos verdes peninsula resulted in significant coastal flooding in seal beach a four block area of oceanfront property was affected several apartments were left with inches of water on ground floor severe beach erosion resulted in loss of 10 000 20 000 yd3 7 600 15 200 m3 of sand a state of emergency was declared to assist with restoration efforts near malibu pier several surfers were caught in rough swells and knocked into each other one struck a rock was knocked unconscious and drowned malibu pier itself sustained some damage and a lifeguard house built in 1950s was destroyed north of malibu one structure fell into ocean los angeles county fire department assisted with over 115 ocean rescues on august 26 more than 170 rescues were made following day including 73 at famous surfing spot wedge in newport beach thumb left breaches along middle breakwater in long beach california significant flooding also occurred in and around port of long beach army corps of engineers was sent out to inspect significant damage to middle breakwater at long beach eleven sections of breakwater sustained major damage including three areas which were completely gouged out along breakwater of it sustained major damage saw significant damage and a further experienced moderate damage several hundred tons of rock were estimated to have been dislodged by storm nearby san pedro and long beach breakwaters saw substantial damage as well though not as severe as middle breakwater debris from navy mole breakwater damaged a roadway near sea launch commander within long beach breach resulted in roughly 3 million in damage to nearby terminals two barges and a pleasure craft were loosed from their anchors by surging waves and had to be towed back two terminals had to close due to dangerous conditions for workers less than two weeks after marie hurricane norbert threatened to bring further increased surf to area with breakwater yet to be repaired a large sand berm was reinforced along beaches and residents were supplied with sandbags thumb repair work along middle breakwater on october 29 army corps estimated that it would take more than 20 million to repair just major breaches along middle breakwater on september 18 connolly pacific co was contracted for 5m to repair twelve worst affected areas of breakwaters and construction began on october 8 an estimated 20 000 30 000 tons of rock would be used in project a 200 000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around navy mole including pier f j south and navy mole road this was later increased to 4 million by long beach board of harbor commissioners in january 2015 on santa catalina island boulders estimated to weigh were tossed inland by surf substantial damage took place at avalon harbor where many dry docked boats were knocked off their stands harbor was littered with debris for several days mainly pieces of lumber a pier at white s landing was also partially destroyed a boat was tossed onshore at pebbly beach into catalina laundry only laundry business on island building and a nearby were deemed total losses damage at beach was deemed worst since september 1997 when hurricane linda brought large swells to region catalina express ferry halted service on august 27 due to rough seas damage across catalina island was estimated to be 3 5 million total losses in california amounted to nearly 20 million see also hurricane linda 1997 hurricane rick 2009 hurricane celia 2010 list of category 5 pacific hurricanes list of california hurricanes other tropical cyclones named marie notes
