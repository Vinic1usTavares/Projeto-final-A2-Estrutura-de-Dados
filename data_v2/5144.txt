kalinin was one of six s officially known as project 26 built for soviet navy in russian far east from components shipped from european russia during world war ii ship was one of last pair constructed known as project 26bis2 subclass completed at end of 1942 and assigned to pacific fleet she saw no action during soviet japanese war in 1945 and served into cold war sometimes serving as a flagship her post war career was uneventful until she was disarmed and converted into a floating barracks in 1960 she was scrapped in early 1960s description design of kirovs was derived from italian light cruisers modified to suit their more powerful armament wright 2010 p 127 pair of project 26bis2 ships were slightly larger than earlier project 26 and 26bis ships and were fitted with a different anti aircraft armament kalinin was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of and had a draught between ship displaced at standard load and at full load her crew numbered 812 officers and men during wartime yakubov worth p 84 kirov class ships were powered by two sets of tv 7 geared steam turbines each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by six yarrow normand boilers turbines were designed to produce which was intended to give ships a speed of wright 2010 p 146 on her sea trials kalinin only reached from without overload power she was only capable of in 1945 ship normally carried of fuel oil at full load and at overload this gave her an endurance of at with overload fuel yakubov worth p 90 armament protection and sensors main battery of kirov class consisted of nine b 1 p guns in three triple gun turrets a superfiring pair forward of superstructure and one aft unlike her earlier half sisters built in european russia her secondary armament initially consisted of eight single 34 k anti aircraft aa guns mounted on each side of rear funnel because b 34 guns originally intended to be used had run into production problems 34 k guns were a stop gap until army 52 k aa gun could be mated with mount of 34 k and put into production as 90 k they replaced 34 k guns in may 1943 light aa guns initially consisted of six semi automatic 21 k aa guns ten fully automatic 70 k aa guns and six machine guns but were significantly increased during war by 1945 kalinin had exchanged her 21 k guns for nine additional 70 k aa guns of which four were mounted on turret roofs and others in superstructure by 1957 her light anti aircraft armament consisted of only nine powered twin gun 37 mm v 11 mounts wright 2010 p 131 yakubov worth pp 86 87 six 39 yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings one on each broadside cruiser was designed rails to carry between 100 and 164 mines and racks for fifty depth charges chernyshev kulagin pp 31 34 but by 1945 she could carry 100 106 mines and she had been fitted with two or four throwers for her 66 depth charges wright 2010 p 138 project 26bis and project 26bis2 cruisers shared same armor configuration waterline armor belt turret and barbette armor were all thick deck armor was thick while that of conning tower was thick chernyshev kulagin p 15 initially built without a sonar kalinin received lend lease asdic 132 system which soviets called drakon 132 as well as experimental soviet mars 72 system by 1945 yakubov worth p 88 as built she lacked any radars but by 1944 she was equipped with british and american lend lease radars as well as soviet designed systems a british type 291 and an american sg radar were used for air search a pair of soviet yupiter 1 radars were used for main battery fire control while anti aircraft fire control was provided by two british type 282 radars she was planned to be equipped with a single zk 2b catapult on centerline between her funnels with capacity for two kor 2 seaplanes but was completed without catapult which could not be shipped from besieged leningrad in time in place of catapult six 70 k guns were added catapult was later installed with kalinin conducting sea trials with catapult and kor 2 in 1945 catapult was removed in october 1947 as radar had superseded use of aircraft to correct ship s gunfire chernyshev kulagin pp 38 39 wright 2010 p 143 service kalinin was one of two project 26bis2 cruisers third pair of kirov class cruisers she was assembled at newly constructed shipyard no 199 komsomolsk on amur as yard number 7 from components built at shipyard no 189 in leningrad she was laid down on 12 august 1938 launched from drydock on 8 may 1942 and towed down amur river to vladivostok for completion her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from factories in european russia and poorly built drydock for example her propellers had to be shipped from leningrad after it had been surrounded by germans and her propeller shafts had to be transported from factory in stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by germans wright 2008 p 311 cruiser joined pacific fleet on 31 december after completing her sea trials chernyshev and kulagin p 49 and officially entered service exactly a month later when soviet naval jack was raised aboard her berezhnoy pp 144 145 upon her entry into service kalinin became flagship of detachment of light forces of pacific fleet she conducted combat training in ussuri bay screened by minesweepers subchasers and torpedo boats in addition to air cover provided by anti submarine aircraft she was ordered to prepare for transfer to soviet northern fleet together with destroyer via northern sea route on 24 april 1943 due to soviet belief that northern fleet was weaker than its german opponents she was scheduled for departure on 25 june during may extensive preparations were made for voyage at shipyard no 202 which included installation of special propellers with removable blades and strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure after transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 june kalinin was removed from drydock although alterations remained in place until may 1944 she was under repair during soviet invasion of manchuria in 1945 not having been slated for inclusion in operation kalinin was declared best ship in pacific fleet for her training performance during 1946 winning four prizes cruiser became part of 5th fleet between 17 january 1947 and 23 may 1953 when pacific fleet was temporarily split she went to sea in 1951 for gunnery testing under flag of 5th

period on routine training missions until she was mothballed at vladivostok on 7 may 1956 kalinin was reactivated on 1 december 1957 before being disarmed and converted into a floating barracks on 6 february 1960 being renamed pkz 21 on 14 march of that year she was struck from fleet on 12 april 1963 chernyshev and kulagin pp 116 117 and worth p 95 before being transferred to sovetskaya gavan for
