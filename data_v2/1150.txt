slava glory was a pre dreadnought battleship of imperial russian navy last of five s completed too late to participate in battle of tsushima during russo japanese war she survived while all of her sister ships were either sunk during battle or surrendered to imperial japanese navy serving in baltic sea during world war i slava was largest ship of russian gulf of riga squadron that fought german high seas fleet in battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 she repeatedly bombarded german positions and troops for rest of 1915 and during 1916 during battle of moon sound in 1917 slava was badly damaged by german dreadnought significantly increasing her draft shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was scuttled in moon sound strait between island of muhu moon and mainland estonians scrapped her during 1930s description thumb left 300px right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual was long at waterline and long overall with a beam of and a draft of more than designed her normal displacement was almost more than her designed displacement of mclaughlin p 136 ship was powered by two 4 cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines each driving one 4 bladed propeller with twenty belleville water tube boilers providing steam to engines at a pressure of engines and boilers were both built by baltic works engines had a total designed output of but they produced on trials and gave a top speed of at full load she carried of coal that provided her a range of at a speed of she had four steam driven dynamos each with a capacity of 150 kw and two auxiliary generators with a capacity of 64 kw each mclaughlin pp 137 144 slavas 40 caliber 12 inch guns were mounted in two twin gun turrets one each fore and aft they had a rate of fire of about one round per minute sixty rounds per gun were carried twelve 45 caliber guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin gun turrets carried on sides of ship they had a practical rate of fire of about three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun four of twenty guns used against torpedo boats were mounted in casemates just below forward main gun turret two on each side these guns were placed well above waterline for use in any weather unlike remaining sixteen guns which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over length of ship close to water this was graphically demonstrated when slavas sister ship made a high speed turn during her trials heeling 15deg and began taking water through lower casemates each gun had 300 rounds available all but four of her hotchkiss guns were removed before she was completed and remaining guns were used as saluting guns she carried four torpedo tubes one above water in bow and one in stern with two torpedoes each and a submerged tube on each side forward with three torpedoes each two of these were removed before 1914 although it is not known which ones were retained mclaughlin pp 142 295 wartime modifications she was reportedly fitted with two 47 mm anti aircraft aa guns during war but carried only four aa guns in early 1917 her light armament had been reduced to twelve 75 mm guns by that same date while she was laid up over winter of 1916 at helsinki elevation of her main guns was increased to a maximum of 25deg which increased their range to mclaughlin p 302 service slava was built by baltic works at saint petersburg she was laid down on 1 november 1902 launched on 29 august 1903 and completed in october 1905 too late to participate in russo japanese war together with battleship she helped to suppress rebellion in 1906 mclaughlin p 146 slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from naval college that was formed after rebellion as part of post tsushima naval reforms on one of her training cruises to mediterranean her crewmen rescued survivors during 1908 messina earthquake and ship took casualties to naples for medical care she had a serious boiler accident in august 1910 and was towed by tsesarevich to gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete upon her return to kronstadt she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to baltic fleet nekrasov pp 9 17 baltic fleet only had four pre dreadnoughts in service as second brigade of battleships when world war i began although four dreadnoughts of were almost finished after they were completed and could defend mouth of gulf of finland slava sailed through irbe strait on 31 july 1915 to assist russian forces defending gulf of riga more specifically she was to support imperial russian army with her guns and to defend gulf against german naval forces mclaughlin p 298 battle of gulf of riga barely a week later on 8 august germans began to sweep mines defending irbe strait and slava accompanied by gunboats and sortied to fire on minesweepers german pre dreadnoughts and attempted to drive russians off but slava remained in position despite sustaining splinter damage from near misses she did not open fire as her captain did not want to reveal fact that she was out ranged by german battleships nekrasov p 47 germans were not prepared for number of mines laid by russians and withdrew to reconsider their plans they tried again on 16 august this time with dreadnoughts and defending minesweepers halpern pp 196 197 slava flooded her side compartments to give herself a 3deg list which increased her maximum range to about she did not engage german battleships but only fired on minesweepers and any german ships such as armored cruiser when they approached other russian ships nekrasov pp 50 51 when germans returned next day slava was hit three times by shells in quick succession first hit penetrated her upper belt armor and exploded in a coal bunker second hit penetrated her upper deck hit supporting tube of aft port side six inch turret and started a fire in ammunition hoist which caused magazine to be flooded third shell passed through a pair of ship s boats but exploded in water off to one side mclaughlin p 299 these hits did not seriously damage slava and she remained in place until ordered to retreat nekrasov p 52 germans entered gulf next day but they were forced to withdraw shortly afterward when british submarine torpedoed battlecruiser on 19 august and russian coastal artillery that still commanded irbe strait made it very risky to enter gulf of riga halpern p 198 german withdrawal allowed slava after repairs to switch to her other task and support army with gunfire during one of these missions as she was bombarding german positions near tukums on 25 september 1915 she was hit in conning tower while at anchor killing her captain and five others mclaughlin attributes hit to german field artillery but nekrasov quotes german accounts that attribute it to a bomb dropped by one of a pair of german seaplanes nekrasov pp 60 61 slava remained in position and resumed her bombardment she continued to support army until water in gulf of riga threatened to freeze over at which time she retired to port of kuivastu to winter over nekrasov pp 61 62 while still in port she was hit by three light bombs dropped by a seaplane on 12 april 1916 these did little material damage but killed seven sailors on 2 july she resumed her support of army with a bombardment of advancing german troops despite sustaining one hit by an shell on her waterline armor that caused no damage she repeated these missions a number of times in july and august nekrasov p 64 these annoyed germans enough that they attempted to sink slava with a coordinated ambush by submarine and low flying torpedo bombers as she responded to a feint by german cruisers on 12 september but all their torpedoes missed mclaughlin p 300 this was first attack by torpedo bombers against a moving battleship nekrasov p 67 battle of moon sound slava was held back during initial stages of german landings operation albion on saaremaa island guarding mouth of gulf of riga in october 1917 to defend kassar wiek inlet which separates outer islands of saaremaa and hiiumaa dago she intermittently fired at german torpedo boats as they fought russian light forces in kassar wiek on 15 and 16 october but scored no hits from her position near island in moon sound strait staff pp 85 98 99 on morning of 17 october germans attempted to sweep russian mines placed at southern entrance to moon sound strait slava pre dreadnought and armored cruiser were ordered south to meet them by vice admiral mikhail bakhirev opening fire on minesweepers at 8 05 a m central european time is used in this section dreadnoughts and were to provide cover for minesweepers but slava sailing further south opened fire on them at 8 12 at nearly her maximum range grazhdanin whose turrets had not been modified for extra elevation remained behind with bayan and continued to engage minesweepers german ships returned fire but their shells fell short at a range of slava continued to fire on germans but scored no hits although some shells impacted only from konig german ships were at a severe disadvantage as they were sailing in a narrow swept channel and could not maneuver so they reversed course to get out of range staff pp 110 112 right 250px thumb sinking slava german minesweepers made good progress despite minor damage from shell splinters and numerous near misses by slava grazhdanin bayan and russian shore batteries during this period slavas front turret became inoperable when a bronze rack and pinion gear bent so that gear wheel could not be moved only eleven shots had been fired between two guns in turret before breakdown slava and her consorts were ordered north to allow crews to eat lunch but returned to fray and opened fire on minesweepers again at 10 04 with her rear turret at an approximate range of minesweepers had cleared a channel to north while russians were eating and dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage russian pre dreadnoughts konig opened fire on slava at 10 14 and hit her with three shells from her third salvo first hit slavas bow below waterline and exploded in bow dynamo room flooding that room forward 12 inch magazine and other bow compartments while second penetrated capstan flat ship took on of water which gave her a list of 8deg later reduced to 4deg by counter flooding this also increased her forward draft to about third shell hit port side armor abreast engine room but failed to penetrate two more shells struck her at 10 24 in superstructure near forward funnel they damaged a six inch magazine and forward stokehold boiler room and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes however forward left six inch magazine was flooded as a precaution at 10 39 two more shells hit her killing three men in boiler room and flooding a coal bunker around this time slava and her compatriots were ordered to retire to north while bayan trailed behind to divert fire from battleships staff pp 113 116 slavas draft had increased too much to allow her to use dredged channel between hiiumaa island and worms island so she was ordered to wait until all other deep draft ships had entered channel and then scuttle herself at channel entrance however sailors committee organized on ship after february revolution had ordered engine room abandoned for fear of sinking and she grounded on a shoal southeast of channel because there was no one to obey captain s order to stop a number of destroyers evacuated crew before rear 12 inch magazine exploded at 11 58 however this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her only one of their six torpedoes worked and slava settled on shallow bottom with a hole on starboard side near funnel staff pp 116 117 she was officially struck off navy list on 29 may 1918 by scrapped in 1935 by estonians gardiner and gray p 294 notes citations bibliography external links short article
