stations crossing potomac river history planning for metro began with mass transportation survey in 1955 which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet needs of region projected for 1980 schrag at p 33 38 in 1959 study s final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown washington schrag at p 39 because plan called for extensive freeway construction within district of columbia alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a regional transportation agency with a moratorium on freeway construction through july 1 1962 schrag at p 42 new agency national capital transportation administration issued a 1962 transportation in national capital region report which did not include route that became yellow line schrag at p 55 a central route under 7th street in downtown was only added in 1967 primarily to serve inner city schrag at p 112 in march 1968 washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata board approved its adopted regional system ars which included yellow line from franconia and road in springfield to greenbelt schrag at p 117 while a cut and fill tunnel for yellow line was built under 7th street and u street both street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets were difficult schrag at p 217 result was loss of traditional retail businesses along route downtown segment of line was originally projected to open in september 1977 schrag at p 214 obtaining approval of district of columbia and prince georges county of exact alignment of yellow line north of u street delayed construction originally ars called for line to be placed in median strip of planned north central freeway but after that road was cancelled route of replacement subway tunnel became controversial resulting in years of expensive delays schrag at p 214 16 service on yellow line began on april 30 1983 adding archives to system and linking two already built stations of gallery place and pentagon with a bridge across potomac river it was extended beyond national airport by four stations to huntington on december 17 1983 first station outside capital beltway when green line link to u street opened on may 11 1991 it acted as an extension of yellow line until southern green line branch was completed when green line service began yellow line was truncated at mount vernon square where a pocket track exists to relay trains yellow line was originally planned to follow a slightly different route in virginia plan would have sent yellow line trains to franconia springfield with blue line trains serving huntington this was changed due to a shortage of rail cars at time of completion of line to huntington because fewer rail cars were required to operate yellow line service than would be required to run blue line service out to huntington due to yellow line s shorter route line designations were switched from 1999 to 2008 yellow line operated to franconia springfield on july 4 as part of metro s special service pattern on that day thumb right one of hundreds of signs that were reworded from just national airport in 1998 congress changed name of washington national airport to ronald reagan washington national airport with law specifying that no money be spent to implement name change as a result wmata did not change name of national airport station which never included full name of airport in response to repeated inquiries from republican congressmen that station be renamed wmata stated that stations are renamed only at request of local jurisdiction because both arlington county and district of columbia were controlled by democrats name change was blocked finally in 2001 congress made changing station s name a condition of further federal funding schrag at p 258 2002 transportation appropriations act public law 107 87 section 343 statutes at large 115 2001 833 in may 2018 metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across system to accommodate these platform reconstructions blue and yellow lines south of ronald reagan washington national airport would be closed from may 25 to september 8 2019 in what would be longest line closure in metro s history extensions in 2006 metro board member jim graham and d c mayor anthony a williams proposed re extending yellow line service to fort totten station or even to greenbelt station which was originally planned northern terminus for line their proposal did not involve construction of any new track because either extension would run along same route as existing green line and would thus relieve crowding on that line suburban members of board initially resisted proposal through a compromise that also increased service on red line on april 20 2006 wmata board approved a yellow line extension to fort totten station during off peak hours an 18 month pilot program began on december 31 2006 at a cost of 5 75 million to district of columbia on june 26 2008 due to success of 18 month trial yellow line was permanently extended to operate all way up to fort totten metro station at all other times other than during weekday rush hour peak commuter periods starting june 18 2012 yellow line was extended as part of rush plus initiative trial to operate all way up to greenbelt on northern end and several trains were diverted to franconia springfield on southern end in may 2019 due to success of this trial yellow line was permanently extended to operate all way up to greenbelt at all times including during weekday rush hour peak period commuter times certain yellow line trains continue to divert to franconia springfield instead of operating to huntington in 2019 metro announced that yellow line trains will be re extend from mt vernon sq fort totten back to greenbelt
