fanny bullock workman january 8 1859 january 22 1925 was an american geographer cartographer explorer travel writer and mountaineer notably in himalayas she was one of first female professional mountaineers she not only explored but also wrote about her adventures she set several women s altitude records published eight travel books with her husband and championed women s rights and women s suffrage born to a wealthy family workman was educated in finest schools available to women and traveled in europe her marriage to cemented these advantages and after being introduced to climbing in new hampshire fanny workman traveled world with him they were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around europe north africa and asia couple had two children but fanny workman was not a motherly type they left their children in schools and with nurses and workman saw herself as a new woman who could equal any man workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of switzerland france italy spain algeria and india they cycled thousands of miles sleeping wherever they could find shelter they wrote books about each trip and fanny frequently commented on state of lives of women that she saw their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books at end of their cycling trip through india couple escaped to western himalaya and karakoram for summer months where they were introduced to high altitude climbing they returned to this then unexplored region eight times over next 14 years despite not having modern climbing equipment workmans explored several glaciers and reached summit of several mountains eventually reaching on pinnacle peak a women s altitude record at time they organized multiyear expeditions but struggled to remain on good terms with local labor force coming from a position of american privilege and wealth they failed to understand position of native workers and had difficulty finding and negotiating for reliable porters after their trips to himalaya workmans gave lectures about their travels they were invited to learned societies fanny workman became first american woman to lecture at sorbonne and second to speak at royal geographical society she received many medals of honor from european climbing and geographical societies and was recognized as one of foremost climbers of her day she demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down gender barrier in mountaineering early life left thumb fanny workman learned her love of climbing on mount washington workman was born january 8 1859 in worcester massachusetts to a wealthy and elite family descended from pilgrims she was youngest of three children her mother was elvira hazard and her father was alexander h bullock businessman and republican massachusetts governor fanny was educated by governesses before attending miss graham s finishing school in new york city after which she spent time in paris and then dresden thomas pauly writes in his short biography of workman that early on fanny chafed at constraints of her privilege a small number of her stories from this time survive describing her interest in adventure in one a vacation episode she describes a beautiful and aristocratic english girl who is contemptuous of society she runs away to grindelwald becoming an excellent alpinist and marrying an american story encapsulates much of fanny s own life wanderlust a love of mountains and a commitment to women s rights in 1886 she published a short story set during first indian war in new york magazine about capture and rescue of a white girl a reviewer of story stated that it was told in a very pleasant and infatuating style in 1879 fanny returned to united states and on june 16 1882 married william hunter workman a man 12 years her senior he was also from a wealthy and educated family having attended yale and having received his medical training at harvard in 1884 they had a daughter rachel william introduced fanny to climbing after their marriage and together they spent many summers in white mountains in new hampshire here she mount washington several times climbing in northeastern united states allowed fanny to develop her abilities together with other women unlike european clubs american climbing clubs in white mountains allowed women members and encouraged women to climb they promoted a new vision of american woman one who was both domestic and athletic and workman took to this image with enthusiasm by 1886 women sometimes outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in new england appalachia journal of appalachian mountain club vol 4 pages 161 163 223 255 in her paper on gender dynamics of climbing in region jenny ernie states that this formative experience shaped workman s commitment to women s rights pointing out that no other well known international mountaineers of time male or female spoke as openly and fervently about women s rights however both of workmans disliked provincial nature of life in worcester where they resided and yearned to live in europe after both fanny s and william s fathers died leaving them enormous estates couple embarked on their first major european trip a tour of scandinavia and germany move to europe and cycling tours thumb portrait of fanny and william in 1889 workman family relocated to germany citing william s health although pauly speculates that this may have been merely a pretext for he recovered surprisingly quickly couple s second child siegfried was born shortly after they arrived in dresden fanny chose not to conform to traditionally circumscribed roles of wife and mother and became an author and adventurer she lived a vigorous life that diverged from idealized femininity in 1800s as a feminist fanny considered herself an example of idea that women could equal and excel over men in arduous life and embodied new woman ethos of day moreover as miller points out in her book about women explorers since ideal family of time was a large one and information about birth control was not easily available william s medical knowledge must have been invaluable workmans left their children with nurses while they took long trips in 1893 siegfried died from a combination of influenza and pneumonia after his death according to pauly workman through her bicycle tours aggressively pursued an alternative identity one that liberated her from conventional responsibilities of wife and mother and allowed for her interests and ambitions they missed their daughter s wedding to sir alexander macrobert in 1911 while exploring in karakoram together workmans explored world and co wrote eight travel books that describe people art and architecture of areas they journeyed through workmans were aware of their contribution to genre of travel writing as they commented on other writers in their own works their mountaineering narratives said little about culture of those remote and sparsely inhabited regions they included both lyrical descriptions of sunset for example for their popular audience and detailed explanations of geographical features such as glaciers for their scientific readership fanny and william added scientific elements to their writings to appeal to authoritative organizations such as royal geographical society fanny also believed science would make her more legitimate in eyes of climbing community but it cost her readers in general their bicycling tour narratives were better received than those about their mountaineering exploits fanny wrote majority of these travel books herself and in them she commented extensively on plight of women wherever she traveled stephanie tingley writes in her encyclopedia entry on workman s travel writing that there is an implied feminist criticism of hardships women experienced and inferior status of women in societies she encountered as a strong willed outspoken supporter of women s rights workman used their travels to demonstrate her own abilities and to highlight inequities other women lived under however their travel books are written in first person plural or third person singular so it is difficult to decisively attribute views or voices to either william or fanny workmans works are colonialist in that they describe people they meet and observe as exotic or unusual at worst as primitive or even subhuman however at times they make it clear that people they encounter see them in a similar light demonstrating that they were sometimes aware of their own biases between 1888 and 1893 workmans took bicycling tours of switzerland france and italy in 1891 fanny became one of first women to climb mont blanc she also was one of first women to climb jungfrau and matterhorn her guide was peter who had made first ascent with edward in 1893 couple decided to explore areas beyond europe and headed for algeria indochina and india these longer trips were fanny s idea couple s first extended tour was a bicycle trip across spain in 1895 each of them carried of luggage and they averaged a day sometimes riding up to afterwards they co wrote sketches in modern iberia about their trip in it they described spain as rustic quaint and charming a common travel writing motif that did not make their book fresh or original in algerian memories fanny focused on beauty and romance of countryside avoiding any commentary on appalling urban conditions however she did highlight abuse and neglect of women in algerian society india thumb right fanny bullock workman on her bicycle tour of india c 1897 workmans trip to india burma ceylon and java lasted two and a half years beginning in november 1897 and covered at time fanny was 38 and william 50 they bicycled about from southernmost tip of india to himalaya in north to ensure they had access to supplies they rode along major thoroughfares near railways and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available they carried minimal supplies including tea sugar biscuits cheese tinned meats water pillows a blanket for each of them writing materials and medical and repair kits they dispensed with their bicycles at northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between and trip was grueling they often had little food or water dealt with swarms of mosquitoes fixed as many as 40 bicycle tire punctures per day and slept in rat infested quarters fanny workman s book written after trip highlighted ancient architecture that they had seen rather than contemporary local cultures mrs workman mentions in my asiatic wanderings about india i have wheeled through much enchanting scenery in palm and banyan grooves of orissa over green and scarlet slopes of terai but i have never cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful american woman cyclist in java los angeles herald la number 354 19 september 1899 retrieved on 09 june 2016 workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about india for westerners of time and had read mahabharata and ramayana before their trip they were eager to learn about culture that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people labor issues during summer of 1898 couple decided to escape heat and explore western himalaya and karakoram after that they intended to explore area around kanchenjunga in sikkim and then finally travel to mountains bordering bhutan on east bureaucratic difficulties and weather problems abounded and impeded their plans most serious problems concerned labor they hired 45 porters outfitted them for basic mountain travel and bought provisions but costs skyrocketed as news of wealthy americans circulated in villages they could not leave until october 3 and by then cold weather was approaching workmans complain in their writings about porters they hired who were difficult to work with and refused to trek more than per day three days into their journey workmans reached snow and porters rebelled they refused to work in such cold conditions and forced entire party to return to darjeeling workmans struggled with labor problems continually needing local porters to carry gear for them because they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi month expedition they had to transport mummery tents eider sleeping bags camera equipment scientific instruments and a large supply of food porters were skeptical of entire venture locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman which made fanny s position difficult workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high handedness kenneth mason maintains in his history of himalayan mountaineering written in 1955 that workmans were on their journeys victims of their own faults they were too impatient and rarely tried to understand mentality of porters and so did not get best out of them labor problems beset all of their expeditions because as miller puts it almost alone of victorian travellers workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even common sense understanding of local people into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies in her chapter on workman miller argues that couple being american did not have same sense of caste or class that british explorers had workmans like most of their countrymen plunged in their enterprises headlong expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles they were justifiably criticized by british for their callous incompetent behavior toward indians mountaineering in himalayas after travelling to himalaya first time workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering over a span of 14 years they traveled eight times to area which at time was almost completely unexplored and unmapped their trips were made without benefit of modern lightweight equipment freeze dried foods sunblock or radios on each expedition they explored surveyed and photographed ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps couple shared and alternated responsibilities one year fanny would organize logistics of their journey and william would work on scientific projects and next year they would reverse roles after their first trip to himalaya and subsequent labor problems workmans hired matthias zurbriggen best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of time thus in 1899 with 50 local porters and zurbriggen workmans began to explore biafo glacier in karakoram but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to la glacier and unclimbed peaks around it they reached siegfriedhorn an 18 600 foot 5 700 m summit that she named after her son giving fanny an altitude record for women at time they next camped at and climbed a higher peak of naming it mount bullock workman historian michael comments that names mount bullock workman and mount siegfriedhorn are long forgotten p 234 admiring view of a far off mountain they commented on grand view they were looking at k2 second highest mountain in world fanny workman may have been first woman recorded to have seen it finally they climbed gunge giving fanny her third successive altitude record it was very challenging they had to hire new porters establish a new base camp and remain overnight at around in morning they climbed a wall that measured and were buffeted by winds during summit push fanny s fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of porters abandoned them pauly writes propelled to summit by adrenalin and desperation foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that temperature was ten degrees fahrenheit 12 degc and their elevation was 21 000 feet fanny was a slow relentless and intrepid climber she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with other climbing at beginning of 20th century she did not have specialized equipment like or she was able to climb to such heights pauly argues because of her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness as soon as she was able fanny workman published accounts of her feats such as an article in scottish geographical magazine writing about this trip at length in in ice world of himalayas fanny made efforts to include scientific information and experiments touting her own modified barometer as superior but scholarly critics were unimpressed and pointed out her lack of scientific knowledge popular reviewers on other hand enjoyed book with one concluding we have no hesitation in saying that dr and mrs workman have written one of most remarkable books of travel of recent years left thumb workman with climbing gear as one commentator writes even though pantaloons were acceptable sporting women s dress at time workman wore skirts while cycling thousands of miles across europe and asia climbing himalayan peaks and negotiating crevasses in 1902 workmans returned to himalaya and became first westerners to explore glacier starting in they hired 80 porters and took four tons of supplies but their explorations were limited by near constant snow and a 60 hour storm in 1903 they trekked to hoh lumba glacier with guide cyprien savoye they also attempted to climb nearby mountain they called pyramid peak later renamed spantik as part of spantik mountains they camped first night at and second at an ailing porter forced them to camp third night at rather than and they eventually left him behind they ascended a peak giving fanny a new altitude record william and a porter climbed toward needle like spire that was expedition s goal however he abandoned summit attempt a few hundred feet from top because he realized they could not have descended to a safe altitude before altitude sickness set in after returning from their travels workmans lectured all over europe fanny lectured in english german or french as occasion required at one talk in lyon france 1000 people crowded into auditorium and 700 were turned away in 1905 fanny became second woman to address royal geographical society isabella bird bishop had been first in may 1897 her talk was mentioned in times workmans returned to kashmir in 1906 and were first westerners to explore nun kun massif for this trip couple hired six italian porters from alps 200 local porters and savoye returned as guide as isserman weaver and molenaar explain in their history of himalayan mountaineering workmans despised local porters but were forced to recruit them their otherwise invaluable books read like one long anguished harangue against lazy lying thieving mutinous cheats on whom they unhappily depended for local support they planned a sequence of four camps from to despite labor problems workmans spent night higher than any previous mountaineers on top of z1 on nun kun at what they called camp america william wrote of fanny map workmans made during this trip was of low quality according to mason couple did not have a good sense of topographical direction which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by survey of india pinnacle peak and altitude record right thumb mount kun center and pinnacle peak left from suru valley from at age of 47 in 1906 workman climbed up to pinnacle peak which she believed to be a subsidiary peak in nun kun massif of western himalaya it was her greatest mountaineering achievement as isserman weaver and molenaar point out fact that she climbed mountain at all without benefit of modern equipment and encumbered by her voluminous skirts speaks to both her ability and resolve she set an altitude record for women that would stand until hetti s 1934 ascent of sia c believing that they had both climbed above 23 000 foot 7 000 m mark fanny and william now considered themselves leading experts on climbing at altitude workman vigorously defended her pinnacle peak altitude record against all other claimants especially annie smith peck in 1908 peck claimed a new record with her climb of peru s huascaran which she believed to be however she was misinformed as to peak s height and exaggerated distances she could not measure workman was so competitive that she paid a team of french surveyors from service geographique de l armee us 13 000 to measure elevation of mountain which was actually confirming her record pauly explains ironically her determination to prove herself equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with a withering attack on an american woman who tried to surpass her determined to be best woman workman was also a meticulous record keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments pauly concludes if fanny workman ever receives recognition she deserves for her feminist determination to excel at this then male sport she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record keeping as for elevations she achieved hispar and siachen glaciers right thumb fanny workman on silver throne plateau holding up a newspaper that reads votes for women in 1908 workmans returned to karakoram and explored 38 mile long 61 km hispar glacier in nagar region they went from gilgit to over hispar pass and onto 37 mile long 60 km biafo glacier to their total traverse of glaciers was another record and fanny became first woman to travel across any himalayan glacier of this size they were first to explore its many side glaciers and maps created by their italian porters helped map region for first time they recorded physiological effects of high altitude studied glaciers and ice pinnacles and took meteorological measurements including altitude data recorded with both aneroid barometers and boiling point thermometers workmans exploration of rose glacier and 45 mile long 72 km siachen glacier in baltistan around in 1911 and 1912 was most important achievement of their careers because it was widest and longest subpolar glacier in world and at time least explored and accessible glacier as well for two months workmans explored 45 mile glacier climbed several mountains and mapped area they spent entire time over high point being indira col which they and named on this expedition one of their italian guides fell into a crevasse and died fanny was lucky to escape others were badly shaken but decided to carry on fanny led them across sia la pass near head of siachen glacier and through a previously unexplored region to glacier this exploration and resulting book were among her greatest accomplishments as she wrote in her book about trip two summers in ice wilds of eastern karakoram she organized and led this expedition dr hunter workman accompanied me this time in charge with me of commissariat and as photographer and but i was responsible leader of this expedition and on my efforts in a large measure must depend success or failure of it at one 21 000 foot 6 400 m plateau fanny unfurled a votes for women newspaper and her husband snapped an iconic picture they took trained alpine guides and surveyors including grant peterkin and singh whose contributions ensured that unlike numerous other maps workmans helped create their map of siachen glacier remained unchallenged for many years later life and death thumb monument dedicated to fanny bullock workman rural cemetery worcester massachusetts plot 1500 sec 31 after their 1908 12 trip couple stopped exploring and turned to writing and lecturing primarily because of onset of world war i in 1914 fanny workman became first american woman to lecture at sorbonne in paris she was also one of first women admitted as a member of royal geographical society a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena she also earned medals of honor from 10 european geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of american alpine club royal asiatic society club italiano deutscher und osterreichischer and club alpin francais she was very proud of these achievements listing them on title pages of her books fanny workman fell ill in 1917 and died after a long illness in 1925 in cannes france her ashes were buried in massachusetts and are now reinterred along with her husband s under a monument in worcester massachusetts rural cemetery that reads pioneer himalayan explorers in her will she left 125 000 to four colleges radcliffe wellesley smith and bryn mawr bequests were demonstrative of her long lasting interest in advancement of women s rights and her belief that women were equals of men legacy women in climbing along with annie smith peck workman was recognized during early 20th century as one of most famous female climbers in world their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb most remote and difficult terrain on planet women had climbed regularly in alps since 1850s but in himalayas mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy english men no other women however climbed in himalaya until well after world war i by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions workman herself an ardent feminist and a supporter of women s suffrage wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women s potential in her writings workman described herself as questioning or violating norms of victorian female propriety she demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside home by showing how easy it was for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes workman challenged a masculine realm her obituary in alpine journal alluded to challenges she faced saying that she felt that she suffered from sex antagonism author of piece added it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of novelty of a woman s intrusion into domain of exploration so long reserved to man may in some quarters have existed there tended to arise an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness however in her study of victorian mountaineering ann colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations such as in himalaya colley states away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures up high above snow line or in distant regions women climbers could more fully experience equality and power if they chose they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as men in her entry about workman in dictionary of literary biography tingley sums workman up as an aggressive determined and uncompromising turn of century american woman traveler and one of first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about expeditions she and her husband took to most remote reaches of himalaya she was an outspoken advocate of woman s suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself to be a role model for other women travelers and mountaineers as a result of money workman left in her will wellesley college offers a 16 000 fellowship named after fanny workman for graduate study in any discipline to a wellesley graduate each year bryn mawr established a fanny bullock workman traveling fellowship which is awarded to ph d candidates in archaeology or art history when funds permit exploration of himalaya many books and articles produced by workmans are still useful according to mason especially for their photographs and illustrations but their maps are deceptive and not always reliable one assessment states that although workmans excelled at describing meteorological conditions glaciology and how high altitudes affected human health and fitness they were poor topographers workmans were some of first mountaineers to grasp that himalaya were place for ultimate climbing challenge and their explorations helped evolve mountaineering from strenuous recreation into a serious regulated competitive sport according to isserman weaver and molenaar that workmans were intrepid explorers and climbers none could possibly doubt but they were also aggressive self promoters who in their eagerness for recognition and honors sometimes exaggerated originality and significance of what they had done in their final assessment isserman weaver and molenaar say they had logged more miles and climbed more peaks than anyone to date they had produced five sumptuously illustrated and widely read expedition volumes and by simple virtue of her sex fanny of course had set an invaluable himalayan precedent but workmans were not great mountaineers at their best they were vigorous and competent patrons who followed capably in hard won steps of their italian guides however in his chapter on workman pauly writes that few recent accounts of fanny workman have tended to slight or belittle her achievements but contemporaries unaware of far greater accomplishments to come held workmans in high regard they were first americans to
