puritans who profoundly affected their region s culture laws and traditions by time of john adams s birth puritan tenets such as predestination had waned and many of their severe practices moderated but adams still considered them bearers of freedom a cause that still had a holy urgency adams recalled that his parents held every species of in contempt and horror and detailed pictures of disgrace or and of ruin resulting from any debauchery adams later noted that as a child i enjoyed perhaps greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form characters of her children adams as eldest child was compelled to obtain a formal education this began at age six at a dame school for boys and girls conducted at a teacher s home and was centered upon new england primer shortly thereafter adams attended braintree latin school under joseph cleverly where studies included latin rhetoric logic and arithmetic adams s early education included incidents of truancy a dislike for his master and a desire to become a farmer all discussion on matter ended with his father s command that he remain in school you shall comply with my desires deacon adams hired a new schoolmaster named joseph marsh and his son responded positively college education and adulthood at age sixteen adams entered harvard college in 1751 studying under

reputation and more from his fellows and was determined to be a great man he decided to become a lawyer to further those ends writing his father that he found among lawyers noble and gallant achievements but among clergy pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces his aspirations conflicted with his puritanism though prompting reservations about his self described and failure to share happiness of his fellow men as french and indian war began in 1754 adams aged nineteen began to struggle with his responsibility in conflict as many of his contemporaries joined war for money adams later said i longed more ardently to be a soldier than i ever did to be a lawyer recognizing that he was first of his family to degenerate from virtues of house so far as not to have been an officer

completed his studies under putnam he developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary this included james otis jr s 1761 legal argument challenging legality of british writs of assistance allowing british to search a home without notice or reason otis s argument inspired adams to cause of american colonies a group of boston businessmen had been appalled at writs of assistance that crown had started issuing to clamp down on colonial smuggling writs of assistance were not only search warrants without any limits they also required local sheriffs and even

political theory in seven essays written for boston newspapers he offered them anonymously under nom de plume humphrey ploughjogger and in them ridiculed selfish thirst for power he perceived among massachusetts colonial elite adams was initially less well known than his older cousin samuel adams but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer his analysis of history and his dedication to republicanism adams often found his own irascible nature a constraint in his political career in late 1750s adams fell in love with hannah quincy while they were alone he was poised to propose but was interrupted by friends and moment was lost in 1759 he met 15 year old abigail smith his third cousin through his friend richard cranch who was courting abigail s older sister adams initially was not impressed with abigail and her two sisters writing that they were not fond nor frank nor candid in time he grew close to abigail and they were married on october 25 1764 despite opposition of abigail s haughty mother they shared a love of books and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other after his father s death in 1761 adams had inherited a farm and a house where they lived until 1783 john and abigail had six children abigail nabby in 1765 future president john quincy adams in 1767 susanna in 1768 charles in 1770 thomas in 1772 and elizabeth in 1777 susanna died when she was one year old while elizabeth was stillborn all three of his sons became lawyers charles and thomas were unsuccessful became alcoholics and died before old age while john quincy excelled and launched a career in politics adams s writings are devoid of his feelings about sons fates career before revolution opponent of stamp act adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to stamp act of 1765 act was imposed by british parliament without consulting american legislatures it required payment of a direct tax by colonies for stamped documents and was designed to pay for costs of britain s war with france power of enforcement was given to british vice admiralty courts rather than common law courts these admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent and encountered violent resistance preventing its enforcement adams authored braintree instructions in 1765 in form of a letter sent to representatives of braintree in massachusetts legislature in it he explained that act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all englishmen and which all free men deserved rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one s peers instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties and served as a model for other towns instructions adams also reprised his pen name humphrey ploughjogger in opposition to stamp act in august of that year included were four articles to boston gazette articles were republished in london chronicle in 1768 as true sentiments of america also known as a dissertation on canon and feudal law he also spoke in december before governor and council pronouncing stamp act invalid in absence of massachusetts representation at parliament he noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of boston minister jonathan mayhew invoking romans 13 to justify insurrection while adams took a strong stand against act in writing he rebuffed attempts by samuel adams a leader in popular protest movements to involve him in mob actions and public demonstrations in 1766 a town meeting of braintree elected adams as a selectman with repeal of stamp act in early 1766 tensions with britain temporarily eased putting politics aside adams moved his family to boston in april 1768 to focus on his law practice family rented a clapboard house on brattle street that was known locally as white house he abigail and children lived there for a year then moved to cold lane still later they moved again to a larger house in brattle square in center of city with death of jeremiah gridley and mental collapse of otis adams became boston s most prominent lawyer counsel for british boston massacre thumb boston massacre of 1770 by alonzo chappel 1878 alt depiction of chaotic confrontation between british soldiers and bostonians britain s passage of townshend acts in 1767 revived tensions and an increase in mob violence led british to dispatch more troops to colonies on march 5 1770 when a lone british sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens eight of his fellow soldiers reinforced him and crowd around them grew to several hundred soldiers were struck with snowballs ice and stones and in chaos soldiers opened fire killing five civilians bringing about infamous boston massacre accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder when no other attorneys would come to their defense adams was impelled to do so despite risk to his reputation he believed no person should be denied right to counsel and a fair trial trials were delayed so that passions could cool week long trial of commander captain thomas preston began on october 24 and ended in his acquittal because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire remaining soldiers were tried in december when adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or dictates of our passion they cannot alter state of facts and evidence he added it is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to bar and condemned perhaps to die then citizen will say whether i do good or whether i do evil is immaterial for innocence itself is no protection and if such an idea as that were to take hold in mind of citizen that would be end of security whatsoever adams won an acquittal for six of soldiers two who had fired directly into crowd were convicted of manslaughter adams was paid a small sum by his clients according to biographer john e ferling during jury selection adams expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to british army but five ultimately became loyalist exiles while adams s defence was helped by a weak prosecution he also performed brilliantly ferling surmises that adams may have been encouraged to take case in exchange for political office one of boston s seats opened three months later in massachusetts legislature and adams was town s first choice to fill vacancy prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure as did demands on his time in 1771 adams moved his family to braintree but kept his office in boston he noted on day of family s move now my family is away i feel no inclination at all no temptation to be any where but at my office i am in it by 6 in morning i am in it at 9 at night in evening i can be alone at my office and no where else after some time in capital he became disenchanted with rural and vulgar braintree as a home for his family in august 1772 he moved them back to boston he purchased a large brick house on queen street not far from his office in 1774 adams and abigail returned family to farm due to increasingly unstable situation in boston and braintree remained their permanent massachusetts home becoming a revolutionary adams who had been among more conservative of founders persistently held that while british actions against colonies had been wrong and misguided open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with ultimate view of remaining part of great britain was a better alternative his ideas began to change around 1772 as british crown assumed payment of salaries of governor thomas hutchinson and his judges instead of massachusetts legislature adams wrote in gazette that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place colonial government in closer subjugation to crown after discontent among members of legislature hutchinson delivered a speech warning that parliament s powers over colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal subsequently john adams samuel and joseph hawley drafted a resolution adopted by house of representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny resolution argued that colonists had never been under sovereignty of parliament their original charter as well as their allegiance was exclusive to king boston tea party a historic demonstration against british east india company s tea monopoly over american merchants took place on december 16 1773 british schooner dartmouth loaded with tea to be traded subject to new tea act had previously dropped anchor in boston harbor by 9 00 pm work of protesters was done they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds 1992 equivalent of about 1 million dartmouth owners briefly retained adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for destroyed shipment adams himself applauded destruction of tea calling it grandest event in history of colonial protest movement and writing in his diary

despite an emotional plea from his friend jonathan sewall not to shortly after he arrived in philadelphia adams was placed on 23 member grand committee tasked with drafting a letter of grievances to king george iii members of committee soon split into conservative and radical factions although massachusetts delegation was largely passive adams criticized conservatives such as joseph galloway james duane and peter oliver who advocated a conciliatory policy towards british or felt that colonies had a duty to remain loyal to britain although his views at time did align with those of conservative john dickinson adams sought repeal of objectionable policies but at this early stage he continued to see benefits for maintaining america s status as a british colony he renewed his push

wars nor rumors of war in a firm belief that thro mercy of its king we shall both rejoice there together news of opening hostilities with british at battles of lexington and concord made adams hope that independence would soon become a reality three days after battle he rode into a militia camp and while reflecting positively on high spirits of men was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline a month later adams returned to philadelphia for second continental congress as leader of massachusetts delegation he moved cautiously at first noting that congress was divided between loyalists those favoring independence and those hesitant to take any position he became convinced that congress was moving in proper direction away from great britain publicly adams supported reconciliation if practicable but privately agreed with benjamin franklin s confidential observation that independence was inevitable in june 1775 with a view of promoting union among colonies against great britain he nominated george washington of virginia as commander in chief of army then assembled around boston he praised washington s skill and experience as well as his excellent universal character adams opposed various attempts including olive branch petition aimed at trying to find peace between colonies and great britain invoking already long list of british actions against colonies he wrote in my opinion powder and artillery are most efficacious sure and conciliatory measures we can adopt after his failure to prevent petition from being enacted he wrote a private letter derisively referring to dickinson as a genius letter was intercepted and published in loyalist newspapers well respected dickinson refused to greet adams and he was for a time largely ostracized ferling writes by fall of 1775 no one in congress labored more ardently than adams to hasten day when america would be separate from great britain in october 1775 adams was appointed chief judge of massachusetts superior court but he never served and resigned in february 1777 in response to queries from other delegates adams wrote 1776 pamphlet thoughts on government which laid out an influential framework for republican constitutions independence throughout first half of 1776 adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be slow pace of declaring independence he kept busy on floor of congress helping push through a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels later in year he drafted first set of regulations to govern provisional navy adams drafted preamble to lee resolution of colleague richard henry lee he developed a rapport with delegate thomas jefferson of virginia who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary on june 7 1776 adams seconded resolution which stated these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states thumb left upright 1 1 assembly room in philadelphia s

jefferson many years later adams recorded his exchange with jefferson jefferson asked why will you not you ought to do it to which adams responded i will not reasons enough jefferson replied what can be your reasons and adams responded reason first you are a virginian and a virginian ought to appear at head of this business reason second i am obnoxious suspected and unpopular you are very much otherwise reason third you can write ten times better than i can well said jefferson if you are decided i will do as well as i can committee left no minutes and drafting process itself remains uncertain accounts written many years later by jefferson and adams although frequently cited are often contradictory although first draft was written primarily by jefferson adams assumed a major role in its completion on july 1 resolution was debated in congress it was expected to pass but opponents such as dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow jefferson a poor debater remained silent

to as a one man war department working up to eighteen hour days and mastering details of raising equipping and fielding an army under civilian control he authored plan of treaties laying out congress s requirements for a treaty with france as chairman of board adams functioned as a de facto secretary of war he kept extensive correspondences with a wide range of continental army officers concerning supplies munitions and tactics adams emphasized to them role of discipline in keeping an army orderly he was worn out by rigor of his duties and longed to return home his finances were unsteady and money that he received as a delegate failed even to cover his own necessary expenses however crisis caused by defeat of american soldiers kept him at his post after defeating continental army at battle of long island on august 27 british admiral richard howe determined that a strategic advantage was at hand and requested that congress send representatives to negotiate peace a delegation consisting of adams franklin and edward rutledge met with howe at staten island peace conference on september 11 howe s authority was premised on states submission so parties found no common ground when lord howe stated he could only view american delegates as british subjects adams replied your lordship may consider me in what light you please except that of a british subject adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from howe s pardon granting authority adams was unimpressed with howe and predicted american success he was able to return home to braintree in october before leaving in january of 1777 to resume his duties in congress diplomatic service commissioner to france before signing of declaration of independence in 1776 adams advocated in congress that independence was necessary to establish trade and conversely trade was essential for attainment of independence he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with france he was then appointed along with franklin dickinson benjamin harrison of virginia and robert morris of pennsylvania to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers while jefferson was laboring over declaration of independence adams worked on model treaty model treaty authorized a commercial agreement with france but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance there were provisions for what constituted french territory treaty adhered to provision that free ships make free goods allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband by late 1777 america s finances were in tatters and that september a british army had defeated general washington and captured philadelphia more americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between u s and france would not be enough and that military assistance would be needed to end war defeat of british at saratoga was expected to help induce france to agree to an alliance in november adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to france replacing silas deane and joining franklin and arthur lee in paris to negotiate an alliance with hesitant french james lovell invoked adams s inflexible integrity and need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance franklin s advanced age on november 27 adams accepted wasting no time he wrote to lovell that he should have wanted no motives or arguments for his acceptance if he could be sure that public would be benefited by it abigail was left in massachusetts to manage their home but it was agreed that 10 year old john quincy would go with adams for experience was of inestimable value to his maturation on february 17 adams set sail aboard frigate boston commanded by captain samuel tucker trip was stormy and treacherous lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one ship was pursued by several british vessels with adams taking up arms to help capture one a cannon malfunction killed one of crew and injured five others on april 1 boston arrived in spain where adams learned that france had agreed to an alliance with united states on february 6 shortly after they arrived in france adams was annoyed by other two commissioners lee whom he thought paranoid and cynical and popular and influential franklin whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to french he assumed a less visible role but helped manage delegation s finances and record keeping frustrated by perceived lack of commitment on part of french adams wrote a letter to french foreign minister vergennes in december arguing for french naval support in north america franklin toned down letter but vergennes still ignored it in september 1778 congress increased franklin s powers by naming him minister plenipotentiary to france while lee was sent to spain adams received no instructions frustrated by apparent slight he departed france with john quincy on march 8 1779 on august 2 they arrived in braintree thumb left upright 0 9 adams frequently clashed with benjamin franklin over how to manage french relations in late 1779 adams was appointed as sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with britain and end war following conclusion of massachusetts constitutional convention he departed for france in november aboard french frigate sensible accompanied by john quincy and 9 year old son charles constant disagreement between lee and franklin eventually resulted in adams assuming role of tie breaker in almost all votes on commission business he increased his usefulness by mastering french language lee was eventually recalled adams closely supervised his sons education while writing to abigail about once every ten days in contrast to franklin adams viewed franco american alliance pessimistically french he believed were involved for their own self interest and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to revolution french adams wrote meant to keep their hands above our chin to prevent us from drowning but not to lift our heads out of water in march 1780 congress trying to curb inflation voted to devalue dollar vergennes summoned adams for a meeting in a letter sent in june he insisted that any fluctuation of dollar value without an exception for french merchants was unacceptable and requested that adams write to congress asking it to retrace its steps adams bluntly defended decision not only claiming that french merchants were doing better than vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had with french alliance had been made over two years before during that period an army under comte de rochambeau had been sent to assist washington but it had yet to do anything of significance and america was expecting french warships these were needed adams wrote to contain british armies in port cities and contend with powerful british navy however french navy had been sent not to united states but to west indies to protect french interests there france adams believed needed to commit itself more fully to alliance vergennes responded that he would deal only with franklin who sent a letter back to congress critical of adams adams then left france of his own accord ambassador to dutch republic in mid 1780 adams traveled to dutch republic one of few other existing republics at time adams thought it might be sympathetic to american cause securing a dutch loan could increase american independence from france and pressure britain into peace at first adams had no official status but in july he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in amsterdam in august adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed city but soon became disappointed dutch fearing british retaliation refused to meet adams before he had arrived british found out about secret aid dutch had sent to americans british authorized reprisals against their ships which only increased their apprehension word had also reached europe of american battlefield defeats after five months of not meeting with a single dutch official adams in early 1781 pronounced amsterdam capital of reign of mammon he was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to dutch government at hague on april 19 1781 but they did not promise any assistance in meantime adams thwarted an attempt by neutral european powers to mediate war without consulting united states in july adams consented to departure of both of his sons john quincy went with adams s secretary francis dana to saint petersburg as a french interpreter in an effort to seek recognition from russia and a homesick charles returned home with adams s friend benjamin waterhouse in august shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations adams fell seriously ill in a major nervous breakdown that november he learned that american and french troops had decisively defeated british at yorktown victory was in large part due to assistance of french navy which vindicated adams s stand for increased naval assistance news of american triumph at yorktown convulsed europe in january 1782 after recovering adams arrived at hague to demand that states general of netherlands answer his petitions his efforts stalled and he took his cause to people successfully capitalizing on popular pro american sentiment to push states general towards recognizing u s several provinces began recognizing american independence on april 19 states general in hague formally recognized american independence and acknowledged adams as ambassador on june 11 with aid of dutch leader joan van der capellen tot den pol adams negotiated a loan of

laurens was posted to dutch republic ferling ch 11 12 in final negotiations securing fishing rights off newfoundland and cape breton island proved both very important and very difficult in response to very strict restrictions proposed by british adams insisted that not only should american fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on shores of newfoundland this and other statements prompted vergennes to secretly inform british that france did not feel compelled to sustain these pretentious ambitions overruling franklin and distrustful of vergennes jay and adams decided not to consult with france instead dealing directly with british during these negotiations adams mentioned to british that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by france in 1778 and that accepting would foster goodwill between britain and united states while putting pressure on france britain agreed and two sides worked out other provisions afterward vergennes was angered when he learned from franklin of american duplicity but did not demand renegotiation and was supposedly surprised at how much americans could extract independent negotiations allowed french to plead innocence to their spanish allies whose demands for gibraltar might have caused significant problems on september 3 1783 treaty was signed and american independence was recognized ambassador to great britain adams was appointed first american ambassador to great britain in 1785 when a counterpart assumed that adams had family in england adams replied neither my father or mother grandfather or grandmother great grandfather or great grandmother nor any other relation that i know of or care a farthing for has been in england these one hundred and fifty years so that you see i have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is american thumb left portrait by mather brown right adams 1785 mather brown portrait after arriving in london from paris adams had his first audience with king george iii on june 1 which he meticulously recorded in a letter to foreign minister jay next day pair s exchange was respectful adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality between people who tho sic by an ocean and under different governments have same language a similar religion and kindred blood and king agreed to receive with pleasure assurances of friendly dispositions of united states king added that although he had been last to consent to american independence he wanted adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right towards its end he startled adams by commenting that there is an opinion among some people that you are not most attached of all your countrymen to manners of france adams replied that opinion sir is not mistaken i must to your majesty i have no attachments but to my own country to this king george responded an honest man will never have any other adams was joined by abigail while in london suffering hostility of king s courtiers they escaped when they could by seeking out richard price minister of newington green unitarian church and instigator of debate over revolution within britain adams corresponded with his sons john quincy and charles both of whom were at harvard cautioning former against smell of midnight lamp while admonishing latter to devote sufficient time to study jefferson visited adams in 1786 while serving as minister to france two toured countryside and saw many british historical sites while in london he briefly met his old friend jonathan sewall but two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship adams considered sewall one of war s casualties and sewall critiqued him as an ambassador adams s tenure in britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations american states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to british merchants and in response british refused to vacate forts in northwest as promised adams s attempts to resolve this dispute failed and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home news he received of tumult at home such as shays rebellion heightened his anxiety he then asked jay to be relieved in 1788 he took his leave of george iii who engaged adams in polite and formal conversation promising to uphold his end of treaty once america did same adams then went to hague to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from dutch allowing united states to meet obligations on earlier loans vice presidency 1789 97 election on june 17 adams arrived back in massachusetts to a triumphant welcome he returned to farming life in months after nation s first presidential election was soon to take place because george washington was widely expected to win presidency many felt that vice presidency should go to a northerner although he made no public comments on matter adams was primary contender each state s presidential electors gathered on february 4 1789 to cast their two votes for president person with most votes would be president and second would become vice president adams received 34 electoral college votes in election second place behind george washington who garnered 69 votes as a result washington became nation s first president and adams became its first vice president adams finished well ahead of all others except washington but was still offended by washington receiving more than twice as many votes to benjamin rush he wrote is not my election to this office in dark and scurvy manner in which it was done a curse rather than a blessing unbeknownst to adams alexander hamilton convinced many electors to not vote for him under pretext of not embarrassing washington to be absolutely sure that adams did not win although his term was scheduled to start on march 4 1789 adams did not become vice president of united states until april 21 because congress could not initially achieve a quorum tenure thumb upright 0 9 portrait of adams by john trumbull 1793 sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of vice president is to preside over senate where he can cast a tie breaking vote early in his term adams became deeply involved in a lengthy senate controversy over official titles for president and executive officers of new government although house agreed that president should be addressed simply as george washington president of united states senate debated issue at some length adams favored adoption of style of highness as well as title of protector of their united states liberties for president some senators favored a variant of highness or lesser excellency anti federalists in senate objected to monarchical sound of them all jefferson described them as ridiculous senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism and many argued that these distinctions as adams called them violated constitution s prohibition on titles of nobility adams argued that distinctions were necessary because highest office of united states must be marked with dignity and splendor to command respect he was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness especially as he actively debated and lectured senators for forty minutes he us from chair wrote senator william maclay of pennsylvania maclay became adams s fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private he likened adams to a monkey just put into breeches ralph izard suggested that adams be referred to by title his a joke which soon became popular on may 14 senate decided that title of mr president would be used privately adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly and that perhaps he had been out of country too long to know sentiment of people washington quietly expressed his displeasure with fuss and rarely consulted adams thumb left upright 0 9 portrait of washington by gilbert stuart 1795 washington rarely consulted vice president adams who often felt marginalized and overshadowed by washington s prestige as vice president adams largely sided with washington administration and emerging federalist party he supported washington s policies against opposition from anti federalists and republicans he cast 31 tie breaking votes all in support of administration and more than any other vice president he voted against a bill sponsored by maclay that would have required senate consent for removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by senate in 1790 jefferson james madison and hamilton struck a bargain guaranteeing republican support for hamilton s debt assumption plan in exchange for capital being temporarily moved from new york to philadelphia and then to a permanent site on potomac river to placate southerners in senate adams cast a tie breaking nay vote against a last minute motion to keep capital in new york adams played a minor role in politics as vice president he attended few cabinet meetings and president sought his counsel infrequently while adams brought energy and dedication to office by mid 1789 he had already found it not quite adapted to my character too inactive and mechanical he wrote my country has in its wisdom contrived for me most insignificant office that ever invention of man or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived adams s behavior made him a target for critics of washington administration toward end of his first term he grew accustomed to assuming a marginal role and rarely intervened in debate adams never questioned washington s courage or patriotism but washington did join franklin and others as object of adams s ire or envy history of our revolution will be one continued lie adams declared essence of whole will be that dr franklin s electrical rod smote earth and out sprung general washington that franklin electrified him with his rod and henceforth these two conducted all policy negotiations legislatures and war adams won reelection with little difficulty in 1792 with 77 votes his strongest challenger george clinton had 50 on july 14 1789 french revolution began republicans were jubilant adams at first expressed cautious optimism but soon began denouncing revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical washington eventually consulted adams more often but not until near end of his administration by which point hamilton jefferson and edmund randolph had all resigned british had been raiding american trading vessels and john jay was sent to london to negotiate an end to hostilities when he returned in 1795 with a peace treaty on terms unfavorable to united states adams urged washington to sign it to prevent war washington chose to do so igniting protests and riots he was accused of surrendering american honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning his back on french republic john adams predicted in a letter to abigail that ratification would deeply divide nation election of 1796 thumb upright 1 15 1796 presidential election results election of 1796 was first contested american presidential election twice george washington had been elected to office unanimously but during his presidency deep philosophical differences between two leading figures in administration alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson had caused a rift leading to founding of federalist party and republican parties when washington announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term an intense partisan struggle for control of congress and presidency began like previous two presidential elections no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796 constitution provided for selection of electors who would then choose a president in seven states voters chose presidential electors in remaining nine states they were chosen by state s legislature clear republican favorite was jefferson adams was federalist frontrunner republicans held a congressional nominating caucus and named jefferson and aaron burr as their presidential choices jefferson at first declined nomination but he agreed to run a few weeks later federalist members of congress held an informal nominating caucus and named adams and thomas pinckney as their candidates campaign was for most part confined to newspaper attacks pamphlets and political rallies of four contenders only burr actively campaigned practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called silly and wicked game of electioneering as campaign progressed fears grew among hamilton and his supporters that adams was too vain opinionated unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions indeed adams felt largely left out of washington s administration and did not consider himself a strong member of federalist party he had remarked that hamilton s economic program centered around banks would swindle poor and unleash gangrene of avarice desiring a more pliant president than adams hamilton maneuvered to tip election to pinckney he coerced south carolina federalist electors pledged to vote for favorite son pinckney to scatter their second votes among candidates other than adams hamilton s scheme was undone when several new england state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for pinckney adams wrote shortly after election that hamilton was a proud spirited conceited aspiring mortal always pretending to morality with as debauched morals as old franklin who is more his model than any one i know throughout his life adams made highly critical statements about hamilton he made derogatory references to his womanizing real or alleged and slurred him as creole bastard in end adams won presidency by a narrow margin receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for jefferson who became vice president pinckney finished in third with 59 votes and burr came in fourth with 30 balance of electoral college votes were dispersed among nine other candidates this is only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets presidency 1797 1801 thumb president s house philadelphia adams occupied this philadelphia mansion from march 1797 to may 1800 inauguration adams was sworn into office as nation s second president on march 4 1797 by chief justice oliver ellsworth as president he followed washington s lead in using presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue and his service was free of scandal adams spent much of his term at his massachusetts home peacefield preferring quietness of domestic life to business at capital he ignored political patronage and office seekers which other office holders utilized historians debate his decision to retain members of washington s cabinet in light of cabinet s loyalty to hamilton hamiltonians who surround him jefferson soon remarked are only a little less hostile to him than to me although aware of hamilton s influence adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession adams maintained economic programs of hamilton who regularly consulted with key cabinet members especially powerful treasury secretary oliver wolcott jr adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet often making decisions despite opposition from it hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by washington shortly after adams was inaugurated hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for new administration adams dismissively ignored it failed peace commission and xyz affair thumb right a political cartoon depicts xyz affair america is a female being plundered by frenchmen 1798 historian joseph ellis writes that t he adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of american policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of office that question was whether to make war with france or find peace in europe britain and france were at war as a result of french revolution hamilton and federalists favored british monarchy against what they perceived to be political and anti religious radicalism of french revolution while jefferson and republicans with their firm opposition to monarchy strongly supported france french had supported jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss when adams entered office he decided to continue washington s policy of staying out of war because of jay treaty french saw america as britain s junior partner and began seizing american merchant ships that were trading with british most americans were still pro french due to france s assistance during revolution perceived humiliation of jay treaty and their desire to support a republic against british monarchy and would not tolerate war with france on may 16 1797 adams gave a speech to house and senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with france he announced that he would send a peace commission to france but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential french threat speech was well received by federalists adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and emblems of defense in other republicans were outraged for adams had not only failed to express support for cause of french republic but appeared to be calling for war against it sentiments changed with xyz affair peace commission that adams appointed consisted of john marshall charles cotesworth pinckney and elbridge gerry jefferson met four times with joseph letombe french consul in philadelphia letombe wrote to paris stating that jefferson had told him that it was in france s best interest to treat american ministers civilly but then drag out negotiations at length to arrive at most favorable solution according to letombe jefferson called adams vain suspicious and stubborn when envoys arrived in october they were kept waiting for several days and then granted only a 15 minute meeting with french foreign minister talleyrand diplomats were then met by three of talleyrand s agents french emissaries later code named x y and z refused to conduct negotiations unless united states paid enormous bribes one to talleyrand personally and another to republic of france supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to france by adams in his speech americans refused to negotiate on such terms marshall and pinckney returned home while gerry remained news of disastrous peace mission arrived in form of a memorandum from marshall on march 4 1798 adams not wanting to incite violent impulses among populace announced that mission had failed without providing details he also sent a message to congress asking for a renewal of nation s defenses republicans frustrated president s defense measures suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to france house with support of federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in messages and were happy to assist republicans voted overwhelmingly to demand that adams release papers once they were released republicans according to abigail were struck dumb benjamin franklin bache editor of philadelphia aurora blamed adams s aggression as cause of disaster among general public effects were very different affair substantially weakened popular american support of france adams reached height of his popularity as many in country called for full scale war against french alien and sedition acts despite xyz affair republican opposition persisted federalists accused french and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest in an attempt to quell outcry federalists introduced and congress passed a series of laws collectively referred to as alien and sedition acts which were signed by adams in june 1798 congress specifically passed four measures naturalization act alien friends act alien enemies act and sedition act all came within a period of two weeks in what jefferson called an unguarded passion alien friends act alien enemies act and naturalization acts targeted immigrants specifically french by giving president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements sedition act made it a crime to publish false scandalous and malicious writing against government or its officials adams had not promoted any of these acts but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet he eventually agreed and signed bills into law thumb right thomas jefferson adams s vice president attempted to undermine many of his actions as president and eventually defeated him for reelection administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under sedition act as well as suits against five of six most prominent republican newspapers majority of legal actions began in 1798 and 1799 and went to trial on eve of 1800 presidential election other historians have cited evidence that alien and sedition acts were rarely enforced namely 1 only 10 convictions under sedition act have been identified 2 adams never signed a deportation order and 3 sources of expressed furor over acts were republicans acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed federalists congressman matthew lyon of vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing president adams resisted pickering s attempts to deport aliens although many left on their own largely in response to hostile environment republicans were outraged jefferson disgusted by acts wrote nothing publicly but partnered with madison to secretly draft kentucky and virginia resolutions jefferson writing for kentucky wrote that states had natural right to nullify any acts they deemed unconstitutional writing to madison he speculated that as a last resort states might have to sever ourselves from union we so much value federalists reacted bitterly to resolutions which were to have far more lasting implications for country than alien and sedition acts still acts adams signed into law energized and unified republican party while doing little to unite federalists quasi war in may 1798 a french privateer captured a merchant vessel off of new york harbor an increase in attacks on sea marked beginning of undeclared naval war known as quasi war adams knew that america would be unable to win a major conflict both because of its internal divisions and because france at time was dominating fight in most of europe he pursued a strategy whereby america harassed french ships in an effort sufficient to stem french assaults on american interests in may shortly after attack in new york congress created a separate navy department prospect of a french invasion of u s mainland led for calls to build up army hamilton and other high federalists were particularly adamant that a large army be called up in spite of a common fear particularly among republicans that large standing armies were subversive to liberty in may a provisional army of 10 000 soldiers was authorized by congress in july congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies these numbers exceeded adams s requests but fell short of hamilton s adams was pressured by federalists to appoint hamilton who had served as washington s aide de camp during revolution to command army distrustful of hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration adams appointed washington to command without consulting him washington was surprised and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates he wished to have henry knox as second in command followed by hamilton and then charles pinckney on june 2 hamilton wrote to washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made inspector general and second in command washington conceded that hamilton despite holding a rank lower than that of knox and pinckney had by serving on his staff more opportunity to comprehend whole military scene and should therefore outrank them adams sent secretary of war mchenry to mount vernon to convince washington to accept post mchenry put forth his opinion that washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers adams had intended to appoint republicans burr and frederick muhlenberg to make army appear bipartisan washington s list consisted entirely of federalists adams relented and agreed to submit to senate names of hamilton pinckney and knox in that order although final decisions of rank would be reserved to adams knox refused to serve under these conditions adams firmly intended to give to hamilton lowest possible rank while washington and many other federalists wrongly insisted that order in which names had been submitted to senate must determine seniority on september 21 adams received a letter from mchenry relaying a statement from washington threatening to resign if hamilton were not made second in command adams knew of backlash that he would receive from federalists should he continue his course and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow federalists severe illness of abigail whom adams was feared was near death exacerbated his suffering and frustration thumb left alexander hamilton s desire for high military rank and his push for war with france put him into conflict with adams it quickly became apparent that due to washington s advanced age hamilton was army s de facto commander he exerted effective control over war department taking over supplies for army meanwhile adams built up navy adding six fast powerful frigates most notably uss constitution quasi war continued but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in fall once news arrived of french defeat at battle of nile which many americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate in october adams heard from gerry in paris that french wanted to make peace and would properly receive an american delegation that december in his address to congress adams relayed these statements while expressing need to maintain adequate defenses speech angered both federalists including hamilton many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war and republicans hamilton secretly promoted a plan already rejected by adams in which american and british troops would combine to seize spanish florida and louisiana ostensibly to deter a possible french invasion hamilton s critics including abigail saw in his military buildups signs of an aspiring military dictator on february 18 1799 adams surprised many by nominating diplomat william vans murray on a peace mission to france decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even abigail who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a master stroke to placate republicans he nominated patrick henry and ellsworth to accompany murray and senate immediately approved them on march 3 henry declined nomination and adams chose william richardson davie to replace him hamilton strongly criticized decision as did adams s cabinet members who maintained frequent communication with him adams again questioned loyalty of those men but did not remove them to annoyance of many adams spent a full seven months march to september of 1799 in peacefield finally returning to trenton where government had set up temporary quarters due to yellow fever epidemic after a letter arrived from talleyrand confirming gerry s statement that american ministers would be received adams then decided to send commissioners to france adams arrived back in trenton on october 10 shortly after hamilton in a breach of military protocol arrived uninvited at city to speak with president urging him not to send peace commissioners but instead to ally with britain which he viewed to be stronger party to restore bourbons to france i heard him with perfect good humor though never in my life did i hear a man talk more like a fool adams said he regarded hamilton s idea as chimerical and far fetched on november 15 commissioners set sail for paris fries s rebellion to pay for military buildup of quasi war adams and his federalist allies enacted direct tax of 1798 direct taxation by federal government was widely unpopular and government s revenue under washington had mostly come from excise taxes and tariffs though washington had maintained a balanced budget with help of a growing economy increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits and federalists developed a taxation plan to meet need for increased government revenue direct tax of 1798 instituted a progressive land value tax of up to 1 of value of a property taxpayers in eastern pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors and in march 1799 bloodless fries s rebellion broke out led by revolutionary war veteran john fries rural german speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties they intimidated tax collectors who often found themselves unable to go about their business disturbance was quickly ended with hamilton leading army to restore peace fries and two other leaders were arrested found guilty of treason and sentenced to hang they appealed to adams requesting a pardon cabinet unanimously advised adams to refuse but he instead granted pardon using as justification argument that men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion in his pamphlet attacking adams before election hamilton wrote that it was impossible to commit a greater error federalist divisions and peace on may 5 1800 adams s frustrations with hamilton wing of party exploded during a meeting with mchenry a hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded even by hamilton as an inept secretary of war adams accused him of subservience to hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as jefferson s vice president or minister at hague than be beholden to hamilton for presidency mchenry offered to resign at once and adams accepted on may 10 he asked pickering to resign pickering refused and was summarily dismissed adams named john marshall as secretary of state and samuel dexter as secretary of war in 1799 napoleon took over as head of french government in coup of 18 brumaire and declared french revolution over news of this event increased adams s desire to disband provisional army which with washington now dead was commanded only by hamilton his moves to end army after departures of mchenry and pickering were met with little opposition rather than allow adams to receive credit federalists joined with republicans in voting to disband army in mid 1800 napoleon realizing that conflict was pointless signaled his readiness for friendly relations by convention of 1800 two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for peaceful transfer of non military goods to an enemy of nation on january 23 1801 senate voted 16 14 in favor of treaty four votes short of necessary two thirds some federalists including hamilton urged that senate vote in favor of treaty with reservations a new proposal was then drawn up demanding that treaty of alliance of 1778 be superseded and that france pay for its damages to american property on february 3 treaty with reservations passed 22 9 and was signed by adams as president adams proudly avoided war but deeply split his party in process historian ron chernow writes that threat of jacobinism was one thing that united federalist party and that adams s elimination of it unwittingly contributed to party s demise news of peace treaty did not arrive in united states until after election too late to sway results establishing government institutions and move to washington adams s leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called father of american navy in july 1798 he signed into law an act for relief of sick and disabled seamen which authorized establishment of a government operated marine hospital service in 1800 he signed law establishing library of congress adams made his first official visit to nation s new seat of government in early june 1800 amid raw and unfinished cityscape president found public buildings in a much greater of completion than expected he moved into nearly completed president s mansion later known as white house on november 1 abigail arrived a few weeks later upon arriving adams wrote to her before i end my letter i pray heaven to bestow best of blessings on this house and all that shall hereafter inhabit it may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof senate of 7th congress met for first time in new congress house later known as capitol building on november 17 1800 on november 22 adams delivered his fourth state of union address to a joint session of congress in old supreme court chamber this would be last annual message any president would personally deliver to congress for next 113 years election of 1800 thumb upright 1 15 1800 presidential election results with federalist party deeply split over his negotiations with france and opposition republican party enraged over alien and sedition acts and expansion of military adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in 1800 federalist congressmen in spring of 1800 and nominated adams and charles cotesworth pinckney republicans nominated jefferson and burr their candidates in previous election ferling ch 19 campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides federalists claimed that republicans were enemies of all who love order peace virtue and religion they were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states rights over union and would instigate anarchy and civil war jefferson s rumored affairs with slaves were used against him republicans in turn accused federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring britain and other coalition countries in their war with france to promote aristocratic anti republican values jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of people while adams was labelled a monarchist he was accused of insanity and marital infidelity james t callender a republican propagandist secretly financed by jefferson degraded adams s character and accused him of attempting to make war with france callender was arrested and jailed under sedition act which only further inflamed republican passions opposition from federalist party was at times equally intense some including pickering accused adams of colluding with jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president hamilton was hard at work attempting to sabotage president s reelection planning an indictment of adams s character he requested and received private documents from both ousted cabinet secretaries and wolcott letter was intended for only a few federalist electors upon seeing a draft several federalists urged hamilton not to send it wolcott wrote that poor old man could do himself in without hamilton s assistance hamilton did not heed their advice on october 24 he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking adams s policies and character hamilton denounced precipitate nomination of murray pardoning of fries and firing of pickering he included a fair share of personal insults vilifying president s disgusting egotism and ungovernable temper adams he concluded was emotionally unstable given to impulsive and irrational decisions unable to coexist with his closest advisers and generally unfit to be president strangely it ended by saying that electors should support adams and pinckney equally thanks to burr who had covertly obtained a copy pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout country by republicans who rejoiced in what it contained pamphlet destroyed federalist party ended hamilton s political career and helped ensure adams s already likely defeat when electoral votes were counted adams finished in third place with 65 votes and pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes jefferson and burr tied for first place with 73 votes each because of tie election devolved upon house of representatives with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory on february 17 1801 on 36th ballot jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4 two states abstained it is noteworthy that hamilton s scheme although it made federalists appear divided and therefore helped jefferson win failed in its overall attempt to woo federalist electors away from adams to compound agony of his defeat adams s son charles a long time alcoholic died on november 30 anxious to rejoin abigail who had already left for massachusetts adams departed white house in predawn hours of march 4 1801 and did not attend jefferson s inauguration since him only three out going presidents having served a full term have not attended their successors inaugurations complications arising out of 1796 and 1800 elections prompted congress and states to refine process whereby electoral college elects a president and a vice president through 12th amendment which became a part of constitution in 1804 cabinet judicial appointments thumb right john marshall 4th chief justice of u s supreme court and one of adams s few dependable allies adams appointed two u s supreme court associate justices during his term in office bushrod washington nephew of american founding father and president george washington and alfred moore after retirement of ellsworth due to ill health in 1800 it fell to adams to appoint court s fourth chief justice at time it was not yet certain whether jefferson or burr would win election regardless adams believed that choice should be someone in full vigor of middle age who could counter what might be a long line of successive republican presidents adams chose his secretary of state john marshall he along with stoddert was one of adams s few trusted cabinet members and was among first to greet him when he arrived at white house adams signed his commission on january 31 and senate approved it immediately marshall s long tenure left a lasting influence on court he maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation of constitution and established judicial branch as equal of executive and legislative branches after federalists lost control of both houses of congress along with white house in election of 1800 lame duck session of 6th congress in february 1801 approved a judiciary act commonly known as midnight judges act which created a set of federal appeals courts between district courts and supreme court adams filled vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges whom his opponents called midnight judges just days before his term expired most of these judges lost their posts when 7th congress with a solid republican majority approved judiciary act of 1802 abolishing newly created courts retirement initial years adams resumed farming at peacefield in town of quincy and began work on an autobiography work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited most of adams s attention was focused on farm work he regularly worked around farm but mostly left manual labor to hired hands his frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801 in 1803 bank holding his cash reserves of about 13 000 collapsed john quincy resolved crisis by buying his properties in weymouth and quincy including peacefield for 12 800 during first four years of retirement adams made little effort to contact others but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as benjamin waterhouse and benjamin rush adams generally stayed quiet on public matters he did not publicly denounce jefferson s actions as president believing that instead of opposing systematically any administration running down their characters and opposing all their measures right or wrong we ought to support every administration as far as we can in justice when a disgruntled james callender angry at not being appointed to an office turned on president by revealing sally hemings affair adams said nothing john quincy was elected to senate in 1803 shortly thereafter both he and his father crossed party lines to support jefferson s louisiana purchase only major political incident involving adams during jefferson years was a dispute with mercy otis warren in 1806 warren an old friend had written a history of american revolution attacking adams for his partiality for monarchy and pride of talents and much ambition a tempestuous correspondence ensued in time their friendship healed adams did privately criticize president over his embargo act despite fact that john quincy voted for it john quincy resigned from senate in 1808 after federalist controlled state senate refused to nominate him for a second term after federalists denounced john quincy as no longer being of their party adams wrote to him that he himself had long since abdicated and disclaimed name and character and attributes of that sect after jefferson s retirement from public life in 1809 adams became more vocal he published a three year marathon of letters in boston patriot newspaper refuting line by line hamilton s 1800 pamphlet initial piece was written shortly after his return from peacefield and had gathered dust for eight years adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact john quincy should he ever seek office although hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with aaron burr adams felt need to vindicate his character against his charges with his son having broken from federalist party and joined republicans he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career adams supported war of 1812 having worried over rise of sectionalism he celebrated growth of a national character that accompanied it adams supported james madison for reelection to presidency in 1812 daughter abigail nabby was married to representative william stephens smith but she returned to her parents home after failure of marriage she died of breast cancer in 1813 correspondence with jefferson in early 1801 adams sent thomas jefferson a brief note after returning to quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency jefferson failed to respond and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years in 1804 abigail unbeknownst to her husband wrote to jefferson to express her condolences upon death of his daughter polly who had stayed with adamses in london in 1787 this initiated a brief correspondence between two which quickly descended into political rancor jefferson terminated it by not replying to abigail s fourth letter aside from that by 1812 there had been no communication between peacefield and monticello since adams left office thumb right john adams c 1816 by samuel morse brooklyn museum alt an unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair slightly pointing left in early 1812 adams reconciled with jefferson previous year had been tragic for adams his brother in law and friend richard cranch had

declaration of independence who had been corresponding with both encouraged them to reach out to each other on new year s day adams sent a brief friendly note to jefferson to accompany a two volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by john quincy adams jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter and two men revived their friendship which they sustained by mail correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted rest of their lives and has been hailed as among their great legacies of american literature their letters represent an insight into both period and minds of two revolutionary leaders and presidents missives lasted fourteen years and consisted of 158 letters 109 from adams and 49 from jefferson early on adams repeatedly tried to turn correspondence to a discussion of their actions in political arena jefferson refused to oblige him saying that nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age thomas jefferson to john adams june 27 1813 cappon p 338 adams made one more attempt writing that you and i ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other john adams to thomas jefferson july 15 1813 cappon p 358 still jefferson declined to engage adams in this sort of discussion adams accepted this and correspondence turned to other matters particularly philosophy and their daily habits as two men became older letters grew fewer and farther between there was also important information that each man kept to himself jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house domestic turmoil slave ownership or poor financial situation while adams did not mention troublesome behavior of his son thomas who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic resorting afterwards to living

legislature and a weak executive elected by legislature according to adams author had a better hand at pulling down than building he believed that views expressed in pamphlet were so without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise that it must produce confusion and every evil work what paine advocated was a radical democracy with views of majority neither checked nor counterbalanced this was incompatible with system of checks and balances that conservatives like adams would implement some delegates urged adams to commit his views to paper he did so in separate letters to these colleagues so impressed was richard henry lee that with adams s consent he had most comprehensive letter printed published anonymously in april 1776 it was titled thoughts on government and styled as a letter from a gentleman to his friend many historians agree that none of adams s other compositions rivaled enduring influence of this pamphlet adams advised that form of government should be chosen to attain desired ends happiness and virtue of greatest number of people he wrote that there is no good government but what is republican that only valuable part of british constitution is so because very definition of a republic is an empire of laws and not of men treatise defended bicameralism for a single assembly is liable to all vices follies and frailties of an individual adams vol iv p 195 thoughts on government adams suggested that there should be a separation of powers between executive judicial and legislative branches and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it should sacredly be confined to certain enumerated powers thoughts on government was referenced in every state constitution writing hall adams used letter to attack opponents of independence he claimed that john dickinson s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence and wrote that opposition from southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it massachusetts constitution after returning from his first mission to france in 1779 adams was elected to massachusetts constitutional convention with purpose of establishing a new constitution for massachusetts he served on a committee of three also including samuel adams and james bowdoin to draft constitution task of writing it fell primarily to john adams resulting constitution of massachusetts was approved in 1780 it was first constitution written by a special committee then ratified by people and was first to feature a bicameral legislature included were a distinct executive though restrained by an executive council with a qualified two thirds veto and an independent judicial branch judges were given lifetime appointments allowed to hold their offices during good behavior constitution affirmed duty of individual to worship supreme being and that he had right to do so without molestation in manner most agreeable to dictates of his own conscience it established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to children of all citizens adams was a strong believer in good education as one of pillars of enlightenment he believed that people in a state of ignorance were more easily enslaved while those enlightened with knowledge would be better able to protect their liberties adams became one of founders of american academy of arts and sciences in 1780 defence of constitutions adams s preoccupation with political and governmental affairs which caused considerable separation from his wife and children had a distinct familial context which he articulated in 1780 i must study politicks and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematicks and philosophy my sons ought to study geography natural history naval architecture navigation commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting poetry musick architecture statuary tapestry and while in london adams learned of a convention being planned to amend articles of confederation in january 1787 he published a work entitled a defence of constitutions of government of united states pamphlet repudiated views of turgot and other european writers as to viciousness of state government frameworks he suggested that rich well born and able should be set apart from other men in a senate that would prevent them from dominating lower house adams s defence is described as an articulation of theory of mixed government adams contended that social classes exist in every political society and that a good government must accept that reality for centuries dating back to aristotle a mixed regime balancing monarchy aristocracy and democracy that is king nobles and people was required to preserve order and liberty historian gordon s wood has maintained that adams s political philosophy had become irrelevant by time federal constitution was ratified by then american political thought transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures had abandoned classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates americans new understanding of popular sovereignty was that citizenry were sole possessors of power in nation representatives in government enjoyed mere portions of people s power and only for a limited time adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to older version of politics yet wood was accused of ignoring adams s peculiar definition of term republic and his support for a constitution ratified by people on separation of powers adams wrote that power must be opposed to power and interest to interest works of john adams iv 557 this sentiment was later echoed by james madison s statement that a must be made to counteract ambition in federalist no 51 explaining separation of powers established under new constitution adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions and a single democratically elected house if left unchecked would be subject to this error and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive he wrote that a strong executive would defend people s liberties against aristocrats attempting to take it away on government s role in education adams stated that whole people must take upon themselves education of whole people and be willing to bear expenses of it there should not be a district of one mile square without a school in it not founded by a charitable individual but maintained at public expense of people themselves adams letter to john jebb vol 9 p 540 adams first saw new united states constitution in late 1787 to jefferson he wrote that he read it with great satisfaction adams expressed regret that president would be unable to make appointments without senate approval and over absence of a bill of rights should not such a thing have preceded model he asked political philosophy and views slavery adams never owned a slave and declined on principle to use slave labor saying i have through my whole life held practice of slavery in such abhorrence that i have never owned a negro or any other slave though i have lived for many years in times when practice was not disgraceful when best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for labor and subsistence of free men which i might have saved by purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap before war he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom adams generally tried to keep issue out of national politics because of anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence he spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in massachusetts saying that issue was presently too divisive and so legislation should sleep for a time he also was against use of black soldiers in revolution due to opposition from southerners slavery was abolished in massachusetts about 1780 when it was forbidden by implication in declaration of rights that john adams wrote into massachusetts constitution abigail adams vocally opposed slavery accusations of monarchism throughout his lifetime adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions at times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches suggesting for example that hereditary monarchy or aristocracy are only institutions that can possibly preserve laws and liberties of people yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas calling himself a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to monarchy and no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in america such denials did not assuage his critics and adams was often accused of being a monarchist historian clinton rossiter portrays adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with stability of monarchy to create ordered liberty his 1790 discourses on davila published in gazette of united states warned once again of dangers of unbridled democracy thumb john adams by gilbert stuart 1823 this portrait was last ever made of adams done at request of john quincy alt an elderly man sits in a red chair with his arms crossed looking slightly left many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous including suggestions that he was planning to crown himself king and grooming john quincy as heir to throne peter shaw has argued that t he inevitable attacks on adams crude as they were stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself he was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy as distinct from kings and aristocrats decidedly sometime after he became vice president adams concluded that united states would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life in contrast to such notions adams asserted in a letter to thomas jefferson according to luke mayville adams synthesized two strands of thought practical study of past and present governments and scottish enlightenment thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics adams conclusion was that great danger was that an oligarchy of wealthy would take hold to detriment of equality to counter that danger power of wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions and checked by a strong executive religious views adams was raised a congregationalist since his ancestors were puritans according to biographer david mccullough as his family and friends knew adams was both a devout christian and an independent thinker and he saw no conflict in that in a letter to rush adams credited religion with success of his ancestors since their migration to new world he believed that regular church service was beneficial to man s moral sense everett 1966 concludes that adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection fielding 1940 argues that adams s beliefs synthesized puritan deist and humanist concepts adams at one point said that christianity had originally been revelatory but was being misinterpreted in service of superstition fraud and unscrupulous power frazer 2004 notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology adams clearly was not a deist deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by god consequently deists did not believe in miracles or god s providence adams did believe in miracles providence and to a certain extent bible as revelation frazer gregg l 2004 political theology of american founding phd dissertation claremont graduate university p 46 frazer argues that adams s theistic rationalism like that of other founders was a sort of middle ground between protestantism and deism frazer gregg l 2004 political theology of american founding phd dissertation claremont graduate university p 50 in 1796 adams denounced thomas paine s deistic criticisms of christianity in age of reason saying christian religion is above all religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times religion of wisdom virtue equity and humanity let blackguard paine say what he will but historian gordon s wood 2017 writes although both jefferson and adams denied miracles of bible and divinity of christ adams always retained a respect for religiosity of people that jefferson never had in fact jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings in his retirement years adams moved away from some of puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream enlightenment religious ideals he blamed institutional christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society he became a unitarian rejecting divinity of jesus david l holmes argues that adams while adopting central tenets of unitarian creed accepted jesus as redeemer of humanity and biblical accounts of his miracles as true legacy historical reputation franklin summed up what many thought of adams when he said he means well for his country is always an honest man often a wise one but sometimes and in some things absolutely out of his senses adams came to be seen as someone with a long distinguished and honorable career in public service and a man of great patriotism and integrity but whose vanity stubbornness and often got him into unnecessary trouble adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history these feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other founders historian george herring argues that adams was most independent minded of founders though he formally aligned with federalists he was somewhat a party unto himself at times disagreeing with federalists as much as he did republicans he was often described as prickly but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in face of universal opposition adams was often combative which diminished presidential decorum as he admitted in his old age as president i refused to suffer in silence i sighed sobbed and groaned and sometimes screeched and screamed and i must confess to my shame and sorrow that i sometimes swore stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits a fact for which adams made no apology thanks to god that he gave me stubbornness when i know i am right he wrote his resolve to advance peace with france while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection most historians applaud him for avoiding an all out war with france during his presidency his signing of alien and sedition acts is almost always condemned according to ferling adams s political philosophy fell out of step with way that country was heading country tended further away from adams s emphasis on order and rule of law and towards jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government in years following his retirement from public life as first jeffersonianism and then jacksonian democracy grew to dominate american politics adams was largely forgotten when his name was mentioned it was typically not in a favorable way in 1840 presidential election whig candidate william henry harrison was attacked by democrats on false allegation that he had once been a supporter of john adams adams was eventually subject to criticism from states rights advocates edward a pollard a strong supporter of confederacy during american civil war singled out adams writing in 21st century adams remains less well known than many of america s other founding fathers mccullough argued that t he problem with adams is that most americans know nothing about him todd leopold of cnn wrote in 2001 that adams is remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between washington and jefferson and as a short vain somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues he has always been seen ferling says as honest and dedicated but despite his lengthy career in public service adams is still overshadowed by dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries gilbert chinard in his 1933 biography of adams described man as staunch honest stubborn and somewhat narrow in his two volume 1962 biography page smith lauds adams for his fight against radicals such as thomas paine whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery ferling in his 1992 biography writes that adams was his own worst enemy he criticizes him for his pettiness jealousy and vanity and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children he praises adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them in 1995 peter shaw published character of john adams ferling believes that man who emerges is one perpetually at war with himself whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity in 2001 david mccullough published a biography of president entitled john adams mccullough lauds adams for consistency and honesty plays down or explains away his more controversial actions such as dispute over presidential titles and predawn flight from white house and criticizes his friend and rival jefferson book sold very well and was very favorably received and along with ferling biography contributed to a rapid resurgence in adams s reputation in 2008 a miniseries was released based on mccullough biography featuring paul giamatti as adams in memoriam adams is commemorated as namesake of various counties buildings and other items one example is john adams building of library of congress an institution whose existence adams had signed into law unlike many other founders adams does not have a monument dedicated to him in washington d c according to mccullough popular symbolism has not been very generous toward adams there is no memorial no statue in his honor in our nation s capital and to me that is absolutely inexcusable it s long past time when we should recognize what he did and who he was notes references sources biographies specialized studies primary sources butterfield l h et al eds adams papers 1961
