protagonist encountering an infected crewmember development of system shock 2 began in 1997 when looking glass studios approached irrational games with an idea to co develop a new game development team were fans of system shock and sought to create a similar game early story ideas were similar to novella heart of darkness in an early draft player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship original title of game according to its pitch document was junction point philosophy of design was to continue to develop concept of a dungeon crawler like ultima underworld stygian abyss in a science fiction setting basis for system shock however press mistook system shock to be closer to a doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of system shock with junction point goal was to add in significant role playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance game from doom title took 18 months to create with a budget of 1 7 million and was pitched to several publishers until electronic arts who owned rights to shock franchise responded by suggesting game become a sequel to system shock development team agreed electronic arts became publisher and story changes were made to incorporate franchise project was allotted one year to be completed and to compensate for short time frame staff began working with looking glass studio s unfinished dark engine same engine used to create thief dark project designers included role playing elements in game similar to ultima underworld another looking glass studios project environment in system shock 2 is persistent and constantly changes without player s presence paper and pencil role playing games were influential character customization system was based on travellers methodology and was implemented in fictional military branches which by allowing multiple character paths player could receive a more open ended gameplay experience horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it isolation was deemed primary which resulted in player having little physical contact with other sentient beings secondly a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character last were inclusion of moody sound effects and intelligent placement of lighting and shadows game s lead designer ken levine oversaw return of system shock villain shodan part of levine s design was to ally player with her as he believed that game characters were too trusting stating good guys are good bad guys are bad what you see and perceive is real levine sought to challenge this notion by having shodan betray player sometimes characters are betrayed but player never is i wanted to violate that trust and make player feel that they and not only character were led on and deceived this design choice was controversial with development team several problems were encountered during project because team comprised two software companies tension emerged regarding job assignments and some developers left project additionally many employees were largely inexperienced but in retrospect project manager jonathan chey felt this was advantageous stating inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment that might not have been present with a more jaded set of developers dark engine posed problems of its own it was unfinished forcing programmers to fix software bugs when encountered in contrast working closely with engine code allowed them to write additional features not all setbacks were localized a demonstration build at e3 was hindered when it was requested all guns be removed from presentation due to then recent columbine high school massacre release a demo for game featuring a tutorial and a third of first mission was released on august 2 1999 nine days later system shock 2 was shipped to retailers an enhancement patch was released a month later and added significant features such as co operative multiplayer and control over weapon degradation and enemy respawn rates a port was planned for dreamcast but was canceled end of support around 2000 with end of support for game by developer and publisher remaining bugs and compatibility with newer operating systems and hardware became a growing problem to compensate missing support some fans of game became active in modding community to update game for instance rebirth graphical enhancement mod replaced many low polygonal models with higher quality ones a shock texture upgrade project increased resolution of textures and an updated level editor was released by user community intellectual property debacle and re release intellectual property ip rights of system shock 2 were caught for years in complications between electronic arts and meadowbrook insurance group parent company of star insurance company entity that acquired assets of looking glass studios on their closure though according to a lawyer for star insurance they themselves have since acquired lingering intellectual property rights from ea in player community attempts had been made to update and patch system shock 2 for known issues on newer operating systems and limitations that had been hard coded into game in 2009 a complete copy of system shock 2s dark engine source code was discovered in possession of an ex looking glass studios employee who was at time continuing his work for eidos interactive in late april 2010 a user on dreamcast talk forum disassembled contents of a dreamcast development kit he had purchased and among content he received into some of source code for looking glass games including system shock an unknown user going only as le corbeau raven issued a patch for system shock 2 and thief 2 in 2012 that resolved several of known issue with dark engine and other features it is believed that patches were enabled by dreamcast kit using a combination of available source code and by disassembling libraries off development kit patch became known informally as newdark patch to distinguish it from other efforts to improve game at about same time stephen kick of night dive studios had been seeking to license system shock property as to create system shock 3 star insurance had not been willing to grant that license but did agree to allow night dive studios to bring system shock 2 to modern systems shortly after getting this approval newdark
