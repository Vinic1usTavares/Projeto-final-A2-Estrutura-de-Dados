engineering student barbara 1958 1989 nursing student in addition suicides were later reported among students who had been present at time of massacre at least two students left notes confirming that they committed suicide due to distress caused by massacre perpetrator shooter marc lepine initially named gamil gharbi was born to a french canadian mother and an algerian his father a mutual funds salesman did not consider women to be equal of men he was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son discouraging tenderness between mother and child when gamil was seven his parents separated his father ceased contact with his children soon after his mother returned to nursing to support family and because of her schedule children lived with other families during week at 14 gamil changed his name to marc lepine citing his hatred of his father as reason for taking his mother s surname lepine attempted to join canadian army during winter of 1980 1981 but according to his suicide letter was rejected because he was anti social quoted in montreal massacre a story of membership categorization analysis eds p eglin and s hester 2003 brief biography of marc lepine that police released day after killings described him as intelligent but troubled he disliked feminists career women and women in traditionally male occupations such as police force he began a pre university cegep college program in pure sciences in 1982 but switched to a three year vocational program in electronics technology after his first year he abandoned this program in his final semester without explanation lepine applied to ecole polytechnique in 1986 and in 1989 but lacked two cegep courses required for admission he completed one of them in winter of 1989 search for a rationale a public inquiry was not held and marc lepine s suicide letter was not officially released as government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about massacre would cause pain to families and lead to antifeminist violence in addition although an extensive police investigation into marc lepine and killings took place resulting report was not made public though a copy was used by coroner as a source in her investigation media academics women s organizations and family members of victims protested lack of a public inquiry and paucity of information released thumb left memorial in minto park ottawa alt circular monument in a park and made of multiple grey stones large central stone contains a bilingual inscription in memory of women killed by men s violence many much smaller irregularly shaped stone shafts are carved with women s names gender of marc lepine s victims as well as his oral statements during massacre and suicide note quickly led to event s being seen as an antifeminist attack and as an example of wider issue of violence against women feminist scholars consider lepine s actions to spring from a widespread societal misogyny including toleration of violence against women scholars have categorized it as a pseudo community type of pseudo commando murder suicide in which perpetrator targets a specific group often in a public place and intends to die in a blaze of glory criminologists regard massacre as an example of a hate or bias crime against women as victims were selected solely because of their membership in category of women and those targeted were interchangeable with others from same group lepine s mother later wondered if attack was not directed at her as some would have considered her a feminist since she was a single working mother others including television journalist barbara frum pleaded that massacre not be seen as an antifeminist attack or violence against women and questioned why people insisted on diminishing tragedy by suggesting that it was an act against just one group as predicted by marc lepine in his suicide letter some saw event as isolated act of a madman a psychiatrist interviewed lepine s family and friends and examined his writings as part of police investigation he noted that marc lepine defined suicide as his primary motivation and that he chose a specific suicide method namely killing oneself after killing others multiple homicide suicide strategy which is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder other psychiatrists emphasized traumatic events of his childhood suggesting that blows he had received may have caused brain damage or that lepine was psychotic having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase memories of a brutal yet largely absent father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women a different theory was that lepine s childhood experiences of abuse led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life his mother wondered whether lepine might have suffered from attachment disorder due to abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood others expressed a broader analysis framing lepine s actions as result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty powerlessness individual isolation and polarization between men and women noting lepine s interest in violent action films some suggested that violence in media and in society may have influenced his actions effects and controversy thumb upright 1 15 place du 6 decembre 1989 december 6

thumb upright 0 7 left memorial at john engineering building mcmaster university alt a roughly edged flat grey stone inscribed with names of women murdered and dedicated by engineering community at mcmaster male survivors of massacre have been subjected to criticism for not intervening to stop lepine in an interview immediately after event a reporter asked one of men why they abandoned women when it was clear that lepine s targets were women rene sergeant at arms who persuaded denis lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack said that someone should have intervened at least to distract lepine but acknowledged that ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in midst of terror right wing newspaper columnist mark steyn suggested that male inaction during massacre illustrated a culture of passivity prevalent among men in canada which enabled lepine s shooting spree yet defining image of contemporary canadian maleness is not m lepine gharbi but professors and men in that classroom who ordered to leave by lone gunman meekly did so and abandoned their female classmates to their fate an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent shootings but nathalie provost one of survivors said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent tragedy and that her fellow students should not feel guilty anti feminist interpretation feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating massacre as a symbol of male violence against women for example charles a university of toronto computer science professor compared ku klux klan with those organizing vigils marking event writing that t he point is to use death of these people as an excuse to promote feminist extreme left wing agenda and adding that it is no more justified than kkk using murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda other critics say that lepine was a lone gunman who does not represent men and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture in this perspective feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women some men s rights and anti feminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women and without condoning shootings view massacre as an extreme expression of men s frustrations a few anti feminists view lepine as a hero and glorify his actions gun control massacre was a major spur for canadian gun control movement heidi rathjen a student who was in one of classrooms lepine did not enter during shooting organized coalition for gun control with wendy suzanne edward and jim edward parents of one of victims were also deeply involved their activities along with others led to passage of bill c 68 or firearms act in 1995 ushering in stricter gun control regulations these new regulations included requirements on training of gun owners screening of firearm applicants rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and registration of all firearms between 2009 and 2012 survivors of massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by stephen harper s conservative government aimed at ending requirement to register non restricted firearms commonly referred to as long gun registry a bill was narrowly defeated in september 2010 but following their 2011 majority election win long gun registry was abolished by harper government in april 2012 quebec government subsequently won a temporary injunction preventing destruction of province s gun registry data and ordering continued registration of long guns in quebec in march 2015 supreme court of canada ruled against quebec clearing way for destruction of all registry data police response police response to shootings was heavily criticized first police officers to arrive at scene established a perimeter around building and waited before entering building during this period several women were killed subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders handling of dawson college shooting in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a shooter in that incident coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention were credited with minimizing loss of life violence against women in response to killings a house of commons sub committee on status of women was created it released a report war against women in june 1991 which was not endorsed by full standing committee however following its recommendations federal government established canadian panel on violence against women in august 1991 panel issued a final report changing landscape ending violence achieving equality in june 1993 panel proposed a two pronged national action plan consisting of an equality action plan and a zero tolerance policy designed to increase women s equality and reduce violence against women through government policy critics of panel said that plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations final report failed to make an impact canadian women s movement sees massacre as a symbol of violence against women death of those young women would not be in vain we promised canadian feminist judy recalled we would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women memorials since 1991 anniversary of massacre has been designated national day of remembrance and action on violence against women intended as a call to action against discrimination against women a white ribbon campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in london ontario in wake of massacre for purpose of raising awareness
