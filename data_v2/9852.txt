churchill machine tool company limited began as manufacturing jones lewis p 85 of machine tool importers charles churchill company limited founded in early 1900s by us born charles churchill 1837 1916 rolt p 177 created out of personal bankruptcy of charles churchill company developed to become one of largest british importers of machine tools from united states and a major manufacturer of such tools initially under licence and later of its own development original business importing american machine tools into britain began with charles churchill as sole proprietor and later as a partnership with two others it became a limited company in 1889 in 1906 a separate company churchill machine tool co ltd was established with purpose of adapting tools imported by charles churchill co former expanded producing american tools under licence and then manufactured tools of its own design in particular precision surface grinders and similar engineering machinery in 1918 churchill machine tool co relocated its factories onto a single site at broadheath near altrincham two companies initially remained closely linked with common a chairman and board members including arthur chamberlain in early 1930s a series of board disagreements within charles churchill co led to arthur chamberlain resigning as chairman of that company he remained chairman of churchill machine tool co and two companies diverged charles churchill co changed from a sales organisation to become a manufacturer thereafter both companies manufactured machine tooling and charles churchill co became a group of companies by 1960s significant rationalisation took place in british manufacturing with companies merging or being taken over in an attempt to achieve benefits from economies of scale and pooled resources churchill machine tool co was taken over by birmingham small arms company which merged with alfred herbert ltd with production moving to coventry coincidentally charles churchill co was taken over by tube investments ti churchill machine tool co ceased trading in early 1970s along with several other companies in alfred herbert group during a period of huge contraction of manufacturing sector in britain s economy a part of charles churchill co group became matrix churchill through a convoluted corporate process a company using churchill machine tool co name still trades but charles churchill co no longer exists history charles churchill charles churchill was born in united states in hamden connecticut on 8 july 1837 his father was willis churchill described as a mechanic of rare ability original in style of his goods and in his process of manufacture who had been manufacturing brass surgical instruments at a time when such instruments were all imported to united states willis churchill founded a factory manufacturing auger drill bits which was so locally prominent that area of hamden in which it was situated was called thumb alt charles churchill charles churchill 1837 1916 charles worked in his father s auger manufacturing business but when willis went to london in 1861 to supervise installation of wire covering machinery being exported by thompson langdon co of new york city charles soon followed and once there spotted a business opportunity for himself as he saw interest that us made equipment generated by time of his death his businesses had a presence in london manchester glasgow birmingham and newcastle on tyne and was a giant machine importing business according to historian l t c rolt original installation was of machines for wire braiding crinoline frames and charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend hiram maxim who was developing a machine gun this is a moot point maxim gun was not developed for a further 20 years and it is unlikely that maxim was in england during 1860s however gatling gun was patented in 1862 rolt claimed that charles churchill co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported first examples of morse tapered twist drills self centring drill chucks manufactured by cushman and hand held micrometers into uk according to floud he imported agricultural implements and other non engineering items at this time in its early years company traded from 28 wilson street finsbury sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address charles churchill co initially operated on charles own account rather than as a limited company in his early period of operating in england he was active in patenting engineered items in conjunction with one of several other parties london gazette shows several announcements for protection under terms of patent law amendment act of 1852 see

charles churchill co was declared bankrupt by debtors petition on 1 september 1887 he declared himself bankrupt rather than be declared so by someone to whom he owed money final dividend in bankruptcy was paid in 1889 and he was released from trusteeship on 29 april 1890 he had applied earlier for discharge but it had been refused on grounds that he churchill fully tooled up that is installed assembled and made ready for productive use gatling gun factory that opened in birmingham in 1889 davenport hines p 324 this was despite being an undischarged bankrupt he had formed a partnership with his son charles henry churchill and in 1888 he obtained another partner when john william wright gabriel disposed of his family s interest in a drugs manufacturer gabriel and troke and joined churchills this partnership may explain how he was able to complete work in birmingham despite his financial status despite assertion by biographer david jeremy that j w w gabriel disposed of drugs manufacturing interest a notice in london gazette for 1885 shows his father john wild gabriel ending a partnership with troke and that troke then formed a similar arrangement with another person early years as a limited company in 1889 partnership was transformed into a limited company charles churchill co ltd company registration number there followed a period of exceptional growth and in 1896 a dividend of 230 was paid on company s share capital of ps5 500 floud pp 73 91 in an interview in us towards end of 1896 churchill explained that for financial year ending 1 september 1896 sales were ps110 000 and order book value was ps30 000 he attributed much of exceptional growth of that year to boom in bicycling and consequent demand for automatic screw machines and similar machinery and commented that he had placed orders for between 15 million and 18 million steel balls and that gas furnaces were selling well he explained that there was little competition for imported machinery not even a manufacturer of chucks as far as he was aware because english firms seemed reluctant to even copy us designs partly because of englishman s desire to have and to embody his own ideas and to what they perceived to be high capital costs of setting up production given price at which us machinery was sold there a few years later he did just that he commented in 1901 that what he called hump caused by bicycling bubble needed to be put into context growth in trade had been steady for company both before and since that time this period of british us engineering development has been subject of analysis by economic historians s b saul writing in 1960 determined that british engineering and its methods were advanced in spheres such as manufacture of textile machinery but less so in that of light machine tools and machinery of mass production he argued that in these areas response by british manufacturers to imports from us belatedly matured so their influence permeated back through whole engineering trade and began a rejuvenation of old fossilised trades in 1890s he broadly agreed with contemporary opinion of churchill that adoption of us methods was slow in light machine tools sector primarily because there was a perceived lack of demand and return on investment to excite interest of british engineers he viewed cycle boom as catalyst for growth in this area but pointed out that heavy machine tool sector was one of those which had not been previously neglected by british engineers economic historian roderick floud s analysis in 1970s of relative imports and exports led him to conclusion that it was unlikely that american share of british market was rising significantly until 1890s it rose to a peak in 1899 before settling back to a period of less astonishing but still considerable growth to 1913 he also advanced a hypothesis believing saul s analysis to be simplified which placed a heavier emphasis on happenings in us than in britain that us import tariff of 45 on machinery and engineered products which was highest in world until 1908 protected development of us industry in such products while it reached a maturity which enabled its prices to fall to a level that was highly competitive in world market in march 1897 charles churchill co ltd was put into voluntary liquidation to aid capital restructuring this comprised an increase in authorised share capital to ps50 000 ps30 000 was fully subscribed ps10 000 allotted as goodwill for old company and ps10 000 retained for later issue within two years company advertised with contact addresses at 2 10

other members of chamberlain family were later involved in company new main office in leonard street opened around 1896 and comprised over four storeys complete with internal hydraulic lifts an external hydraulic crane and electric lighting company claimed in its press release that it had more than doubled its sales compared to any previous year and that it had sales lists for in excess of

construction at factory and in 1907 around ps5 000 was spent on enlarging premises although a year on year drop in sales of 36 in 1908 demonstrated that all was not a smooth progression dividends had to be suspended for that year but were resumed in 1909 by this time company manufactured machine tools to its own design rapid expansion in use of precision grinding machines after 1910 particularly in developing car manufacturing industry focussed company s efforts on producing machines of this type many were of a revolutionary design due to technical flair of harry hales asbridge who had joined company from charles churchill co at its inception a large plain grinding machine with a swing built and installed in sheffield remained in service at least until 1990s and was used primarily to grind

fitters who were supervising female war workers an increased wage of 48 shillings per week union told company it was rate paid for similar work at armstrong whitworth when it was not a news item in an edition of american machinist of that year suggests that churchill name had a certain cachet in us as it warned that churchill machine tool co was a founder member of associated british machine tool makers ltd in 1917 an organisation that might be classed as a cartel but which was then perfectly it was a joint venture marketing company to develop export markets charles churchill co continued to handle domestic sales a further note of inter company co operation was informal saturday afternoon exchange visits between local machine shops to aid exchange of ideas and appreciate differences in

engineering businesses which included h w kearns co george richards co luke spencer ltd schaffer and linotype single storey factory covered affording potential for further expansion it forms in fact easily largest concern of this type in great britain said american machinist and was under charge of h h asbridge with s h march as general manager march s business address according to institute of mechanical engineers register in 1922 was albion street manchester and fred garbutt anderson amimeche was at oxford street address address for asbridge who was mimeche was broadheath in 1920 charles churchill co participated in a machine tool exhibition at olympia exhibition centre in london between 4 and 25 september involving many manufacturers and agents a tabulated list published at time showed company s stationary exhibits comprised machines for boring and drilling centring planing shaping drop forging and gear hobbing as well as upright radial and sensitive drills furnaces centre and precision lathes tool cutter grinders and twist drill machinery in addition it exhibited running examples of boring and turning mills machines for broaching gear cutting thread milling horizontal plain milling universal milling and vertical milling along with internal surface and cylinder plain universal grinders automatic and capstan turret lathes there are many notices before and subsequent to this of company s participation in exhibitions reported in american machinist american machinist reported in 1922 that churchill machine tool co was now almost only specialist in precision grinding machines in great britain and that uses of process in railway industry for production of axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established a summary box to article says that carborundum company and pratt whitney companies are referred to in article perhaps demonstrating that churchill could not operate in isolation despite only specialist status accorded to them early in article supplying grinding machinery to railways for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms became an important new area of operations post war government sales of used machinery had flooded domestic market for machine tools but exports initially to indian railways and then elsewhere went some way towards softening blow and churchill companies whilst scarred were able to ride out worst of post war recession among more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind valves of trumpets for salvation army an office opened at 35 victoria street bristol where lindsay somerville amimeche worked for company advertising indicates that there was an office in leeds opening probably postdating bristol possibly during 1918 as bristol is listed in advertising without mention of leeds branch but citing all other branches previously referred to boards of directors were reconstituted in 1923 john beresford stuart gabriel b 1 aug 1888 twickenham d 7 jul 1979 kenilworth son of j w w gabriel had been assistant managing director of charles churchill co ltd since 1920 and became joint managing director from 1923 in addition arthur chamberlain nephew of both herbert and walter resigned his chairmanship of kynoch ltd and became chairman of both churchill companies in november and h h asbridge became a director of churchill machine tool co in march 1924 greville simpson maginness followed chamberlain from kynoch to become managing director of churchill machine tool co and in that role he was over years to expand export markets for business emphasis on manufacturing especially that done under licence became even more apparent following imposition of a 20 duty on imported machine tools and reduced demand both triggered by great depression there was much innovation and many of these advances were pioneering techniques that are now universal although from a trading perspective things were dire for companies in particular churchill machine tool co successfully harnessed utility of hydraulics in many aspects of its machinery and developed a mechanism for grinding rollers used in for example paper industry in 1932 h h asbridge s bearing was introduced this aided precision positioning of a workpiece with almost no intervening film of lubrication j w w gabriel became sole managing director in 1932 directors had been for some years working with cincinnati milling machine co of which gabriel had been an employee before world war i and in 1933 cincinnati established an english subsidiary with gabriel as chairman this worked with churchill machine tool co in a joint manufacturing development project concerning precision grinders lloyd jones lewis p 116 machine tool company had a sales agent in australia by 1932 reorganisation chamberlain resigned as chairman of charles churchill co amid a series of board disagreements in 1934 he took control of churchill machine tool co and with maginness as managing director in december of that year embarked on a scheme to expand production and replace obsolete machinery some of it over 20 years old in an attempt to achieve an average output figure of ps40 000 per month however there were difficulties in decision making and wariness as clouds of war loomed most notably because of company s contracts to supply a needy soviet union with machine tools which had done much to assist it out of depths of depression thumb alt fay lathe a fay automatic lathe from 1921 churchill redman subsequently built a range of these under licence from jones lamson francis penny burnage son in law of charles became chairman of charles churchill co and gabriel continued to work for that company they moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what would otherwise have been just a sales organisation in december 1934 company took over cornelius redman sons renaming it churchill redman ltd facility was used initially to manufacture american machine tools under licence rather as machine tool company had started out in early 1900s a particularly notable example of its output was licence granted in 1937 by jones lamson of springfield vermont for fay automatic lathe it was to become a pattern for gabriel to orchestrate take overs of other companies but not subsume them they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity up to this point redman investment had not been a notable success in decade to 1934 despite an additional capital injection by churchill business had made losses in half of years and in only one of other years had it made any more than a modest profit however growth was steady after 1934 with profits of ps23 000 ps38 000 ps54 000 and then a large jump to ps139 000 in 1938 by 1939 redman operation alone employed 300 people compared to around 30 in 1920 motor industry expansion assisted in this growth with ford becoming a customer and gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at coventry road south yardley birmingham in 1938 to give easy access for industry s centre but rearmament was most significant factor subsequent history churchill machine tool co despite manufacturing developments churchill machine tool co experienced a lean period from 1921 to 1934 being unable to distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital commencement of european rearmament from 1935 is given as cause of a dramatic turnaround in fortunes a dividend of 12 was paid in that year in following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125 an adjustment to share capital was made and in 1938 dividend was 40 with an additional scrip bonus of 33 3 there was a subsequent fall in yield to 30 but in cash terms allowing for capital restructuring payment remained same economic historians roger lloyd jones and lewis have analysed company s minute books to derive following information on profits during inter war period churchill machine tool co ltd summary of inter war years profits ps 000 lloyd jones lewis p 91 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 24 1 32 1 9 2 3 4 8 11 3 18 4 24 2 20 1 6 5 27 3 28 6 28 9 51 4 66 7 78 3 118 8 a further example of how innovatory company could be is apparent in 1936 when it introduced first electronics for control of precision grinding machines this being a timing device although there is no evidence of industrial unrest targeted at churchill s activities until 1970s there was concern about possibility during inter war years and probability of none occurring at all is unlikely economic league was established as a right wing organisation consisting mainly of employers to counteract rise in communist and socialist propaganda and its associated activities during great war support for league was particularly strong among engineering companies in manchester area while workers in cotton industries for example seemed not generally to take a great interest in communist party left wing educational groups and shop floor agitators those in engineering industry perhaps mostly more intelligent did do so and apparent threat to capitalism and private wealth was more evident to employers of such people among league s less publicised more nefarious activities was that of intelligence gathering and promotion of systematic blacklisting methods it co operated with police and government infiltrated left wing groups and used information from disaffected ex supporters of such groups in order to obtain information about what it considered to be dangerous elements and tendencies and disseminated knowledge obtained usually in a confidential manner churchill machine tool co was one of several companies which during 1936 37 was a recipient of information concerning reports of meetings held by anti capitalist groups past and current activities of particular workers and even names of those specifically blacklisted others who received information at this time included a v roe ferranti metropolitan vickers and fairey aviation company announced post tax profits in 1949 of ps119 909 tax ps140 500 for 1950 figures were 704 and 500 respectively total dividend for those years was 30 by 1952 net profit was ps146 318 tax 000 and in 1953 respective figures were 583 and 000 dividend for both of these years was 20 but in 1953 there

managing director of bsa group s motorcycle division in 1966 churchill merged in a joint venture agreement with alfred herbert and became part of herbert bsa ltd intention being that combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities general expectation held also by department of trade and industry and stock market of rewards from venture did not materialise and bsa sold its entire holding in august 1971 writing off ps6 9m as a consequence of need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities uk economy was contracting by early 1970s and engineering businesses were rationalising their operations on a scale which raised many comments in parliament and elsewhere ratio of unemployment to vacancies in engineering and allied trades at june 1970 was more or less 1 1 but by september 1971 it was 5 1 i e five people unemployed in sector for every job available in 1972 churchill factory in altrincham was closed despite industrial action there and at alfred herbert s coventry factory to stop this happening there were representations against closure from altrincham council to government including a meeting in february 1972 when council and its delegation of industry experts met minister for trade and industry and said it was said in parliament that 1 000 people were made redundant and that in manchester 500 machine tool fitters were now chasing 10 jobs production moved to coventry as parent group herbert faced losses of ps4m although churchill had an order book of ps2 25m that could provide sufficient work to keep its 1 100 workforce in jobs through to 1974 order book value aside it was also said in parliament that churchill had lost over ps1m in previous two years churchill machine tool co was put into members voluntary liquidation on 25 october 1973 with several other companies in herbert group company s name resurfaced only to be put into voluntary liquidation again on 15 march 1985 winding up resolutions on both these occasions occurred at meetings held at canal road coventry although appointed people were different a further revival of company name took place a company formed as churchill atlantic manchester co ltd company registration number had been incorporated in 1979 and in 1999 was renamed churchill machine tool co ltd two years later in april 2001 it also failed and went into receivership there is an atlantic street in broadheath in 2011 company name continued to be used ltd registration number was incorporated in march 2001 and changed its name to churchill machine tool co ltd in june that year it trades from atlantic works in old trafford manchester and it uses slogan a century of precision grinding machinery churchill machine tools coventry ltd company registration was liquidated in 1974 significance of this company is uncertain but low registration number indicates that entity even if not using particular name had existed for some considerable time by 1950s new companies were being issued numbers around region and by 2000s this had become a series starting around subsequent history charles churchill co ltd in 1946 churchill redman ltd bought longfield foundry in halifax to provide extra production capacity and leased a part of vickers armstrong admiralty works in scotswood newcastle it was intended that newcastle site concern itself with a range of lathes intended for motor industry austin and vauxhall in particular halifax operation would focus on manufacture of fay lathes which were still being licensed from us company worked on tight profit margins immediately post war a combination of a shortage of skilled labour outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism result was that despite a booming order book redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2 16 company was by no means unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging agonising and by gabriel and a k mckay redman managing director since at least 1936 lloyd jones lewis p 130 regarding how
