thomas cranmer 2 july 1489 21 march 1556 was a leader of english reformation and archbishop of canterbury during reigns of henry viii edward vi and for a short time mary i he helped build case for annulment of henry s marriage to catherine of aragon which was one of causes of separation of english church from union with holy see along with thomas cromwell he supported principle of royal supremacy in which king was considered sovereign over church within his realm during cranmer s tenure as archbishop of canterbury he was responsible for establishing first doctrinal and liturgical structures of reformed church of england under henry s rule cranmer did not make many radical changes in church due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers however he succeeded in publishing first officially authorised vernacular service exhortation and litany when edward came to throne cranmer was able to promote major reforms he wrote and compiled first two editions of book of common prayer a complete liturgy for english church with assistance of several continental reformers to whom he gave refuge he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as eucharist clerical celibacy role of images in places of worship and veneration of saints cranmer promulgated new doctrines through prayer book homilies and other publications after accession of roman catholic mary i cranmer was put on trial for treason and heresy imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from church authorities he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with roman catholic church however on day of his execution he withdrew his recantations to die a heretic to roman catholics and a martyr for principles of english reformation cranmer s death was

born in 1489 at aslockton in nottinghamshire england only authority for date of his birth 2 july is according to ridley an anonymous biographer who wrote shortly after cranmer s death biographer makes several mistakes about cranmer s early life he was a younger son of thomas cranmer by his wife agnes hatfield thomas cranmer was of modest wealth but was from a well established armigerous gentry family which took its name from manor of cranmer in lincolnshire thomas was lord of manor of whatton which had come to his great grandfather edmund cranmer by marriage with heiress of who held it from reign of henry ii it later passed by an heiress of cranmer to sir john molyneux baronet who sold it to marquis of dorchester and in 1792 was owned by representative of duke of kingston magazine

inherited family estate whereas thomas and his younger brother edmund were placed on path to a clerical career early years 1489 1527 today historians know nothing definite about cranmer s early schooling he probably attended a grammar school in his village at age of fourteen two years after death of his father he was sent to newly created jesus college cambridge it took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his bachelor of arts degree following a curriculum of logic classical literature and philosophy during this time he began to collect medieval scholastic books which he preserved faithfully throughout his life for his master s degree he took a different course of study concentrating on humanists jacques lefevre d etaples and erasmus this time he progressed with no special delay finishing course in three years shortly after receiving his master of arts degree in 1515 he was elected to a fellowship of jesus college sometime after cranmer took his ma he married a woman named joan although he was not yet a priest he was forced to forfeit his fellowship resulting in loss of his residence at jesus college to support himself and his wife he took a job as a reader at buckingham hall later reformed as magdalene college when joan died during her first childbirth jesus college showed its regard for cranmer by reinstating his fellowship he began studying theology and by 1520 he had been ordained university already having named him as one of their preachers he received his doctor of divinity degree in 1526 not much is known about cranmer s thoughts and experiences during his three decades at cambridge traditionally he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship prepared him for adoption of lutheran ideas which were spreading during 1520s however a study of his marginalia reveals an early antipathy to martin luther and an admiration for erasmus when cardinal wolsey king s lord chancellor selected several cambridge scholars including edward lee stephen gardiner and richard sampson to be diplomats throughout europe cranmer was chosen to take a minor role in english embassy in spain two recently discovered letters written by cranmer describe an early encounter with king henry viii of england upon cranmer s return from spain in june 1527 king personally interviewed cranmer for half an hour cranmer described king as kindest of princes in service of henry viii 1527 1532 thumb henry viii recognised cranmer s value in obtaining support for annulment of his marriage with catherine of aragon

of christ henry viii s first marriage had its origins in 1502 when his elder brother arthur died their father henry vii then betrothed arthur s widow catherine of aragon to future king betrothal immediately raised questions related to biblical prohibition in leviticus 18 and 20 against marriage to a brother s wife couple married in 1509 and after a series of miscarriages a daughter mary was born in 1516 by 1520s henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a sure sign of god s anger and made overtures to vatican about an annulment according to macculloch he became convinced of this perhaps as much as two years before his passion for anne boleyn he gave cardinal wolsey task of prosecuting his case wolsey began by consulting university experts from 1527 in addition to his duties as a cambridge don cranmer assisted with annulment proceedings in summer of 1529 cranmer stayed with relatives in waltham holy cross to avoid an outbreak of plague in cambridge two of his cambridge associates stephen gardiner and edward foxe joined him three discussed annulment issue and cranmer suggested putting aside legal case in rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout europe henry showed much interest in idea when gardiner and foxe presented him this plan it is not known whether king or his new lord chancellor thomas more explicitly approved plan eventually it was implemented and cranmer was requested to join royal team in rome to gather opinions from universities edward foxe coordinated research effort and team produced collectanea sufficiently abundant collections and determinations historical and theological support for argument that king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm full title is determinations of most famous and most excellent universities of italy and france that it is unlawful for a man to marry his brother s wife that pope hath no power to dispense therewith and it is likely that cranmer undertook translation from latin to english comparing two language versions macculloch notes that document reveals first indications of a change away from his humanist catholicism towards a more radically reformist stance cranmer s first contact with a continental reformer was with simon grynaeus a humanist based in basel switzerland and a follower of swiss reformers huldrych zwingli and johannes oecolampadius in summer of 1531 grynaeus took an extended visit to england to offer himself as an intermediary between king and continental reformers he struck up a friendship with cranmer and after his return to basel he wrote about cranmer to german reformer martin bucer in strasbourg grynaeus early contacts initiated cranmer s eventual relationship with strasbourg and swiss reformers in january 1532 cranmer was appointed resident ambassador at court of holy roman emperor charles v as emperor travelled throughout his realm cranmer had to follow him to his residence in regensburg he passed through lutheran city of nuremberg and saw for first time effects of reformation when imperial diet was moved to nuremberg in summer he met leading architect of nuremberg reforms andreas osiander they became good friends and during that july cranmer took surprising action of marrying margarete niece of osiander s wife he did not take her as his mistress as was prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous scholars note that cranmer had moved however moderately at this stage into identifying with certain lutheran principles this progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade charles catherine s nephew to support annulment of his aunt s marriage appointed archbishop of canterbury 1532 1534 thumb right family of anne boleyn secured appointment of cranmer as archbishop of canterbury later portrait by an unknown artist while cranmer was following charles through italy he received a royal letter dated 1 october 1532 informing him that he had been appointed new archbishop of canterbury following death of archbishop william warham cranmer was ordered to return to england appointment had been secured by family of anne boleyn who was being courted by henry when cranmer s promotion became known in london it caused great surprise as cranmer had previously held only minor positions in church cranmer left mantua on 19 november and arrived in england at beginning of january henry personally financed papal bulls necessary for cranmer s promotion to canterbury bulls were easily acquired because papal nuncio was under orders from rome to please english in an effort to prevent a final breach bulls arrived around 26 march 1533 and cranmer was consecrated as a bishop on 30 march in st stephen s chapel by john longland bishop of lincoln john vesey bishop of exeter and henry standish bishop of st asaph even while they were waiting for bulls cranmer continued to work on annulment proceedings which required greater urgency after anne announced her pregnancy henry and anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 january 1533 in presence of a handful of witnesses cranmer did not learn of marriage until a fortnight 14 days later for next few months cranmer and king worked on establishing legal procedures on how monarch s marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy several drafts of procedures have been preserved in letters written between two once procedures were agreed upon cranmer opened court sessions on 10 may inviting henry and catherine of aragon to appear gardiner represented king catherine did not appear or send a proxy on 23 may cranmer pronounced judgement that henry s marriage with catherine was against law of god he even issued a threat of excommunication if henry did not stay away from catherine henry was now free to marry and on 28 may cranmer validated henry and anne s marriage on 1 june cranmer personally crowned and anointed anne queen and delivered to her sceptre and rod pope clement vii was furious at this defiance but he could not take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with england however on 9 july he provisionally excommunicated henry and his advisers which included cranmer unless he repudiated anne by end of september henry kept anne as his wife and on 7 september anne gave birth to elizabeth cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents it is difficult to assess how cranmer s theological views had evolved since his cambridge days there is evidence that he continued to support humanism he renewed erasmus pension that had previously been granted by archbishop warham in june 1533 he was confronted with difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer but also seeing him burnt at stake john frith was condemned to death for his views on eucharist he denied real presence cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success although he rejected frith s radicalism by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with rome and that he had set a new theological course he supported cause of reform by gradually replacing old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed new thinking such as hugh latimer he intervened in religious disputes supporting reformers to disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain link with rome under vicegerency 1535 1538 thumb right thomas cromwell was vicegerent acting as main agent for king over spiritual matters portrait by hans holbein 1532 1533 cranmer was not immediately accepted by bishops within his province when he attempted a canonical visitation he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority in 1535 cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops john stokesley john longland and stephen gardiner among others they objected to cranmer s power and title and argued that act of supremacy did not define his role this prompted thomas cromwell king s chief minister to activate and to take office of vicegerent deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs he created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to royal supremacy hence archbishop was eclipsed by vicegerent cromwell in regards to king s spiritual jurisdiction there is no evidence that cranmer resented his position as junior partner although he was an exceptional scholar he lacked political ability to even clerical opponents those tasks were left to cromwell on 29 january 1536 when anne miscarried a son king began to reflect again on biblical prohibitions that had haunted him during his marriage with catherine of aragon shortly after miscarriage king started to take an interest in jane seymour by 24 april he had commissioned cromwell to prepare case for a divorce unaware of these plans cranmer had continued to write letters to cromwell on minor matters up to 22 april anne was sent to tower of london on 2 may and cranmer was urgently summoned by cromwell on very next day cranmer wrote a letter to king expressing his doubts about queen s guilt highlighting his own esteem for anne after it was delivered however cranmer was resigned to fact that end of anne s marriage was inevitable on 16 may he saw anne in tower and heard her confession and following day he pronounced marriage null and void two days later anne was executed cranmer was one of few who publicly mourned her death vicegerency brought pace of reforms under control of king a balance was instituted between conservatives and reformers and this was seen in ten articles first attempt at defining beliefs of henrician church articles had a two part structure first five articles showed influence of reformers by recognising only three of former seven sacraments baptism eucharist and penance last five articles concerned roles of images saints rites and ceremonies and purgatory and they reflected views of traditionalists two early drafts of document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work competition between conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by cranmer and cuthbert tunstall bishop of durham end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of debate by 11 july cranmer cromwell and convocation general assembly of clergy had subscribed to ten articles in autumn of 1536 north of england was convulsed in a series of uprisings collectively known as pilgrimage of grace most serious opposition to henry s policies cromwell and cranmer were primary targets of protesters fury cromwell and king worked furiously to quell rebellion while cranmer kept a low profile after it was clear that henry s regime was safe government took initiative to remedy evident inadequacy of ten articles outcome after months of debate was institution of a christian man informally known from first issue as bishops book book was initially proposed in february 1537 in first synod ordered by cromwell for whole church cromwell opened proceedings but as synod progressed cranmer and foxe took on chairmanship and co ordination foxe did most of final editing and book was published in late september even after publication book s status remained vague because king had not given his full support to it in a draft letter henry noted that he had not read book but supported its printing his attention was most likely occupied by pregnancy of jane seymour and birth of male heir edward that henry had sought for so long jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 november that month henry started to work on bishops book his amendments were sent to cranmer sampson and others for comment cranmer s responses to king were far more confrontational than his colleagues and he wrote at much greater length they reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or sola fide faith alone and predestination however his words did not convince king a new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with publication of king s book in 1538 king and cromwell arranged with lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance henry had been seeking a new embassy from schmalkaldic league since summer 1537 lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various german cities including a colleague of martin luther friedrich delegates arrived in england on 27 may 1538 after initial meetings with king cromwell and cranmer discussions on theological differences were transferred to lambeth palace under cranmer s chairmanship progress on an agreement was slow partly due to cromwell being too busy to help expedite proceedings and partly due to negotiating team on english side which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers talks dragged on through summer with germans becoming weary despite archbishop s strenuous efforts negotiations however were fatally neutralised by an appointee of king cranmer s colleague edward foxe who sat on henry s privy council had died earlier in year king chose as his replacement cranmer s conservative rival cuthbert tunstall who was told to stay near henry to give advice on 5 august when german delegates sent a letter to king regarding three items that particularly worried them compulsory clerical celibacy withholding of chalice from laity and maintenance of private masses for dead tunstall was able to intervene for king and to influence decision result was a thorough dismissal by king of many of germans chief concerns although cranmer begged germans to continue with negotiations using argument to consider many thousands of souls in england at stake they left on 1 october having made no substantial achievements reforms reversed 1539 1542 continental reformer philipp melanchthon was aware that he was very much admired by henry in early 1539 melanchthon wrote several letters to henry criticising his views on religion in particular his support of clerical celibacy by late april another delegation from lutheran princes arrived to build on melanchthon s exhortations cromwell wrote a letter to king in support of new lutheran mission however king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in england rather than reaching out to lutherans on 28 april 1539 parliament met for first time in three years cranmer was present but cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health on 5 may house of lords created a committee with customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine however committee was given little time to do detailed work needed for a thorough revision on 16 may duke of norfolk noted that committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that lords examine six doctrinal questions which eventually formed basis of six articles they affirmed conservative interpretation of doctrines such as real presence clerical celibacy and necessity of auricular confession private confession of sins to a priest as act of six articles neared passage in parliament cranmer moved his wife and children out of england to safety up until this time family was kept quietly hidden most likely in ford palace in kent act passed parliament at end of june and it forced latimer and nicholas shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to measure thumb left philipp melanchthon was continental reformer henry most admired in 1552 cranmer invited him to participate in an ecumenical council in england engraving by albrecht durer 1526 setback for reformers was short lived by september henry was displeased with results of act and its ever loyal cranmer and cromwell were back in favour king asked his archbishop to write a new preface for great bible an english translation of bible that was first published in april 1539 under direction of cromwell preface was in form of a sermon addressed to readers as for cromwell he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between henry and anne of cleves sister of a german prince was accepted by king in cromwell s view marriage could potentially bring back contacts with schmalkaldic league henry was dismayed with anne when they first met on 1 january 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 january in a ceremony officiated by cranmer however marriage ended in disaster as henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce this resulted in henry being placed in an embarrassing position and cromwell suffered consequences his old enemies including duke of norfolk took advantage of weakened cromwell and he was arrested on 10 june he immediately lost support of all his friends including cranmer however as cranmer had done for anne boleyn he wrote a letter to king defending past work of cromwell henry s marriage to anne of cleves was quickly annulled on 9 july by vice synod now led by cranmer and gardiner following annulment cromwell was executed on 28 july according to howell several charges were brought against him but chief one was heresy cranmer now found himself in a politically prominent position with no one else to shoulder burden throughout rest of henry s reign he clung to henry s authority king had total trust in him and in return cranmer could not conceal anything from king at end of june 1541 henry with his new wife catherine howard left for his first visit to north of england cranmer was left in london as a member of a council taking care of matters for king in his absence his colleagues were lord chancellor thomas audley and edward seymour earl of hertford this was cranmer s first major piece of responsibility outside church in october while king and queen were away a reformer named john lascelles revealed to cranmer that catherine engaged in extramarital affairs cranmer gave information to audley and seymour and they decided to wait until henry s return afraid of angering king audley and seymour suggested that cranmer inform henry cranmer slipped a message to henry during mass on all saints day an investigation revealed truth of marital indiscretions and catherine was executed in february 1542 support from king 1543 1547 in 1543 several conservative clergymen in kent banded together to attack and denounce two reformers richard turner and john bland before privy council they prepared articles to present to council but at last moment additional denunciations were added by stephen gardiner s nephew germain gardiner these new articles attacked cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541 this document and actions that followed were basis of so called prebendaries plot articles were delivered to council in london and were probably read on 22 april 1543 king most likely saw articles against cranmer that night archbishop however appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made his commissioners in lambeth dealt specifically with turner s case where he was acquitted much to fury of conservatives while plot against cranmer was proceeding reformers were being attacked on other fronts on 20 april convocation reconvened to consider revision of bishops book cranmer presided over sub committees but conservatives were able to overturn many reforming ideas including justification by faith on 5 may new revision called a necessary doctrine and erudition for any christian man or king s book was released doctrinally it was far more conservative than bishops book on 10 may reformers received another blow parliament passed act for advancement of true religion which abolished erroneous books and restricted reading of bible in english to those of noble status from may to august reformers were examined forced to recant or imprisoned for five months henry took no action on accusations against his archbishop it is not known why henry took so long to react to charges against cranmer macculloch notes that it was henry s nature to brood over evidence against his archbishop he also speculates that cranmer s support of king s book made henry reflect about whether charges were serious another possibility is that in playing situation out henry could observe behaviour of leading politicians until he was ready to intervene conspiracy was finally revealed to cranmer by king himself according to cranmer s secretary ralph morice sometime in september 1543 king showed cranmer a paper summarising accusations against him an investigation was to be mounted and cranmer was appointed chief investigator surprise raids were carried out evidence gathered and ringleaders identified typically cranmer put clergymen involved in conspiracy through immediate humiliation but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services to show his trust in cranmer henry gave cranmer his personal ring when privy council arrested cranmer at end of november nobles were stymied by symbol of king s trust in him cranmer s victory ended with two second rank leaders imprisoned and germain gardiner executed left thumb portrait of cranmer painted by an unknown artist after henry viii s death it was said that his beard signified his mourning of king and his rejection of old church with atmosphere in cranmer s favour he pursued quiet efforts to reform church particularly liturgy on 27 may 1544 first officially authorised vernacular service was published processional service of intercession known as exhortation and litany it survives today with minor modifications in book of common prayer traditional litany uses invocations to saints but cranmer thoroughly reformed this aspect by providing no opportunity in text for such veneration additional reformers were elected to house of commons and new legislation was introduced to curb effects of act of six articles and act for advancement of true religion in 1546 conservatives in a coalition including gardiner duke of norfolk lord chancellor wriothesley and bishop of london edmund bonner made one last attempt to challenge reformers several reformers with links to cranmer were targeted some such as lascelles were burnt at stake however powerful reform minded nobles edward seymour and john dudley returned to england during summer from overseas and they were able to turn tide against conservatives two incidents in autumn tipped balance gardiner was disgraced before king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates and son of duke of norfolk was charged with treason and executed there is no evidence that cranmer played any part in these political games and there were no further plots as king s health ebbed in his final months cranmer performed his final duties for king on 28 january 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping henry s hand instead of giving him his last rites cranmer mourned henry s death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard beard was also a sign of his break with past continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of old church and this significance of clerical beards was well understood in england on 31 january he was among executors of king s final will that nominated edward seymour as lord protector and welcomed boy king edward vi foreign divines and reformed doctrines 1547 1549 thumb right martin bucer who had corresponded with cranmer for many years was forced to take refuge in england under regency of seymour reformers were now part of establishment a royal visitation of provinces took place in august 1547 and each parish that was visited was instructed to obtain a copy of homilies this book consisted of twelve homilies of which four were written by cranmer his reassertion of doctrine of justification by faith elicited a strong reaction from gardiner in homily of good works annexed to faith cranmer attacked monasticism and importance of various personal actions involved in liturgical recitations and ceremonies hence he narrowed range of good works that would be considered necessary and reinforced primacy of faith in each parish visited injunctions were put in place that resolved to eliminate any image which had any suspicion of devotion attached to it cranmer s eucharistic views which had already moved away from official catholic doctrine received another push from continental reformers cranmer had been in contact with martin bucer since time when initial contacts were made with schmalkaldic league however cranmer and bucer s relationship became ever closer due to charles v s victory over league at which left england as sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers cranmer wrote a letter to bucer now lost with questions on eucharistic theology in bucer s reply dated 28 november 1547 he denied corporeal real presence and condemned transubstantiation and adoration of elements letter was delivered to cranmer by two italian reformed theologians peter martyr and bernardino who were invited to take refuge in england martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by john chrysostom now regarded as a forgery ad which appeared to provide patristic support against corporeal real presence epistle was once widely accepted as written by chrysostom but is now commonly regarded as a forgery these documents were to influence cranmer s thoughts on eucharist in march 1549 city of strasbourg forced martin bucer and paul fagius to leave cranmer immediately invited men to come to england and promised that they would be placed in english universities when they arrived on 25 april cranmer was especially delighted to meet bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence he needed these scholarly men to train a new generation of preachers as well as assist in reform of liturgy and doctrine others who accepted his invitations include polish reformer jan laski but cranmer was unable to convince osiander and melanchthon to come to england book of common prayer 1548 1549 thumb right title page of 1549 book of common prayer as use of english in worship services spread need for a complete uniform liturgy for church became evident initial meetings to start what would eventually become book of common prayer were held in former abbey of chertsey and in windsor castle in september 1548 list of participants can only be partially reconstructed but it is known that members were balanced between conservatives and reformers these meetings were followed by a debate on eucharist in house of lords which took place between 14 and 19 december cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned doctrine of corporeal real presence and believed that eucharistic presence was only spiritual parliament backed publication of prayer book after christmas by passing act of uniformity 1549 it then legalized clerical marriage it is difficult to ascertain how much of prayer book is actually cranmer s personal composition generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down sources that he used including sarum rite writings from hermann von wied and several lutheran sources including osiander and justus jonas more problematic is determining how cranmer worked on book and with whom he worked despite lack of knowledge of who might have helped him however he is given credit for editorship and overall structure of book use of new prayer book was made compulsory on 9 june 1549 this triggered a series of protests in devon and cornwall where english language was not yet in common usage now known as prayer book rebellion by early july uprising had spread to other parts in east of england rebels made a number of demands including restoration of six articles use of latin for mass with only consecrated bread given to laity restoration of prayers for souls in purgatory and rebuilding of abbeys cranmer wrote a strong response to these demands to king in which he denounced wickedness of rebellion on 21 july cranmer commandeered st paul s cathedral where he vigorously defended official church line a draft of his sermon only extant written sample of his preaching from his entire career shows that he collaborated with peter martyr on dealing with rebellion consolidating gains 1549 1551 prayer book rebellion and other events had a negative effect on seymour regency privy council became divided when a set of dissident councillors banded together behind john dudley in order to oust seymour cranmer and two other councillors william paget and thomas smith initially rallied behind seymour however after a flurry of letters passed between two sides a bloodless coup d etat resulted in end of seymour s protectorship on 13 october 1549 despite support of religiously conservative politicians behind dudley s coup reformers managed to maintain control of new government and english reformation continued to consolidate gains macculloch claims that paget supported seymour but according to loades it was only smith who joined with cranmer loades also states that it was likely cranmer who persuaded seymour to surrender seymour was initially imprisoned in tower but he was shortly released on 6 february 1550 and returned to council archbishop was able to transfer his former chaplain nicholas ridley from minor see of rochester to diocese of london while john ponet took ridley s former position incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers thumb left john hooper was influenced by zwinglian reformation and advocated more radical reforms portrait by henry bryan hall 1839 first result of co operation and consultation between cranmer and bucer was ordinal liturgy for ordination of priests this was missing in first prayer book and was not published until 1550 cranmer adopted bucer s draft and created three services for commissioning a deacon a priest and a bishop in same year cranmer produced defence of true and catholic doctrine of sacrament of body and blood of christ a semi official explanation of eucharistic theology within prayer book it was first full length book to bear cranmer s name on title page preface summarises his quarrel with rome in a well known passage where he compared beads pardons pilgrimages and such other like popery with weeds but roots of weeds were transubstantiation corporeal real presence and sacrificial nature of mass although bucer assisted in development of english reformation he was still quite concerned about speed of its progress both bucer and fagius had noticed that 1549 prayer book was not a remarkable step forward although cranmer assured bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary however by winter 1550 bucer was becoming disillusioned cranmer however made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him this attention paid off during vestments controversy this incident was initiated by john hooper a follower of heinrich bullinger who had recently returned from zurich hooper was unhappy with cranmer s prayer book and ordinal and he particularly objected to use of ceremonies and vestments when privy council selected him to be bishop of gloucester on 15 may 1550 he laid down conditions that he would not wear required vestments he found an ally among continental reformers in jan laski who had become a leader of stranger church in london a designated place of worship for continental protestant refugees his church s forms and practices had taken reforms much further than cranmer would have liked however bucer and peter martyr while they sympathised with hooper s position supported cranmer s arguments of timing and authority cranmer and ridley stood their ground this led to hooper s imprisonment and he eventually gave in he was consecrated on 8 march 1551 according to ordinal and he preached before king in his episcopal garments cranmer s vision of reform through careful steps under authority of government was maintained final reform programme 1551 1553 cranmer s role in politics was diminishing when on 16 october 1551 seymour was arrested on charges of treason in december seymour was put on trial and although acquitted of treason he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 january 1552 according to loades a felony a lesser crime than treason in english law included gathering men unlawfully and plotting death of a councillor seymour admitted to these actions this was beginning of breach between cranmer and dudley it was aggravated during year by gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by regency however even throughout this political turmoil cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme revision of canon law revision of prayer book and formation of a statement of doctrine thumb left pietro vermigli or peter martyr greatly assisted cranmer in english reformation portrait by hans asper 1560 original roman canon law that defined governance within church clearly needed revision following henry s break with rome several revision attempts were made throughout henry s reign but these initial projects were shelved as speed of reform outpaced time required to work on a revision as reformation stabilised cranmer formed a committee in december 1551 to restart work he recruited peter martyr to committee and he also asked laski and hooper to participate demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions cranmer and martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law code in england would have international significance cranmer planned to draw together all reformed churches of europe under england s leadership to counter council of trent roman catholic church s response to protestant reformation in march 1552 cranmer invited foremost continental reformers bullinger john calvin and melanchthon to come to england and to participate in an ecumenical council response was disappointing melanchthon did not respond bullinger stated that neither of them could leave germany as it was riven by war between emperor and lutheran princes and while calvin showed some enthusiasm he said he was unable to come cranmer acknowledged calvin and replied stating meanwhile we will reform english church to utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after model of holy scripture one partial manuscript of project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by cranmer and martyr when final version was presented to parliament breach between cranmer and dudley was complete and regent effectively killed canon law bill in house of lords as in first prayer book origins and participants in work of its revision are obscure but it was clear that cranmer led project and steered its development it had begun as early as end of 1549 when convocation of canterbury met to discuss matter late in 1550 opinions of martyr and bucer were sought on how liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced revision spiritual presence view was clarified by use of entirely different words when communicants are offered bread and wine new rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by curate thus disassociating elements from any physical presence new book removed any possibility of prayers for dead as such prayers implied support for doctrine of purgatory act of uniformity 1552 which authorised book s use specified that it be exclusively used from 1 november however final version was not officially published until nearly last minute due to dudley s intervention while travelling in north of country he met scots reformer john knox then based in newcastle impressed by his preaching dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in reform projects in a sermon before king knox attacked practice of kneeling during communion on 27 september 1552 privy council stopped printing of new prayer book and told cranmer to revise it he responded with a long letter using argument that it was for parliament with royal assent to decide any changes in liturgy on 22 october council decided to keep liturgy as it is and add so called black rubric which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion origins of statement that eventually became forty two articles are equally obscure as early as december 1549 archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles in 1551 cranmer presented a version of a statement to bishops but its status remained ambiguous cranmer did not devote much effort into developing articles most likely due to work on canon law revision he became more interested once hope for an ecumenical council began to fade by september 1552 draft versions of articles were being worked on by cranmer and john cheke his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into latin when forty two articles were finally published in may 1553 title page declared that articles were agreed upon by convocation and were published by authority of king this was not in fact case and mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between archbishop and privy council cranmer complained about this to council but authorities responded by noting that articles were developed during time of convocation hence evading a direct answer council gave cranmer unfortunate task of requiring subscription to articles from bishops many of whom opposed them and pointed out anomaly of title page it was while cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render subscriptions futile trials recantations death 1553 1556 thumb right stained glass window depicting cranmer ridley and latimer oxford martyrs edward vi became seriously ill from tuberculosis and councillors were told that he did not have long to live in may 1553 council sent several letters to continental reformers assuring them that edward s health was improving among letters was one addressed to melanchthon inviting him to come to england to take up regius chair in cambridge which was vacant since death of martin bucer in february 1551 both henry viii and cranmer had previously failed to convince melanchthon to come this time council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take offer despite his plea melanchthon never made voyage to england while this effort to shore up reformation was taking place council was working to convince several judges to put on throne lady jane grey edward s cousin and a protestant instead of mary henry and catherine of aragon s daughter and a catholic on 17 june 1553 king made his will noting jane would succeed him contravening third succession act cranmer tried to speak to edward alone but he was refused and his audience with edward occurred in presence of councillors edward told him that he supported what he wrote in his will cranmer s decision to support jane must have occurred before 19 june when royal orders were sent to convene convocation for recognition of new succession by mid july there were serious provincial revolts in mary s favour and support for jane in council fell as mary was proclaimed queen dudley ridley cheke and jane s father duke of suffolk were imprisoned however no action was taken against archbishop on 8 august he led edward s funeral according to rites of prayer book during these months he advised others including peter martyr to flee england but he himself chose to stay reformed bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy such as edmund bonner had their old positions restored cranmer did not go down without a fight when rumours spread that he authorised use of mass in canterbury cathedral he declared them to be false and said a ll doctrine and religion by our said sovereign lord king edward vi is more pure and according to god s word than any that hath been used in england these thousand years not surprisingly government regarded cranmer s declaration as tantamount to sedition he was ordered to stand before council in star chamber on 14 september and on that day he said his final goodbye to martyr cranmer was sent straight to tower to join hugh latimer and nicholas ridley on 13 november 1553 cranmer and four others were brought to trial for treason found guilty and condemned to death several enemies testified that cranmer had encouraged heresy and had written heretical works throughout february 1554 jane grey and other rebels were executed it was now time to deal with religious leaders of reformation and so on 8 march 1554 privy council ordered cranmer ridley and latimer to be transferred to bocardo prison in oxford to await a second trial for heresy during this time cranmer was able to smuggle out a letter to martyr who had fled to strasbourg last surviving document written in his own hand he stated that desperate situation of church was proof that it will eventually be delivered and wrote i pray that god may grant that we may endure to end cf he that endureth to end shall be saved cranmer remained isolated in bocardo prison for seventeen months before trial started on 12 september 1555 although it took place in england trial was under papal jurisdiction and final verdict would come from rome under interrogation cranmer admitted to every fact that was placed before him but he denied any treachery disobedience or heresy trial of latimer and ridley started shortly after cranmer s but their verdicts came almost immediately and they were burnt at stake on 16 october cranmer was taken to a tower to watch proceedings on 4 december rome decided cranmer s fate by depriving him of archbishopric and giving permission to secular authorities to carry out their sentence left thumb 250x250px trial of thomas cranmer 1580 in his final days cranmer s circumstances changed which led to several recantations on 11 december cranmer was taken out of bocardo and placed in house of dean of christ church this new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison he was in an academic community and treated as a guest approached by a dominican friar juan de villagarcia he debated issues of papal supremacy and purgatory in his first four recantations produced between end of january and mid february cranmer submitted himself to authority of king and queen and recognised pope as head of church on 14 february 1556 he was degraded from holy orders and returned to bocardo he had conceded very little and edmund bonner was not satisfied with these admissions on 24 february a writ was issued to mayor of oxford and date of cranmer s execution was set for 7 march two days after writ was issued a fifth statement first which could be called a true recantation was issued cranmer repudiated all lutheran and zwinglian theology fully accepted catholic theology including papal supremacy and transubstantiation and stated that there was no salvation outside catholic church he announced his joy of returning to catholic faith asked for and received sacramental absolution and participated in mass cranmer s burning was postponed and under normal practice of canon law he should have been absolved mary however decided that no further postponement was possible his last recantation was issued on 18 march it was a sign of a broken man a sweeping confession of sin heinze and macculloch note that cranmer s recantations can be deduced from two primary sources that had opposite polemical aims bishop cranmer s by an unknown author and acts and monuments by john foxe also known as foxe s book of martyrs despite stipulation in canon law that recanting heretics be reprieved mary was determined to make an example of cranmer arguing that his iniquity and obstinacy was so great against god and your grace that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him and pressed ahead with his execution thumb 300px cranmer s martyrdom from john foxe s book 1563 alt cranmer was told that he would be able to make a final recantation but this time in public during a service at university church he wrote and submitted speech in advance and it was published after his death at pulpit on day of his execution he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey king and queen but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly deviating from prepared script he renounced recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and as such he stated his hand would be punished by being burnt first he then said and as for pope i refuse him as christ s enemy and antichrist with all his false doctrine he was pulled from pulpit and taken to where latimer and ridley had been burnt six months before as flames drew around him he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into heart of fire while saying that unworthy hand his dying words were lord jesus receive my spirit i see heavens open and jesus standing at right hand of god according to heinze and macculloch an additional corroborating account of cranmer s execution is found in letter of a catholic witness with initials j a aftermath and legacy marian government produced a pamphlet with all six recantations plus text of speech cranmer was to have made in university church his subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned though what actually happened soon became common knowledge undermining effectiveness of marian propaganda similarly protestant party had difficulty in making use of event given cranmer s recantations exiles propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings eventually john foxe put cranmer s story to effective use in 1559 and it features prominently in his acts and monuments when it was first printed in 1563 cranmer s family had been exiled to continent in 1539 it is not known exactly when they returned to england but it was soon after accession of edward vi in 1547 that cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence not much is known about early years of children his daughter margaret was likely born in 1530s and his son thomas came later probably during reign of edward sometime around mary s accession cranmer s wife margarete escaped to germany while his son was entrusted to his brother edmund cranmer who took him too to continent margarete cranmer eventually married cranmer s favourite publisher edward whitchurch couple returned to england after mary s reign and settled in surrey whitchurch also negotiated for marriage of margaret to thomas norton whitchurch died in 1562 and margarete married for third time to bartholomew scott she died in 1570s both of cranmer s children died without issue and his line became extinct when elizabeth i came to power she restored church of england s independence from rome under elizabethan religious settlement church that she re established represented in effect a snapshot of edwardian church from september 1552 thus elizabethan prayer book was basically cranmer s 1552 edition but without black rubric in convocation of 1563 forty two articles which were never adopted by church were altered in area of eucharistic doctrine to form thirty nine articles most of exiles returned to england and resumed their careers in church to some like edmund grindal an archbishop of canterbury during elizabeth s reign cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended cranmer s greatest concerns were maintenance of royal supremacy and diffusion of reformed theology and practice scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to realms of language and of cultural identity stevenson adds that marriage vow from prayer book occupies a singular place in cultural life of english language his prose helped to guide development of english language and book of common prayer is a major contribution to english literature that influenced many lives in anglophone world it guided anglican worship for four hundred years catholic biographers sometimes depict cranmer as an unprincipled opportunist a and a tool of royal tyranny for their part hagiographic protestant biographers sometimes overlook times that cranmer betrayed his own principles null provides an overview of cranmer scholarship and different points of view yet both sides can agree in seeing cranmer as a committed scholar whose life showed strengths and weaknesses of a very human and often under appreciated reformer anglican
