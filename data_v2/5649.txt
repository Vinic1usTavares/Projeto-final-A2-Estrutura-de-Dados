obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out gay rival soap home and away however script producer emma steele defended storyline and said that it is not a ploy to grab ratings steele said that she is particularly proud of way chris s storyline had been handled and she added it was something we wanted to do for a while because it s a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways it wasn t just chris s story i think it s interesting to see how his sexuality affected his friends and his relationships with them too mason said he hoped that his storyline would draw in viewers in a responsible way and feedback would stay positive mason added that he would like to see chris happy in future and hopes viewers will warm to him he added i know it s quite a sensitive topic but i think difference between his and last encounters they ve had is that we re looking more in depth into more than just a gay kiss we go more into relationships how it affects people around steele backed this up saying we wanted gay to be part of chris s character not chris to be gay character he s not your typical gay stereotype that some tv shows like to play up he s on basketball team he s had a girlfriend for a time and i think show does a good job of portraying way his character is discovering who he really is relationship with aidan foster in october 2010 mason stated that a romantic interest for chris could be introduced in future he said that it was not confirmed but there was a chance that chris would find someone mason admitted that he would find it awkward if he had to

aidan foster a love interest for chris aidan and chris formed serial s first gay couple bower called storyline a natural progression for chris noting that he needed to meet someone at some stage bower told daniel kilkelly of digital spy that chris s romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within character she explained chris is a naturally shy person he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart so it will be done according to that character and it may not be a full on relationship character that bob is playing is older and further down track with his relationship testing so it will be a relationship story rather than a gay male romance mason said that chris and aidan s relationship would have a slow build up chris meets aidan when he is brought into hospital following a vicious beating aidan provides a source of kindness and support for chris he later takes his car to local garage to be serviced and flirts with chris who is initially unaware

promised that it would not be sensationalist or token and low key scene earned praise from viewers on social networking sites morley took a break from neighbours in mid 2012 which led writers to improvise an on screen break up for aidan and chris break up occurs after aidan learns chris has not told his parents that they are in a relationship mason said that chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship but it is different story when it comes to his parents his father has not always made things easy for him in past so he does not give him and his mother a chance to get to know aidan when chris parents throw him a birthday party at lassiters lake he decides not to invite aidan however aidan learns about party from andrew and he feels hurt and humiliated by chris

miss morley as he had enjoyed working with him during storyline homophobia and attack a homophobia storyline was implemented for character in september 2011 when chris meets warren burrell tony rickards a homophobic customer at garage warren makes his prejudice against gay people clear to chris which leaves him unsure how to respond as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in way warren does chris tells his boss lucas fitzgerald about warren but he is disappointed when lucas does not do anything about it of chris s situation mason explained it was very confronting for him and because guy wasn t pointing his remarks directly at chris lucas didn t understand why chris was so offended at first he didn t have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt chris storyline divided opinions of viewers with some understanding why lucas would not want to confront warren while others were on chris s side mason was pleased that audience was discussing storyline and he admitted to appreciating both sides of conversation he said lucas wasn t there when customer was saying these things so he didn t understand chris s point of view however as story went along we saw lucas change and his respect for chris grew mason added storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing to change your ideas two months later warren returns to garage and lucas shows his support for chris by defending him chris soon meets and befriends warren s son blake burrell oliver edwin when warren learns they are friends he decides to put a stop to situation warren threatens to kill chris unless he stops spending time with blake mason thought it was a shame that chris and blake could not continue their friendship because of warren and

with josh willis character s inclusion in neighbours and his storyline has received a positive reaction from public television critics and lgbt websites chris s coming out episode which was broadcast on 10 august 2010 was seen by 679 000 viewers in australia david knox of citysearch melbourne said that inclusion of chris in show is a positive step with its juvenile audience knox added that following gay kiss scandal on home and away test for neighbours will be not just coming out but whether he remains in show after this storyline subsides of chris sx news said one could simply dismiss gay character as simply just another plot line but there s no denying its significance especially with a show as enduring and mainstream as neighbours if anything it s a small reflection of changing attitudes in society they also praised neighbours for focusing on chris s coming out and issue of homophobia instead of letting chris explode out of closet and leave ramsay street glittering in sequins atv news network said chris s coming out should be praised for way it has been handled they added that decision to play it out at a school would have viewers in a similar situation identifying with storyline alan mckee a university film and television professor said that usually subscription television channels take risks in portraying storylines like chris s he added commercial tv is not about risk taking it is about entertainment for broadest possible audience but attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that holy soap said chris s most memorable moment was announcing to his entire class that he was gay anthony d langford from website afterelton said he found it humorous that neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman chris is compared to andrew he said it s like they re almost saying if you re a nice guy who s not all over your girlfriend you must be gay but on television that s usually case langford hoped that chris would not vanish and that he would not be relegated to monitoring relationship between andrew and summer and not having a romance of his own langford later said that neighbours is doing a fairly decent job with chris s coming out story he wished that viewers got to see more of chris s thoughts and feelings and less of how his situation affected people around him langford added i do like that chris isn t a perfect kid many shows tend to make gay teens near saints instead he s a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up like starting a fight at a basketball game in july 2011 langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that lucas and chris should be paired up he opined that there is not a hint of romance between two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy they must get together langford revealed that he liked chris and lucas s mentor and mentee relationship as it is writer also commented on introduction of chris s father and said that he was delighted that chris was finally getting his own drama that was pretty realistic he added it s nice to see father son dynamic play out i have feeling that a lot of chris s dad s issues stem from fact that his son is gay and i hope show will delve into those issues sarah ellis writing for inside soap said i d love to see chris with a boyfriend he s nicest guy in erinsborough in 2011 mason revealed that he has had a positive reaction to his character from viewers and he has been receiving mail from people who have had similar experiences who appreciate what neighbours is doing he added what s interesting is that a lot of feedback has been about fact character s coming out wasn t a warm and fuzzy experience that there were rough spots they appreciated authenticity of story and i think that comes from character and storylines being based on other people s real life experiences cameron adams of herald sun branded chris erinsborough s token gay he added good on neighbours for not having their gay character flouncing around in a midriff top listening to britney spears inside soap s staff said that they could not wait to see how chris would get on with aidan they added that
