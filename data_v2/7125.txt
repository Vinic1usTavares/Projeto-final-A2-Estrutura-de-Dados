career he said i love conducting opera only trouble is that i hate atmosphere of opera house where only too often music is least of many considerations from staging to temperaments of principal singers nor was he drawn to further engagements as a ballet conductor it offers special problems of fitting in with dances and dancers most of whom i m sorry to say seem to have musical appreciation

practice monteux 1965 p 113 he was dismayed when it was announced that his contract would not be renewed after 1924 official explanation was that orchestra s policy had always been to appoint conductors for no more than five years it is unclear whether that was genuinely reason one suggested possibility is that conductor chosen to replace him serge koussevitzky was thought more charismatic with greater box office appeal another is that members of boston society disapproved of monteux s morals he and his second wife had gradually drifted apart and by 1924 he was living with doris

manchester guardian 16 june 1958 p 5 monteux considered british concertgoers most attentive in world and british music critics most intelligent however a disadvantage of conducting a london orchestra

neville marriner felt that he made them feel like an international orchestra he gave them extended horizons and some of his achievements with orchestra both at home and abroad gave them quite a

canarina p 71 reportedly during days of segregation in us when told he could not be served in a restaurant for colored folk he insisted that he was coloured pink monteux 1962 pp 13 15 music making reputation and repertoire record producer john culshaw described monteux as that rarest of beings a conductor who was loved by his orchestras to call him a legend would be to understate case culshaw p 144 toscanini observed that monteux had best baton technique he had ever seen like toscanini monteux insisted on traditional orchestral layout with first and second violins to conductor s left and right believing that this gave a better representation of string detail than grouping all violins together on left on fidelity to composers scores monteux s biographer john canarina ranks him with klemperer and above even toscanini whose reputation for strict adherence to score was in canarina s view less justified than monteux s canarina p 83 according to biographical sketch in grove dictionary of music and musicians monteux was never an ostentatious conductor he prepared his orchestra in often arduous rehearsals and then used small but decisive gestures to obtain playing of fine texture careful detail and powerful rhythmic energy retaining to last his extraordinary grasp of musical structure and a faultless ear for sound quality monteux was extremely economical with words and gestures and expected a response from his smallest movement record producer erik smith recalled of monteux s rehearsals with vienna philharmonic for beethoven s pastoral symphony and brahms s second although he could not speak to orchestra in german he transformed their playing from one take to next importance of rehearsal to monteux was shown when in 1923 diaghilev asked him to conduct stravinsky s new les noces with no rehearsal as composer would already have conducted first performance monteux following on from there monteux told impresario stravinsky e can do what e like but i have to do what ze composer as written monteux s self effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment music critic of nation b h haggin while admitting that monteux was generally regarded as one of giants of conducting wrote of his repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity haggin p 127 other american writers have taken a different view in 1957 carleton smith wrote his approach to all music is that of master craftsman seeing him at work modest and quiet it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at metropolitan opera house than any prima donna that he is only conductor regularly invited to take charge of america s big three boston philadelphia and new york philharmonic orchestras in his 1967 book great conductors harold c schonberg wrote of monteux a conductor of international stature a conductor admired and loved all over world word loved is used schonberg 1967 p 328 elsewhere schonberg wrote of monteux s passion and charisma schonberg 1981 p 59 when asked in a radio interview to describe himself as a conductor in one word monteux replied damned professional monteux 1962 p 63 throughout his career monteux suffered from being thought of as a specialist in french music music that meant most to him was that of german composers particularly brahms but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies of four brahms symphonies he was invited by recording companies to record only one second recordings of his live performances of first and third have been released on cd but discography in canarina s biography lists no recording live or from studio of fourth canarina pp 321 340 critic william mann along with many others regarded him as a supremely authoritative conductor of brahms style and bounds of nationalism times 21 april 1961 p 20 though cardus disagreed in german music monteux naturally enough missed harmonic weight and right heavily lunged tempo his rhythm for example was a little too pointed for say brahms or schumann reviewer jonathan swain contends that no conductor knew more than monteux about expressive possibilities in strings claiming that conductor who doesn t play a stringed instrument simply doesn t know how to get different sounds and bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing same note in his 2003 biography john canarina lists nineteen significant world premieres conducted by monteux in addition to petrushka and rite of spring is a further stravinsky work nightingale monteux s other premieres for diaghilev included ravel s daphnis et chloe and debussy s jeux in concert hall he premiered works by among others milhaud poulenc and prokofiev in a letter of april 1914 stravinsky wrote everyone can appreciate your zeal and your probity in regard to contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend stravinsky p 60 monteux s biographer jean philippe mousnier analysed a representative sample of monteux s programmes for more than 300 concerts symphonies played most frequently were cesar franck s d minor symphony symphonie fantastique beethoven s seventh tchaikovsky s fifth and sixth and first two symphonies of brahms works by richard strauss featured almost as often as those of debussy and wagner s prelude and liebestod from tristan und isolde as often as rite of spring mousnier pp 235 248 recordings monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career his first recording was as a violist in plus blanche que la blanche hermine from

indifferently played recordings by monteux of music by ravel and berlioz made in 1930 and 1931 canarina believes were more impressive stravinsky who also recorded rite in 1929 was furious that monteux had made a rival recording he made vitriolic comments privately and for some time his relations with monteux remained cool walsh stephen first rites for stravinsky musical times vol 130 no 1759

issue recordings of live concerts although he would much have preferred it he said if one could record in one take in normal concert hall conditions some live performances of monteux conducting metropolitan opera and among others san francisco symphony boston symphony bbc symphony and london symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings and some have been issued on compact disc achenbach andrew orchestral reissues gramophone may 2006 p 83 it has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings a conductor at once passionate disciplined and tasteful one who was sometimes more vibrant than monteux captured in studio and yet like that studio conductor a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance a keen sense of style and a sure grasp
