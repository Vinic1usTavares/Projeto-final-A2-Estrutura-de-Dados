thumb upright adult female in winnipeg manitoba canada thumb kestrel resting in an apple tree american kestrel falco sparverius is smallest and most common falcon in north america it has a roughly two to one range in size over subspecies and sex varying in size from about weight of a blue jay to a mourning dove it also ranges to south america and is a well established species that has evolved seventeen subspecies adapted to different environments and habitats throughout americas it exhibits sexual dimorphism in size females being moderately larger and plumage although both sexes have a rufous back with noticeable barring its plumage is colorful and attractive and juveniles are similar in plumage to adults american kestrel usually hunts in energy conserving fashion by perching and scanning ground for prey to ambush though it also hunts from air it sometimes hovers in air with rapid wing beats while homing in on prey its diet typically consists of grasshoppers and other insects lizards mice and small birds e g sparrows this broad diet has contributed to its wide success as a species it nests in cavities in trees cliffs buildings and other structures female lays three to seven eggs which both sexes help to incubate its breeding range extends from central and western alaska across northern canada to nova scotia and south throughout north america into central mexico and caribbean it is a local breeder in central america and is widely distributed throughout south america most birds breeding in canada and northern united states migrate south in winter it is an occasional vagrant to western europe based on appearance and behavior it was for many years considered a member of primarily european and african kestrel clade within genus falco but dna analysis shows american kestrel to actually be genetically more closely related to larger american falcons such as aplomado wink m and h sauer 2004 phylogenetic relationships in diurnal raptors based on nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear marker genes pp 483 498 in r d chancellor and b u eds raptors worldwide world working group on birds of prey berlin peregrine and prairie falcons though species has not been renamed as a result of these genetic analyses it is not actually a kestrel in phylogenetic sense instead a process of convergent evolution to fit a similar small prey niche in ecosystem as true kestrels has left it with similar physical characteristics and hunting methods american kestrel is a common bird used in falconry especially by beginners though not as strong a flyer as many other larger falcons proper training and weight control by falconer allows many american kestrels to become effective hunters of birds in size range of sparrows and starlings with occasional success against birds up to approximately twice their own weight mullenix description under traditional classification american kestrel is smallest raptor in america wauer american kestrel

life history all about birds cornell lab of ornithology allaboutbirds org retrieved on 2013 02 25 physically american kestrels are leaner and less muscular than larger falcons mullenix matt 2003 merlins and american kestrels compared com pectoral flight muscles of american kestrel make up only about 12 of its body weight as compared to about 20 for strongest flying falcons such as peregrine davis kate kindle locations 225 234 wings are moderately long fairly narrow and taper to a point their less muscular body type is adapted to energy conserving ambush hunting rather than spending large amounts of energy consuming time on wing and getting into long tail chases of bird prey for their size they have strong talons and beaks and can swiftly dispatch prey their lean build and energy conserving strategy allows a lower daily food intake than if they were more strongly muscled yet with enough strength to commonly take bird prey as large as themselves and occasionally larger success of this body style and hunting strategy is reflected in high success of species in densely populating a large range throughout americas flight of american kestrel is not so dramatic and swift as more muscular falcons such as merlins and peregrines but their efficient adaptation to a broader diet of more available smaller prey and need for less food per day has resulted in there being many more of them in contrast to many other raptor species sexes differ more in plumage than in size males have blue grey wings with black spots and white undersides with black barring back is rufous with barring on lower half belly and flanks are white with black spotting tail is also rufous with a white or rufous tip and a black subterminal band back and wings of female american kestrel are rufous with dark brown barring undersides of females are creamy to buff with heavy brown streaking tail is noticeably different from male s being rufous in color with numerous narrow dark black bars juveniles exhibit coloration patterns similar to adults in both sexes head is white with a bluish grey top there are also two narrow vertical black facial markings on each side of head while other falcons have one two black spots ocelli can be found on each side of white or orangish nape function of these spots is debated but most commonly accepted theory is that they act as false eyes and help to protect bird from potential attackers vocalizations american kestrel has three basic vocalizations klee or killy whine and chitter klee is usually delivered as a rapid series klee klee klee klee when kestrel is upset or excited this call is used in a wide variety of situations and is heard from both sexes but larger females typically have lower pitched voices than males whine call is primarily associated with feeding but is also uttered during copulation chitter is used in activities that involve interaction between male and female birds including courtship feeding copulation and feeding of nestlings wauer pp 11 12 nestlings can produce calls similar to those of adults at 16 days old taxonomy until sixth edition of aou checklist of north american birds was published by american ornithologists union in 1983 most commonly used name for american kestrel was sparrow hawk or sparrowhawk this was due to a mistaken connection with eurasian sparrowhawk in genus accipiter sixth edition of aou checklist corrected this officially renaming bird american kestrel several other colloquial names for kestrel are also in use including grasshopper hawk due to its diet and killy hawk due to its distinct call wauer p 4 as noted in introduction dna analysis shows american kestrel to actually be genetically more closely related to larger american falcons than to true kestrels however based on its physical similarity to kestrels and established nature of name american kestrel there has been little impetus to change its name this could change in future if continued genetic research more precisely determines evolutionary history of american kestrel within genus falco entire genus is actually a set of species so closely related that most or all can be hybridized by artificial insemination significant natural hybridization of species has occurred in past during evolution of this closely related set of species such that precise evolutionary genetic analysis as to which species are more basal to other species or to genus as a whole is difficult to render american kestrel s scientific name falco sparverius was given by carl linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae genus refers to falcate or hooked shape of beak and specific name means pertaining to a sparrow referring to bird s small size and hunting of sparrows as a typical prey seventeen subspecies of american kestrel are recognized generally based upon plumage size and vocalizations f s sparverius described by linnaeus in 1758 is nominate subspecies it is found in most of united states canada and mexico f

american kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats including grasslands meadows deserts and other open to regions they can also be found in both urban and suburban areas a kestrel s habitat must include perches open space for hunting and cavities for nesting whether natural or man made american kestrel is able to live in very diverse conditions ranging from above arctic circle wauer p 15 to tropics of central america to elevations of over in andes mountains bird is distributed from northern canada and alaska to southernmost tip of south america tierra del fuego it is only kestrel found in americas though as mentioned above this classification is genetically inaccurate it has occurred as a vagrant in uk denmark malta and azores american kestrels in canada and northern united states typically migrate south in winter sometimes going as far as central america and caribbean birds that breed south of about 35deg north latitude are usually year round residents migration also depends on local weather conditions wauer pp 23 24 wintering kestrels choice of habitat varies by sex females are found in open areas more often than males during non breeding season a common explanation for this behavior is that larger females arrive at preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory american kestrel is not long lived with a lifespan of 5 years for wild birds oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months while captive kestrels can live up to 14 17 years in a study humans accounted for 43 2 of 1 355 reported deaths which included direct killing and while predation including by larger birds of prey accounted for 2 8 this statistic is likely biased however as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans feeding american kestrels feed largely on small animals such as grasshoppers dragonflies lizards mice voles and small birds kestrel has also been reported to have killed snakes bats and squirrels kestrel is able to maintain high population densities at least in part because of broad scope of its diet american kestrel s primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees overhead power lines or fence posts it also hunts by hovering in air with rapid wing beats and scanning ground for prey other hunting techniques include low flight over fields or chasing insects and birds in air prey is most often caught on ground though occasionally they take birds in flight before striking kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail then makes a direct flight toward prey to grab it in its talons much like red tailed hawk american kestrels conserve energy in a hunt and pick their attacks with care as to position and odds of success during breeding season bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young one study found that an american kestrel pair foraged in ways that minimized costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation for example if success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area bird will move to a different area reproduction thumb a young bird american kestrels are sexually mature by their first spring in migratory populations males arrive at breeding ground before females then female selects a mate pair bonds are strong often permanent pairs usually use previous nesting sites in consecutive years this gives birds an advantage over younger or invading individuals as they would already be familiar with hunting grounds neighbors predators and other features of site wauer p 52 males perform elaborate dive displays to advertise their territory and attract a mate these displays consist of several climbs and dives with three or four klee calls at their peaks females are promiscuous for about one to two weeks after their arrival at nesting site this is thought to stimulate ovulation wauer p 54 food transfers from male to female occur from about four to five weeks prior to egg laying to one to two weeks after american kestrels are cavity nesters but they are able to adapt to a wide variety of nesting situations they generally prefer natural cavities such as in trees with closed tops and tight fitting entrances that provide for maximum protection of eggs and young wauer p 55 kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers or use abandoned nests of other birds such as red tailed hawks merlins and crows wauer pp 55 56 they have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops as well as in abandoned cavities in american kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes three to seven eggs typically four or five are laid approximately 24 72 hours apart average egg size is 10 larger than average for birds of its body size eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly responsibility of female although male incubates 15 20 of time eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11 12 days hatching takes place over three to four days hatchlings are altricial and are only able to sit up after five days they grow very quickly reaching an adult weight after 16 17 days after 28 31 days their wings have developed and they are able to leave nest wauer pp 59 63 young adult kestrels may breed from a year old and species has approximately a three to five year life expectancy in wild in ecological terms reproductive pattern of american kestrel leans towards a small bird r selection strategy davis kate kindle location 948 in r k selection theory selective pressures are hypothesized to drive evolution in one of two generalized directions r or k selection r selected species are those that place an emphasis on a high growth rate typically exploiting less crowded ecological niches and produce many offspring each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood i e high r low k by contrast k selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches that invest more heavily in fewer offspring each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood i e low r high k between these two extremes american kestrel is one of few raptor species that lean towards being r selected they are able to breed at one year old have few non breeding adults in population and have larger broods their population growth rate is high relative to larger raptors which typically lean towards being k selected stress physiology weather american kestrels are often useful in scientific studies on animal physiology and are typically captured using bal method or raised in nest boxes for experiments kestrel metabolic rate has been found to increase in response to rainfall and at ambient temperatures below about 250 c kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary however with sex kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss environmental disturbance american kestrels response to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of cort a hormone produced by hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions extended periods of elevated blood cort levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction thus high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding american kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure among successful nests however nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress response to environmental human disturbance suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near nest environmental contaminants since american kestrels are carnivores toxic chemical runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate at high levels in their blood wild kestrels are subject to or an altered immune response to ethers pbdes a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into environment when pbdes accumulate in body tissues of kestrels t cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency as a result kestrels that ingest pbdes may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms in addition certain pbdes may suppress growth and development of spleen and bursa in american kestrels status and conservation american kestrel is likely most abundant falcon in north america although its total population is difficult to quantify as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability count data from usgs breeding bird survey bbs indicate that north american breeding population is experiencing long term and gradual but sustained declines with some regions such as new england and coastal california exhibiting more rapid declines count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate bbs data north american population has been estimated at 1 2 million pairs with central and south american populations being as large a smaller estimate is 236 000 birds wintering in north america a population increase occurred in 18th and 19th centuries probably due to deforestation for agriculture resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels thumb male with handler san diego zoo southeastern u s subspecies falco sparverius paulus has declined 82 since 1940 due to a decrease in nest site availability this decline is a result of longleaf pines being cleared from agricultural fields despite this american kestrel is classed as least

american kestrels is in falconry it is often considered a beginner s bird though careful weight control needed to maintain kestrel s desire to aggressively hunt takes skill falconers experienced in extracting best performance species is capable of report they are highly reliable on normal game of sparrows and starlings mullenix pp 82 84 more aggressive individuals are sometimes capable of capturing prey up to approximately twice their own body weight allowing occasional capture of true game birds such as quail and dove however most falconers interested in reliable taking of such game do prefer larger falcons or hawks advantage american kestrel offers experienced falconer is its suitability to simple and urban falconry not requiring large tracts of land or use of hunting dogs this form of falconry is sometimes referred to as micro falconry kestrels merlins and micro falconry com 2012 or micro hawking other small raptor species commonly used in micro falconry are merlin sharp shinned hawk smallest accipiter and european kestrel a true kestrel hawking with american kestrel requires adapting to strengths and weaknesses of bird it is a very small falcon and even for its size it is less muscular than other small falcons such as athletic and swift merlin it is more adapted to ambush hunting and short chases than to longer aerial chases larger falcons often adopt used within its limits it is effective experienced falconer matthew mullenix author of book american kestrels in modern falconry in an article comparing kestrels to merlins summed their abilities up as follows 1 kestrels are thin winged flat chested under powered and lack acceleration compared to merlins i say that with much affection for them and with thousands of kestrel kills to prove these are not necessarily damning differences comparing a red tailed hawk to a harris or goshawk will conjure equally negative points of fact yet we all know how good trained red tails can be 2 chief variable to choosing between a kestrel and a merlin may be your hawking land if you live in open country or have access at least to good pasture for cattle a merlin can excel there if you plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb and especially if you plan to hawk from a car i d recommend kestrel consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry to snipe dove quail and open country sparrows merlins are best suited for most blackbirds either falcon can prove effective starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels but in open are best prey for merlins same holds true for house sparrows with this exception sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels this is slip for which i feel american kestrel is perfect 3 once committed to an attack trained kestrels tend to follow through to end they will stoop into cover chase birds on foot bind to quarry twice their size and never let go voluntarily they have small feet but as written elsewhere also have strongest feet for their size it is a simple fact that american kestrels hold starlings better than merlins on average and will gladly tackle larger quarry than will any jack male merlin american kestrels do not train so easily as some larger falcons particularly peregrine falcon in art of waiting on to perform a diving stoop on flushed prey however some individual kestrels do master this skill mullenix p 80 falconers sometimes train them to climb to a stooping position with tidbits on kites or balloons that kestrels learn to climb after more common hunting techniques are to slip them after spotted game from fist or to release them from a vehicle window close to spotted quarry these techniques are more of a natural fit to kestrel s ambushing methods in wild falconers using american kestrel should be alert to protect falcon from larger predators that may attack kestrel particularly if it is distracted on ground with captured prey domestic cats and dogs are greatest threat to attack falcon on ground but cooper s hawk is well known to boldly attack kestrels this mid sized american accipiter has sufficient size and strength to carry kestrel away though falconers have reported often being successful in recovering kestrel unharmed by acting quickly to intimidate larger hawk into releasing kestrel mullenix p 107 american kestrels are bred in captivity for use in falconry and are among easier falcons to breed they are also sufficiently common that passage birds in their first year are relatively easy to trap wild caught kestrels tame down fairly quickly they will usually be eating from a falconer s hand day after capture be training within a week and be ready to hunt in three to five weeks a very tame american kestrel will allow itself to be picked up around body with one hand while accepting tidbits from other hand mullenix p 48 such tameness is very useful when checking or treating bird for injury or illness migratory raptors native to united states are protected by migratory bird treaty act of 1918 so american kestrels are illegal to possess without a permit such as a falconry permit in united states canada and mexico references cited books external links
