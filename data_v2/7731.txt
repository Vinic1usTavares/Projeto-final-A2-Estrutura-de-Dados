impact commercial or occasionally just sociopolitical reach with added panache preferred subcultural acclaim especially from rock criticism s producers and consumers but also from alternative radio and dance djs and past performance increasingly problematic as more and more artists truck on into middle age quality boiled down to my grading system like previous volume guide follows a grading schema on a scale of a plus to e minus although there are far less records graded c minus or lower in this volume b plus records are most commonly reviewed in book and are defined by christgau as those offering satisfactory listen through at least half their songs and encourage revisiting in school b is a good grade almost any student will settle for near excellence it implies it s a compliment in consumer guide too there are also introductory essays about musical developments and trends during 1980s in one essay christgau identifies fusion of post punk and post disco sounds as one of decade s major developments while coining term dance oriented rock to describe their synthesis an appendix lists artists overlooked in reviews and a core collection of albums before 1980

contemporary reception reviewing book in 1991 john lawson of school library journal said it works well not only by itself but also as an update of new rolling stone record guide 1983 and new trouser press record guide 1989 even if it covers only one decade of music australian academic and research libraries journal publication of australian library and information association said christgau gives full rein to his and proves just how readable reference books can be fellow rock critic greil marcus remarked on guide in 1990 entries covering a decade s work by a performer sometimes read like tiny novels full of suspense dramatic tragedy or farce but what makes book work is christgau s endless capacity for surprise in los angeles times robert hilburn believed collection of capsule reviews reinforced a number of qualities about christgau how his interest extends beyond individual recording artists and into state of rock and in richness of its culture how he constantly challenges artists fans and other critics to demand more of themselves and their favorites and why he nurtures new and significant developments however uncommercial or controversial hilburn regarded him as premier reference for popular music and journalistic equivalent of bob dylan or neil young quite simply christgau writes with same reckless independence and ferocious eccentricity that fuels our most valuable pop artists book s charged eloquence embodied rock music in mind of chicago tribune critic greg kot who could not recommend it highly enough finding entries on pop singer debbie gibson and hip hop group public enemy especially fun to read book was not without criticism hilburn questioned christgau s grouchy dismissal of u2 s 1980 debut boy while noting a partiality for third world music records and an as a writer citing review of 1987 x album see how we are as an example of latter kot believed christgau was less understanding of metal and also called some of writing inaccessible sometimes he assumes an intimate understanding of not only record he s discussing but also a host of peripheral concerns that most of his readers could not possibly possess library journals barry miller praised broad based musical coverage but deemed writing glib and unctuous christgau s catholic tastes provide a wonderful cornucopia but cumulative effect of his terminally hip prose and gymnastic verbal constructions boho americanism art rock mucho etc is vacuous miller recommended new trouser press record guide as an alternative of superior depth and information legacy and reappraisal christgau s record guide 80s was used by music library association as a reference to prepare select rock recordings for a basic music library essential scores and sound recordings 1997 published by american library association as a guide for librarians and other collectors according to m thomas inge s greenwood guide to american popular culture 2002 christgau s record guide 80s was a precursor to more popular music guide series such as all music guide musichound and rough guides and has since maintained a resourceful timelessness christgau s judgments are incisive knowledgeable and amusing in 2006 consumer guide series was ranked fifth on a v clubs list of 17 most essential popular music books with 80s singled out as best of three an accompanying blurb said it covered a decade when top 40 and college radio were equally compelling and christgau could apply his naturally skeptical eye to artists who either bore scrutiny or shrunk away to nothing website s michaelangelo matos who had been greatly influenced by christgau said first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult along with christgau s ability to distill a record s essence into a handful of words murray highlighted his humor quoting what remains single best sentence ever written on prince from review of dirty mind 1980 mick jagger should fold up his penis and go home both 1970s and 1980s guides were cited by nashville scene journalist noel murray as seminal works for budding rock critics who can learn from them art of concision and virtue of wielding strong opinions backed by a general spirit of
