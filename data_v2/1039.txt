osborne street in 1877 and given its present name in 1882 according to education historian alison wheatley street is possibly named after a james turner who taught at king edward s school in birmingham and name may have been suggested by a former pupil who became a town planner as a way of honouring turner s legacy however birmingham historian carl chinn believes street was named for a local businessman and partner in firm hammond turner sons a manufacturer of buttons of winson green chinn writes that it was originally developed as a better off working class district but that by latter part of 20th century many of properties in area were falling into decay dr chris upton reader in public history at city s newman university has described street as part of a ribbon development of suburban districts built as birmingham expanded during latter part of 19th century while many of street s original residents were locals who moved from inner city back to back houses some had moved from as far away as london and cornwall to work in birmingham upton describes them as respectable working class skilled workers who earned around 30 shillings ps1 50 per week and who in many cases could even afford to employ a maid those who grew prosperous moved to wealthier areas and were replaced by immigrants from asia and west indies who came to uk during years after world war ii a high proportion of those who lived in area were employed by birmingham s industrial economy which enjoyed prosperity until collapse of city s manufacturing industry during early 1980s resulting in mass unemployment professor steven mccabe of birmingham city business school has noted that birmingham lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs between 1971 and 1981 and that city s gdp per capita which in 1976 was highest for a uk city outside south east region had fallen to become lowest in england seven years later during 1980s unemployment in birmingham reached 20 and mccabe says that in many areas including james turner street this figure has not reduced since that decade clare short who grew up in area and represented winson green as member of parliament for ladywood for 27 years has said that along

spirit with residents helping each other in times of difficulty episode list no title air date follow up programmes no title air date reception political and media response programme led to some political debate on issue of welfare speaking in house of commons on 13 january iain duncan smith conservative secretary of state for work and pensions suggested programme justified changes being made by conservative liberal democrat coalition government s welfare reform act following week duncan smith gave a speech to mark tenth anniversary of his centre for social justice in which he said that areas of country were being by long term unemployment and had remained largely hidden from rest of society conservative mp simon hart raised subject of benefits street at prime minister s questions on 15 january saying that a street of type seen in series existed in every constituency in land prime minister and conservative leader david cameron responded that government should intervene in people s lives to get them off benefits and into employment after declining an invitation to visit james turner street deputy prime minister nick clegg leader of liberal democrats said that he believed both left and right wing arguments on welfare were wrong we want a welfare system which is compassionate shortly after clegg s comments birmingham councillor desmond told birmingham mail that he had compiled letters to clegg cameron and labour leader ed miliband on behalf of some james turner street residents inviting them to visit street and asking for help to find employment writing for wiltshire gazette and herald liberal democrat mp duncan hames argued that programme would contribute little to subject we do need to have a rational informed debate about how to improve our welfare system but editorial line taken by supposedly factual reality tv adds very little to that programme was condemned by current ladywood mp labour s shabana mahmood i found it shocking that channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment it was profoundly wrong in radio times clare short who represented constituency prior to mahmood said series was totally unrepresentative of area and condemned it as crummy and misleading others have also criticised benefits street arguing it does not present a balanced view of subject labour mp anne begg chair of commons work and pensions select committee said that programme was a misrepresentation of people claiming benefits arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of overall welfare bill referring to first episode that featured a shoplifter chris williamson also a labour mp said it was irresponsible to portray him as a typical benefits claimant owen jones a columnist for independent described series as medieval stocks updated for a modern format in an article for birmingham mail writer and television personality samantha brick a native of birmingham said that series was an unbalanced view of city shadow welfare minister chris bryant claimed that residents of bishop s avenue in as billionaire s row because of its expensive as likely to have drink and drugs problems as residents of james turner street fraser nelson editor of spectator suggested programme had highlighted a section of society who have been forgotten by politicians these people are people who otherwise don t have a voice they don t vote so for many years they have just not mattered nelson s comments were echoed by dominic sandbrook in daily mail who felt programme portrayed its participants sympathetically real scandal of benefits street in fact is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people through no fault of their own to a life without hope or ambition effectively turning them into an underclass dependent on charity of state charlie brooker also felt programme had been broadly sympathetic to those it portrays in daily mirror entrepreneur john bird founder of big issue wrote that although benefits street did not fully represent spectrum of people who claim benefits it did show what could happen to those forgotten by system who get caught in a kind of social suicide benefits britain debate a live one hour debate was scheduled to be broadcast by channel 4 following final episode of benefits street channel 4 announced on 16 january that this would be chaired by presenter richard bacon and feature a panel of guests who represent views across political spectrum and crucially those who claim benefits mentorn media producers of programmes such as bbc one s question time was commissioned to produce show originally scheduled for 10 february programme titled benefits britain debate was subsequently moved back a week to 17 february after rival broadcaster channel 5 announced plans for a two hour debate about immigration for same evening channel 4 said benefits britain debate would be immediately preceded by a follow up

shortly before it aired and included some benefits street participants as well as mike penning a minister from department of work and pensions chris bryant from opposition daily telegraph columnist allison pearson political editor of huffington post mehdi hasan and john bird owen jones who also participated in programme described it as a rowdy chaotic show based on formula of who shouts loudest this view was echoed by neil midgley of telegraph who felt that both follow up programmes didn t live up to standards of series and that debate had sparked a lot of shouting and tumult but very little new wisdom independents daisy wyatt said programme had proved as rambling and unfocused as documentary that sparked hour long studio show with neutral host richard bacon veering across topics and adding his own opinions jeremy kyle style zoe williams of guardian found debate unsatisfactory feeling topics discussed were too broad and that bacon was not an effective chair however roz laws of birmingham mail described debate as articulate and felt that interesting points were made such as fact that most people on benefits are pensioners yet we didn t see any of them on benefits street debate was watched by an average audience of 3 2 million big benefits row live channel 5 aired big benefits row live their own unconnected debate about welfare state on 3 february presented by matthew

personality had dominated proceedings while fact based arguments were lost to non stop barrage of immature tempers daily mirror described it as a mess of a programme and a joke of a discussion public reception complaints to ofcom first episode of series attracted several hundred complaints both to channel 4 and media regulator ofcom from viewers over a variety of issues according to guardian complaints were received about alleged criminal activities foul language and misleading portrayals of welfare claimants by 8 january 2014 two days after series debuted benefits street had attracted 300 complaints to ofcom and 400 to channel 4 three weeks later that figure had collectively increased to 1 700 ofcom said that it would assess viewer feedback before deciding whether to launch an investigation after generating a total of 960 complaints to ofcom and 800 to channel 4 broadcasting watchdog announced on 25 february that it would investigate programme an inquiry described by guardian as ofcom s most high profile investigation into a tv programme since it cleared channel 4 of unfair racial stereotyping in big fat gypsy weddings ofcom published its findings on 30 june and concluded that channel 4 had not breached broadcasting regulations watchdog looked at a number of issues raised by viewers including concerns that rules governing child welfare had been broken and that programme featured certain criminal techniques however ofcom concluded that benefits street had reflected real lives of children taking part and channel 4 had taken care to limit amount of time they were seen on screen of concerns about criminal activity watchdog said it was satisfied that certain essential details were not broadcast which may have enabled successful commission of a crime and that there was a sufficient editorial justification for including material broadcast regulator also concluded that programme had been fair in its portrayal of its participants because it was an observational documentary and that almost 900 complaints about negative and offensive portrayal needed no further investigation other public responses following first episode of benefits street west midlands police said they had received a number of complaints from members of public about alleged criminal activities that had been filmed which they were considering whether to investigate alleged death threats by twitter users against residents were also being probed channel 4 said they would not provide investigators with any unbroadcast material from benefits street unless issued with a

claimed they were tricked into appearing in series by love productions who they say told them it would be about community spirit one resident told birmingham mail they told me it was about living as a community and how we all got along but actual programme doesn t show any of that if they had said it was about benefits and making street look bad i would not have taken part they tricked us responding to allegations residents were duped nick mirsky said that love productions had spent much time consulting residents before filming began and that process continued afterwards key contributors have been offered viewings of programmes during editing period and were given opportunity to comment on them both love and channel 4 listened to any concerns raised and in some cases made changes to programme to accommodate them deirdre kelly however subsequently told itv s this morning that she believed programme had provided a one sided view of her community and that residents went into show naively gareth price of guardian suggested show s producers adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience sources including independent and broadcast reported that several commentators had accused channel 4 of making poverty porn in response ralph lee refuted those accusations during a debate on 9 january edition of bbc two s newsnight programme it s inaccurate and it s patronising towards people that take part in these programmes and open up their lives and it s quite offensive to people who make them mirsky claimed reaction to benefits street demonstrated how it had touched a nerve and subsequently proved it was essential series was made boss of love productions richard mckerrow also defended series saying it was not about demonising poor it s a very honest and true portrayal of life in britain and people are frightened of it writing as series concluded daily telegraphs neil midgley felt that benefits street had not exploited its participants and was definitely kind of series that channel 4 should be making easy to grasp and innovative and yet a blinding revelation of some ills that are at heart of modern britain midgley s view was echoed by jay hunt channel 4 s chief creative officer who described series as a perfect channel 4 show because it engaged a huge audience and got millions of people thinking about welfare state and people at bottom of society emma johnson head teacher of oasis school organised a public meeting on evening of 15 january to discuss issues raised by programme event was attended by around 100 residents from area bbc journalist david lumb said reporters were not allowed to take pictures and those present felt occasion was an opportunity to preach a political agenda meeting was told that
