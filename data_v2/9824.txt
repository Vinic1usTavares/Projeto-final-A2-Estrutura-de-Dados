malay archipelago is a book by british naturalist alfred russel wallace which chronicles his scientific exploration during eight year period 1854 to 1862 of southern portion of malay archipelago including malaysia singapore islands of indonesia then known as dutch east indies and island of new guinea it was published in two volumes in 1869 delayed by wallace s ill health and work needed to describe many specimens he brought home book went through ten editions in nineteenth century it has been reprinted many times since and has been translated into at least eight languages book describes each island that he visited in turn giving a detailed account of its physical and human geography its volcanoes and variety of animals and plants that he found and collected at same time he describes his experiences difficulties of travel and help he received from different peoples that he met preface notes that he travelled over 14 000 miles and collected 125 660 natural history specimens mostly of insects though also thousands of molluscs birds mammals and reptiles work was illustrated with engravings based on wallace s observations and collection by leading illustrators thomas baines walter hood fitch john gerrard keulemans e w robinson joseph wolf and t w wood malay archipelago attracted many reviews with interest from scientific geographic church and general periodicals reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories especially division of fauna and flora along what soon became known as wallace line natural selection and uniformitarianism nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of geography natural history and peoples of archipelago which was little known to their readers at time and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens book is much cited and is wallace s most successful both commercially and as a piece of literature context in 1847 wallace and his friend henry walter bates both in their early twenties agreed that they would jointly make a collecting trip to amazon towards solving problem of origin of species charles darwin s book on origin of species was not published until 11 years later in 1859 it was based on darwin s own long collecting trip on hms beagle its publication precipitated by a famous letter from wallace sent during period covered by malay archipelago while he was staying in ternate which described theory of evolution by natural selection in outline wallace and bates had been inspired by reading american entomologist william henry edwards s pioneering 1847 book a voyage up river amazon with a residency at para edwards 1847 bates stayed in amazons for 11 years going on to write naturalist on river amazons 1863 however wallace ill with fever went home in 1852 with thousands of specimens some for science and some for sale ship and his collection were destroyed by fire at sea near guianas rather than giving up wallace wrote about amazon in both prose and poetry and then set sail again this time for malay archipelago overview preface summarises wallace s travels thousands of specimens he collected and some of results from their analysis after his return to england in preface he notes that he travelled over 14 000 miles and collected 125 660 specimens mostly of insects 83 200 beetles 13 100 butterflies and moths 13 400 other insects he also returned to england 7 500 shells such as molluscs 8 050 birds 310 mammals and 100 reptiles wallace 1869 p xiv thumb upright 3 fold out coloured map at front of book showing wallace s travels around archipelago deep water that separates borneo from sulawesi celebes forms what became known as wallace line alt original map showing wallace s travels book is dedicated to charles darwin but as wallace explains in preface he has chosen to avoid discussing evolutionary implications of his discoveries instead he confines himself to interesting facts of problem whose solution is to be found in principles developed by mr darwin wallace 1869 p xii so from a scientific point of view book is largely a descriptive natural history this modesty belies fact that while in sarawak in 1855 wallace wrote paper on law which has regulated introduction of new species concluding with evolutionary sarawak law every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species three years before he wrote to darwin proposing concept of natural selection first chapter describes physical geography and geology of islands with particular attention to role of volcanoes and earthquakes it also discusses overall pattern of flora and fauna including fact that islands can be divided by what would eventually become known as wallace line into two parts those whose animals are more closely related to those of asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of australia wallace 1869 volume 1 pp 1 30 following chapters describe in detail places wallace visited wallace includes numerous observations on people their languages ways of living and social organisation as well as on plants and animals found in each location he talks about biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history in terms both of movement of species and of geologic history of region he also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels wallace 1869 final chapter is an overview of ethnic linguistic and cultural divisions among people who live in region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 439 464 publication thumb treeps hurstpierpoint house where malay archipelago was largely written malay archipelago was largely written at treeps wallace s wife s family home in hurstpierpoint west sussex it was first published in spring 1869 as a single volume first edition however was reprinted in two volumes by macmillan london marked second edition same year by harper brothers new york wallace returned to england in 1862 but explains in preface that given large quantity of specimens and his poor health after his stay in tropics it took a long time he noted that he could at once have printed his notes and journals but felt that doing that would have been disappointing and unhelpful instead therefore he waited until he had published papers on his discoveries and other scientists had described and named as new species some 2 000 of his beetles coleoptera and over 900 hymenoptera including 200 new species of ant wallace 1869 pp vii ix book went through 10 editions with last published in 1890 illustrations thumb great shielded grasshopper drawn and signed by e w robinson illustrations are according to preface made from wallace s own sketches photographs or specimens wallace thanks walter and henry woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people he acknowledges william wilson saunders and mr pascoe for horned flies and very rare longhorn beetles all rest were from his own enormous collection original drawings were made directly on to wood engraving blocks by leading artists thomas baines walter hood fitch john gerrard keulemans e w

englishman is perhaps least known part of globe wallace 1869 volume 1 p 2 archipelago he explains stretches more than 4 000 miles east to west and about 1 300 miles north to south with over twenty sizeable islands and innumerable isles and islets indo malay islands thumb remarkable beetles found at simunjon borneo aeneas tarandus wallacei wallacei 2 singapore wallace gives a lively description of people of town and of wildlife of island he finds chinese most noticeable of people while in one square mile of forest he found 700 species of beetles including 130 longhorns 3 malacca and mount ophir he finds an attractive old portuguese town and beautiful birds such as blue billed flora includes pitcher plants and giant ferns there are tigers and rhinoceros but elephants had already disappeared 4 borneo orang utan he stays in sarawak and finds simunjon coal works convenient as workers are happy to be paid a little for insects they find including locusts stick insects and about 24 new species of beetles each day in all he collects 2000 species of beetle in borneo nearly all at coal mine site he also found a flying frog and orang utans in same place thumb dyak crossing a bamboo bridge 5 borneo journey in interior wallace returns to sarawak where he stays in circular head house of a dyak village travels upriver and describes durian praising it as king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour wallace 1869 volume 1 pp 117 119 and dyak s slender bamboo bridges wallace 1869 volume 1 pp 123 124 as well as ferns and nepenthes pitcher plants on a mountain he finds only place in his entire journey where moths are abundant he collected 1 386 moths on a total of 26 nights but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights he attributes reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped moths in other houses moths at once escaped into roof and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah shaped tent to enable them to catch moths wallace 1869 volume 1 pp 132 136 6 borneo dyaks wallace describes dyak people expressing surprise that despite thomas malthus s predictions for human population of world and lack of any obvious restraints dyak population appeared to be stable 7 java wallace stayed three and a half months in java where he admires system of government and contented people population is he notes rapidly increasing from 3 5 million in 1800 to 5 5 million in 1826 and 14 million in 1865 he enjoys fine hindu archaeological sites and flora of mountain tops which have plants resembling those of europe including royal primula imperialis endemic to one mountain top 8 sumatra he visits sumatra while coastal forest of nipa palms is flooded to a distance of several miles from sea river houses at palembang are built on rafts moored to piles rising and falling with tide he admires traditional houses of villages but had difficulty getting any food there people living entirely on rice through rainy season he discovers some new species of butterfly including papilio memnon which occurs in different forms some being batesian mimics of papilio coon he admires camouflage of a species of dead leaf butterfly kallima he is pleased that one of his hunters brings him a male hornbill shot at its nest hole while feeding female 9 natural history of indo malay islands wallace sketches natural history of islands to west of wallace line noting that flora is like that of india as described by botanist joseph dalton hooker in his 1855 flora indica similarly mammals are similar to those of india including tiger leopard rhinoceros and elephant bird species had diverged but genera were mainly same and some species of for example woodpecker parrot kingfisher and pheasant were found from india to java and borneo while many more were found both in sumatra and malay peninsula timor group thumb upright drawing of timor men by thomas baines from a photograph 10 bali and lombock wallace is grateful for an involuntary stop in bali which he finds one of most interesting places of his trip as hindu customs and religion are still practised while on lombok he finds australian birds such as cockatoos observing that this is most westerly point of that family s range 11 lombock manners and customs on lombok wallace observes how guns are made witnessing boring of gun barrels by two men rotating a pole which is weighted down by a basket of stones he describes people of island and custom of running amok 12 lombock how rajah took census whole chapter is taken up with a legend which wallace calls an anecdote about rajah king of lombok it involves taxation needles and sacred 13 timor wallace describes island of timor its abundance of fan palms its people who are like papuans and portuguese government which he considers extremely poor on some hills he finds eucalyptus gum trees a genus from australia he finds vegetation monotonous also 14 natural history of timor group he finds mixture of bird species intermediate between those of java and australia with 36 species actually javan and 11 closely related while there are only 13 actually australian with 35 closely related wallace interprets this to mean that a small number of birds from australia and a larger number from java colonised timor and then evolved into new species endemic to island land mammals were very few in number six species were endemic or related to those of java or moluccas with none from australia so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent celebes group thumb skull of a babirusa pig deer from celebes by e w robinson 15 celebes macassar wallace finds staying in town of macassar expensive and moves out into countryside he meets rajah and is lucky enough to stay on a farm where he is given a glass of milk every day one of my greatest luxuries wallace 1869 volume 1 p 355 16 celebes macassar he catches some ornithoptera largest most perfect and most beautiful of butterflies wallace 1869 volume 1 p 364 he uses rotten jackfruit to attract beetles but finds few birds limestone mountains are eroded into skittle shaped pillars with narrow bases 17 celebes menado wallace visits menado on northeast coast of celebes people of minahasa region are fair skinned unlike anywhere else in archipelago he stays high in mountains by coffee plantations and is often cold but finds that animals are no different from those lower down forest was full of orchids bromeliads clubmosses and mosses he experiences an earthquake but low timber framed houses survive with little damage he finds that people under guidance of missionaries are most hard working peaceful and civilised of whole archipelago he obtains apparently by purchase skulls of babirusa pig deer and rare midget buffalo 18 natural history of celebes he describes range of species in each group in some detail concluding that birds are unlike those of any of surrounding countries and are quite isolated but are related to those of distant places including new guinea australia india and africa he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place similarly in nymphalidae he mentions english member purple emperor butterfly there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to celebes he concludes that celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of archipelago moluccas 19 banda he finds banda delightful with a smoking volcano and a fine view from top nutmeg trees are beautiful but he regrets ending of dutch monopoly in nutmeg trade which avoided need to levy direct taxes only indigenous animals he thinks are bats except possibly for its opossum species 20 amboyna he finds inhabitants of amboyna lazy but harbour contained most beautiful sight a continuous series of corals sponges and other marine productions of magnificent dimensions varied forms and brilliant colours wallace 1869 volume 1 p 463 a large python has to be ejected from roof space of his house he enjoys true breadfruit which he considers good in many dishes but best simply baked volume 2 moluccas continued 21 ternate wallace takes on and repairs a house which he keeps for three years drawing a plan of it in book it has stone walls 3 feet 1 metre high with posts holding up roof walls and ceiling are made of leaf stems of sago palm he has a well of clean cold water and market provides luxuries of fresh food he returns here to restore his health after arduous journeys 22 gilolo he finds large island rather dull with much tall coarse grass and few species in forest he obtains some small brush tongued lories and day flying moth d thumb upright moluccan beetles 23 voyage to kaioa islands and batchian he hires a small boat to go to highly recommended island of batchian and crosses to tidore where he sees comet of october 1858 it spans about 20 degrees of night sky they sail past volcanic island of which erupted in 1646 and devastatingly again soon after wallace had left archipelago in 1862 in kaioa islands he finds some virgin forest where beetles are more abundant than anywhere he ever saw in his life with swarms of golden rose and long horned weevils as well as longicorn beetles it was a glorious spot and one which will always live in my memory as exhibiting insect life of tropics in unexampled luxuriance wallace 1869 volume 2 p 32 thumb upright male and female of wallace s standardwing from batchian drawn on wood by dutch engraver john gerrard keulemans 24 batchian he is lent a house by sultan who offers him tea and cakes but asks him to teach him to make maps and to give him a gun and a milking goat all of which requests i evaded as skilfully as i was able wallace 1869 volume 2 p 38 his servant ali shoots a new bird of paradise wallace s standardwing a great prize and a striking novelty wallace 1869 volume 2 p 41 he is a little disappointed in range of insects and birds but discovers new species of roller sunbird and is happy to see racquet tailed kingfisher his house is burgled twice a blacksmith manages to pick his locks and make him a new set of keys and he discovers a new species of birdwing butterfly 25 ceram goram and matabello islands he travels to ceram where he enjoys company of a multilingual flemish plantation owner he finds few birds despite constant searching and wading through rivers water and rough ground destroy both his pairs of shoes and he returns home on last day lame from walking in my stockings very painfully wallace 1869 volume 2 p 85 sailing in matabello islands he is blown ten miles off course his men fearing being swept on to coast of new guinea in which case we should most likely all be murdered as tribes there are treacherous and bloodthirsty wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 99 100 111 he is sorry to see that even smallest children here all chew betel nut and are disfigured by sores from a poor diet however he enjoys their palm wine which he finds more like cider than beer and water inside young coconuts which he explains is nothing like contents of old dry coconuts on sale in england he buys a prau and surprises people by fitting it out himself using tools of best london make but lacking a large drill holes have to be made very slowly by boring with hot iron rods wallace 1869 volume 2 p 109 travelling round ceram crew from goram run away he describes in detail process of making sago 26 bouru he finds he has arrived in rainy season seeing mainly mud and water he complains that two months work produce only 210 species of beetle compared to 300 in three weeks at amboyna however one beetle was up to 3 inches 7 5 cm long with antennae up to 5 inches 12 5 cm in length he is amused at himself for finding his simple hut comfortable once he has made a rough table and is in his rattan chair with a mosquito net and large scotch plaid to form a little sleeping apartment he gets 17 new at least for moluccas species of bird including a new bird wallace 1869 volume 2 p 133 27 natural history of moluccas only carnivore in moluccas is malayan civet which he supposes has been introduced by accident as it is kept for its musk celebes babirusa is oddly found on bouru which he supposes it reached partly by swimming citing sir charles lyell s principles of geology to confirm this ability other mammals are marsupial so he presumes true natives in contrast to few mammals there are at least 265 bird species more than all of europe which had 257 but of these just three groups parrots kingfishers and pigeons make up nearly a third compared to only a twentieth of birds of india wallace suggests this is because they came from new guinea which has a similar lack of some groups and adds that many new guinea birds have not reached moluccas implying that islands have been isolated for a long time papuan group thumb upright 0 8 papuan charm by e w robinson 28 macassar to aru islands in a native prau wallace decides to avoid rainy season of celebes by travelling to aru islands source of pearls mother of pearl and tortoiseshell for europe and edible birds nests and sea slugs for china even though they are inhabited by savages he is excited despite danger of a 1 000 mile 1600 km voyage in a 70 ton bugis prau with a crew of 50 considering islands ultima thule of east his small cabin was he ever had at sea and he liked natural materials and absence of foul smelling paint and tar wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 158

men naked but for shells and long plumes of cassowary feathers singing and shouting as they rowed who board prow with high exuberance intoxicated with joy and excitement asking for tobacco wallace 1869 volume 2 p 177 it is at once clear to wallace these papuans are not malays in appearance or behaviour wallace 1869 volume 2 p 176 they are expert boat builders using only axe adze and auger fitting planks together so well that a knife blade can hardly be inserted anywhere wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 184 186 they use no money bartering for knives cloth and arrack brandy and bring many beetles including a new jewel beetle species in return for tobacco 30 aru islands residence in dobbo on one day he captures about 30 species of butterfly most since he was in amazon including large

journey and residence in interior he is brought a king bird of paradise amusing islanders with his excitement it had been one of his goals for travelling to archipelago he reflects on how their beauty is wasted in dark and gloomy woods with no intelligent eye to gaze upon their loveliness but that when civilized man reaches islands he will certainly upset balance of nature and make birds extinct wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 222 224 he finds men most beautiful of all peoples he has stayed among women less handsome except in extreme youth wallace 1869 volume 2 p 254 32 aru islands second residence in dobbo he sees a cock fight in street but is more interested in a game of football played with a hollow ball of rattan and remarks excessive cheapness wallace 1869 volume 2 p 271 of all goods including those made in europe or america which he believes causes idleness and drunkenness because there is no need to work hard to obtain goods he admires a crimson flowered tree surrounded with flocks of blue and orange lories he is given some birds nest soup which he found almost tasteless 33 aru islands physical geography and aspects of nature islands are completely crossed by three narrow channels which resemble and are called rivers though they are inlets of sea wildlife is much like that of new guinea 150 miles 240 km away which he supposes was once connected by a land bridge most flowers are green large and showy flowers are rare or absent 34 new guinea dorey he travels to new guinea after long anticipation coastal village houses stand in water they have boat shaped rooves and often have human skulls hanging under eaves trophies of battles with their attackers council house has revolting carvings of naked figures he finds inhabitants often very handsome as they are tall with aquiline noses and heads of carefully combed hair wallace 1869 volume 2 pp 305 306 he failed to find birds of paradise described by french pharmacist and botanist rene primevere lesson but is pleased with horned deer flies including cervicornis and e wallacei he injured his ankle and had to rest as it became an ulcer while all his men had fever dysentery or ague when he recovers birds are scarce but he finds about 30 species of beetles each day on average on two memorable days he finds 78 and 95 kinds his personal record it takes him 6 hours to pin and lay out specimens afterwards in all he collected over 800 species of beetle in dorey he leaves without much regret as he never visited a place with more privations and annoyances wallace 1869 volume 2 p 327 35 voyage from ceram to waigiou he is blown far off course while trying to reach his assistant mr allen losing some men who went ashore dragging anchor running on to a coral reef and guided by an incorrect map it took 8 days among reefs and islands of waigiou wallace 1869 volume 2 p 347 to return to a safe harbour he sends a boat to rescue his men it returns 10 days later without them but he pays them again and on second attempt it returns with his two men who had survived for a month on roots and tender flower stalks of a species of on shell fish and on a few turtles eggs wallace 1869 volume 2 p 348 36 waigiou he builds a palm leaf hut which leaks badly until they increase slope of roof he shoots a red bird of paradise he supposes people to be of mixed race he sails to where chief lends him a tiny hut on stilts entered by a ladder and not tall enough to stand up in he learns to live and work in a semi horizontal position wallace 1869 volume 2 p 360 he is first white man to come to island he trades goods for birds of paradise people do not shoot them with blunt arrows like aru islanders but set out fruit as bait on a forked stick and catch birds with a noose of cord that hangs from stick down to ground pulling cord when bird arrives sometimes after two or three days 37 voyage from waigiou to ternate while sailing back to ternate boat is overtaken by a dozen waves which approached with a dull roaring like heavy surf sea being perfectly smooth wallace 1869 volume 2 p 371 before and after he concludes these must have been earthquake waves as william dampier had described later he learnt that there had been an earthquake on gilolo that day on journey they lose their anchor and their mooring cable is snapped by a squall new wooden anchors are ingeniously made men believe boat is unlucky and ask for a ceremony before travelling further they are caught by a storm and lose small boat they are towing wallace notes that in 78 days there was not one single day of fair wind sic wallace 1869 volume 2 p 384 38 birds of paradise wallace pointing out that he often journeyed expressly to obtain specimens describes birds of paradise in detail and effects of sexual selection by females he covers great king red magnificent superb golden or six shafted standard wing twelve wired and or long tailed birds of paradise as well as three new guinea birds which he considers almost as remarkable he suggests they could live well if released in palm house at kew gardens in all he knows of 18 species of which 11 are from new guinea and 8 are endemic to it and or 14 in general new guinea area 1 being from moluccas and 3 from australia his assistant mr allen runs into trouble as people were suspicious of his motives a year of five voyages had produced only 5 of 14 species in new guinea area 39 natural history of papuan islands new guinea writes wallace is mostly unknown with only wildlife of northwestern peninsula partially explored but already 250 land birds are known making island of great interest there are few mammals mostly marsupials including a kangaroo first seen by le brun in 1714 thumb upright portrait of a javanese chief 40 races of man in malay archipelago wallace ends book by describing his views on peoples of archipelago he finds malays such as javanese most civilised though he describes dyaks of borneo and bataks of sumatra among others as savage malays wallace 1869 volume 2 p 441 he quotes traveller nicolo conti s 1430 account of them with other early descriptions he thinks papuan opposite of malay impulsive and demonstrative where malay is impassive and taciturn he speculates about their origins and in a note at end criticises english society appendix on crania and languages wallace mentions huxley s theory and dr joseph barnard davis s book thesaurus which supposed that human races could be distinguished by shape of cranium dome of skull of which theory wallace is sceptical however he lists measurements he had taken of crania of malays and papuans noting that within malay group there was enormous variation he had few skulls in papuan group and there were no definite differences between two groups language appendix lists 9 words black white fire water large small nose tongue tooth in 59 of languages encountered in archipelago and 117 words in 33 of those languages making it clear that many of languages have many words in common reception contemporary malay archipelago was warmly received on publication often in lengthy reviews that attempted to summarise book from perspective that suited reviewing periodical it was reviewed in more than 40 periodicals a selection of those reviews is summarised below anthropological review anthropological review notes that while descriptions of animal life are full of interest our readers as anthropologists will however take a keener interest in great man like ape of borneo orang utan or mias as it is called by aborigines two pages are taken up with a discussion of orang utan review then turns to wallace s observations on races of man in book observing that anthropological details given are useful but perhaps chosen to support a particular theory namely wallace s belief that there were eastern and western races malays and papuans though boundary between them was east of wallace line review accepts wallace s data on natural history but suspects he was selective in recording details of individuals it notes that wallace agreed with french authors that polynesians included in his papuans had a local origin review remarks that mr wallace relies more on diversity of moral features to prove differences of race than on physical peculiarities although he declares that these are strongly marked and doubts difference and wonders whether javan chief and dyak do not differ more review after ten pages of reflections on race concludes by recommending book to its readers as much better than ordinary travel books and even in absence of any very stirring incidents that it will amply repay perusal of both scientific and general readers journal of ethnological society of london thumb upright papuan new guinea was reprinted from malay archipelago in ethnological society s review journal of ethnological society of london focussed exclusively on ethnology in book praising value both of information and of wallace s thoughtful and suggestive speculation review notes that wallace identified two types of mankind in archipelago malayan and papuan and that he thought these two had no traceable affinity to each other it remarks that wallace greatly extends knowledge of people of timor celebes and while also adding to what is known of malays and papuans reprinting his entire description and his engraving of a papuan reviewer remarks that portrait would as well suit a papuan of south east coast of new guinea as any of those whom mr wallace saw noting however that southern tribes are more varied in skin colour reviewer disagrees with wallace about extension of this papuan race as far as fiji noting that there are or were people like that in tasmania but that their features and height varied widely perhaps forming a series reviewer disagrees also that sandwich islanders and new zealanders maori are related to papuans and with wallace s claim that presence of malay words in polynesian languages is caused by roaming habits trade and navigation of malays arguing instead that polynesians long ago migrated from some common seat in or near malay archipelago review ends by stating that despite all these disagreements it holds wallace s ethnology in high estimation royal geographical society sir roderick murchison giving a speech at royal geographical society felt able to feel a pride in wallace s success and in striking contributions made to science he takes interest in wallace s line which he calls this ingenious speculation with two faunas wonderfully contrasted either side of deep channel between borneo and celebes or bali and lombok he points out same principle between british isles and continental europe though there conclusion is rather that same fauna and flora is found on both sides however murchison states his disagreement with wallace s support for james hutton s principle of uniformitarianism that all former changes of outline of earth were produced slowly opining that bali lombok channel probably formed suddenly he mentions in one sentence that book contains interesting and important facts on physical geography native inhabitants climate and products of archipelago and describes wallace as a great naturalist and a most attractive writer ladies repository one of shortest reviews was in ladies repository which found it reviewer notes region is of terrific grandeur parts of it being perpetually illuminated by discharging volcanoes and all of it frequently shaken with earthquakes review summarises book s geographical reach and style in a paragraph popular science review popular science review began by writing that we never remember to have taken up a book which gave us more pleasure it was quite unlike dull journey logs of most travel books it was a romance which is nevertheless plain matter of fact review especially admires way that wallace has generalised on facts rather than just shooting a multitude of birds and interminably describing them account notes that wallace was joint originator of theory of natural selection and summarises discovery of wallace line in some detail review ends by placing malay archipelago between charles lyell s principles of geology and darwin s origin of species american quarterly church review thumb upright 0 8 natives of aru shooting great bird of paradise american quarterly church review admires wallace s bravery in going alone among barbarous races in a villainous climate with all hardships of travel and his hard work in skinning stuffing drying and bottling so many specimens since as a scientific man he follows darwin review finds his theories sometimes need as many grains of salt as his specimens but review then agrees that book will make world wiser about its more solitary and singular children hid away over seas and opines that no one will mind paying price of book to read about birds of paradise those bird angels with flaming wings of crimson and gold and scarlet who twitter and and make merry among great island trees while malay hunts for them with his blunt headed arrows review concludes that book is a fresh and valuable record of a remote and romantic land australian town and country journal australian town and country journal begins by stating that and quickly makes clear that it objects to wallace s doubts about indications of design in plants despite this grave fault reviewer considers book to be of immense value and that it would become a standard work on region review quotes a paragraph that paints a picture of country life in celebes where wallace describes his host a mr m who relied on his gun to supply his table with wild pigs deer and jungle fowl while enjoying his own milk butter rice coffee ducks palm wine and tobacco however australian reviewer doubted wallace s judgement about flavours given that he praised durian fruit namely that it tastes of custard cream cheese onion sauce brown sherry and other incongruities whereas most europeans found it an abomination otherwise review notes that wallace seemed to have enjoyed his time in celebes with flapping past and baboons staring down from their trees and enjoys his enthusiasm for birds of paradise review is respectful of his account of wallace line having no difficulty agreeing that australian type vegetation continues into archipelago as far as lombok and celebes it concludes that he covers almost every natural phenomenon he came across with accuracy and discriminating sagacity of an accomplished naturalist and explains that great charm of book is a truthful simplicity which inspires confidence calcutta review thumb indian museum calcutta calcutta review starts by noting that this is a book that cannot be done justice in a brief notice that wallace is a most eminent naturalist and chiefly known as a darwinian book was most interesting to cross reviewer s desk since palgrave s arabia 1865 and sir samuel baker s explorations of nile 1866 by combining geography geology and ethnology into one narrative reader is saved monotony of traversing same regions several times review describes in detail wallace s findings of different birds and mammals either side of wallace line it notes wallace s cheerfulness and good temper in face of difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel such as having to cross a hundred miles of open sea in a little boat of four tons burthen review is citing wallace 1869 volume 2 p 92 which wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable reviewer remarks that wallace was set down as a conjuror by these simple people with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country but is less admiring about wallace s moralising tone especially when he supposes that wild communities can be happier than in a more highly civilised society review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little known malay archipelago is in india given that they were closely connected with hindu temples in java and bali and hopes that soon there will be some productions of archipelago in indian museum of calcutta revue des deux mondes book s fame spread beyond english speaking world r radau wrote a lengthy review of un dans l archipel in french revue des deux mondes radau notes many deaths from volcanic eruptions in archipelago before explaining similarity of fauna of java and sumatra with that of central asia while that of celebes carries mark of australia seeming to be last representatives of another age radau describes wallace s experiences in singapore where goods were far cheaper than in europe wire knives corkscrews gunpowder writing paper and he remarks on spread of jesuits into interior though missionaries had to live on just 750 francs a year singapore was covered in wooded hills and sawn wood and rotten trunks supported innumerable beetles for naturalist to study only disagreeable element was that tigers that roared in forest devoured on average one chinese per day especially in ginger plantations radau summarises one passage from book after another orang utans of borneo wrestling open jaws of a crocodile or killing a python timorese walking up tall trees leaning back on ropes as they pull themselves upwards indescribable taste of a durian fruit at once recalling custard almond paste roasted onions sherry and a host of other things that melts on tongue that one does not want to stop eating more fruit has a repulsive odour and tree is dangerous as hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head radau follows wallace up to high plateaux of java where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen finally at summit vegetation seems european an island vegetation recalling resemblance between plants of high alps and of lapland and in celebes men run amok generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death radau returns to food describing sago and breadfruit tree breadfruit tastes like yorkshire pudding or mashed potato with meat it is best of vegetables with sugar milk butter or molasses it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in european markets as for sago palm one tree yields 1 800 cakes enough to feed a man for a year there is torrential rain there are savages there are dangerous trips in small boats only in final paragraph does radau reflect on it all we have tried in this study on wallace s two volumes to give an idea of what he saw in his eight year stay in far east he admits he has left out most of natural history and regrets not having space for more charming pages which would have taken him too far he joins wallace in reflecting on relative state of civilized and savage wondering which is morally superior and notes nostalgia for primitive state concluding that civilisation brings benefit of reason to restrain hasty action modern guardian thumb chief s house and rice shed in a sumatran village by e w robinson tim radford writing in guardian considers that malay archipelago shows wallace to be an extraordinary figure since he is radford finds delights on every page such as wallace line between islands of bali and lombok sparkling observations like river bed a mass of pebbles mostly pure white quartz but with abundance of jasper and agate detailed but lively accounts of natural history and physical geography respectful and friendly attitude to native peoples such as hill dyaks of borneo and his observations of human society such as way a bugis man in lombok runs amok where wallace observer thumb upright flying frog of borneo alt engraving of a frog robin mckie in observer writes that common view of wallace as a clever decent cove who knew his place as second fiddle to charles darwin is rather lopsided wallace he writes is capable of great insights in malay archipelago travelling over 14 000 miles and collecting 125 000 specimens he also made scrupulous notes for book which in mckie s view wallace was a gifted writer with an eye for catchy observation and this is one of finest of travel books mckie liked account of wallace s night sleeping with half a dozen smoke dried human skulls suspended over my head in research researcher charles smith rates malay archipelago as wallace s most successful work literarily and commercially placing it second only to his darwinism 1889 among his books for academic citations
