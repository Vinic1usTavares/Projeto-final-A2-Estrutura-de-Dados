of human rights a declaration on essential rights of man had been proposed at 1945 san francisco conference which led to founding of united nations and economic and social council was given task of drafting it early on in process document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments former evolved into udhr and was adopted on 10 december 1948 drafting continued on convention but there remained significant differences between un members on relative importance of negative civil and political versus positive economic social and cultural rights these eventually caused convention to be split into two separate covenants one to contain civil and political rights and other to contain economic social and cultural rights united nations general assembly resolution 543 5 february 1952 two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible and be opened for signature simultaneously each would also contain an article on right of all peoples to self determination united nations general assembly resolution 545 5 february 1952 states parties to present covenant including those having responsibility for administration of non self governing and trust territories shall promote realization of right of self determination and shall respect that right in conformity with provisions of

committee on economic social and cultural rights see below to make general recommendations to un general assembly on appropriate measures to realise rights article 21 part 5 articles 26 31 governs ratification entry into force and amendment of covenant core provisions principle of progressive realisation article 2 of covenant imposes a duty on all parties to take steps to maximum of its available resources with a view to achieving progressively full realization of rights recognized in present covenant by all appropriate means including particularly adoption of legislative measures icescr article 2 1 this is known as principle of progressive realisation it acknowledges that some of rights for example right to health may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time and that states may be subject to resource constraints but requires them to act as best they can within their means principle differs from that of iccpr which obliges parties to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction rights in that convention however it does not render covenant meaningless requirement to take steps imposes a continuing obligation to work towards realisation of rights paragraph 9 it also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal committee on economic social and cultural rights also interprets principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide at least minimum essential levels of each of rights cescr general comment 3 paragraph 10 if resources are highly constrained this should include use of targeted programmes aimed at vulnerable cescr general comment 3 paragraph 12 committee on economic social and cultural rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints enacting of anti discrimination provisions and establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means some provisions such as anti discrimination laws are already required under other human rights instruments such as iccpr cescr general comment 3 paragraphs 3 6 labour rights article 6 of covenant recognises right to work defined as opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work icescr article 6 1 parties are required to take

18 paragraph 7 this is effectively defined by article 7 of covenant which recognises right of everyone to just and favourable working conditions these are in turn defined as fair wages with equal pay for equal work sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants safe working conditions equal opportunity in workplace and sufficient rest and leisure including limited working hours and regular paid holidays article 8 recognises right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects right to strike it allows these rights to be restricted for members of armed forces

restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters e g japan right to social security article 9 of covenant recognizes right of everyone to social security including social insurance icescr

of article 9 finally parties must take special measures to protect children from economic or social exploitation including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations icescr article 10 3 right to an adequate standard of living article 11 recognises right of everyone to an adequate standard of living this includes but is not limited to right to adequate food clothing housing and continuous improvement of living conditions icescr article 11 1 it also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate world hunger right to adequate food also referred to as right to food is interpreted as requiring availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy dietary needs of individuals free from adverse substances and acceptable within a given culture this must be accessible to all implying an obligation to provide special programmes for vulnerable cescr general comment 12 paragraph 13 this must also ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need taking into account problems of food importing and food exporting countries ref icescr article 11 2 b ref right to adequate food also implies a right to water right to adequate housing also referred to as right to housing is right to live somewhere in security peace and dignity it requires adequate privacy adequate space adequate

communities from homes and or land which they occupy without provision of and access to appropriate forms of legal or other protection are a prima facie violation of covenant right to adequate clothing also referred to as right to clothing has not been defined and has received little in way of academic commentary or international discussion what is considered adequate has only been discussed in specific contexts such as refugees disabled elderly or workers dr stephen james a forgotten right right to clothing in international law right to 12 of covenant recognises right of everyone to enjoyment of highest attainable standard of physical and mental health icescr article 12 1 health is understood not just as a right to be healthy but as a right to control one s own health

to underlying determinants of health such as clean water sanitation food nutrition and housing and through a comprehensive system of healthcare which is available to everyone without discrimination and economically accessible to all cescr general comment 14 paragraphs 11 12 article 12 2 requires parties to take specific steps to improve health of their citizens including reducing infant mortality and improving child health improving environmental and workplace health preventing controlling and treating epidemic diseases and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all these are considered to be illustrative non exhaustive examples rather than a complete statement of parties obligations cescr general comment 14 paragraph 7 right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women s reproductive rights by not limiting access to contraception or censoring withholding or intentionally misrepresenting information about sexual health cescr general comment 14 paragraph 34 they must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation cescr general comment 14 paragraph 35

instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available cescr general comment 13 paragraph 28 committee on economic social and cultural rights interpret covenant as also requiring states to respect academic freedom of staff and students as this is vital for educational process cescr general comment 13 paragraph 38 it also considers corporal punishment in schools to be inconsistent with covenant s underlying principle of dignity of individual cescr general comment 13 paragraph 41 article 14 of covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free compulsory primary education to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction within a reasonable number of years icescr article 14 right to participation in cultural 15 of covenant recognises right of everyone to participate in cultural life enjoy benefits of scientific progress and to benefit from protection of moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring protection of intellectual property but committee on economic social and cultural rights interprets it as primarily protecting moral rights of authors and proclaim ing intrinsically personal character of every creation of human mind and ensuing durable link between creators and their creations it thus requires parties to respect right of authors to be recognised as creator of a work material rights are interpreted as being part of right to an adequate standard of living and need not extend over entire lifespan of an author cescr general comment 17 paragraph 16 parties must also work to promote conservation development and diffusion of science and culture

amnesty international writes that united states signed covenant in 1979 under carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified for political reasons carter administration did not push for necessary review of covenant by senate which must give its advice and consent before us can ratify a treaty reagan and george h w bush administrations took view that economic social and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be object of binding treaties clinton administration did not deny nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with congress over covenant george w bush administration followed in line with view of previous bush administration obama administration stated
