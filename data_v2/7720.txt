goldsmith s novel vicar of wakefield complex plot was broken down to a single reel adaptation by edwin thanhouser and or lloyd lonergan edwin thanhouser s wife gertrude assisted with scenarios and editing of films but it is not specifically known if she contributed to this production film s director is unknown but it may have been barry o neil or lucius j henderson credit is sometimes given to theodore marston an error that apparently originates with american film index 1908 1915 film historian q david bowers consulted one of co authors of book gunnar lundquist and confirmed that credit of marston as director was in error marston worked with pathe kinemacolor vitagraph and other companies but there is no record of him working with thanhouser this error has persisted in several works including complete index to literary sources in film cameramen employed by company at time film was made include blair smith carl louis gregory and alfred h moses jr but role of cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions this production is unique for having cast members known because most of credits in thanhouser s 1910 productions are fragmentary release and reception single reel drama approximately 1 000 feet long was released on december 27 1910 film likely had a wide national release theaters are known to have shown film in pennsylvania kansas indiana and south dakota film received positive reviews from trade publications including moving picture world which praised acting and execution of film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces new york dramatic mirror reviewer was less enthusiastic writing that production gave a very praiseworthy portrayal of period but a moving picture needs such different treatment from a novel that its interpretation in a picture is bound to lose much of original interest acting was in every way adequate although not great complete index to literary sources in film lists this film as first adaptation of vicar of wakefield it was followed by identically titled adaptations including pathe freres s vicar of wakefield in 1912 and kinematograph trading company s vicar of wakefield in 1913 ideal film company s vicar of wakefield in 1916 thanhouser company reproduced vicar of wakefield in 1917 two thanhouser films differ in more than just length as feature length adaptation shows
