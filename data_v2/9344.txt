already outdated by time they entered service as they were inferior in size armor firepower and speed to revolutionary new british battleship after commissioning schlesien was assigned to i battle squadron of high seas fleet later being transferred to ii battle squadron she was primarily occupied with training cruises and fleet maneuvers in her early career she served with fleet throughout first two years of world war i seeing action at battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 where she was briefly actively engaged in combat after jutland imperial navy relegated schlesien to guard duties before withdrawing her altogether in 1917 when she became a training ship treaty of versailles permitted german navy to keep eight obsolete battleships including schlesien to defend german coast initially kept in reserve she was modernized in mid 1920s and saw extensive service with reorganized reichsmarine schlesien saw limited combat during world war ii briefly bombarding polish forces during invasion of poland in september 1939 she escorted minesweepers during operation weserubung invasion of norway and denmark in april 1940 after operation she was given secondary duties primarily serving as a training ship and icebreaker she ended her career providing fire support in baltic coast while off swinemunde on 3 may 1945 she struck a mine and was towed into swinemunde where she was sunk by her crew in shallow water though much of her superstructure including her main battery remained above water in remaining days of war schlesien used her anti aircraft guns to defend city from air attack after end of war she was broken up though some parts of ship remained visible until 1970s design thumb left line drawing of deutschland class alt side and top views of a large ship shaded

passed under direction of vizeadmiral vadmvice admiral alfred von tirpitz law secured funding for construction of twenty new battleships over next seventeen years first group five s were laid down in early 1900s shortly thereafter design work began on a follow up design which became deutschland class ships were broadly similar to braunschweigs but featured incremental improvements in armor protection they also abandoned gun turrets for secondary battery guns moving them back to traditional casemates to save weight british battleship armed with ten 12 inch 30 5 cm gunswas commissioned in december 1906 dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of german navy obsolete including schlesien schlesien was long had a beam of and a draft of she displaced and had a full

in march 1908 for her final fitting out schlesien was commissioned into fleet on 5 may she then began sea trials which were delayed from 6 july to 5 september when ship was temporarily used as a torpedo testing ship in place of protected cruiser which had to go into drydock for an overhaul by early september vineta had completed her overhaul allowing schlesien to join fleet she received her full crew on 22 september and thereafter joined i battle squadron ships of high seas fleet embarked on a cruise into atlantic ocean that lasted from 7 july to 1 august while on way back to germany they were received by british royal navy in spithead in late 1909 admiral henning von holtzendorff became new fleet commander his tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation due to threat latest underwater weapons posed and fact that new s were too wide to pass through kaiser wilhelm canal accordingly fleet was transferred from kiel to wilhelmshaven on 1 april 1910 in may 1910 fleet conducted training maneuvers in kattegat these were in accordance with holtzendorff s strategy which envisioned drawing royal navy into narrow waters there annual summer cruise was to norway and was followed by fleet training during which another fleet review was held in danzig on 29 august a training cruise into baltic sea took place at end of year in march 1911 fleet conducted exercises in skagerrak and kattegat schlesien and rest of fleet received british and american naval squadrons at kiel in june and july year s autumn maneuvers were confined to baltic and kattegat during which another fleet review was held in order to prepare for an austro hungarian delegation that included archduke franz ferdinand and admiral rudolf montecuccoli on 3 november 1911 schlesien was transferred to ii battle squadron with rest of her sister ships at this time she transferred back to kiel where ii squadron was based in mid 1912 due to agadir crisis summer cruise was confined to baltic to avoid exposing fleet during period of heightened tension with britain and france fleet thereafter held annual autumn maneuvers in august and september a winter cruise in baltic followed at end of year in 1913 same uneventful pattern followed on 14 july 1914 annual summer cruise to norway began threat of war during july crisis forced kaiser wilhelm ii to end cruise after only two weeks by end of july fleet was back in port world war i schlesien served with high seas fleet through first two years of war at outbreak of conflict ship was deployed to guard german bight she then rejoined high seas fleet to support battlecruisers that bombarded scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 16 december 1914 during operation german battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six british battleships skirmishes between rival destroyer screens convinced admiral friedrich von ingenohl that he was confronted with entire grand fleet and so he broke off engagement and went back home two fruitless fleet advances followed on 17 18 and 21 23 april 1915 another followed on 17 18 may and another on 23 24 october in march 1916 schlesien was employed as a target ship for u boats on 24 25 april schlesien and her sisters joined dreadnoughts of high seas fleet to support battlecruisers of i scouting group on a raid of english coast while en route to target battlecruiser was damaged by a mine remaining battlecruisers conducted a short bombardment of ports of yarmouth and lowestoft target s visibility was poor so operation was soon called off before british fleet could intervene squadron exercises in baltic followed from 11 to 22 may battle of jutland thumb upright 1 4 diagram of battle of jutland showing major movements alt german fleet sailed to north and met british fleet sailing from west both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during chaotic battle admiral scheer immediately planned another foray into north sea but damage to seydlitz delayed operation until end of may schlesien was second ship in iv division of ii battle squadron under command of rear admiral positioned at rear of german line during ensuing operation schlesien was second to last ship in german line followed only by her sister ship during run to north admiral reinhard scheer commander of fleet ordered fleet to pursue british v battle squadron at top speed slower deutschland class ships could not keep up with faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind by 19 30 grand fleet had arrived on scene and confronted scheer with a large numerical superiority german fleet was severely hampered by presence of slower deutschland class ships if scheer ordered an immediate turn towards germany he would have to sacrifice slower ships to make good his escape scheer decided to reverse course of fleet with gefechtskehrtwendung a maneuver that required every unit in german line to turn 180deg simultaneously as they had fallen behind ships of iibattle squadron could not conform to new course following turn schlesien and other five ships of squadron were therefore located on disengaged side of german line mauve considered moving his ships to rear of line astern of iiibattle squadron dreadnoughts but decided against it when he realized movement would interfere with maneuvering of admiral franz von hipper s battlecruisers instead he attempted to place his ships at head of line later on first day of battle hard pressed battlecruisers of i scouting group were being pursued by their british opponents schlesien and other so called five minute ships came to their aid by steaming in between opposing battlecruiser squadrons schlesien and her sisters could barely make out a target in darkness owing to poor visibility their shooting was ineffective british battlecruisers scored several hits on german ships in brief melee a near miss from a large caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto schlesiens decks killing one man and wounding another admiral mauve ordered an 8 point turn to south and british did not follow late on 31st fleet organized for night return to germany schlesien and schleswig holstein fell in behind mauled battlecruisers and at rear of line british destroyers conducted a series of attacks against fleet some of which targeted schlesien regardless high seas fleet punched through british destroyer forces and reached horns reef by 04 00 on 1 june german fleet reached wilhelmshaven a few hours later where undamaged dreadnoughts of nassau and es took up defensive positions later wartime service after jutland schlesien and her three surviving sisters returned to picket duty at mouth of elbe and in june and july schlesien again served as a torpedo target ship for u boats experience at jutland demonstrated that pre dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts and they were thus left behind when high seas fleet sortied again on 18 august from 31 january to 9 february 1917 she served in danish straits as a guard ship and also as an icebreaker after which she returned to elbe from 2 may to 8 june she was again used as a target ship in baltic her guard ship duties in elbe ended on 27 july when she was withdrawn from service and converted into a training ship for engine room personnel and new recruits she served in this capacity from 20 august to 16 april 1918 in late april schlesien was taken into drydock at kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in wilhelmshaven to be converted into a training ship for naval cadets ship s main and secondary battery guns were removed so they could be used ashore leaving schlesien equipped with a battery of and guns she had made several training cruises in baltic by november 1918 she was in kiel during kiel mutiny in closing days of war on 5 november she left port still flying imperial german flag even after most of other vessels in port had hoisted red flag of revolution schlesien initially went to flensburg but mutiny had already spread to port so on orders from reichsmarineamt imperial naval office she sailed instead to swinemunde where on 10 november her commander fregattenkapitan frigate captain von hauled down his flag and placed his ship out of service he and crew remained aboard and on 14 november they took ship back to kiel where they were released from service on 20 november she was used briefly again to train cadets to operate boilers and engines on 1 december she was again removed from service inter war years thumb left schlesien in panama canal in 1937 alt overhead view of a large ship much of which is covered with canvas sun shades as it passes through calm waters following german defeat in world war i german navy was reorganized as reichsmarine according to treaty of versailles new navy was permitted to retain eight pre dreadnought battleships under article 181 two of which would be in reserve for coastal defense schlesien was one of vessels retained under terms of treaty but was initially kept in reserve since she still carried battery of just 10 5 cm and 8 8 cm guns by mid 1920s two of battleships still in active service and were becoming worn out and needed replacement replacements for old battleships s would not be ready for some time and so navy decided to rearm and modernize schlesien in 1926 1927 her original 28 cm guns were reinstalled and a new secondary battery of guns were installed in casemates for old 17 cm guns this included removing fore funnel and ducting those boilers into an enlarged funnel and installing a new heavy pole mast work was completed on 1 march 1927 and she thereafter entered service with crew from hannover on joining rest of fleet schlesien became flagship of commander of naval forces of north sea konteradmiral kadm rear admiral alexander werth which was renamed on 1 january 1930 commander of battleships she was based in wilhelmshaven in may 1927 president paul von hindenburg came to wilhelmshaven to visit fleet annual fleet maneuvers were conducted in august and september as they had been in prewar years and they culminated in a naval review on 14 september for hindenburg kadm wilhelm prentzel replaced werth on 29 september and in october 1928 he was in turn replaced by kadm walther franz in course of 1928 schlesien went on a fleet cruise in atlantic in july and conducted shooting training in august with old ironclad now target ship another atlantic cruise followed in april and may 1929 in february 1930 franz who had by then been promoted to rank of vizeadmiral turned command of unit to kadm richard foerster from 3 april to 6 june schlesien embarked on a major training cruise by herself to mediterranean sea during which she visited messina sicily where her senior officers met king victor emmanuel iii of italy in june 1931 schlesien visited norway kommodore commodore max bastian replaced foerster in september 1932 and at same time kapitan zur see captain at sea wilhelm canaris who later served as chief of abwehr took command of ship a position he would hold for next two years schlesien made another trip into atlantic in january 1933 which included a stop in iceland from 6 to 9 january on 10 december 1933 new heavy cruiser replaced schlesien as flagship of commander of battleships schlesien was converted back into a training ship for cadets between 18 february and 8 april 1935 and she was formally removed from fleet organization on 30 september among modifications were installation of additional anti aircraft guns and replacement of ship s boilers newer boilers were more efficient which allowed fewer of them to be used additional space this created was used as crew compartments for cadets and an instruction room crew was also altered standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men after conversion this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors supplemented by 214 cadets over course of following three years schlesien embarked on several overseas training cruises as part of training inspectorate first lasted from 1 december 1935 to 29 february 1936 and went to cape verde in central atlantic more modernization work was done after her return to germany and from 12 october 1936 to 22 april 1937 she went on a tour of north central and south america further cruises followed in october 1937 april 1938 and march 1939 during this period her last

following occupation of port alt two large ships bristling with guns moored close to shore after outbreak of world war ii following german invasion of poland on 1 september 1939 schlesien initially remained in her training ship role though from 21 to 27 september she was used to bombard polish artillery positions around hela and after operation schlesien had six of her 15 cm guns removed to arm new surface raider she then returned to training ship duties and from january to march 1940 served as an icebreaker to allow u boats to operate she then escorted minesweepers in little belt in april during operation weserubung invasion of norway and denmark she resumed training duties but crew shortages forced navy to deactivate ship on 2 august leaving only a skeleton crew aboard to maintain ship s condition in january 1941 she was reactivated to again serve as an icebreaker in baltic until 31 march when she was again decommissioned in gotenhafen thereafter being used as a stationary training hulk with a skeleton crew as germany began to prepare for war with soviet union in early 1941 schlesien was reactivated on 30 april to protect minelayers along with schleswig holstein as they laid a series of minefields in baltic to prevent soviet baltic fleet from attempting to break out to britain soviet fleet did not attempt to leave port after germany invaded in june and so schlesien was detached from force guarding minefields in october she returned to gotenhafen and resumed training duties there icebreaker service again summoned vessel to active service from january to april 1942 on 4 april schlesien sailed to back gotenhafen in company with battleship and icebreaker schlesien thereafter saw limited training duties in baltic in 1943 and 1944 owing to increasingly limited supplies of fuel oil available to germany by this stage in war during this period her armament was revised several times in 1943 a pair of twin anti aircraft guns were installed one on each side of her bridge in early 1944 her anti aircraft armament was strengthened considerably with addition of two 40 mm guns and twenty guns these were in two flakvierling quadruple and six twin mounts further enhancements were made later in year including with installation of four heavy 10 5 cm anti aircraft guns in place of old 8 8 cm guns atop her after superstructure and two more of guns abreast her bridge these taking place of 37 mm guns which were removed light anti aircraft battery increased to seven or ten 40 mm guns in single and double mounts and eighteen or twenty two 20 mm guns in double and quadruple mounts sources differ on exact number of guns schlesien was also equipped with a fumo 25 search radar and a fumb 6 radar detection set both of which were installed on foremast she was moved from danzig to gotenhafen and then to sopot from 15 to 21 march 1945 to provide gunfire support to german forces in area she was then used to carry more than 1 000 wounded soldiers from sopot to swinemunde where she also restocked her ammunition she then remained in port to shell advancing soviet 2nd shock army on 2 may she was ordered to protect bridge that connected wolgast and island of early on morning of 3 may while steaming south of greifswalder oie she struck a british air dropped naval mine explosion killed two men and caused significant flooding she was taken under tow by destroyer back to swinemunde where her anti aircraft guns could be used to help defend city crew scuttled ship there in shallow water so she could not be sunk by air attack and risk capsizing between 1949 and 1956 wreck was demolished and then scrapped in situ by an east german company some remains from ship were still visible in 1970 footnotes notes citations references further reading external
