is sometimes considered to be an israelite version of popular near eastern folk hero also embodied by sumerian enkidu and greek heracles biblical account states that samson was a nazirite and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of philistines using only jawbone of a donkey however if samson s long hair were cut then his nazirite vow would be violated and he would lose his strength samson was betrayed by his lover delilah who ordered a servant to cut his hair while he was sleeping and turned him over to his philistine enemies who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at gaza whilst there his hair began to regrow when philistines took samson into their temple of dagon samson asked to rest against one of support pillars after being granted permission he prayed to god and miraculously recovered his strength allowing him to grasp hold of columns and tear them down killing himself and all philistines with him in some jewish traditions samson is believed to have been buried in tel tzora in israel overlooking sorek valley samson has been subject of both rabbinic and christian commentary with some christians viewing him as a type of jesus based on similarities between their lives notable depictions of samson include john milton s closet drama samson agonistes and cecil b demille s 1949 hollywood film samson and delilah samson also plays a major role in western art and traditions biblical narrative birth thumb left upright 1 sacrifice of manoah 1640 1650 by eustache le sueur according to account in book of judges samson lived during a time of repeated conflict between israel and philistia when god was disciplining israelites by giving them into hand of philistines manoah was an israelite from zorah descended from and his wife had been unable to conceive angel of lord appeared to manoah s wife and proclaimed that couple would soon have a son who would begin to deliver israelites from philistines angel of lord stated that manoah s wife was to abstain from all alcoholic drinks and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair he was to be a nazirite from birth in ancient israel those wanting to be especially dedicated to god for a time could take a nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits not cutting hair or shaving and other requirements manoah s wife believed angel of lord her husband was not present so he prayed and asked god to send messenger once again to teach them how to raise boy who was going to be born after angel of lord returned manoah asked him his name but he said why do you ask my name it is beyond understanding judges 13 18 manoah then prepared a sacrifice but angel of lord would only allow it to be for god he touched it with his staff miraculously engulfing it in flames and then ascended into sky in fire this was such dramatic evidence of nature of messenger that manoah feared for his life since it was said that no one could live after seeing god however his wife convinced him that if god planned to slay them he would never have revealed such things to them in due time their son samson was born and he was raised according to angel s instructions marriage to a philistine when he was a young adult samson left hills of his people to see cities of philistia he fell in love with a philistine woman from timnah whom he decided to marry ignoring objections of his parents over fact that she was non israelite in development of narrative intended marriage was shown to be part of god s plan to strike at philistines according to biblical account samson was repeatedly seized by spirit of lord who blessed him with immense strength first instance of this is seen when samson was on his way to ask for philistine woman s hand in marriage when he was attacked by a lion he simply grabbed it and ripped it apart as spirit of god divinely empowered him however samson kept it a secret not even mentioning miracle to his parents judges 14 6 he arrived at philistine s house and became betrothed to her he returned home then came back to timnah some time later for wedding on his way samson saw that bees had nested in carcass of lion and made honey he ate a handful of honey and gave some to his parents at wedding feast samson told a riddle to his thirty groomsmen all philistines if they could solve it he would give them thirty pieces of fine linen and garments but if they could not solve it they would give him thirty pieces of fine linen and garments riddle was a veiled account of two encounters with lion at which only he was present out of eater came something to eat out of strong came something sweet philistines were infuriated by riddle thirty groomsmen told samson s new wife that they would burn her and her father s household if she did not discover answer to riddle and tell it to them at urgent and tearful imploring of his bride samson told her solution and she told it to thirty groomsmen thumb right upright 1 2 samson slays a thousand men with jawbone of a donkey c 1896 1902 by james tissot before sunset on seventh day they said to him what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion samson said to them if you had not plowed with my heifer you would not have solved my riddle samson then traveled to ashkelon a distance of roughly 30 miles where he slew thirty philistines for their garments he then returned and gave those garments to his thirty groomsmen in a rage samson returned to his father s house family of his would have been bride instead gave her to one of groomsmen as wife some time later samson returned to timnah to visit his wife unaware that she was now married to one of his former groomsmen but her father refused to allow samson to see her offering to give samson a younger sister instead samson went out gathered 300 foxes and tied them together in pairs by their tails he then attached a burning torch to each pair of foxes tails and turned them loose in grain fields and olive groves of philistines philistines learned why samson burned their crops and burned samson s wife and father in law to death in retribution in revenge samson slaughtered many more philistines saying i have done to them what they did to me samson then took refuge in a cave in rock of etam an army of philistines came to tribe of judah and demanded that 3 000 men of judah deliver them samson with samson s consent given on condition that would not kill him themselves they tied him with two new ropes and were about to hand him over to philistines when he broke free of ropes using jawbone of a donkey he slew 1 000 philistines delilah thumb left upright 1 3 samson and delilah 1887 by jose later samson travels to gaza where he stays at a harlot s house his enemies wait at gate of city to ambush him but he tears gate from its very hinges and frame and carries it to hill that is in front of hebron he then falls in love with delilah in valley of sorek philistines approach delilah and induce her with 1 100 silver coins to find secret of samson s strength so that they can capture their enemy but samson refuses to reveal secret and teases her telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings she does so while he sleeps but when he wakes up he snaps strings she persists and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes she ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps and he snaps them too she asks again and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver s loom she weaves them into a loom but he simply destroys entire loom and carries it off when he wakes delilah however persists and samson finally and tells delilah that god supplies his power because of his consecration to god as a nazirite symbolized by fact that a razor has never touched his head and that if his hair is cut off he will lose his strength judges 16 16 16 esv delilah then woos him to sleep in her lap and calls for a servant to cut his hair samson loses his strength and he is captured by philistines who blind him by gouging out his eyes they then take him to gaza imprison him and put him to work turning a large millstone and grinding grain death one day philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice to dagon one of their most important deities for having delivered samson into their hands they summon samson so that people can watch him perform for them temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto roof to watch and all rulers of entire government of philistia have gathered there too some 3 000 people in all judges 16 27 samson is led into temple and he asks his captors to let him lean against supporting pillars to rest however whilst in prison his hair had begun to grow again he prays for strength and god gives him strength to break pillars causing temple to collapse killing him and people inside jps 1917 after his death samson s family recovered his body from rubble and buried him near tomb of his father manoah a tomb structure which some attribute to samson and his father stands on top of mountain in tel tzora at conclusion of judges 16 it is said that samson had judged israel for twenty years bible does not mention fate of delilah interpretations rabbinic literature thumb right blinded samson 1912 by corinth rabbinic literature identifies samson with bedan a judge mentioned by samuel in his farewell address among judges who delivered israel from their enemies however name bedan is not found in book of judges quick search bedan name samson is derived from hebrew word which means sun so that samson bore name of god who is called a sun and shield in and as god protected israel so did samson watch over it in his generation judging people even as did god samson s strength was divinely derived talmud tractate sotah 10a midrash genesis rabbah xcviii 18 jewish legend records that samson s shoulders were sixty cubits broad many talmudic commentaries however explain that this is not to be taken literally for a person that size could not live normally in society rather it means that he had ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide approximately 30 meters on his shoulders ben yehoyada and in commentary to talmud tractate sotah 10a he was lame in both feet talmud tractate sotah 10a but when spirit of god came upon him he could step with one stride from zorah to while hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance midrash leviticus rabbah viii 2 samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two clods of earth ibid sotah 9b yet his superhuman strength like goliath s brought woe upon its possessor midrash eccl rabbah i end in licentiousness he is compared with amnon and zimri both of whom were punished for their sins leviticus rabbah xxiii 9 samson s eyes were put out because he had followed them too often sotah l c it is said that in twenty years during which samson judged israel he never required least service from an israelite midrash numbers rabbah ix 25 and he piously refrained from taking name of god in vain therefore as soon as he told delilah that he was a of god she immediately knew that he had spoken truth when he pulled down temple of dagon and killed himself and philistines structure fell backward so that he was not crushed his family being thus enabled to find his body and to bury it in tomb of his father midrash genesis rabbah l c ss 19 in talmudic period some seem to have denied that samson was a historical figure regarding him instead as a purely mythological personage this was viewed as heretical by rabbis of talmud and they attempted to refute this they named as his mother in numbers rabbah naso 10 and in bava batra 91a and stated that he had a sister named or christian interpretations thumb samson in treadmill 1863 by carl bloch samson s story has also garnered commentary from a christian perspective epistle to hebrews praises him for his faith ambrose following portrayal of josephus and pseudo philo represents delilah as a philistine prostitute and declares that men should avoid marriage with those outside faith lest instead of love of one s spouse there be treachery of arles interpreted samson s death as prefiguring crucifixion of jesus remarking notice here an image of cross samson extends his hands spread out to two columns as to two beams of cross he also equates delilah with satan who tempted christ following this trend more recent christian commentators have viewed samson as a type of jesus christ based on similarities between samson s story and life of jesus in new testament samson s and jesus births were both foretold by angels who predicted that they would save their people samson was born to a barren woman and jesus was born of a virgin samson defeated a lion jesus defeated satan whom first epistle of peter describes as a roaring lion looking for someone to devour samson s betrayal by delilah has also been compared to jesus betrayal by judas iscariot both delilah and judas were paid in pieces of silver for their respective deeds ebenezer cobham brewer notes in his a guide to scripture history old testament that samson was blinded insulted and enslaved prior to his death and that jesus was blindfolded insulted and treated as a slave prior to his crucifixion brewer also compares samson s death among wicked with christ being crucified between two thieves scholarly thumb upright 1 3 left samson slaying lion 1628 by peter paul rubens academics have interpreted samson as a demigod such as heracles or enkidu enfolded into jewish folklore or as an archetypical folk hero in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries some comparative interpreted samson as a euhemerized solar deity charles fox burney book of judges with introduction and notes london rivingtons 1918 graves robert 1955 greek myths cf herakles arguing that samson s name is derived from meaning sun and that his long hair might represent sun s rays these solar theorists also pointed out that legend of samson is set within general vicinity of beth shemesh a village whose name means temple of sun they argued that name delilah may have been a wordplay with hebrew word for night layla which consumes day although this hypothesis is still sometimes promoted in scholarly circles it has generally fallen out of favor due to superficiality of supporting evidence an interpretation far more popular among current scholars holds that samson is a hebrew variant of same international near eastern folk hero which inspired earlier mesopotamian enkidu and later greek heracles and by extension his roman hercules adaptation heracles and samson both slew a lion bare handed former killed nemean lion likewise they were both believed to have once been extremely thirsty and drunk water which poured out from a rock and to have torn down gates of a city they were both betrayed by a woman heracles by deianira samson by delilah who led them to their respective dooms both heroes champions of their respective peoples die by their own hands heracles ends his life on a pyre whereas samson makes philistine temple collapse upon himself and his enemies in this interpretation annunciation of samson s birth to his mother is a censored account of divine conception samson also strongly resembles another hero mentioned in book of judges who in is described as having slain 600 philistines with an ox goad thumb right 300px a monument of samson in poland these views are disputed by traditional and conservative biblical scholars who consider samson to be a literal historical figure and thus reject any connections to mythological heroes concept of samson as a solar hero has been described as an artificial ingenuity joan co author of who s who in bible old testament and apocrypha new testament believes that biblical story of samson is so specific concerning time and place that samson was undoubtedly a real person who pitted his great strength against oppressors of israel in contrast james king west considers that hostilities between philistines and hebrews appear to be of a purely personal and local sort he also considers that samson stories have in contrast to much of judges an almost total lack of a religious or moral tone conversely elon gilad of haaretz writes some biblical stories are flat out cautions against marrying foreign women none more than story of samson gilad notes how samson s parents disapprove of his desire to marry a philistine woman and how samson s relationship with delilah leads to his demise he contrasts this with what he sees as a more positive portrayal of intermarriage in book of ruth in august 2012 archaeologists from tel aviv university announced discovery of a circular stone seal approximately in diameter which was found on floor of a house at beth shemesh and appears to depict a long haired man slaying a lion seal is dated to 12th century bce according to haaretz excavation directors prof shlomo and dr zvi lederman of tel aviv university say they do not suggest that human figure on seal is biblical samson rather geographical proximity to area where samson lived and time period of seal show that a story was being told at time of a hero who fought a lion and that story eventually found its way into biblical text and onto seal cultural influence thumb alleged site of
