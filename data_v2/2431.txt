thumb signature pedro alvares cabral or ne pedro alvares de gouveia c 1467 or 1468 c 1520 was a portuguese nobleman military commander navigator and explorer regarded as european discoverer of brazil in 1500 cabral conducted first substantial exploration of northeast coast of south america and claimed it for portugal while details of cabral s early life remain unclear it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education he was appointed to head an expedition to india in 1500 following vasco da gama s newly opened route around africa undertaking had aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in india bypassing monopoly on spice trade then in hands of arab turkish and italian merchants although previous expedition of vasco da gama to india on its sea route had recorded signs of land west of southern atlantic ocean in 1497 cabral led first known expedition to have touched four continents europe africa america and asia see his fleet of 13 ships sailed far into western atlantic ocean perhaps intentionally and made landfall april 1500 on what he initially assumed to be a large island as new land was within portuguese sphere according to 1494 treaty of tordesillas cabral claimed it for portuguese crown he explored coast realizing that large land mass was probably a continent and dispatched a ship to notify king manuel i of new territory continent was south america and land he had claimed for portugal later came to be known as brazil fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume journey to india a storm in southern atlantic caused loss of several ships and six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in mozambique channel before proceeding to calicut in india cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights but arab merchants saw portugal s venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both muslims and hindus on portuguese entrepot portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed cabral took vengeance by looting and burning arab fleet and then bombarded city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain unexpected attack from calicut expedition sailed to kingdom of cochin another indian city state where cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to europe despite loss of human lives and ships cabral s voyage was deemed a success upon his return to portugal extraordinary profits resulting from sale of spices bolstered portuguese crown s finances and helped lay foundation of a portuguese empire that would stretch from americas to far east cabral was later passed over possibly as a result of a quarrel with manuel i when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in india having lost favor with king he retired to a private life of which few records survive his accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years decades after brazil s independence from portugal in 19th century cabral s reputation began to be rehabilitated by emperor pedro ii of brazil historians have long argued whether cabral was brazil s discoverer and whether discovery was accidental or intentional first question has been settled by observation that few cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at time and contributed nothing to future development and history of land which would become brazil sole portuguese speaking nation in americas on second question no definite consensus has been formed and intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof nevertheless although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers historians consider cabral to be a major figure of age of discovery early life thumb 200px alt shield from coat of arms of pedro alvares cabral s coat of arms of cabral s family little is certain regarding pedro alvares cabral s life before or following his voyage which led to discovery of brazil he was born in 1467 or 1468 former year being most likely at belmonte about from present day in central portugal see he was a son of fernao alvares cabral and isabel gouveia one of five boys and six girls in family see cabral was christened pedro alvares de gouveia and only later supposedly upon his elder brother s death in 1503 see did he begin using his father s surname coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver purple represented fidelity and goats were derived from family name cabral pertains to goats in english however only his elder brother was entitled to make use of family arms family lore said that cabrais were descendants of caranus legendary first king of macedonia caranus was in turn a supposed 7th generation scion of demigod hercules myths aside historian james mcclymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to true origin of cabral s family according to that tradition cabrais derive from a castilian clan named cabra is spanish for goat who bore a similar coat of arms cabral family rose to prominence during 14th century alvaro gil cabral cabral s great great grandfather and a frontier military commander was one of few portuguese nobles to remain loyal to dom joao i king of portugal during war against king of castile as a reward joao i presented alvaro gil with hereditary fiefdom of belmonte see thumb left alt photograph of a silver colored 1968 coin with a profile of a bearded man on obverse and a coat of arms on reverse portuguese coin celebrating 500th anniversary of cabral s birth raised as a member of lower nobility cabral was sent to court of king dom afonso v in 1479 at around age 12 he received an education in humanities and learned to bear arms and fight he would have been roughly age 17 on 30 june 1484 when he was named moco fidalgo young nobleman a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles by king dom joao ii records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary but cabral may have campaigned in north africa as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day see king dom manuel i who had acceded to throne two years previously awarded him an annual allowance worth 30 000 reais on 12 april 1497 he was concurrently given title fidalgo nobleman in king s council and was named a knight of order of christ there is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of cabral it is known that he had a strong build and matched his father s height of see cabral s character has been described as well learned courteous prudent generous tolerant with enemies humble but also vain and too concerned with respect he felt his honor and position demanded discovery of brazil fleet commander in chief thumb 400px

in blue on 15 february 1500 cabral was appointed mor literally major captain or commander in chief of a fleet sailing for india see it was then custom for portuguese crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands regardless of experience or professional competence this was case for captains of ships under cabral s command most were nobles like himself practice had obvious pitfalls since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as afonso de albuquerque or dom joao de castro scant details have survived regarding criteria used by portuguese government in its selection of cabral as head of india expedition in royal decree naming him commander in chief only reasons given are merits and services nothing more is known about these qualifications historian william greenlee argued that king manuel i had undoubtedly known him well at court that along with standing of cabral family their unquestioned loyalty to crown personal appearance of cabral and ability which he had shown at court and in council were important factors also in his favor may have been influence of two of his brothers who sat on king s council given political intrigue present at court cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment historian malyn newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that choice of cabral was a deliberate attempt to balance interests of rival factions of noble families for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions cabral became military chief while far more experienced navigators were seconded to expedition to aid him in naval matters most important of these were bartolomeu dias diogo dias and nicolau coelho see they would along with other captains command 13 and 1 500 men see of this contingent 700 were soldiers although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat fleet had two divisions first division was composed of nine naus carracks and two round and was headed to calicut today more often known as kozhikode in india with goal of establishing trade relations and a factory trading post second division consisting of one nau and one round caravel set sail for port of sofala in what is today mozambique in exchange for leading fleet cabral was entitled to 10 000 an old portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35 kg of gold and right to purchase of pepper at his own expense for transport back to europe pepper could then be resold tax free to portuguese crown he was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice duty free although voyage was extremely hazardous cabral had prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to portugal with cargo spices were then rare in europe and keenly sought after an earlier fleet had been first to reach india by circumnavigating africa that expedition had been led by vasco da gama and returned to portugal in 1499 for decades portugal had been searching for an alternate route to east in order to bypass mediterranean sea which was under control of italian maritime republics and ottoman empire portugal s expansionism would lead first to a route to india and later to worldwide colonization a desire to spread catholic christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration there also was a long tradition of pushing back muslims which stemmed from portugal s fight for nationhood against moors fight expanded first to north africa and eventually to indian subcontinent an additional ambition which galvanized explorers was search for mythical prester john a powerful christian king with whom an alliance against islam could be forged finally portuguese crown sought a share in lucrative west african trade in slaves and gold and india s spice trade departure and arrival in a new land thumb 250px left alt a painting depicting

curious and friendly natives appeared cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a christian mass was held first celebrated on soil of what would later become brazil he along with ships crews participated following days were spent stockpiling water food wood and other provisions portuguese also built a massive perhaps long wooden cross cabral ascertained that new land lay east of demarcation line between portugal and spain that had been specified in treaty of tordesillas territory was thus within sphere allotted to portugal to portugal s claim to land wooden cross was erected

fleet resumed its voyage on either 2 or 3 may 1500 and sailed along east coast of south america cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent rather than an island around 5 may fleet veered eastwards towards africa on 23 or 24 may they encountered a storm in south atlantic s high pressure zone resulting in loss of four ships exact location of disaster is unknown speculations range from near cape of good hope at southern tip of african continent to within sight of south american coast three naus and a caravel commanded by bartolomeu dias first european to reach cape of good hope in 1488 foundered and 380 men were lost remaining vessels hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging were separated one ship that had been separated commanded by diogo dias wandered onward alone and other six ships were able to regroup they gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each and cabral s group sailed east past cape of good hope fixing their position and sighting land they turned north and landed somewhere in and archipelago off east africa and north of sofala main fleet remained near sofala ten days undergoing repairs expedition then went north and on 26 may reached kilwa kisiwani where cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king from kilwa kisiwani fleet departed to malindi which was reached on 2 august cabral met with its king with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts pilots were recruited at malindi for last leg to india and fleet set sail land was reached at anjadip an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to calicut here ships were beached recaulked and painted final arrangements were put into place for encounter with ruler of calicut see massacre in calicut fleet departed anjadip and arrived in calicut on 13 september see cabral successfully negotiated with zamorin title of ruler of calicut and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse in hopes of further improving relations cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at zamorin s request however on 16 or 17 december factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 according to other accounts perhaps as many as several thousand muslim arabs and hindu indians despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen more than 50 portuguese were killed remaining defenders retreated to ships some by swimming thinking that attack was result of unauthorized incitement by jealous arab merchants cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from ruler of calicut but no apology was forthcoming see portuguese were outraged by attack on factory and death of their comrades and seized 10 arab merchant ships at anchor in harbor around 600 of their crews were killed and cargoes confiscated before merchantmen were set afire cabral also ordered his ships to bombard calicut for an entire day in reprisal for violation of agreement massacre was blamed in part on portuguese animosity towards muslims which had developed over centuries of conflict with moors on iberian peninsula and in north africa moreover portuguese were determined to dominate spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish arabs also had no desire to allow portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of trade letter from king manuel i brought by cabral to ruler of calicut which was translated by ruler s arab interpreters sought exclusion of arab traders muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods and attempted to sway hindu ruler against portuguese portuguese and arabs were extremely suspicious of each other s every action thumb alt an illustration from an old map which shows a wooden sailing vessel with a square rigged foresail a square rigged main mast with main and topsail and a lateen sail aft over a very high stern nau carrack was a type of vessel that was larger than a caravel but smaller than later galleon they were used in voyages of christopher columbus vasco da gama and cabral historian william greenlee has argued that portuguese realized that they were few in numbers and that those who would come to india in future fleets would always be at numerical disadvantage so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that portuguese would be feared and respected in future it was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end thus they created a precedent for european behavior in asia during following centuries return to europe warnings in reports from vasco da gama s voyage to india had prompted king manuel i to brief cabral regarding another port to south of calicut where he could also trade this city was kochi and fleet set sail reaching it on 24 december kochi was nominally a vassal of calicut as well as being dominated by other indian cities kochi was eager to achieve independence and portuguese were willing to exploit indian disunity as british would three hundred years later this tactic eventually ensured portuguese hegemony over region cabral forged an alliance with kochi s ruler as well with rulers of other indian cities and was able to establish a factory at last loaded with precious spices fleet went to for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to portugal on 16 january 1501 see expedition headed for east coast of africa one of ships became stranded on a sandbar and vessel began to founder as there was no space in other ships its cargo was lost and cabral ordered carrack to be set on fire see fleet then proceeded to island of mozambique northeast of sofala in order to take on provisions and make ships ready for rough passage around cape of good hope one caravel was sent to sofala another of expedition s goals a second caravel considered fastest ship in fleet and captained by nicolau coelho was sent ahead to give king advance notice of voyage s success a third vessel commanded by pedro de ataide became separated from fleet after leaving mozambique on 22 may fleet now reduced to only two ships rounded cape of good hope they arrived in beseguiche now dakar located near cape verde on 2 june there they found not only nicolau coelho s caravel but also nau captained by diogo dias which had been lost for over a year following disaster in south atlantic nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades another portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in beseguiche after manuel i had been told of discovery of what is now brazil he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it one of its navigators was amerigo vespucci for whom americas would be named who told cabral of his exploration confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island nicolau coelho s caravel departed first from beseguiche and arrived in portugal on 23 june 1501 cabral stayed behind waiting for pedro de ataide s missing ship and for caravel that had been sent to sofala both eventually appeared and cabral arrived in portugal on 21 july 1501 with other vessels coming home during following days in all two ships returned empty five were fully loaded and six were lost nonetheless cargoes carried by fleet returned up to 800 profit to portuguese crown once sold proceeds covered outlay in equipping fleet covered cost of vessels which had been lost and cleared a profit which itself exceeded total sum of those costs undeterred by unprecedented losses which he had sustained asserts historian james mcclymont when cabral reached east african coast pressed forward to accomplishment of task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire surviving officers and men with like courage few voyages to brazil and india were so well executed as cabral s affirmed historian bailey diffie which laid down a path leading to immediate commencement of a portuguese seagoing empire from africa to far east and eventually to a land empire in brazil later years and death thumb alt photograph of a small chapel in which a roped off inscribed stone slab is set into floor and with a stone altar in background on which are a wreath and a large metal cross cabral s tomb in santarem portugal upon cabral s return king manuel i began planning another fleet to make journey to india and to avenge portuguese losses in calicut cabral was selected to command this revenge fleet as it was called for eight months cabral made all preparations but for reasons which remain uncertain he was relieved of command it had apparently been proposed to give another navigator vicente sodre independent command over a section of fleet and cabral strongly opposed this see whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command result was that when fleet departed in march 1502 its commander was vasco da gama a maternal nephew of vicente sodre and not cabral see it is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da gama and another supporting cabral at some point cabral left court permanently king was greatly irritated by feud to such an extent that mentioning matter in his presence could result in banishment as it did for one of da gama s supporters despite loss of favor with manuel i cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to dona lady isabel de castro a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of king dom fernando i of portugal her mother was a sister of afonso de albuquerque one of greatest portuguese military leaders during age of discovery see couple had at least four children two boys fernao alvares cabral and antonio cabral and two girls catarina de castro and guiomar de castro there were two additional daughters named isabel and leonor according to other sources which also say that guiomar isabel and leonor joined religious orders afonso de albuquerque attempted to intercede on cabral s behalf and on 2 december 1514 asked manuel i to forgive him and allow his return to court but to no avail see suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor possibly malaria since his voyage cabral withdrew to santarem in 1509 he spent his remaining years there only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time according to a royal letter dated 17 december 1509 cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service in 1518 or perhaps previously he was raised from fidalgo to knight in king s council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2 437 reais see this was in addition to annual allowance granted to him in 1497 and still being paid cabral died of unspecified causes most probably in 1520 he was buried in sao joao evangelista chapel of da graca in santarem see legacy posthumous

portuguese settlement in land which would become brazil was sao vicente which was established in 1532 by martim afonso de sousa as years passed portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward conquering more lands from both indigenous americans and spanish brazil had secured most of its present day borders by 1750 and was regarded by portugal as most important part of its far flung maritime empire on 7 september 1822 heir of portuguese king dom joao vi secured independence of brazil from portugal and as dom pedro i became its first emperor cabral s discovery and even his resting place in land of his birth had been almost completely forgotten during span of nearly 300 years since his expedition this began to change beginning in 1840s when emperor dom pedro ii successor and son of pedro i sponsored research and publications dealing with cabral s life and expedition through brazilian historic and geographic institute this was part of emperor s ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among brazil s diverse citizenry giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique portuguese speaking empire surrounded by hispanic american republics initial resurgence of interest in cabral had resulted from rediscovery in 1839 of his resting place by brazilian historian francisco adolfo de varnhagen later viscount of porto seguro completely neglected state in which cabral s tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between brazil and portugal latter then ruled by pedro ii s eldest sister maria ii in 1871 brazilian emperor then on a trip to europe visited cabral s gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study which was carried out in 1882 in a second exhumation during 1896 an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed although his remains still lay in portugal urn was eventually brought to old cathedral of rio de janeiro in brazil on 30 december 1903 cabral has since become a national hero in brazil in portugal however he has been much overshadowed by his rival vasco da gama historian william greenlee argued that cabral s exploration is important not only because of its position in history of geography but because of its influence on history and economics of period though he acknowledges that few voyages have been of greater importance to posterity he also says that few have been less appreciated in their time nevertheless historian james mcclymont affirmed that cabral s position in history of portuguese conquest and discovery is despite supremacy of greater or more fortunate men he concluded that cabral will always be remembered in history as chief if not first discoverer of brazil intentional discovery hypothesis thumb upright alt a photograph of a park in

lisbon thumb 170px monument to cabral brazil a controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether cabral s discovery was by chance or intentional if latter that would mean that portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to west matter was first raised by emperor pedro ii in 1854 during a session of brazilian historic and geographic institute when he asked if discovery might have been intentional until 1854 conference widespread presumption was that discovery had been an accident early works on subject supported this view including historia do e conquista da india history of discovery and conquest of india published in 1541 by fernao lopes de decadas da asia decades of asia 1552 by joao de barros do rei d manuel chronicles of most fortunate d manuel

by sebastiao da rocha pita first work to advocate idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by joaquim de sousa e silva after pedro ii had opened debate since then several scholars have subscribed to that view including francisco adolfo de varnhagen capistrano de abreu pedro calmon fabio ramos and mario barata historian helio vianna affirmed that although there are signs of intentionality in cabral s discovery based mainly in knowledge or previous suspicion of existence of lands at edge of south atlantic there are no irrefutable proofs to support it this opinion is also shared by historian thomas skidmore debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered irrelevant by historian charles r boxer historian anthony smith concludes that conflicting contentions will probably never be resolved forerunners thumb left alt an old hand drawn map with a large compass rose on right side and a coastline drawn on left side with writing occupying center map of juan de la cosa dated 1500 mentions travel to northern brazil by vicente yanez pinzon cabral was not first european to stumble upon areas of present day brazil not to mention other parts of south america roman coins have been found in today s venezuela northwest of brazil presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times norsemen reached north america and even established settlements though these ended in failure sometime before end of 15th century christopher columbus on his third voyage to new world in 1498 traveled along part of what would later become venezuela in case of brazil it was once considered probable that portuguese navigator duarte pacheco pereira had made a voyage to brazilian coast in 1498 this belief has since been dismissed however and it is now thought that he voyaged to north america instead see there is more certain evidence that two spaniards vicente yanez pinzon and diego de lepe traveled along northern coast of brazil between january and march 1500 pinzon went from what is today cabo de santo agostinho brazilian state of pernambuco to mouth of amazon river there he encountered another spanish expedition led by lepe which would reach as far as river in march reason cabral is credited with having discovered brazil rather than spanish explorers is because visits by pinzon and lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact historians capistrano de abreu francisco adolfo de varnhagen mario barata and helio vianna concur that spanish expeditions did not influence development of what would become only portuguese
