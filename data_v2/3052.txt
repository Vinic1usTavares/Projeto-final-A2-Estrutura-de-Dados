dragon s egg is a 1980 hard science fiction novel by robert l forward in story dragon s egg is a neutron star with a surface gravity 67 billion times that of earth and inhabited by cheela intelligent creatures size of a sesame seed who live think and develop a million times faster than humans most of novel from may to june 2050 chronicles cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face to face contact with humans who are observing hyper rapid evolution of cheela civilization from orbit around dragon s egg novel is regarded as a landmark in hard science fiction as is typical of genre dragon s egg attempts to communicate unfamiliar ideas and imaginative scenes while giving adequate attention to known scientific principles involved plot summary neutron star half a million years ago and 50 light years from earth a star in constellation draco turns supernova and star s remnant becomes a neutron star radiation from explosion causes mutations in many earth organisms including a group of that become ancestors of homo sapiens star s short lived plasma jets are lop sided because of anomalies in its magnetic field and set it on a course passing within 250 astronomical units of sun in 2020 ad human astronomers detect neutron star call it dragon s egg and in 2050 they send an expedition to explore it star contains about half of a solar mass of matter compressed into a diameter of about making its surface gravity 67 billion times that of earth its outer crust compressed to about 7 000 kg per cubic centimeter is mainly iron nuclei with a high concentration of neutrons overlaid with about of white dwarf star material atmosphere mostly iron vapor is about thick star shrinks slightly as it cools causes crust to crack and produce mountains high large volcanos formed by liquid material oozing from deep cracks can be many centimeters high and hundred meters in diameters and will eventually collapse causing forward dragon s egg technical pp 287 289 around 3000 bc dragon s egg cools enough to allow a stable equivalent of chemistry in which compounds are constructed of nuclei bound by strong force rather than of earth s atoms bound by electromagnetic force as star s chemical processes are about one million times faster than earth s self replicating molecules appear shortly and life begins on star as star continues to cool more complex life evolves until plant like organisms appear around 1000 bc one lineage of these later became first animals earliest of these stealing from sessile organisms and some later lineages becoming predators forward cheela physiology pp 292 296 adults of star s most intelligent species called cheela no flexion for gender or number have about same mass as an adult human however extreme gravity of dragon s egg compresses cheela to volume of a sesame seed but with a flattened shape about high and about in diameter their eyes are wide such

almost whole history of cheela civilization spans from 22 may 2050 to 21 june 2050 by humans standards a day on dragon s egg is about 0 2 seconds and a typical cheela s lifetime is about 40 minutes forward cheela time scales pp 298 299 one clan organizes first cheela agriculture which brings predictable food supply but provokes grumbling about repetitive work shortly after a volcano emerges in area and clan invents first sledge to carry food from more distant sources however within a few generations volcano pollutes soil one clan leads its population on a long arduous journey to new territory that is fertile and uninhabited although one genius invents mathematics to calculate and measure band s food supply situation is desperate and clan s survival depends on self sacrifice of oldest members over course of generations cheela come to worship humans spacecraft as a god and their records of its satellites movements cause them to develop writing several generations later cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers humans notice this novel and very regular feature conclude that intelligent beings inhabit star and use a laser to send simple messages cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of spaceships its satellites and its crew impossibly spindly creatures who communicate with frustrating slowness and are apparently almost 10 as long as cheela s great arena a cheela engineer proposes to send messages to humans as her attempts to transmit from civilization s territory are ineffective she travels to a mountain range to transmit directly under spacecraft conquering fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67 billion g humans recognize her message and realize that cheela live a million times faster than humans since real time conversations are impossible humans send sections of expedition s library after reading an astronomy article a cheela realizes that supernova half a million human years ago created both their races many cheela generations later but only a few hours for humans develop gravity manipulation a few generations later a cheela spacecraft visits human one although they still need extreme gravity fields to survive cheela can now control them precisely enough for both races to see each other face to face in safety cheela have decided that transferring their technologies now far advanced of humans would stunt humanity s development however cheela leave clues in several challenging locations before going their separate ways plot introduction in dragon s egg forward describes history and development of a life form cheela that evolves on surface of a neutron star a highly dense collapsed star about 20 km in diameter this is dragon s egg of title so named because from earth it is observed to be near tail of constellation draco dragon cheela develop sentience and intelligence despite their relative small size an individual cheela has approximately volume of a sesame seed but mass of a human and an intense gravity field that restricts their movement in third dimension much of book concerns biologic and social development of cheela a subplot is arrival of a human vessel nearby neutron star and eventual contact that is made between humans and cheela a major problem in this contact is that cheela live a million times more quickly than humans do a cheela year goes by in about 30 human seconds humans arrive when cheela are a savage backward species fighting rival clans in a subsistence level society within a few human days equivalent of a few thousand cheela years cheela surpass humans in technology and humans are affectionately called slow ones forward wrote a sequel to dragon s egg called starquake which deals with consequences of cheela developing space travel and of a seismic disturbance that kills most of cheela on surface of neutron star development history writer robert l forward described being inspired by astronomer frank drake s suggestion in 1973 that intelligent life could inhabit neutron stars physical models in 1973 implied that drake s creatures would be microscopic by time forward was outlining book newer models indicated that cheela would be about size of sesame seeds later forward found an earlier letter in which he discussed idea of high gravity life in sun with science fiction novelist hal clement forward was scientist and larry niven author in a tutorial on science fiction writing and later that evening forward and niven agreed to collaborate on a novel on aliens on a neutron star however niven soon found himself too busy with lucifer s hammer on which he was already co writing with jerry pournelle forward wrote first draft himself but several publishers suggested story should be rewritten by niven or pournelle who were still busy finally editor lester del rey provided comments that guided forward through two rewrites and del rey then bought novel forward described work as a textbook on

campbell would have loved it frank herbert a gripping and logical account of evolution of intelligence in an alien race charles sheffield bob forward writes in tradition of hal clement s mission of gravity and carries it a giant step how else forward isaac asimov dragon s egg is superb i couldn t have written it it required too much real physics larry niven science fiction critic john clute wrote that novel generates a sense of wonder that is positively joyous saying it was a romance of science chris aylott described it as a minor classic of science fiction one that shows off both best and worst elements of hard sf ideas definitely come first he found writing of human cast dull but appreciated forward s ability to share his fascination with cheela and to create communications between races that lived at vastly different speeds lambourne shallis and shortland consider that research and detailed construction of scenario make dragon s egg an excellent example of hard science fiction scientist seth shostak described book s science as fanciful but impossible to dismiss john pierce also regarded dragon s egg as hard science fiction at its best while forward s later novel martian rainbow 1991 was genre at its worst both novels have cardboard human characters but this does not matter in dragon s egg where focus is on deeper personalities of cheela characters novel even makes readers care about fate of an unsympathetic cheela ruler whose rejuvenation treatment fails catastrophically pierce wrote that best works of this genre create a literary experience but one of an unusual kind instead of offering a metaphor for a reality reader already recognizes they create new realities in which reader is caught up robert lambourne regards forward especially in dragon s egg as successor of hal clement whose mission of gravity exemplifies most strongly science based science fiction in lambourne s opinion hard science fiction authors like clement forward and their successors have been relatively few but have strongly influenced both genre s evolution and public s perception of genre premise of novel was later explored in 2000 star trek voyager episode blink of an eye and 2017 season finale episode mad idolatry of orville with some changes to story for instance fast living organisms have been turned into a humanoid species awards and nominations dragon s egg won 1981 locus award for first novel and placed 14th in locus sf novel category sequel in 1985 forward published starquake a sequel to dragon s egg lambourne shallis and shortland consider starquake s scientific background as rigorous as dragon s egg s in this novel a starquake disrupts cheela civilization while humans aboard spacecraft dragon slayer deal with their own problems references
