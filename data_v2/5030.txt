were a pair of armored cruisers built for imperial japanese navy ijn in late 1890s as japan lacked industrial capacity to build such warships herself ships were built in britain they were part of six six fleet expansion program that began after defeat of china during first sino japanese war of 1894 95 between them sister ships participated in all four main naval battles of russo japanese war of 1904 05 battle of port arthur battle off ulsan battle of yellow sea and battle of tsushima but played a much more minor role in world war i asama ran aground while searching for german commerce raiders in early 1915 and was under repair for next two years tokiwa participated in battle of tsingtao and also searched for commerce raiders both ships made training cruises during war and continued to do so after war asama continued to make training cruises until she ran aground again in 1935 after which she became a stationary training ship for rest of her career tokiwa was converted into a minelayer in 1922 24 she was placed in reserve in 1927 after she was damaged by an accidental explosion of several mines ship became a training minelayer in 1940 during pacific war tokiwa participated in occupation of gilbert islands and rabaul and kavieng in new guinea damaged by american aircraft shortly afterwards ship was forced to return to japan for repairs tokiwa laid minefields during 1944

broken up for scrap asama survived war intact and was scrapped in 1946 47 background and design 1896 naval expansion plan was made after first sino japanese war of 1894 95 and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships all of which had to be ordered from foreign shipyards as japan lacked capability to build them itself further consideration of russian building program caused ijn to believe that battleships ordered under original plan would not be sufficient to counter imperial russian navy budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and ijn decided to expand number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships revised plan is commonly known as six six fleet evans peattie pp 57 62 these ships were purchased using ps30 000
