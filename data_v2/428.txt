trinidad and west indian first class cricketer mason p 3 a third family member constantine s brother elias later represented trinidad mason p 4 constantine wrote that although family was not wealthy his childhood was happy he spent a lot of time playing in hills near his home or on estates where his father and grandfather worked howat 1976 pp 26 27 mason p 2 he enjoyed cricket from an early age family regularly practised together under supervision of lebrun and victor pascall howat 1976 p 28 constantine first went to st ann s government school in port of spain then attended st ann s roman catholic school until 1917 mason p 5 he displayed little enthusiasm for learning and never reached a high academic standard but showed prowess at several sports and was respected for his cricketing lineage he played for school cricket team which he captained in his last two years howat 1976 pp 28 29 by which time he was developing a reputation as an attacking batsman a good fast medium bowler and an excellent fielder mason p 7 his father prohibited him from playing competitive club cricket until 1920 for fear of premature exposure to top class opposition while too young in addition he first wanted his son to establish a professional career howat 1976 pp 33 34 upon leaving school constantine joined jonathan ryan a firm of solicitors in port of spain as a clerk this was a possible route into legal profession however as a member of black lower middle class he was unlikely to progress far few black trinidadians at this time became solicitors and he faced many social restrictions owing to his colour howat 1976 pp 31 32 mason p 6 cricket career cricket in trinidad thumb a modern photograph of queen s park oval trinidad s home ground alt a cricket ground with mountains in background in 1916 before his father imposed a ban on competitive cricket constantine had played briefly for shannon cricket club he returned to club in 1920 initially he appeared in second team but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game was promoted to first eleven howat 1976 p 34 cricket in trinidad at time was divided along racial lines shannon was mainly for black lower middle class players such as teachers or clerks james p 50 club was competitive and highly motivated partly as a reaction to racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their daily lives constantine s cricket thrived in this atmosphere and club helped to form some of his political views mason pp 9 10 he particularly noticed that in trinidadian and west indian cricket white and light skinned players were often favoured over black players of greater ability mason p 10 constantine s reputation continued to grow howat 1976 p 35 an innings for shannon in 1921 against renowned fast bowler george john received great local publicity but according to cricket writer and social historian c l r james this was only time prior to 1928 that constantine played in such an effective way james p 104 constantine s father still a formidable player did not put himself forward for selection into trinidad team in 1921 in hope that his son would replace him white captain of trinidad team major bertie recognised younger constantine s promise and selected him to play in trinidad s inter colonial tournament match against british guiana unfortunately constantine arrived late after a newspaper advertised wrong starting time and did not play however he made his first class debut in following match final of tournament against barbados on 21 september 1921 he scored a duck in his first innings batting at number eight in batting order after taking two wickets at a cost of 44 runs in barbados only innings he scored 24 in his second innings batting at number three mason pp 10 11 constantine played for trinidad in next inter colonial tournament in british guiana in 1922 although in two games he scored only 45 runs and took four wickets commentators considered his fielding in covers to be exceptional and he retained his place in team largely as a fielder mason p 11 although trinidad lost to barbados in final barbados captain harold austin who was also captain of west indies team was impressed by constantine mason pp 11 12 mainly on strength of his fielding howat 1976 p 40 austin secured constantine s selection for 1923 west indian tour of england it was a surprising choice as there were other candidates who appeared to have stronger claims by this time constantine was working for llewellyn roberts a larger solicitors practice which paid better as his new employer s longer working hours restricted constantine s cricket practice when he was selected for west indies tour he resigned his position mason p 12 tour of england in 1923 thumb right constantine demonstrating his bowling technique 1923 west indies touring team played 21 first class matches in england of which six were won seven lost and others drawn team s relative success and particularly performance of leading batsman george challenor persuaded english critics that west indies cricket was stronger than previously supposed this was instrumental in promotion of team to test match status in 1928 mason p 13 challenor was biggest individual success of tour but constantine impressed english critics through his style of play more than his statistical achievements mason pp 13 14 he played 20 first class matches on tour scoring 425 runs at an average of 15 74 and taking 37 wickets at an average of 21 86 against oxford university he scored 77 his maiden first class fifty his only other half century came against derbyshire he also took five wickets in an innings for first time in match against kent wisden cricketers almanack recorded that his batting while highly unorthodox in technique could be very effective when he was in form wisden also noted that his bowling was fast several english players including jack hobbs singled out constantine as an unusually talented cricketer on strength of his performances in 1923 mason p 15 pelham warner a former england captain and influential journalist and administrator described constantine after tour as best fielder in world his fielding was also praised by press and in pages of wisden mason p 14 james later wrote he is a success but he has not set thames on fire and what is more he hasn t tried to mid 1920s career john arlott later commented that on his first tour of england constantine learnt much that he never forgot by no means all of it about cricket and he recognised game as his only possible ladder to kind of life he wanted when constantine returned to trinidad he had no permanent job and little prospect of advancement in any suitable profession he took several temporary jobs but was often forced to rely financially upon his family mason p 16 however his success had inspired him to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in england howat 1976 p 43 and he began to practise to reach required standard although he scored 167 for shannon in 1924 and took eight for 38 for trinidad against barbados constantine s cricket was steady but not consistently successful he was initially dropped from west indies team to face marylebone cricket club mcc touring team during 1926 though he was recalled for second match once again at insistence of austin who wanted a good cover fielder in team james p 105 in match constantine was involved in an incident over short pitched bowling mcc fast bowlers had bowled short at 49 year old austin in retaliation constantine bounced mcc captain freddie calthorpe and only stopped after james pointed out diplomatic row which would follow if calthorpe a respected figure in british establishment was hit by ball james pp 107 08 once more constantine s performances were not statistically exceptional but his style impressed critics and spectators mason pp 16 17 and he came top of west indies bowling averages howat 1976 p 45 a new permanent job with trinidad leaseholds allowed constantine to devote more time to cricket mason p 18 constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer he needed to improve his bowling lacked true speed and when batting he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous after his relative failure in 1926 he increased his level of practice improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling mason pp 20 21 in trial matches before 1928 tour of england constantine secured his place on tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63 mason pp 21 22 he left behind his wife norma whom he had married in 1927 and his newly born daughter mason p 19 tour of england in 1928 thumb right constantine in his west indies cap constantine s main objective on 1928 tour was to secure a contract to play cricket professionally in england mason p 22 james wrote that constantine had revolted against revolting contrast between his first class status as a cricketer and his third class status as a man restraints imposed upon him by social conditions in west indies had become intolerable and he decided to stand them no longer james p 106 according to james constantine would never have left trinidad had he been able to live with honour and a little profit james p 109 in tour s opening first class match against derbyshire constantine began his second innings when west indians needed 40 runs to win in seven scoring shots constantine hit 31 runs and took team to a two wicket victory mason p 24 in following match he scored his maiden first class century 130 in 90 minutes against essex howat 1976 p 50 as tour proceeded constantine continued his success middlesex game at lord s brought his name to widest notice in cricket circles howat 1976 p 51 although struggling for fitness he chose to play knowing that he was a star attraction in this high profile game mason pp 24 25 middlesex batted first and reached 352 before declaring innings closed constantine bowled little owing to his injury and west indies were struggling at 79 for five when constantine came in to bat he scored 50 in 18 minutes and reached 86 in under an hour to avert his side s follow on in middlesex s second innings constantine took seven for 57 in a spell of extremely fast bowling and county were dismissed for 136 west indies needed 259 to win they looked likely to lose when constantine returned to bat with score 121 for five he scored 103 in 60 minutes hitting two sixes and 12 fours and guiding west indies to a three wicket victory howat 1976 p 52 mason p 25 for players and spectators this was defining match of constantine s career mason p 27 many years later cricket writer e w swanton suggested that there were few all round performances in history of cricket to match it swanton p 70 shortly after game nelson a cricket club in lancashire league offered constantine a professional contract rest of constantine s 1928 tour was generally successful mason p 28 only in three test matches first played by west indies was he less effective although he took west indies first wicket in test cricket dismissing charlie hallows and finished with innings figures of four for 82 he took only one more wicket during remainder of series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52 40 with bat he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14 83 even so jack hobbs said that constantine s opening overs to him in first test were among fastest he ever faced constantine believed his captain karl nunes over bowled him pair did not get along well when tour ended constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first class games than any other tourist he was second in team s batting averages with 1 381 runs at 34 52 and led bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22 95 howat 1976 p 55 it was manner in which constantine played which set him apart from restrained form of cricket generally played in england at time his style aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on crowds according to peter mason in his biography of constantine he established a unique style of west indian cricket and possibly established template for west indian cricketers for years to come mason pp 28 29 series against england and australia thumb constantine during tour of australia in 1930 alt head and shoulders photograph of a man in a dark suit at end of 1928 tour constantine returned home and helped trinidad to win intercolonial tournament he took 16 wickets in two games and scored 133 in final against barbados highest score of his career and a record for trinidad at time mason p 30 howat 1976 p 56 these were his last matches in tournament as rules did not permit professional cricketers which he became when he signed for nelson to take part mason p 65 in 1929 constantine played one match in jamaica for a west indies team against an english touring team and then travelled to nelson to begin his professional career constantine returned to west indies to face england represented by mcc as was usual in those days in a four match test series early in 1930 howat 1976 pp 58 59 first test was drawn constantine scored few runs but bowled for a long time and fielded well after game he was awarded a bat for his contribution mason p 55 howat 1976 p 59 calthorpe mcc captain criticised his use of short pitched bowling to a leg side field howat 1976 p 60 one such ball struck andy sandham but constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a request from mcc manager frith pp 31 32 during second test constantine scored a rapid 58 and took six wickets but west indies lost by 167 runs in following match west indies recorded their first win in test matches after centuries from george headley and clifford roach constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure victory constantine was omitted from final match in jamaica because inter island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from island hosting test in series 29 players represented west indies and team had a different captain in each match howat 1976 pp 61 62 in three matches in which he played constantine scored 144 runs at 14 40 and took 18 wickets at 27 61 after his second season at nelson constantine joined first west indies team to tour australia in 1930 31 season side felt some trepidation over how black members of side would be received but tour passed off without incident constantine later praised reception team was accorded mason p 57 west indians were captained by jackie grant a white man who had played for cambridge university but was unfamiliar with his team constantine considered this unsatisfactory and felt it affected team s performances west indies were heavily defeated in five test series losing first four matches before winning last constantine achieved little in series scoring 72 runs at 7 20 and taking eight wickets at 50 87 in other first class games he was more successful and although headley performed very well it was constantine who proved most popular with spectators mason p 58 even before tests began his fielding drew praise from press and he was described in sydney mail as fastest bowler seen in australia for years monty noble a former australian captain writing in sydney sun described one innings of 59 runs as sensational and one of best played in australia since war howat 1976 p 64 constantine scored a century in 52 minutes against tasmania played five other innings over fifty and took three five wicket returns howat 1976 p 66 in 1950 donald bradman who played against constantine that season described him as greatest fielder he had seen howat 1976 pp 71 72 in all first class matches constantine scored 708 runs at an average of 30 78 and took 47 wickets at 20 21 he led team s bowling averages and came fourth in batting howat 1976 p 73 test series against england in 1933 and 1934 35 thumb right constantine practising his batting in nets by now living in nelson and barred from inter colonial tournament mason pp 41 42 constantine played no first class cricket for two years his contract with nelson made him unavailable for much of 1933 west indies tour of england under grant constantine never challenged nelson over this some critics suggested he was swayed by greater financial rewards club provided howat 1976 p 100 he appeared once for tourists in may scoring 57 in 27 minutes and taking four wickets in a victory over an mcc team at lord s mason p 59 west indian board unsuccessfully tried to secure his release for first test match which west indies lost heavily howat 1976 p 101 after he took nine wickets in tourists game against yorkshire nelson gave him permission to appear in second test at manchester during previous winter england had played australia in controversial bodyline series in which english bowlers were accused of bowling ball on line of leg stump deliveries were often short pitched with four or five fielders close by on leg side waiting to catch deflections off bat tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory douglas p 103 in 1933 english season bodyline was a sensitive subject mason pp 59 60 there had already been controversy in tourists match against mcc during which constantine and manny martindale another west indian fast bowler were criticised in press for bowling short frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers grant had ordered constantine to bowl bodyline against yorkshire and decided to repeat tactics in second test frith p 358 howat 1976 p 102 west indies scored 375 of which constantine made 31 when england replied several batsmen were discomfited by bodyline bowling wally hammond was struck on chin and retired hurt frith p 355 constantine and martindale bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that ball rose to head height occasionally they bowled around wicket frith p 357 although not as fast as he had been on previous tour constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling however slowness of pitch reduced effectiveness of bodyline tactics and constantine took one for 55 england s captain douglas jardine who had implemented bodyline tactics in australia batted for five hours to score his only test century frith pp 356 58 public disapproval expressed during and after match was instrumental in turning english attitudes against bodyline douglas pp 167 68 something constantine considered hypocritical in west indies second innings constantine s innings of 64 in an hour ensured that match was drawn howat 1976 p 104 nelson initially agreed to release him for third test with essex all rounder stan nichols to be constantine s substitute for club team when jardine heard he convinced england selectors to include nichols in england team for test deal collapsed and constantine did not play frith p 364 most critics believed that west indies underachieved in test series constantine believed that one cause was inadequacy of grant as captain in all first class games on tour constantine scored 181 runs at 20 11 and took 14 wickets at 22 14 constantine worked in india as a cricket coach during 1934 playing two matches in moin ud gold cup tournament mason pp 62 63 howat 1976 p 105 he was invited to play in 1935 test series against england in west indies and although he arrived too late for first test won by england he played in remaining three games of series mason p 63 in a match for trinidad before second test he and his brother elias appeared together for only time in a first class match and shared a partnership of 93 howat 1976 p 107 in next test constantine scored 90 his highest test score england needed 325 to win in fourth innings but lost early wickets howat 1976 p 108 in final stages of match constantine was warned by umpire for bowling bodyline and grant withdrew him from bowling attack after crowd protested constantine returned to bowl with two balls of match left he took final english wicket mason pp 63 64 west indies won by 217 runs with constantine taking three for 11 in match as a whole he scored 121 runs and took five wickets third test was drawn leaving final test to decide series after making a large total west indies bowled england out twice to win by an innings and record their first test series victory as well as taking six wickets in game constantine captained team to victory after grant injured an ankle on last morning and asked constantine to assume leadership howat 1976 pp 109 10 peter mason writes given measures that west indian authorities had taken to ensure that no black man would ever captain a regional side it was a great irony and a huge source of delight to constantine that he should be man to lead team at moment of their greatest achievement so far mason p 64 once more press praised constantine and hailed his achievements howat 1976 p 110 in series he scored 169 runs at an average of 33 80 and took 15 wickets at 13 13 tour of england in 1939 thumb constantine bowling in 1930 alt a cricketer bowling apart from one guest appearance for barbados in a friendly match early in 1939 constantine did not play first class cricket after 1935 until west indies toured england in 1939 constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939 to be available for tour however he was unhappy with playing strength of touring team and ps600 he was offered in wages howat 1976 p 111 he believed that captain rolph grant younger brother of jackie was unqualified for job and had been appointed only because he was white constantine captained side in one match but was reprimanded by west indies board for not pursuing a win mason p 145 west indies lost three match test series 1 0 against a very strong england side although critics judged overall playing record of team to be good in three tests constantine scored 110 runs at 27 50 and took 11 wickets at 29 81 including five for 75 in final test by this time constantine bowled generally at medium pace from a short run up to compensate for his reduced pace he mixed up his bowling style spinning ball and bowling at speeds varying from slow to very fast he bowled more overs than any other member of team and was side s leading wicket taker with 103 wickets in season mason p 66 his bowling average of 17 77 placed him first in team s bowling averages and seventh in english national averages with bat constantine scored 614 runs at 21 17 preston wrote that constantine often electrified onlookers with his almost impudent zest for runs his highest innings came in final test match when he scored 79 in an hour and hit 11 fours wisden commented constantine in mood suggesting his work in saturday afternoon league cricket brought a welcome air of gaiety to test arena he revolutionised all recognised features of cricket and surpass ed bradman in his amazing stroke play for his all round performances during season he was chosen as one of wisden s cricketers of year third test match after which tour was abandoned owing to imminent outbreak of second world war was constantine s last in 18 test matches between 1928 and 1939 he scored 635 runs at an average of 19 24 took 58 wickets at 30 10 and held 28 catches he played one more first class match when in 1945 he captained a team representing dominions against england at lord s match was narrowly won by dominions constantine in second innings shared a partnership of 117 in 45 minutes with keith miller he bowled very little but ran out a batsman at a key point in final innings howat 1976 pp 140 41 in all first class cricket constantine scored 4 475 runs at 24 05 and took 439 wickets at 20 48 lancashire league cricketer in 1928 constantine had signed an initial three year contract with nelson to play in lancashire league contract was worth ps500 per season plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses mason pp 30 31 he remained there until 1937 an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club constantine s appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all nelson s matches and was of great financial benefit to both club and league as a whole in constantine s nine seasons at club nelson never finished lower than second won league competition seven times and knockout cup twice in 1931 constantine renewed his contract for ps650 per season when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him all lancashire league clubs contributed to his wage mason p 31 which rose to ps750 per year between 1935 and 1937 howat 1976 p 87 this was far more than then maximum wage for a professional footballer of or ps500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn and possibly made constantine best paid sportsman in country consequently he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living for first time in their lives as nelson s professional constantine was immediately successful mason p 32 although he produced better figures in subsequent years he considered his first season at nelson most enjoyable of his life owing to freedom and excitement of cricket mason pp 33 34 in nine years at club he scored 6 363 runs at an average of 37 65 and took 776 wickets at 9 50 his highest score was 192 mason p 35 and his best bowling figures were ten wickets for ten runs howat 1976 p 91 in each season except for 1932 he averaged over 30 with bat and in 1933 he scored 1 000 runs at an average of over 50 he took over 70 wickets every season and his bowling average never rose above 11 30 in five seasons he averaged under ten runs per wicket howat 1976 p 235 in 1933 he took 96 wickets his highest seasonal aggregate and had he not missed two games to play for west indies touring team would likely have completed cricketer s double 1 000 runs and 100 wickets an unprecedented feat in league howat 1976 p 94 in mid 1930s representatives from lancashire county cricket club twice approached constantine with a view to him joining club his time in nelson meant that he qualified to play for lancashire having lived in county for required time there was a precedent for such a course as australian ted mcdonald had joined lancashire after playing as nelson s professional in 1920s in case of constantine nothing happened as members of lancashire board and later players in team opposed idea of a black man playing for county in any case constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was negativity and dullness of county cricket mason pp 32 33 he found standard of play very high stating never in my life have i played harder than in lancashire mason p 36 in his history of west indies cricket michael manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting but it was in this special atmosphere of league cricket that constantine was supreme manley p 51 for 1938 season constantine played for rochdale in central lancashire cricket league although he continued to live in nelson he received for season and performed successfully but did not enjoy experience nature of pitches was different in his new league furthermore some of players seemed resentful of his high earnings there was also an incident of racial abuse which constantine believed central lancashire league committee effectively covered up mason pp 52 53 this season ended constantine s career in lancashire leagues although during war he returned to play for nelson as an amateur howat 1976 p 98 style and technique thumb right constantine practising his batting in nets in australia in 1930 alt a cricketer hitting a ball swanton believed that constantine was first west indian cricketer to make an impression on british public he personified west indian cricket from first faltering entry in test arena in 1928 until post war emergence of trinity of worrell weekes and walcott swanton continued there have been many all rounders with better records but it is hard to think of one who made a more sensational impact and impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere in 1934 neville cardus described constantine as a genius and most original cricketer of recent years r c robertson glasgow called constantine most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries robertson glasgow p 123 this was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter course of a match in a short space of time although he developed his technique to minimise risk manley p 52 constantine s batting was based on good eyesight quick reflexes and natural ability he used his wrists to adjust angle of bat at last second allowing him to counter unexpected late movement of ball he batted by instinct and according to manley his every stroke owed more to energy than calculation manley pp 26 27 he was capable of scoring rapidly against any standard of bowling but rarely survived for long periods because he chose not to defend his best shots were cut pull and hook manley p 26 critics believed that constantine s batting reached its peak once he became an accomplished league cricketer james p 128 by setting himself to master variety of pitch conditions he encountered and adopting a style of fast scoring and occasionally unorthodox batting he became an adaptable and effective batsman in all forms of cricket improvising where necessary to prevent bowlers getting on top james pp 130 33 as a cover point fielder constantine was according to manley athletic panther quick sure handed and with an arm that could rifle ball into wicket keeper s gloves like a bullet even from deepest boundary manley p 27 many critics considered him to be one of best fielders of all time manley p 469 as a bowler constantine accelerated from a relatively short run into what manley calls an explosive delivery manley p 46 james believes he reached his best form as a bowler in 1939 using what he had learned in leagues james p 129 by this time his varieties of spin pace and flight made him effective even when conditions favoured batsmen robertson glasgow p 124 although constantine s test bowling record was modest this may to some extent reflect poor standard of fielding in early west indies teams in particular their propensity to drop catches manley p 50 manley p 471 manley writes that wherever constantine played he brought style and humour that aggressiveness that is somehow good natured and which is distinctively west indian quality in all sport constantine s extrovert exuberance was of course more particularly trinidadian than generally west indian perhaps it is this last characteristic that gave him that special quality of panache which sets him apart from all other west indian cricketers life in england thumb right constantine in november 1930 nelson during his time in nelson constantine made a deep impression and remained a celebrity there even after leaving town his general community involvement was such that a regional historian described him as a local champion mason p 37 he appreciated greater freedom he enjoyed in nelson as compared with trinidad where racial issues predominated mason p 38 although nelson suffered from effects of depression constantine s high earnings were never a source of resentment mason p 43 of his time in nelson he wrote if i had not come i could not have been person i am today i am a better citizen for time i have spent in nelson constantine s first season was difficult both he and residents of town were at that stage uncertain of each other few black people had been seen in nelson and although some residents wrote welcoming letters constantines also received racist and abusive ones he quickly established boundaries over what he considered acceptable permitting and even sharing small jokes over skin colour but protesting strongly at outright racism mason pp 39 40 john arlott wrote constantine fought discrimination against his people with a dignity firm but free of acrimony although constantine later attributed some of initial uneasiness to ignorance at time he seriously considered returning to trinidad after first season his wife persuaded him otherwise

come to london but had run out of money james was at forefront of a growing west indian nationalist movement though constantine had until then consciously avoided politics mason pp 44 46 through james influence constantine realised that his position gave him opportunities to further cause of racial equality and trinidadian independence he joined league of coloured peoples an organisation aiming to achieve racial equality for black people in britain mason pp 47 48 he helped james to get a job with manchester guardian and in return james helped constantine to write his first book cricket and i which was published in 1933 later commentators have identified constantine s book as an important step in west indian nationalism and an encouragement to future authors mason pp 50 51 at that time james wrote few active cricketers wrote books and no one in west indies that i knew cricketer or not was writing books at all certainly none was being printed abroad constantine and james drifted

closely with trade unions in an attempt to ease fears and suspicions of white workers mason pp 78 79 he used his influence with ministry of labour to pressurise companies who refused to employ west indians but generally preferred negotiation to confrontation an approach that was often successful mason p 79 constantine s wartime experiences caused him to increase his involvement in league of coloured peoples sometimes referring cases to them he particularly took up cause of children of white women and black overseas servicemen these children were often abandoned by their parents however

colleague of constantine at ministry of labour arrived and attempted to intervene he was told by manager we are not going to have these niggers in our hotel and that his presence might offend american guests watson argued to no avail that not only was constantine a british subject he worked for government eventually watson persuaded constantine to leave and stay at another hotel which owned by same company as imperial proved to be welcoming imperial hotel incident affected constantine deeply both because of involvement of his family and also because he was due to play cricket for a team

imperial london hotels was heard in high court although there was no law against racial discrimination in britain at time constantine argued that hotel had breached its contract with him constantine

constantine s favour rejecting defence s arguments and praising way constantine had handled situation although law limited award of damages against hotel to five guineas constantine was vindicated he did not pursue case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised issue of racism in public eye case was widely reported in press and constantine received great support from both public and government mason p 97 although racial discrimination continued in england this case was first to challenge such practices in court critics regard it as a milestone in british racial equality in

as an assistant legal advisor uncertain about going back to trinidad after living for 25 years in england he nevertheless believed it was a good time to return particularly as his daughter was moving there to marry mason pp 117 18 before leaving england he published his book colour bar 1954 which addressed race relations in britain and racism he had experienced it also discussed worldwide racial oppression and how lives of black people could be improved mason pp 118 21 at time according to peter mason this was an explosive challenging hard hitting tome more so because it came not from a known black militant but from someone who seemed so charming so unruffled so suited to british society mason p 122 although not viewed as radical by black audiences it was aimed at white british readers mason p 123 british press gave it mixed reviews and criticised him for unfairness in parts of book other critics accused him of communist sympathies mason pp 123 26 return to trinidad when constantine returned to trinidad in late 1954 he found a growing desire for independence from britain mason pp 128 30 at trinidad leaseholds he felt isolated from other mainly white senior staff howat 1976 p 156 this drew him towards political involvement eric williams leader of newly founded people s national movement pnm was aware of constantine s popular appeal and recruited him by january 1956 constantine with full co operation and blessing of his employers was party chairman and a member of its executive committee mason pp 130 33 feeling that pnm s policies were in harmony with his views on improving lives of black people and encouraged by his wife constantine stood for election in parliamentary constituency of in 1956 mason pp 134 36 howat 1976 p 164 he won a narrow victory which his colleagues believed few in party could have done and resigned from trinidad leaseholds mason p 137 pnm formed a government in which constantine became minister of communications works and utilities in his ministerial role constantine promoted development of trinidad s road rail water and electricity infrastructure mason pp 137 39 however in late 1958 he was accused of corruption over a ship leasing deal his angry response to charge in legislative council created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics howat 1976 pp 166 69 according to mason speech was a miscalculation which made public perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to trinidad after so many years away question his fitness for a ministerial role mason pp 140 41 a view increasingly held by commentators mason p 142 in later 1950s constantine supported campaign led by james to appoint west indies cricket s first black captain success of black people like constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain cricket team was a key factor in an ultimately successful campaign mason pp 146 48 while in government constantine assisted in development of west indies federation as a step towards independence of islands and his fame and familiarity with britain played some part in negotiations which led to trinidad s independence in 1962 mason pp 148 49 after he decided not to stand for re election in 1961 williams appointed him as trinidad and tobago s first high commissioner in london mason p 149 peter mason writes that constantine s political career in trinidad was a success he was efficient active respected and popular mason concedes that he was not a natural politician often sensitive to criticism and that his experience abroad was a cause for mistrust in trinidad rather than seen as an advantage mason pp 151 52 gerald howat believes that constantine s political career while not without successes was undermined by several factors his age his over frequent references to his english experience his rejection of political theorising and lack of debating skills however his personal popularity undoubtedly attracted support to pnm howat 1976 pp 176 78 back to united kingdom high commissioner constantine began his role as high commissioner in june 1961 in new year s honours list for 1962 he was knighted and became sir learie constantine mason pp 153 55 among other accolades he received at this time was freedom of town of nelson mason notes that constantine had now passed firmly into consciousness as a british treasure mason p 154 however his tenure as high commissioner ended in controversy constantine felt that his high profile required him to speak out on racial issues affecting all west indian immigrants not just trinidadians mason pp 155 56 161 in april 1963 when a bristol bus company was refusing to employ black staff constantine visited city and spoke to press about issue his intervention assisted in a speedy resolution of affair which according to mason was crucial in persuading british government of need for a race relations act mason pp 156 58 however politicians in both trinidad and britain felt a senior diplomat should not be so closely involved in british domestic affairs particularly as he acted without consulting his government williams effectively withdrew his support from constantine who decided not to continue as high commissioner when his term expired in february 1964 mason pp 158 59 howat 1976 p 189 although as high commissioner constantine looked after his staff and was respected by other diplomats howat 1976 pp 192 93 howat observes there is limited evidence that he was successful in post in one area in which he acted positively he blundered bristol affair in language of game he loved his timing was wrong though he was full of good intentions howat adds that he did not increase his stature or reputation during his term of office howat 1976 p 193 mason believes that there was too much of welfare officer about him and not enough of government focused diplomat mason p 163 final years for remainder of his life constantine lived in london he returned to legal practice and was elected an honorary bencher of middle temple in 1963 despite his limited experience he also resumed work in journalism he wrote and broadcast on cricket race and commonwealth and produced two more books a coaching book young cricketers companion 1964 and changing face of cricket 1966 which included his thoughts on modern cricket mason pp 164 65 he made his debut as a television cricket commentator although his failing health and talkative style meant he was less successful than on radio mason pp 165 66 in 1965 constantine became a founding member of sports council which aimed to develop sport in britain two years later he was appointed to three person race relations board formed through race relations act to investigate cases of racial discrimination mason pp 166 67 in this role he spoke out against commonwealth immigrants act a stance that led to an offer from liberal party which he declined to stand as parliamentary candidate for nelson mason pp 167 68 later he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate release after a military coup of abubakar tafawa balewa overthrown prime minister of nigeria mason p 168 constantine was appointed to bbc s general advisory committee in 1966 and became a bbc governor two years later although declining health restricted his involvement mason pp 169 70 following year students of st andrews university elected constantine as rector but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role mason pp 172 75 in his last years constantine was criticised for becoming part of establishment private eye mocked him while new generation of west indian immigrants believed he was out of touch mason pp 175 77 more radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents mason p 81 constantine was awarded a life peerage in 1969 becoming first black man to sit in house of lords there were rumours that trinidad had prevented earlier attempts to ennoble him he took title of baron constantine of maraval in trinidad and nelson in county palatine of lancaster his investiture attracted widespread media attention constantine stated i think it must have been for what i have endeavoured to do to make it possible for people of different colour to know each other better and live well together swanton p 69 he sat as a in house but due to failing health was only able to make one speech in his time there mason pp 170 72 although constantine was reluctant to leave england his poor health necessitated a return to trinidad but before he could do so he died of a heart attack probably brought about by bronchitis on 1 july 1971 his body was flown to trinidad where he received a state funeral before being buried in arouca he was posthumously awarded trinidad s highest honour trinity cross later in month a memorial service was held in london in westminster abbey mason pp 181 82 a collection of photographs newspaper clippings archival documents and memorabilia about constantine s life is safeguarded and exhibited by trinidad and tobago s national library this collection was inscribed in unesco s memory of world register in 2011 family life constantine met his future wife norma agatha cox in 1921 she had little interest in cricket and although their relationship developed during early 1920s she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her however relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements they were married on 25 july 1927 their only child gloria was born in april 1928 throughout their marriage his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close norma died two months after her husband in 1971 mason pp 182 83 personality john arlott describes constantine as a man of easy humour and essential patience his outlook was that of a compassionate radical and he maintained his high moral standards unswervingly e w swanton writes none could call lord constantine a modest man but gifts of warmth and friendliness as well as a shrewd brain and a ready tongue helped to make him one of personalities of his time he did not get along with everyone he and england cricketer wally hammond feuded for nearly ten years over what constantine perceived as a slight in 1925 26 subsequently constantine continually bowled short when he encountered hammond on field until pair made peace in old trafford test match of 1933 after this they pursued a more good natured rivalry and became quite friendly hammond publicly expressed sympathy towards constantine and other black west indians for discrimination that they faced in his earlier years acquaintances believed constantine was too conscious of colour james wrote many doors in england were open to him that doors were closed to other west indians seemed more important to him james p 111 michael manley describes him as an extrovert who displayed great self belief in everything he did manley p 49 he also notes that constantine was too long in england and perhaps too slight in test match performance to make impact on caribbean that he did on england but he enchanted england howat writes cricket apart constantine s reputation must rest on his contribution to racial tolerance his benevolent view of empire and commonwealth and his personal acceptance within british establishment in end he was more english than trinidadian and he needed that wider platform bibliography with denzil batchelor notes references sources book club
