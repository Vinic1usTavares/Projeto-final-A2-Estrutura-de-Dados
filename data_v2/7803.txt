party mode in which up to four players compete on their own boards using a limited number of balls each attempting to get highest score in each of these modes game generally offers ability for players to select which peggle master they wish to use development peggle was originally envisioned by popcap s studio director sidhu who was inspired by pachinko machines however he recognized that pachinko was mostly luck based and would not translate well into a video game after seeing a 2d game engine created by popcap programmer brian rothstein sidhu was able to realize his game and worked with rothstein for first five months of its development before bringing in additional programmers initial designs focused on bringing together elements of pachinko with breakout team initially incorporated a rapid fire mechanic used in pachinko along with numerous moving targets but they found this made levels either too fast paced or too demanding of player they found over time that a static field of pegs provided a more enjoyable experience for player path of ball would be more predictable leading to gameplay mechanic of requiring only a random subset of orange pegs to be cleared once team had established core mechanics of game they brought on character artist walter wilson background artist marcia broderick and an additional coder eric tams to help complete peggle within its two year development period even with their game established sidhu and rothstein faced internal challenges at popcap to increase level of interactivity with game but two defended their vision of game design team struggled with a theme for game and for a while game was based around mythological god thor during this time game was called thunderball and was much darker in theme than final product eventually game changed themes to be more lighthearted and team realized that name no longer fit game from there designers came up with calling game pego and then pogo team later discovered that since pogo was already name of ea s flash portal they wouldn t be able to use it though game was technically completed within a year popcap opted to spend more time to polish it improving visuals and background images team spent time refining various sound effects used in game in order to provide an appropriate atmosphere in some cases they found desired sound quickly sound of ball hitting a peg was borrowed from another game in development at popcap but was considered perfect for peggle other cases required iteration sound of ball shooter was originally closer to that of a cannon while a plunk sound effect was used when ball catcher caught a ball these were changed to more airy sounds an air cannon and a brief angelic chorus in order to make elements sound as if part of game s music team found it helped to create a defining moment at end of each level when player is moments from clearing final peg this initially was programmed as a simple message stating extreme fever and music of ode to joy as a placeholder sidhu wanted to recreate wild sounds and visuals that were present on winning pachinko games however team found that players reacted well to simpler placeholder elements and team focused on improving presentation of these including adding a zoom on current ball as it neared last orange peg to be cleared versions and sequels peggle extreme was packaged with windows version of orange box featuring levels inspired by half life 2 team fortress 2 and portal it includes ten levels with one peggle master and five challenges peggle extreme was eventually made free to download for anyone with a steam account game was developed in conjunction with valve after popcap s tams learned that peggle was played often at valve s offices and that company had helped to promote game on
