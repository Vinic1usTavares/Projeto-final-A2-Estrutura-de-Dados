is a court judgment delivered in 1991 in which house of lords determined that under english criminal law it is possible for a husband to rape his wife in 1990 defendant referred to in judgment only as r to protect identity of victim had been convicted of attempting to rape his wife he appealed conviction on grounds of a purported marital rape exemption under common law r claimed that it was not legally possible for a husband to rape his wife as wife had given irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband through contract of marriage which she could not subsequently withdraw both court of appeal and subsequently house of lords upheld rape conviction declaring that a marital rape exemption did not exist in english law legal history impossibility of marital rape under english common law was suggested in sir matthew hale s historia placitorum coronae history of pleas of crown published posthumously in 1736 60 years after his death in it he stated that husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract wife hath given herself up to her husband consent which she cannot retract in other words by consenting to marriage a wife had given her body to her husband and also gave irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband first edition of john frederick archbold s pleading and evidence in criminal cases in 1822 reiterated position that a husband also cannot be guilty of a rape upon his wife principle in english law that a husband could not rape his wife had long been supposed to be correct although r v r was first case in which marital rape exemption reached house of lords as late as end of nineteenth century family judges were still prepared to make orders for restitution of conjugal rights against estranged wives breach of such an order ceased to be a criminal offence in 1884 although courts ceased to make such orders during victorian era actual form of action itself was not officially abolished until passing of matrimonial proceedings and property act 1970 however even when granted such orders were routinely ignored in nanda v nada 1968 p 351 an order was granted restraining molestation of a spouse notwithstanding that there was an extant order for restitution of conjugal relations see generally however by that time statement in hale had already been doubted by some judges r v clarence 1888 22 23 r v r followed several cases earlier in 20th century which had progressively narrowed exemption in r v clarke 1949 2 all er 448 33 cr app r

courts finding that marital defence only applied to crime of rape which was then defined as vaginal sex only and not to other sexual acts such as fellatio facts r married his wife in august 1984 but marriage became strained and his wife moved back to her parents house in october 1989 leaving a letter expressing her intention to seek a divorce a few weeks later in november 1989 r broke into house while his wife s parents were out and attempted to force her to have sexual intercourse with him against her will he also assaulted her squeezing his hands around her neck police arrested r and charged him with rape contrary to section 1 1 of sexual offences amendment act 1976 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 47 of offences against person act 1861 couple were divorced in may 1990 legal proceedings case came before mr justice owen and a jury at leicester crown court in july 1990 judge rejected a submission on behalf of defendant that he could not be found guilty of rape due to marital rape exemption he then pleaded not guilty to rape but guilty to attempted rape and to assault charge he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for attempted rape and 18 months imprisonment for assault with sentences to run concurrently r appealed conviction for attempted rape to court of appeal criminal division an unusually large panel of five appeal court judges two or three judges is a more usual number heard case in february 1991 lord chief justice lord lane president of family division stephen brown and lords justices watkins neill and russell lord lane delivered judgment of court in march 1991 dismissing appeal he outlined three possible outcomes to legal issue first a literal approach that it was always impossible for a husband to rape his wife or second a compromise approach that rape was only possible in cases where a wife s presumed consent was deemed to be negated with an expanding and open ended list of possible exceptions he was not in favour of either of those outcomes and instead he adopted third solution one of more radical reform abolishing legal fiction of a marital rape exemption there comes a time when changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting effect of proposition a time when proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour idea that a wife by marriage consents in advance to her husband having sexual intercourse with her whatever her state of health or however proper her objections if that is what hale meant is no longer acceptable it can never have been other than a fiction and fiction is a poor basis for criminal law it seems to us that where common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is true position of a wife in present day society duty of court is to take steps to alter rule if it can legitimately do so in light of any relevant parliamentary enactment we take view that time has now arrived when law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to criminal law irrespective of his relationship with his victim 1991 2 w l r 1065 1991 2 all e r 257 he also pre empted question of whether this is a matter that should be left to parliament saying this is not creation of a new offence it is removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it house of lords judgment thumb left 100px an anti marital rape sign r appealed again to house of lords legal arguments were heard by five law lords in july 1991 lord keith of kinkel lord brandon of oakbrook lord griffiths lord ackner and lord lowry in october 1991 lord keith of kinkel delivered leading speech with which other four law lords all agreed he stated that contortions being performed in earlier cases in order to avoid applying marital rights exemption were indicative of absurdity of rule he referred to a case under scottish law s v h m 469 in which high court of justiciary held that there was no marital rape exemption in scottish law even if married couple was cohabiting in that case lord justice general lord emslie questioned if a marital rape exemption was ever part of scottish law but even if it was concluded that there was no good reason for it to continue nowadays it cannot seriously be maintained that by marriage a wife submits herself irrevocably to sexual intercourse in all circumstances lord keith stated in judgement that there was no reason why this reasoning could not apply in english law he stated that following matrimonial causes acts definition of marriage had moved from hale s time from where wife was subservient to her husband into a contract of equals house of lords also considered whether word unlawful in definition of unlawful rape in sexual offences amendment act 1976 included marital rape court determined that it did word unlawful was as all rape was considered illegal under act with regard to marital rape exemption lord keith agreed with court of appeal that marital rape exemption was a common law fiction and ruled that in modern times supposed marital exemption in rape forms no part of law of england lord brandon of oakbrook lord griffiths lord ackner and lord lowry all unanimously agreed with lord keith s ratio decidendi as such r s appeal was dismissed and his conviction upheld r s appeal was accordingly dismissed and he was convicted of rape of his wife common law is however capable of evolving in light of changing social economic and cultural developments hale s proposition reflected state of affairs in these respects at time it was enunciated since then status of women and particularly of married women has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail apart from property matters and availability of matrimonial remedies one of most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals and no longer one in which wife must be subservient chattel of husband hale s proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at time in modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable impact case was reviewed by european court of human rights with two individuals arguing that it amounted to a retrospective change in criminal law so their conviction following r v r was in breach of article 7 of european convention on human rights amounting to a conviction for an act that was not a criminal offence when it was committed european court of human rights rejected this argument in rulings in november 1995 in cases of sw and cr v uk sw v uk 1995 echr 52 22 november 1995 cr v uk 1995 echr 51 22 november 1995 on grounds that r v r was a natural foreseeable evolution of law and that even if common law marital rape exemption existed or their victims not
