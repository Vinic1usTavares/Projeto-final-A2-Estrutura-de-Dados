brand tronderbanen concept was based on jaeren commuter rail which had been established previous year operating between stavanger and egersund trondelag commuter rail would operate several services north of trondheim to steinkjer and south to oppdal and tynset initial plans called to continued use of class 92 rolling stock but saw change in schedules and new upgraded platforms for this involved building a small platform house with a roof and glass walls but a framework of wood at each station they were optimized to give good protection from various types weather service started on 1 september 1993 changes to schedule involved almost a doubling of number of departures particularly between trondheim and stjordal where a one hour headway was introduced service from trondheim to steinkjer had ten daily round trips while local trains had existed previously north of trondheim services south to oppdal were all new in an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains initial services consisted of four services from trondheim northwards along nordland line to steinkjer east along meraker line to storlien south along dovre line to oppdal and south east along roros line to tynset thumb trondheim central station was upgraded in 1995 and acts as center point of commuter rail after six months operation service had experienced a 40 traffic increase on 15 november 1994 trondelag commuter rail became first airport rail link in nordic countries when a new terminal and trondheim airport station opened at trondheim airport vaernes nsb stated that their primary goal was not to compete with four hourly airport coaches which operated to hotels in trondheim but instead to provide services to communities in nord trondelag and south of trondheim investment at airport cost from january 1995 frequency between steinkjer and melhus was increased slightly on 26 september 1995 train station in trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses coaches and trains investment cost nok 50 million in 1997 nsb stated that trondelag commuter rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it along with an array of other services if funding was not increased same year 750 000 people traveled with commuter rail 20 increase that year was in part due to fis nordic world ski championships 1997 being held in trondheim and was service in country with largest growth thumb left hint rostad opened in 2001 to serve rostad campus of nord trondelag university college following asta accident on 4 january 2000 when a class 92 was wrecked

trondheim to steinkjer from 11 june 2000 all services on dovre line south of storen were terminated leaving only intercity services at same year plans by local politicians and commerce were launched to halve travel time between trondheim and steinkjer under motto trondheim to steinkjer in one hour nsb hoped to introduce a faster airport link similar to airport express train in oslo which would allow trains to operate from trondheim to airport in 20 minutes plans would have called for termination of service at 17 of 21 stations and investments at about nok 3 7 billion in march 2000 nsb announced that they were considering reducing number of stations on commuter rail from then 31 stations to between 15 and 20 nsb stated that 50 of stations were responsible for only 2 of traffic and that a bus service to these areas which would transport people to closest railway station would be more economic and reduce travel time for remaining passengers nsb also stated that they indented to re brand service as part of puls brand used for other commuter rail services part of reason for change of service was that nord trondelag county municipality had permitted tronderbilene to double number of services on their competing coach service along route and commuter rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers to coach thumb skatval station serves skatval a rural village in stjordal from 7 january 2001 nsb made several major changes to commuter rail a fixed hourly headway was introduced on trains from steinkjer to trondheim including extra rush hour trains from lerkendal

at marienborg and rostad opened nsb also introduced a fare zone system which gave up to nok 20 discount for single fare travelers and about same fares for month pass holders part of reason for expansion was that delivery of new class 93 trains for regional services freed up more class 92 units this also allowed nsb to operate some of services with double unit four car trains in rush hour restructuring also called for reduction of four services on meraker line and two services to oppdal terminating all commuter train services on lines for service to oppdal nsb had an operating deficit of nok 1 7 million and 21 000 passengers in 1998 meraker line had about twice number of passengers national rail administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate routes without

opened previously former station known as lademoen was renamed lilleby so new station serving nedre elvehavn could be named lademoen name change caused protests from historians and municipal committee responsible for naming long gevingasen tunnel opened on 15 august 2011 shortening travel time between hommelvik and vaernes by five minutes it also allows number of trains on line between trondheim and stjordal to increase to eight trains per hour both directions combined which will free up sufficient capacity to allow additional commuter trains to run to stjordal levanger station was closed in 2011 for formal technical reasons station was located in a curve and within signaling area of levanger station 600 m distance because of adjacent levanger hospital station was one of busiest on system with 90 000 annual riders as compensation a new pedestrian and bicycle path was constructed from levanger station to hospital future there are political signals to prioritize electrification tracks from trondheim to steinkjer plus meraker line nsb will need to replace rolling stock in 2010s and want to coordinate new stock with electrification thumb map of gevingasen tunnel purple including current nordland line blue and e6 yellow two county municipalities proposed during early 2000s that nordland line between trondheim and steinkjer be upgraded allow travel time to be reduced to one hour this would require average speed to be increased to mainly through a modernization of existing line specific projects include electrification double track between trondheim and trondheim airport gevingasen tunnel a tunnel through between stjordal and asen additional passing loops a new bridge over river and a rearrangement of tracks at hell this would have to be combined with a reduction in number of stops national rail administration estimates that mentioned investments which would cost between nok 4 and 6 billion will allow a travel time of 1 hour and 10 minutes if a number of curves are straightened increased capacity is introduced between stjordal and steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed travel time could be reduced to 1 hour norsk bane a lobbyist organisation which is suggesting to build a high speed line from oslo to trondheim and onwards to steinkjer estimates that regional trains will with their infrastructure be able to operate trains from steinkjer to trondheim in 40 minutes proposals involves only keeping stations at hommelvik trondheim airport stjordal asen levanger verdal rora and steinkjer north of trondheim south of trondheim proposal involves a 35 minute service to oppdal with intermediate stops at heimdal melhus storen and berkak proposal involves building an all new double track and having a stopping pattern where not all stations are served by all services it would involve three services per hour and direct trains to oslo with speeds up to references bibliography category norwegian state railways category public transport in
