cento de laudibus christi a virgilian cento concerning glory of christ is a latin poem arranged by faltonia betitia proba ad 352384 after her conversion to christianity a cento is a poetic work composed of verses or passages taken from other authors and re arranged in a new order this poem reworks verses extracted from work of virgil to tell stories from old and new testament of christian bible much of work focuses on story of jesus christ while scholars have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain why poem was written a definitive answer to this question remains elusive regardless of proba s intent poem would go on to be widely circulated and it eventually was used in schools to teach tenets of christianity often alongside augustine of hippo s de doctrina christiana but while poem was popular critical reception was more mixed a pseudonymous work purportedly by pope gelasius i disparaged poem deeming it apocryphal and many also believe that st jerome wrote negatively of proba and her poem other thinkers like isidore of seville petrarch and giovanni boccaccio wrote highly of proba and many praised her ingenuity during 19th and 20th centuries poem was criticized as being of poor quality but recent scholars have held work in higher regard origin and style author of poem faltonia betitia proba was born ad 322 a member of an influential aristocratic family she eventually married a prefect of rome named clodius kaczynski 2013 pp proba wrote poetry and according to contemporary accounts her first work was titled constantini bellum adversus this poem which is now lost recounted war between roman emperor constantius ii and usurper magnentius that occurred between ad cullhed 2015 p 24 at some point proba converted from paganism to christianity and de laudibus christi which was probably written ad 352384 was her attempt to turn away from battle and slayings in order to write holy things kaczynski 2013 p 132 with exception of proem and invocation of poem entirety of de laudibus christi is a cento i e a patchwork poem made up of rearranged verses extracted from works of roman poet virgil kaczynski 2013 p 131 cullhed 2015 p 1 proba s choice to rework virgil seems to have been made for two reasons first virgil was an influential poet who had been commissioned by caesar augustus first roman emperor to write mytho historical epic aeneid comparetti 1895 pp 114 arguably most influential roman poet virgil s artistic clout was immense being felt well into late antiquity and he was imitated by late latin poets like and prudentius ziolkowski putnam 2008 p 475 comparetti 1895 p 159 respect given to virgil often manifested in form of centos which reached peak popularity in fourth century ad ziolkowski putnam 2008 p 469 comparetti 1895 p 53 second virgil was often seen as a pre christian prophet due to a popular interpretation of his fourth eclogue which many believed foretold birth of jesus ziolkowski putnam 2008 p 470 comparetti 1895 p 99 hardly any names are present in de laudibus christi this is because virgil never used hebrew names like jesus and mary and thus proba was limited in terms of what she was able to work with to compensate proba used vague words like mater mother pater father deus god and vates poet or priest to refer to key judeo christian figures in places this handicap interferes with readability according to g ronald kastner and ann millin necessary and circumlocutions brought about by absences in virgil of appropriate terminology render text impassable at times kastner millin 1981 p 39 an exception to poem s lack of names is found in a reference to moses whom proba refers to by invoking name musaeus according to classicist sigrid schottenius cullhed proba probably used name musaeus for judeo christian prophet since it was often believed from hellenistic era onward that was greek name for moses cullhed 2015 p 128 contents summary cento s 694 lines are divided into a proem and invocation lines 155 select stories from old testament books of genesis lines and exodus lines select stories from new testament gospels lines and an epilogue lines cullhed 2015 pp at beginning of poem proba references her earlier foray into poetry before rejecting it in name of christ this section also serves as an inversion and thus rejection of virgilian tradition whereas virgil opened aeneid by proclaiming that he will sing of weapons and a man arma virumque cano proba rejects warfare as a subject worthy of christian poetry stevenson 2005 pp 6566 proba then describes herself as a prophet proba and calls upon god and holy spirit eschewing traditional invocation of muses to aid her in her work marmureanu cernescu and lixandru 2008 pp 56 stevenson 2005 p 66 at end of invocation proba states her poem s main purpose to tell how virgil sang offices of christ marmureanu cernescu and lixandru 2008 p 6 passages focusing on old testament concern creation of world fall of man great flood and exodus from egypt marmureanu cernescu and lixandru 2008 p 5 proba s presentation of based on of virgil s genesis narrative to better align it with contemporary greco roman beliefs about origin of world cullhed 2015 pp cullhed argues that certain aspects of creation story are abbreviated amplified or even transposed so that proba can avoid repetitive passages such as double creation of man genesis 1 25 27 and genesis 2 18 19 cullhed 2015 p 138 cullhed 2015 pp in events leading to fall of man eve s actions are largely based on story of dido from book iv of aeneid thereby repeatedly foreshadowing imminent disaster of fall cullhed 2015 p 142 cullhed 2015 p 145 serpent is described with lines that detail laocoon s death from book ii aeneid and snake sent by fury to enrage amata from book vii aeneid cullhed 2015 p 151 proba relies on first two books of georgics specifically sections that discuss iron age of man to describe human life after adam and eve eat fruit from tree of knowledge of good and evil cullhed 2015 pp in this way she connects greco roman concept of ages of man with judeo christian concept of fall of man cullhed 2015 p 157 after story of creation proba briefly references great flood by making use of lines from fourth book of georgics that originally discussed death of a beehive and necessity of laws after end of golden age respectively according to classicist karla pollmann by using lines that concern destruction and establishment of law proba is able to convey traditional idea that noah s survival represents dawning of a second creation and a new order that is patriarchal age pollmann 2017 p 113 proba dedicates only a few lines to exodus before moving onto new testament cullhed reasons that this is because book of exodus and remaining old testament is replete with violence and warfare that is stylistically too close to tradition of pagan epic tradition that proba expressly rejects in proem of de laudibus christi cullhed 2015 p 121 in transitional section between old and new testaments proba appropriates invocation of muses of war that immediately precedes catalogue of italians from book vii aeneid and verses that originally described aeneas s prophetic shield from book viii aeneid according to these verses originally functioned as poetic devices enabling virgil to move from first half of poem to latter half proba likewise has re purposed these verses to aid in her transition from old testament into new cullhed 2015 pp portion of de laudibus christi that focuses on new testament recounts birth of jesus his life and deeds his crucifixion and advent of holy spirit marmureanu cernescu and lixandru 2008 p 4 although jesus and mary are featured joseph is omitted cullhed 2015 p 164 jesus is often described by language befitting a virgilian hero cullhed 2015 pp 158 and mary is depicted by lines originally relating to venus and dido proba s sermon on mount begins by borrowing sibyl of cumae s description of punishment for unrighteous from book vi aeneid and some scholars contend that this portion of de laudibus christi is first description of hell in christian poetry cullhed 2015 pp christ s deeds are reduced to three events calming sea walking on water and call of disciples cullhed 2015 p 176 to describe christ s crucifixion proba uses several lines that originally related to warfare destruction and death such as battle between aeneas and from book xii aeneid sack of troy from book ii and suffocation of laocoon by giant serpents from book ii cullhed 2015 p notably christ is crucified not on a cross but an oak tree which cullhed argues synthesizes jewish roman and christian religious codes as species of tree was associated in greco roman world with jupiter and in judeo christian tradition with binding of isaac cullhed 2015 p 182 after covering christ s death proba borrows lines referring to erotic love between dido and aeneas to represent decidedly more spiritual love that christ shares with his disciples cullhed 2015 p 184 end of poem focuses on christ describing world to come and his ascension into heaven proba conveys former via prophecy made by both and oracle of delos both from book iii aeneid and latter with language that originally described god mercury cullhed 2015 p 185 cullhed 2015 p 186 characterization of jesus due to her borrowing from virgil proba s christ is very similar to virgilian epic hero cullhed 2015 p 158 parallels between two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness initiating realms without end and projecting auras of divinity clark hatch 1981 p 31 according to early christian specialist elizabeth a clark and classicist diane hatch proba s purpose was to imbue christ with heroic virtues akin to virgilian hero clark hatch 1981 p 36 poet does this in three major ways first she describes jesus as remarkably beautiful clark hatch 1981 pp 3334 with a magnificent and commanding presence similar to that of aeneas clark hatch 1981 p 33 second during crucifixion jesus does not go meekly to his death but aggressively lashes out at his persecutors clark hatch 1981 p 34 her reconfiguration of jesus s crucifixion is thus in line with aeneas vindictive slaying of described at very end of aeneid finally proba transfers to jesus portions of prophecies scattered throughout aeneid that detail rome s glorious future thus recasting pagan oracles in a christian light clark hatch 1981 p 35 characterization of mary characterization of mary has caused much scholarly debate historian kate cooper sees mary as a courageous intelligent cooper 2007 pp clark and hatch write that proba stresses mary s maternity by omitting joseph and presenting mary as jesus s sole human parent conversely latinist kyriakidis argues that despite mary s presence in poem she lacks feminine attributes and is thus impersonal cullhed 2015 pp according to kyriakidis this is intentional on proba s part as it draws attention to christ s aspect that would be incompatible with a human feminine mother right thumb alt painting of a woman wearing a crown and reading a book according to sigrid schottenius cullhed proba compares mary pictured to goddesses and prophets through use of virgilian language cullhed writes that most scholarly views of mary in poem are inadequate and that proba made mary twofold fulfillment and of both eve and dido cullhed 2015 p 165 cullhed bases this on fact that line 563 of fourth book of aeneid from mercury s speech to aeneas in which god admonishes hero for lingering with dido in carthage is used in two of sections of cento once in which adam admonishes eve for sinning and again in which mary learns that herod wants to kill her child according to cullhed negative characterization of original verse and its reuse in old testament portion of cento is transformed into a positively charged ability allowing mary and jesus to escape herod s wrath because mary can foretell future she is compared through use of virgilian language to greco roman goddesses and prophets cullhed 2015 p 166 proba s character and motivation because historical information about proba is limited many scholars have taken to analyzing de laudibus christi to learn more about her according to classicist bernice kaczynski scholars have seen traces of proba s own character in her emphasis on beauty of natural world readily apparent in her account of creation cento suggests that proba had great regard for domestic matters for marriage and family for marital devotion and for filial piety while new testament stresses asceticism proba seems to de emphasize its importance given that topics like virginity and poverty are not stressed in her poem in regards to issues of finance proba reinterprets a number of new testament episodes in which jesus urges his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that christians should simply share wealth with their families these changes illustrate proba s historical context her socio economic position and expectations of her class as to why proba arranged in poem in first place scholars are still divided latinist r p h green argues that work was a reaction to roman emperor julian s law forbidding christians from teaching literature that they did not believe to be true which is to say classical greek and latin mythology green 1995 pp stevenson 2005 p 67 proba s goal green writes was to present virgil without pagan gods and thus a virgil no longer vulnerable to christian criticism green 1995 p 558 in this way a christian teacher could use text to discuss virgil without compromising their religious and moral integrity clark and hatch on other hand postulate that jesus s virgilian nature in cento may have been proba s attempt to rebut unflattering demonizing descriptions of jesus in julian s caesares and contra they conclude that hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable due to lack of information about proba date of cento s creation and her intentions finally classicist aurelio suggests that proba composed cento to teach her children stories from bible cullhed 2015 pp although there is no solid evidence that poem was ever intended to be a teaching tool plant 2004 p 171 cullhed 2015 p 53 reception by studying manuscript records of claustral libraries scholars have concluded that proba s cento was heavily copied upon its release it was evidently very popular in schools and often used alongside augustine of hippo s de doctrina christiana in some instances proba s work even eclipsed augustine s in popularity according to catalina marmureanu cernescu and laura lixandru work was likely favored because of its accessible virgilian style and because proba presented herself as a meek female thus appealing to misogynistic views of general public marmureanu cernescu and lixandru 2008 p 8 thumbnail alt painting of saint jerome reading a book many scholars believe that jerome pictured criticized poem in late 4th and early 5th centuries work began to receive a more mixed response many scholars hold that church father jerome was a critic of work in a letter written from bethlehem to paulinus of nola castigating virgilian centos copeland 2016 p 357 he warned against following an old chatterbox garrula anus and those who think of calling maro i e virgil a christian non maronem sine christo green 1995 p 553 according to historian james westfall thompson jerome strongly inveighed against this method of destroying sense of a pagan author and that his love of classics and his christian piety were alike offended by proba s actions thompson 1906 p 650 conversely roman emperor arcadius who reigned from ad 395 408 received a copy of poem and his version has a fifteen line dedication contending that proba s work is maro changed for better in sacred meaning maronem mutatum in melius divino sensu cullhed 2015 p 190 stevenson 2005 p 68 work was also presented to empress aelia eudocia wife of byzantine emperor theodosius ii who reigned from ad 408 450 cullhed 2015 p 59 during late antiquity a pseudonymous document known as decretum was long believed to have been issued by pope gelasius i who held papacy from ad 492 496 declared de laudibus christi to be apocryphal and a reprehensible work of poetry 2006 but almost a century later archbishop isidore of seville ad 560 636 called proba only woman to be ranked among men of church proba femina inter viros sola in regards to de laudibus christi isidore wrote that it is not work which should be admired but proba s ingenuity in compiling poem cuius non studium sed laudamus ingenium jensen 1996 p 53 isidore of seville de viris illustribus v during renaissance proba and her work were praised as examples of studiousness and scholarship in a 1385 letter to anna von schweidnitz wife of holy roman emperor charles iv italian poet and scholar petrarch referenced proba and her work while discussing female geniuses cox 2008 p 18 and in 1374 humanist giovanni boccaccio included proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled de mulieribus claris cullhed 2015 p 25 in 1474 poem was published by swiss printer michael which likely made proba first female author to have had her work reproduced by a printing press worth 2015 p 66 in 1518 proba s work was once again being used in an educational setting this time by john colet of st paul s school who believed that proba wrote with clene and chast latin stevenson 2005 p 69 scholarship in 19th and early 20th century was more critical of de laudibus christi cullhed 2015 p 56 cullhed 2015 pp 66 67 some classicists and philologists of era cite work as an example of late antiquity s poverty of ideas in 1849 william smith s dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology called poem trash worthy of no praise smith 1849 p 134 and in 1911 p lejay of catholic encyclopedia wrote that action of poem is constrained and unequal manner absurd and diction frequently either obscure or improper lejay 1911 despite these rather negative appraisals contemporary scholars have taken a renewed interest in poem kaczynski 2013 p 133 and many see it as worthy of study cullhed in particular considers work of considerable historical and cultural importance for it belongs to small number of ancient texts with a female author and stands out as one of our earliest extant christian latin poems cullhed 2015 p 6 first english language work dedicated in its entirety to proba and her poem was 2015 monograph proba prophet written by cullhed cullhed 2015 authorship controversy thumbnail alt painting of a bishop reading a book isidore of seville pictured identified faltonia betitia proba as poem s author in his 7th century work etymologiae right poem is traditionally attributed to faltonia betitia proba largely on assertion of isidore who wrote in his etymologiae that de laudibus christi was product of a woman named proba who was wife of a man named adelphus proba adelphi ex isidore of seville etymologiae i 39 26 but classicist and medievalist danuta shanzer has argued that poem was not work of faltonia betitia proba but rather her granddaughter anicia faltonia proba who lived in late fourth and early fifth centuries green 1995 p 551 is of opinion that faltonia betitia proba likely died in ad much of her assertion on supposed date inconsistencies and anachronisms within text for instance shanzer points out that lines 13 17 of de laudibus christi strongly resemble lines 20 24 of poem carmen contra which was written sometime after faltonia betitia proba s death shanzer also claims that de laudibus christi alludes to a notable debate about date of easter that took place in ad 387 thereby suggesting that poem must date from latter part of fourth century finally shanzer argues that reference to war between magnentius and constantius in work s proem precludes possibility that faltonia betitia proba arranged de laudibus christi due to fact that war took place in same year as her supposed death shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument noting that author of de laudibus christi is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only anicia proba would have received such as mother of or eminent roman mistress in her 2015 book proba prophet cullhed counters shanzer s claims first by noting that there is no definitive evidence that faltonia betitia proba died in ad 351 and that such an assertion remains speculative at best cullhed also argues that there are no grounds for determining priority of poem s opening lines and that supposed reference to ad 387 debate about easter could have likely referred to an earlier perhaps less famous dispute as to titles found in later manuscripts cullhed writes that it is likely that they were erroneously inserted during middle ages by scribes who had understandably confused two cullhed also reasons that if anicia proba had written de laudibus christi latin poet claudian would have almost certainly praised her poetic abilities in his ad 395 panegyric celebrating joint consulship of her sons anicius hermogenianus olybrius and anicius probinus cullhed concludes evidence for discrediting isidore s attribution of faltonia betitia proba as author of cento is not sufficient and so i will assume that cento was written in mid fourth century by faltonia betitia proba cullhed 2015 pp 2223 today general consensus among classicists and scholars of latin is that de laudibus christi was indeed written by faltonia betitia proba plant 2004 p 170 cullhed 2015 p 65 see also interpretatio christiana adaptation of non christian elements of culture or historical facts to worldview of
