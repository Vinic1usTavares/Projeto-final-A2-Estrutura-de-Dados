2010 new year s eve tornado outbreak was a three day long tornado outbreak that impacted central and lower mississippi valley from december 30 2010 to january 1 2011 associated with a low pressure system and a strong cold front 37 tornadoes tracked across five states over length of severe event killing nine and injuring several others activity was centered in states of missouri and later mississippi on december 31 seven tornadoes were rated ef3 on enhanced fujita scale these were strongest during outbreak non tornadic winds were recorded to have reached as high as 80 mph 130 km h at eight locations on december 31 while hail as large as 2 75 in 7 0 cm was documented north northeast of mansfield missouri overall damage from outbreak totaled us 123 3 million most of which was related to tornadoes united states storm prediction center first noted a possible new year s eve severe weather event as early as december 25 2010 these forecasts gained confidence as event approached with a focus on ozarks and adjacent areas supercells developed in this area during night of december 30 and tracked across central missouri producing several tornadoes and large hail however bulk of activity during outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from oklahoma to illinois producing five ef3 tornadoes one of these tracked through northwestern arkansas killing four another tore through eastern sections of fort leonard wood in missouri destroying 159 homes and causing us 90 million in damage making it costliest tornado of outbreak a separate cluster of storms later developed in louisiana before tracking into mississippi producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of state on january 1 meteorological synopsis thumb left plot of all tornado touchdowns during outbreak storm prediction center spc began to note possibility that a severe weather event could develop on december 30 as early as december 25 2010 nonetheless predictability of event was too low as event was several days out as anticipated event grew closer confidence in forecast slowly increased though uncertainties in timing and extent of tornado outbreak still existed these uncertainties remained through december 29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts however spc indicated that discrete tornadic supercells and more severe thunderstorms could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from forecast in contrast forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for new year s eve spc issued a slight risk outlook for much of lower mississippi valley and ozarks as a result atmospheric conditions remained only marginally conducive for development of thunderstorms on morning of december 30 throughout day moisture was drawn from gulf of mexico northward into ozarks region however presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing during evening of december 30 an area of strong wind shear developed near ark la tex and southeastern oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front providing a focal point for potential storm development late that day scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern oklahoma and northern arkansas producing significant hail over next few hours and into december 31 these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern missouri producing four tornadoes first tornado watch issued in association with severe event was issued at 07 06 utc on december 31 as these storms tracked across ozarks after a few hours these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as they neared greater st louis metropolitan area while cluster of thunderstorms was tracking through missouri a new squall line with embedded supercells developed across eastern oklahoma and kansas demarcating a dry line boundary although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes these storms tracked eastward into southwestern missouri and eventually produced several tornadoes a long tracked ef3 developed from one of these supercells and struck cincinnati arkansas at 13 31 utc on december 31 a tornado watch was issued for much of missouri and portions of arkansas and illinois most of tornadoes during outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through missouri and illinois throughout day at around noon a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern louisiana and southern mississippi although these storms were initially weak they gradually intensified into supercells as day went on additional supercells quickly developed over louisiana and eventually spread in coverage over mississippi resulting in development of several tornadoes reaching their peak strength over mississippi storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on december 31 and into january 1 2011 by morning hours of january 1 severe activity had become restricted to florida panhandle and southern alabama last tornado watch issued in association with 2010 new year s eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15 56 utc that day tornadoes december 30
