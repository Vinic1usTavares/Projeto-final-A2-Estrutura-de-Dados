duncan class was a class of six pre dreadnought battleships built for royal navy in early 1900s six ships and were ordered in response to russian naval building specifically fast second class battleships of which they were specifically to counter foremost design consideration was a high top speed to match rumoured and incorrect top speed of of russian ships while maintaining same battery of guns and keeping displacement from growing this forced significant compromises in armour protection though ships adopted a revised system of protection for bow which was copied in other designs like all members of class served in mediterranean fleet after completion thereafter joining home channel and atlantic fleets over next ten years in 1906 montagu was wrecked off lundy island and could not be salvaged period passed largely uneventfully for other members of class following outbreak of first world war in august 1914 ships were sent to reinforce grand fleet where they were used on northern patrol to help blockade germany in november russell and exmouth bombarded zeebrugge but otherwise duncans saw no action in first months of war cornwallis participated in dardanelles campaign beginning in early 1915 and most of other members of class joined her there over course of year duncan instead served in atlantic and later in adriatic sea and albemarle remained with grand fleet and later went to murmansk russia to guard port russell and cornwallis were sunk by german u boats in april 1916 and january 1917 respectively three surviving members of class saw little activity in final two years of war though duncan and exmouth were involved in allied intervention in greece all three ships were ultimately sold for scrap in immediate post war reduction in naval strength and were broken up in 1920 design thumb left russian battleship duncans were ordered to counter six ships of duncan class were ordered in response to russian s that begun construction in mid 1890s at time british mistakenly believed russian vessels were capable of a top speed of though they were not that fast in service so director of naval construction william henry white set about designing a british response his initial proposals were completed by february 1898 but board of admiralty decided that more work would be required on new ships and so modified versions of preceding would be ordered in meantime these ships incorporated some of aspects of white s design namely revised armour protection layout in bow which abandoned heavy transverse bulkhead that connected both ends of armoured belt in favour of continuing side armour all way to stem albeit at reduced thickness these became five s white then returned to working on design for response to peresvet completing a revised version on 14 june 1898 to achieve desired speed of 19 knots while keeping displacement about less than formidables and retaining same battery of four guns carried by earlier british battleships white was forced to make significant reductions particularly in terms of armour protection as such they represented an evolution of smaller rather than a direct development of formidable or london types duncan class was about a thousand tons heavier than canopus class and with that increase in displacement they acquired more powerful guns heavier armour and an improvement in top speed by one to two knots despite these improvements duncans proved to be disappointments in service owing to their reduced defensive characteristics which rendered them inferior to true first class battleships to which they were inevitably compared nevertheless they were still markedly superior to peresvets they had been built to counter and they were some of fastest battleships in service at time they were built minor revisions to dimensions were made between june and september when finalised design was approved with tenders for shipyard contracts being sent out following month public pressure over 1898 programme first three londons that were supposedly slower than peresvets led to passage of a special supplementary programme that allocated funding for first four duncans all of which were laid down in 1899 two more were added under 1899 programme general characteristics and machinery thumb left right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1915 duncan class ships were long overall with a beam of and a draft of duncan class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded they had two pole masts fitted with fighting tops each top carried a searchlight and four additional searchlights were mounted on forward and aft bridges ships hulls were divided with longitudinal bulkheads that should have allowed for counter flooding to offset underwater damage but equipment necessary to quickly flood a compartment was insufficient as was typical in many british pre dreadnought designs decision to adopt longitudinal bulkheads was made in large part to keep reserve stability low since that made ships more stable gun platforms their crew numbered 720 officers and ratings though this varied over course of their careers in 1904 russell had a crew of 736 and while serving as a flagship that same year exmouth had a crew of 762 during first world war in 1915 russells crew had grown to 781 ships were fitted with type 1 wireless telegraphy sets with exception of exmouth which received type 2 sets remainder of class had their type 1s replaced with type 2 sets later in their career except for montagu which had already been wrecked by that time cornwallis and russell eventually received type 3 wireless transmitters ships carried a number of small boats that varied over course of their careers including a variety of steam and sail pinnaces steam launches cutters whalers gigs dinghies and rafts duncan class ships were powered by a pair of 4 cylinder triple expansion engines that drove two inward turning four bladed screws steam was provided by twenty four belleville boilers boilers were divided into four boiler rooms two of which contained eight boilers each and other two with four boilers per room they were trunked into two closely spaced funnels located amidships duncan class ships had a top speed of from though on speed trials their maximum speed ranged from with power slightly exceeding design figure at a cruising speed of ship could steam for armament thumb two turrets for cornwallis under construction duncans had four 12 inch 40 calibre guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft these were same guns and mountings carried aboard formidable and london classes although their barbettes were reduced in diameter as a weight saving measure to account for slightly narrower barbettes gun houses also had to be reduced in size though guns were carried in same bvi type mountings mounts had a range of elevation from 5 degrees to of 13 5 degrees and required guns to return to 4 5 degrees to be loaded guns had a muzzle velocity of and they were capable of penetrating 12 inches of krupp armour at a range of at their maximum elevation guns had a range of ships also mounted twelve 45 calibre guns mounted in casemates same battery carried by earlier british battleships casemates were sponsoned further out from sides of hull however to improve their firing arcs while reducing blast effects on hull when guns fired ahead or astern designers considered moving two of guns per side to upper deck to improve their fighting capabilities in heavy seas but decided that such an arrangement would hamper ammunition movement from magazines guns had a muzzle velocity of these guns could penetrate six of krupp armour at maximum elevation was 14 degrees which allowed guns to engage targets out to for defence against torpedo boats they carried ten 12 pounder guns and six 3 pounder guns as was customary for battleships of period they were also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in hull in 1915 five surviving ships received two anti aircraft guns albemarle duncan and probably exmouth had theirs installed on their aft superstructure while russell had hers mounted on her quarterdeck and cornwallis had her guns placed atop their forwardmost casemates between 1916 and 1917 albemarle had her casemate guns removed with four of 6 inch guns being relocated to 12 pounder battery and two of those guns being removed to make room 6 inch guns were placed in shielded pivot mounts in 1917 1918 albemarle had rest of her 12 pounders removed altogether armour duncan class adopted basic armour layout of formidable class but with significant revision to forward armour scheme and with significantly thinner levels of protection earlier battleship designs had employed a partial armoured belt that terminated abreast of both of main battery turrets ends of belt were connected by way of transverse bulkheads to create a central citadel that protected ships magazines and propulsion machinery spaces this arrangement left bow and stern unprotected and thus highly vulnerable to enemy fire white was concerned that unprotected bow could be flooded by even light gunfire which would reduce speed and maneuverability since duncans were intended to serve as fast battleships white decided to reduce risk of this kind of damage by discarding forward transverse bulkhead in favor of a complete belt main portion of belt was thick and extended to just forward of fore turret thereafter being gradually reduced to then then to and finally to close to stem aft end of ship retained traditional transverse bulkhead which was also 7 in thick abaft of bulkhead hull was protected by a strake of thick side armour horizontal protection consisted of a pair of armoured decks that covered ships vitals main deck ran from stem to aft bulkhead and was connected to top of belt it was 1 to 2 in thick with thicker armour over central portion of ship and thinner steel over bow second deck at middle deck level was 1 in thick and covered just central citadel sloping down on sides to belt voids created between decks and behind belt were used to store coal which had added benefit of increasing strength of side protection layout bow and stern had a curved armour deck below waterline that extended from barbettes to either end of hull which was 1 to 2 in thick ships main battery turrets faces and sides were thick with rears and 2 3 in roofs turrets sat atop barbettes that were on outer face above belt and 7 in thick behind belt their inner faces were reduced to 10 and 4 inches thick respectively casemate battery was protected with of armour plate and their ammunition hoists received 2 in of armour protection ships forward conning towers had 10 12 in sides and their aft conning towers had 3 in sides construction thumb launch of

tenure in unit was relatively short lived with all of vessels being reassigned to channel fleet in 1905 exmouth and russell had already left mediterranean fleet by that point doing a brief stint in home fleet in 1904 before joining their sisters in channel fleet on 30 may 1906 montagu ran aground on lundy island after lengthy attempts to repair and refloat ship failed she was abandoned and broken up in situ five surviving ships moved to atlantic fleet in 1907 though duncan and exmouth left for another tour with mediterranean fleet in 1908 cornwallis and russell joined them there following year in july 1908 russell albemarle duncan and exmouth visited canada during quebec tercentenary albemarle remained in atlantic until 1910 when she was reassigned to home fleet other four ships joined her there in 1912 and together they formed first 4th battle squadron and later 6th battle squadron they remained in 6th squadron until outbreak of first world war in august 1914 thumb left cornwallis firing during operations off dardanelles with onset of hostilities admiral john jellicoe commander of grand fleet requested that 6th squadron ships be sent to strengthen main british fleet in accordance with pre war plans five duncans were used to reinforce cruisers on northern patrol maintaining distant blockade of germany while serving with grand fleet ships were assigned to 3rd battle squadron on 2 november they were transferred to channel fleet owing to increased german naval activity in southern north sea there they reconstituted 6th squadron on 14 november russell and exmouth bombarded german occupied zeebrugge which was being used as an advance naval base for u boats in late november though they inflicted little damage and germans quickly resumed operations there ships were used to guard southern british coast against german attacks through end of year and in first half of 1915 6th squadron was gradually dispersed cornwallis was first to leave in january 1915 when she was sent to join dardanelles campaign against ottoman empire she participated in numerous attacks on coastal fortresses guarding dardanelles all of which failed to break through leading to gallipoli campaign which cornwallis also supported albemarle was recalled to grand fleet for further duty on northern patrol in april in may exmouth was also sent to reinforce dardanelles squadron fitted with heavy anti torpedo nets she was only battleship stationed forward at just outside straits owing to increased threat of german u boats in area duncan was reassigned to finisterre azores madeira station in july 1915 thereafter joining italian fleet in adriatic where she saw little activity russell was transferred to dardanelles campaign in november 1915 albemarle was to have gone at same time but she was badly damaged in a storm and was unable to make voyage russell saw little activity there apart from supporting evacuation of cape helles in january 1916 albemarle remained with grand fleet through january 1916 when she was assigned as a guard ship for russian port of murmansk while cruising off malta on 27 april 1916 russell struck a pair of naval mines that had been laid by u boat she quickly caught fire exploded and then capsized and sank with loss of 125 of her crew cornwallis met a similar fate on 9 january 1917 when she was torpedoed and sunk by though she remained afloat long enough for most of her crew to be evacuated by escorting destroyers only fifteen men were killed in sinking exmouth and duncan were stationed in salonika greece during allied intervention in noemvriana coup in 1916 both ships sent men ashore as part of intervention albemarle returned to britain in september 1916 and was laid up for rest of her existence she exmouth and duncan survived war and all three were eventually broken up for scrap in 1920 notes references further reading external links dreadnought project category battleship classes category ship classes of royal navy duncan
