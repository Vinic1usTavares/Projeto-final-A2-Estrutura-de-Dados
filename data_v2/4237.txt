europium is a chemical element with symbol eu and atomic number 63 europium is most reactive lanthanide by far having to be stored under an inert fluid to protect it from atmospheric oxygen or moisture europium is also softest lanthanide as it can be dented with a finger nail and easily cut with a knife when oxidation is removed a shiny white metal is visible europium was isolated in 1901 and is named after continent of europe being a typical member of lanthanide series europium usually assumes oxidation state 3 but oxidation state 2 is also common all europium compounds with oxidation state 2 are slightly reducing europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non toxic compared to other heavy metals most applications of europium exploit phosphorescence of europium compounds europium is one of rarest of rare earth elements on earth stwertka albert a guide to elements oxford university press 1996 p 156 characteristics physical properties thumb left about 300 g of dendritic sublimated 99 998 pure europium handled in a glove box thumb left oxidized europium coated with yellow europium ii carbonate europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead it crystallizes in a body centered cubic lattice some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half filled electron shell europium has second lowest melting point and lowest density of all lanthanides europium becomes a superconductor when it is cooled below 1 8 k and compressed to above 80 gpa this occurs because europium is divalent in metallic state and is converted into trivalent state by applied pressure in divalent state strong local magnetic moment j 7 2 suppresses superconductivity which is induced by eliminating this local moment j 0 in eu3 chemical properties europium is most reactive rare earth element it rapidly oxidizes in air so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter sized sample occurs within several days its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium and reaction is 2 eu 6 h2o 2 eu oh 3 3 h2 because of high reactivity samples of solid europium rarely have shiny appearance of fresh metal even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil europium ignites in air at 150 to 180 degc to form europium iii oxide 4 eu 3 o2 2 eu2o3 europium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form pale pink solutions of hydrated eu iii which exist as a 2 eu 3 h2so4 18 h2o 2 eu h2o 9 3 3 3 h2 eu ii vs eu iii although usually trivalent europium readily forms divalent compounds this behavior is unusual for most lanthanides which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of 3 2 state has an electron configuration because half filled f shell provides more stability in terms of size and coordination number europium ii and barium ii are similar sulfates of both barium and europium ii are also highly insoluble in water divalent europium is a mild reducing agent oxidizing in air to form eu iii compounds in anaerobic and particularly geothermal conditions divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and other alkaline earths this ion exchange process is basis of negative europium anomaly low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite relative to chondritic abundance bastnasite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite and hence is major source of europium today development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from other trivalent lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration as it usually is isotopes naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 isotopes 151eu and 153eu which occur in almost equal proportions 153eu is slightly more abundant 52 2 natural abundance while 153eu is stable 151eu was found to be unstable to alpha decay with a half life of in 2007 giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium this value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions besides natural radioisotope 151eu 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized most stable being with a half life of 36 9 years 152eu with a half life of 13 516 years and 154eu with a half life of 8 593 years all remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives shorter than 4 7612 years and majority of these have half lives shorter than 12 2 seconds this element also has 8 meta states with most stable being t1 2 12 8 hours t1 2 9 3116 hours and t1 2 96 minutes primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than 153eu is electron capture and primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay primary decay products before 153eu are isotopes of samarium sm and primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium gd europium as a nuclear fission product thermal neutron capture cross 2 europium is produced by nuclear fission but fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near top of mass range for fission products as with other lanthanides many isotopes of europium especially those that have odd mass numbers or are neutron poor like 152eu have high cross sections for neutron capture often high enough to be neutron poisons 151eu is beta decay product of samarium 151 but since this has a long decay half life and short mean time to neutron absorption most 151sm instead ends up as 152sm 152eu half life 13 516 years and 154eu half life 8 593 years cannot be beta decay products because 152sm and 154sm are non radioactive but 154eu is only long lived shielded nuclide other than 134cs to have a fission yield of more than 2 5 parts per million fissions tables of nuclear data japan atomic energy agency a larger amount of 154eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of non radioactive 153eu however much of this is further converted to 155eu 155eu half life 4 7612 years has a fission yield of 330 parts per million ppm for uranium 235 and thermal neutrons most of it is transmuted to non radioactive and gadolinium 156 by end of fuel overall europium is overshadowed by caesium 137 and strontium 90 as a radiation hazard and by samarium and others as a neutron poison occurrence left thumb monazite europium is not found in nature as a free element many minerals contain europium with most important sources being bastnasite monazite xenotime and loparite ce no europium dominant minerals are known yet despite a single find of a tiny possible eu o or eu o c system phase in moon s regolith depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as europium anomaly europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand processes that form igneous rocks rocks that cooled from magma or lava nature of europium anomaly found helps reconstruct relationships within a suite of igneous rocks average crustal abundance of europium is 2 2 2 ppm divalent europium eu2 in small amounts is activator of bright blue fluorescence of some samples of mineral fluorite reduction from eu3 to eu2 is induced by irradiation with energetic particles most outstanding examples of this originated around weardale and adjacent parts of northern england it was fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852 although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be cause in astrophysics signature of europium in stellar spectra can be used to classify stars and inform theories of how or where a particular star was born for instance astronomers recently identified higher than expected levels of europium within star 4535 hypothesizing that this star originated in a dwarf galaxy that collided with milky way billions of years ago production europium is associated with other rare earth elements and is therefore mined together with them separation of rare earth elements occurs during later processing rare earth elements are found in minerals bastnasite loparite ce xenotime and monazite in mineable quantities bastnasite is a group of related ln co3 f oh monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals ln denotes a mixture of all lanthanides except promethium loparite ce is an oxide and xenotime is an orthophosphate y yb er po4 monazite also contains thorium and yttrium which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive for extraction from ore and isolation of individual lanthanides several methods have been developed choice of method is based on concentration and composition of ore and on distribution of individual lanthanides in resulting concentrate roasting ore followed by acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides if cerium is dominant lanthanide then it is converted from cerium iii to cerium iv and then precipitated further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium this fraction is reduced with zinc zinc amalgam electrolysis or other methods converting europium iii to europium ii europium ii reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as a carbonate or co precipitated with barium sulfate europium metal is available through electrolysis of a mixture of molten eucl3 and nacl or cacl2 in a graphite cell which serves as cathode using graphite as anode other product is chlorine gas a few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of world production bayan obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnasite and monazite and is with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare earth element oxides largest known deposit mining operations at bayan obo deposit made china largest supplier of rare

nitride eun history although europium is present in most of minerals containing other rare elements due to difficulties in separating elements it was not until late 1800s that element was isolated william crookes observed phosphorescent spectra of rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium europium was first found in 1892 by paul emile lecoq de boisbaudran who obtained basic fractions from samarium gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium however discovery of europium is generally credited to french chemist eugene anatole demarcay who suspected samples of recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901 he then named it europium when europium doped yttrium red phosphor was discovered in early 1960s and understood to be about to cause a revolution in color television industry there was a scramble for limited supply of europium on hand among monazite processors as typical europium content in monazite is about 0 05 however bastnasite deposit at mountain pass rare earth mine california whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0 1 was about to come on line and provide sufficient europium to sustain industry prior to europium color tv red phosphor was very weak and other phosphor colors had to be muted to maintain color balance with brilliant red europium phosphor it was no longer necessary to mute other colors and a much brighter color tv picture was result europium has continued to be in use in tv industry ever since as well as in computer monitors californian bastnasite now faces stiff competition from bayan obo china with an even richer europium content of 0 2 frank spedding celebrated for his development of ion exchange technology that revolutionized rare earth industry in mid 1950s once related story of how he was lecturing on rare earths in 1930s when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide this was an unheard of quantity at time and spedding did not take man seriously however a package duly arrived in mail containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide elderly gentleman had turned out to be herbert newby mccoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry applications left thumb europium is one of elements involved in emitting red light in crt televisions relative to most other elements commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized almost invariably its phosphorescence is exploited either in 2 or 3 oxidation state it is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices europium oxide eu2o3 is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps and as an activator for yttrium based phosphors color tv screens contain between 0 5 and 1 g of europium oxide whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on composition of host structure uv to deep red luminescence can be achieved two classes of europium based phosphor red and blue combined with yellow green terbium phosphors give white light color temperature of which can be varied by altering proportion or specific composition of individual phosphors this phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs combining same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in tv and computer screens but as an additive it can be particularly effective in improving intensity of red phosphor europium is also used in manufacture of fluorescent glass increasing general efficiency of fluorescent lamps one of more common persistent after glow phosphors besides copper doped zinc sulfide is europium doped strontium aluminate europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug discovery screens it is also used in anti counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes an application that has almost fallen out of use with introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is use of europium complexes such as eu 3 as shift reagents in nmr spectroscopy chiral shift reagents such as eu hfc 3 are still used to determine purity a recent 2015 application of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information for days at a time these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk like device and shipped around quantum hard drive breakthrough phys org 8 january 2015 precautions
