63rd street tunnel is a double deck subway and railroad tunnel under east river between boroughs of manhattan and queens in new york city it is newest of east river tunnels and newest rail river crossing in new york metropolitan area upper level of 63rd street tunnel carries ind 63rd street line of new york city subway tunnel s lower level is unused but will carry long island rail road trains to a new train terminal under grand central terminal following expected completion of east side access project by 2023 construction of 63rd street tunnel began in 1969 and tunnel was holed through beneath roosevelt island in 1972 completion of tunnel and its connections was delayed by 1975 new york city fiscal crisis and upper level was not opened until 1989 twenty years after construction started lower level was never opened because of cancellation of lirr route to manhattan tunnel was initially referred to as tunnel to nowhere because its queens end did not connect to any other subway line until 2001 construction on east side access and completion of lower level started in 2006 history planning in february 1963 new york city transit authority nycta proposed a two track east river subway tunnel under 76th street with unspecified connections to rest of transit network at a cost of 139 million proposed site of tunnel was switched to 59th street on a may 2 1963 report on may 24 mayor wagner suggested that a tunnel around 61st street be built with all deliberate speed several months later on october 17 board of estimate approved a new east river tunnel sited at 64th street noting that it would cost 30 million and take seven years to build 64th street site was said to be 5 3 million less expensive because of easier grades and smaller curves route was changed to 63rd street because officials at rockefeller institute at 64th street feared that heavy construction and later train movements so close to institute s buildings might have adversely affected delicate instruments at institute and affect accuracy of research being conducted a third track was added to plans for tunnel in april 1966 track would serve long island rail road lirr trains to east midtown alleviating train traffic into pennsylvania station that august a fourth track was added to plans after it was determined that lirr trains would be too large to run on subway tracks this amendment increased number of lirr tracks to two and provided dedicated tracks for lirr and subway in november 1967 voters approved a 2 5 billion transportation bond issue and in early 1968 under program for action officials provided detailed plans for how it would be used among many other projects proposal included construction of 63rd street tunnel to host a proposed 63rd street southeast queens subway line on upper level connecting to a super express line and archer avenue lines in queens and an lirr branch traveling to a new railroad terminal in manhattan on lower level construction construction on project began on november 24 1969 four prefabricated sections of 63rd street tunnel were constructed at port deposit maryland then towed to new york and sunk under east river first of tunnel segments was delivered in may 1971 and was lowered into place on august 29 1971 last section was lowered on march 14 1972 double deck tunnel under east river was holed through on october 10 1972 with separate sections of tunnels being connected estimated cost of project was 341 million and mta applied for 227 million in federal funds one section of tunnel was controversial because it called for of cut and cover tunneling which would require digging an open trench through central park in manhattan in june 1970 mayor john lindsay told city engineers to write a report that studied ways to reduce project s impact results of report released in january 1971 called for using tunnel boring machines underneath central park to reduce disruption following month nycta published advertisements in newspapers seeking construction bids for tunnels under central park but withdrew them after objections from community and conservation groups nycta agreed to halve width of proposed wide cut which resulted in a proportionate decrease in area of affected parkland nycta also agreed to reduce disruption to heckscher playground located above proposed subway tunnel s path by cutting construction time from three years to two years and by constructing a temporary playground nearby sections that connected to existing broadway and sixth avenue lines were holed through on october 11 1973 construction on section between 5th avenue and park avenue began in august 1974 project involved digging a high cavern underneath street on march 20 1975 new york mayor abraham beame announced significant cutbacks to plan construction of southeastern queens extension was deferred until 1981 and long island rail road extension through lower level of 63rd street tunnel was canceled for foreseeable future tunnel was 95 complete by january 1976 but later that year nycta announced that it will take an extra five or six years until 1987 or 1988 to complete new manhattan queens trunk subway line from central park to jamaica via new 63rd street tunnel main cause of delay was a proposed 5 8 mile super express bypass in queens upper level was completed in 1976 but due to 1975 new york city fiscal crisis there was no funding to extend tunnel in queens east of 21st street queensbridge station new york times reported that lower level of 63rd street tunnel was still under construction by 1976 even though it would remain unused indefinitely richard mta chairman said that to stop work was so costly as to make it impractical subsequent to construction of subway portion in reality lower level of 63rd street tunnel was completed along with upper subway level but could not be used due to its lack of connections on either side in 1979 mta started studying four options for making upper level of tunnel more useful 63rd street subway tunnel more setbacks for a troubled project new york times november 1 1984 page b1 ultimately agreed on plan was to connect tunnel to local tracks of ind queens boulevard line in queens at a cost of 222 million and a timetable of at least eight years by june 1985 project was again delayed indefinitely after it was found that tunnel had been flooded with of water and several girders and electrical equipment had also deteriorated two contractors were hired to assess structural integrity of tunnel and delay was estimated at two years by february 1987 mta s contractors had concluded that tunnel was structurally sound although federal funding had not yet been released mta approved a new plan to have tunnel open to 21st street queensbridge by october 1989 opening of upper level alt roosevelt island station left thumb roosevelt island station ind 63rd street line went into service on october 29 1989 twenty years after construction began with new stations at lexington avenue roosevelt island and 21st street 41st avenue in queens line was served by trains on weekdays and trains on weekends connector to queens boulevard line had not yet started construction it was nicknamed tunnel to nowhere due to its lack of connections in queens planning for connection to ind queens boulevard line began in december 1990 with final design contract awarded in december 1992 two build alternatives were evaluated a connection to local tracks of queens boulevard line and a connection to local and express tracks goal of project was to increase capacity on queens boulevard by 33 and to eliminate dead end terminal at 21st street queensbridge bellmouths were constructed to allow for a future bypass line through sunnyside yard remaining section from 21st street to queens boulevard line which cost 645 million began construction on september 22 1994 construction project involved a number of other elements such as extending lower level lirr tunnel and widening queens boulevard line tunnel above in december 2000 63rd street connector was opened for construction reroutes connector was open for off peak reroutes on january 13 2001 while signal work was performed in 53rd street tunnel regular service was expected to begin by august or september of that year but september 11 2001 terrorist attacks delayed commencement of regular service connector came into regular use on december 16 2001 with start of v service in 53rd street tunnel and rerouting of f service at all times to 63rd street completion of lower level plans were made in 1995 to bring lirr service to east midtown and had resurfaced by turn of century by that time lirr was busiest commuter railroad in united states with an average of 269 400 passengers each weekday in 1999 penn station located on west side was operating at capacity due to a complex track interlocking and limited capacity in east river tunnels in 1999 mta proposed a 17 billion five year capital budget which included a 1 6 billion lirr connection to a new station under grand central terminal to be built as part of a project called east side access project s final environmental impact assessment feis was released in march 2001 two months later federal transit administration fta gave a favorable record of decision a mark of approval to east side access after reviewing project s feis september 11 attacks underscored need to bring lirr service to grand central as lirr president kenneth j bauer stated if something happened at east river tunnel you wouldn t be able to run trains to penn station in 2002 congress passed a bill that allocated 132 million for infrastructure projects in new york state of which 14 7 million was to go toward funding east side access approval of a final design for east side access was granted in 2002 and first properties for east side access were acquired in 2003 alt a tunnel cavern located north of new grand central lirr station with two tubes diverging from cavern a railroad switch will be installed within cavern connecting tracks that run through tubes left thumb a tunnel cavern deep under park avenue which will house a switch to north of new lirr station construction contract for a tunnel in manhattan westward and southward from dormant lower level of 63rd street tunnel to new station beneath grand central terminal was awarded in july 2006 first tunnel boring machine was launched westbound then southbound from 63rd street tunnel in september 2007 and it reached grand central terminal in july 2008 second machine began boring a parallel tunnel in december 2007 and had completed its tunnel at 37th street on september 30 2008 mta esa progress map metropolitan transportation authority retrieved october 9 2008 on queens side work included extending tunnel under northern boulevard and boring four tunnels under sunnyside yard this was a particularly delicate and expensive task due to existence of elevated bmt astoria line and underground ind queens boulevard line directly above a temporary narrow gauge railway and a conveyor belt system were constructed behind tunnel boring machines and through 63rd street tunnels to queens bell mouth an 83 million cut structure was built which extends tracks under northern boulevard into sunnyside yard and then was covered with a deck new york s subway system finally starting major expansion newyork construction com may 2006 issue in september 2009 mta awarded granite traylor joint venture a 659 2 million contract to employ two 500 ton slurry tunnel boring machines to create tunnels connecting lirr main line and port washington branch to 63rd street tunnel under 41st avenue four tunnels with precast concrete liners total in length two tunnel boring machines began digging on queens side in april 2011 on december 22 2011 breakthrough was achieved in tunnel a of four queens tunnel drives from 63rd street tunnel bellmouth by july 25 2012 all four queens tunnel drives were complete thumb lower level tracks on january 27 2016 final major contract for construction of east side access was awarded for construction of four railroad platforms and eight tracks for new grand central terminal project was initially scheduled to be completed by 2009 but opening date of east side access was tentatively projected to be december 2023 or late 2023 mta was looking to start passenger service in december 2022 at an estimated cost of 11 1 billion construction methods unlike other underwater rail tunnels in new york city which were bored under riverbed 63rd street tunnel s river portions were built using immersed tube method trenches were dug in river bed and four long prefabricated concrete sections of tunnel fabricated in port deposit maryland were floated into position and then sunk into trenches two tubes were placed on each side of roosevelt island each of which were prefabricated sections tubes extended under water from 63rd street and fdr drive on manhattan waterfront to 41st avenue and vernon boulevard on queens waterfront construction shafts at queensbridge park in queens as well as on roosevelt island were turned into ventilation shafts after conclusion of construction other portions of tunnel were built using cut and cover construction or rock tunneling waste material from 63rd street tunnel s construction was deposited at tip of roosevelt island as well as off coast of astoria queens over of spoil had to be extracted usage tunnel has two levels two tracks on upper level connecting ind queens boulevard line in queens to ind sixth avenue line in manhattan via ind 63rd street line are used by there are also track connections to and from bmt 63rd street line west of lexington avenue 63rd street station tunnel west of 21st street queensbridge was placed into service in 1989 final section of 63rd street tunnel connecting 21st street station to queens boulevard line officially opened on december 17 2001 two trackways on lower level were unused when tunnel construction project was halted in 1970s they are planned to be used by long island rail road s east side access project which will bring lirr commuter trains to grand central terminal during construction of east side access project lower level of 63rd street tunnel was used to transport equipment laying of permanent tracks started in september 2017 due to low vertical clearances in lower level rail cars such as lirr s c3 fleet would not be able to serve grand central when tunnel is complete during tunnel s construction an alignment underneath central and queensbridge parks was decided as only feasible route for tunnel because 63rd street tunnel is at such a deep level there are several ventilation shafts along its route in central park near central park zoo there are several ventilation grates that are at same level as ground covering about of surface area a ventilation building was deemed to be architecturally unacceptable hence inclusion of several grates on other hand gratings at queensbridge park were declared to be unfeasible due to park s small usable area therefore a ventilation building stands in queensbridge park measuring additional ventilation shafts are located at second avenue and 63rd street in manhattan and on western shore of roosevelt island when 63rd street connector was constructed in 1990s additional ventilation structures were built at 29th and 39th streets in queens awards 63rd street tunnel and 63rd street tunnel connector received construction achievement project of year award from metropolitan section of american society of civil engineers in 1973 and 2000 respectively 63rd street tunnel connector was also selected as transit project of year in 1999 by new york
