dramatic and narrative levels it employs some of conventions of film noir among them character of a femme fatale narration by protagonist in original release chiaroscuro cinematography and giving hero a questionable moral outlook extended to include reflections upon nature of his own humanity barlow aaron reel toads and imaginary cities philip k dick blade runner and contemporary science fiction movie in brooker pp 43 deborah rachael papers in search of blade runners femme fatale in brooker pp 159 172 it is a literate science fiction film thematically enfolding philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in context of classical greek drama and hubris it also draws on biblical images such as noah s flood kerman judith b post millennium blade runner in brooker pp 31 39 and literary sources such as frankenstein alessio dominic redemption race religion reality and far right science fiction film adaptations of philip k dick in brooker pp 59 76 although scott said any similarity was merely coincidental sammon p 384 fans claimed that chess game between sebastian and tyrell was based on famous immortal game of 1851 blade runner delves into effects of technology on environment and society by reaching to past using literature religious symbolism classical dramatic themes and film noir techniques this tension between past present and future is represented in retrofitted future depicted in film one which is high tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere in an interview with observer in 2002 director ridley scott described film as extremely dark both literally and metaphorically with an oddly masochistic feel he also said that he liked idea of exploring pain in wake of his brother s death when he was ill i used to go and visit him in london and that was really traumatic for me a sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades world of film corporate power looms large police seem omnipresent vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings and consequences of huge biomedical power over individual are explored especially regarding replicants implanted memories control over environment is exercised on a vast scale and goes hand in hand with absence of any natural life for example artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors this oppressive backdrop explains frequently referenced migration of humans to off world extraterrestrial colonies eyes are a recurring motif as are manipulated images calling into question nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it bukatman pp 9 leonard g cutting edges of blade runner in kerman 1991 p 44 these thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for blade runners central theme of examining humanity in order to discover replicants an empathy test is used with a number of its questions focused on treatment of animals seemingly an essential indicator of one s humanity replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while mass of humanity on streets is cold and impersonal film goes so far as to question if deckard might be a replicant in process asking audience to re evaluate what it means to be human gwaltney marilyn androids as a device for reflection on personhood in kerman 1991 pp 32 39 question of whether deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since film s release bukatman pp 80 83 both michael deeley and harrison ford wanted deckard to be human while hampton fancher preferred ambiguity sammon p 362 ridley scott has stated that in his vision deckard is a replicant deckard s unicorn dream sequence inserted into scott s director s cut and concomitant with gaff s parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that deckard is a replicant because gaff could have retrieved deckard s implanted memories interpretation that deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe unicorn imagery shows that characters whether human or replicant share same dreams and recognize their affinity brooker peter imagining real blade runner and discourses on in brooker pp 9 222 or that absence of a decisive answer is crucial to film s main theme bukatman p 83 film s inherent ambiguity and uncertainty as well as its textual richness have permitted multiple interpretations hills matt academic textual poachers blade runner as cult canonical film in brooker pp 124 141 production casting actor james emmet f lewis casting film proved troublesome particularly for lead role of deckard screenwriter hampton fancher envisioned robert mitchum as deckard and wrote character s dialogue with mitchum in mind director ridley scott and film s producers spent months meeting and discussing role with dustin hoffman who eventually departed over differences in vision harrison ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons including his performance in star wars films ford s interest in blade runner story and discussions with steven spielberg who was finishing raiders of lost ark at time and strongly praised ford s work in film following his success in films like star wars 1977 and raiders of lost ark 1981 ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth according to production documents several actors were considered for role including gene hackman sean connery jack nicholson paul newman clint eastwood tommy lee jones arnold schwarzenegger al pacino and burt reynolds one role that was not difficult to cast was rutger hauer as roy batty violent yet thoughtful leader of replicants scott cast hauer without having met him based solely on hauer s performances in paul verhoeven s movies scott had seen katie soldier of orange and turkish delight hauer s portrayal of batty was regarded by philip k dick as perfect batty cold aryan flawless of many films hauer made blade runner was his favorite as he explained in a live chat in 2001 blade runner needs no explanation it just all of best there is nothing like it to be part of a real which changed world s thinking it s awesome hauer rewrote his character s tears in rain speech himself and presented words to scott on set prior to filming blade runner used a number of then lesser known actors sean young portrays rachael an experimental replicant implanted with memories of tyrell s niece causing her to believe she is human sammon pp 92 93 nina axelrod auditioned for role daryl hannah portrays pris a basic pleasure model replicant stacey nelkin auditioned for role but was given another part in film which was ultimately cut before filming casting pris and rachael was challenging requiring several screen tests with morgan paull playing role of deckard paull was cast as deckard s fellow bounty hunter holden based on his performances in tests brion james portrays leon kowalski a combat and laborer replicant and joanna cassidy portrays zhora an assassin

in early 1970s but dick was unimpressed with screenplay written by herb s son robert jaffe s screenplay was so terribly done robert flew down to santa ana to speak with me about project and first thing i said to him when he got off plane was shall i beat you up here at airport or shall i beat you up back at my apartment dick quoted in sammon p 23 screenplay by hampton fancher was optioned in 1977 sammon pp 23 30 producer michael deeley became interested in fancher s draft and convinced director ridley scott to film it scott had previously declined project but after leaving slow production of dune wanted a faster paced project to take his mind off his older brother s recent death sammon pp 43 49 he joined project on february 21 1980 and managed to push up promised filmways financing from us 13 million to 15 million fancher s script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion which are prominent in novel and scott wanted changes fancher found a

bukatman pp 18 19 sammon pp 64 67 dick became concerned that no one had informed him about film s production which added to his distrust of hollywood sammon pp 63 64 after dick criticized an early version of fancher s script in an article written for los angeles select tv guide studio sent dick peoples rewrite sammon pp 67 69 although dick died shortly before film s release he was pleased with rewritten script and with a 20 minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to studio despite his well known skepticism of hollywood in principle dick enthused to scott that world created for film looked exactly as he had imagined it sammon p 284 he said i saw a segment of douglas trumbull s special effects for blade runner on tv news i recognized it immediately it was my own interior world they caught it perfectly he also approved of film s script saying after i finished reading screenplay i got novel out and looked through it two reinforce each other so that someone who started with novel would enjoy movie and someone who started with movie would enjoy novel motion picture was dedicated to dick blade runner film dedication after credits 1 51 30 principal photography of blade runner began on march 9 1981 and ended four months later sammon p 98 in 1992 ford revealed blade runner is not one of my favorite films i tangled with ridley sammon p 211 apart from friction with director ford also disliked voiceovers when we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that version of film that we had agreed upon was version without voiceover narration it was a nightmare i thought that film had worked without narration but now i was stuck re creating that narration and i was obliged to do voiceovers for people that did not represent director s interests i went kicking and screaming to studio to record it sammon p 296 narration were written by an uncredited roland kibbee in 2006 scott was asked who s biggest pain in arse you ve ever worked with he replied it s got to be harrison he ll forgive me because now i get on with him now he s become charming but he knows a lot that s problem when we worked together it was my first film up and i was new kid on block but we made a good movie ford said of scott in 2000 i admire his work we had a bad patch there and i m over it in 2006 ford reflected on production of film saying what i remember more than anything else when i see blade runner is not 50 nights of shooting in rain but voiceover i was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another ridley scott confirmed in summer 2007 issue of total film that harrison ford contributed to blade runner special edition dvd and had already recorded his interviews harrison s fully on board said scott bradbury building in downtown los angeles served as a filming location and a warner bros backlot housed 2019 los angeles street sets other locations included ennis brown house and 2nd street tunnel test screenings resulted in several changes including adding a voice over a happy ending and removal of a holden hospital scene relationship between filmmakers and investors was difficult which culminated in deeley and scott being fired but still working on film crew members created t shirts during filming saying yes guv nor my ass that mocked scott s unfavorable comparison of u s and british crews scott responded with a t shirt of his own xenophobia sucks making incident known as t shirt war sammon p 218 design ridley scott credits edward hopper s painting nighthawks

animated film les du temps a decision that he later regretted production designer lawrence g paull and art director david snyder realized scott s and mead s sketches douglas trumbull and richard yuricich supervised special effects for film and mark stetson served as chief model maker blade runner has numerous deep similarities to fritz lang s metropolis including a built up urban environment in which wealthy literally live above workers dominated by a huge building tower in metropolis and tyrell building in blade runner special effects supervisor david dryer used stills from metropolis when lining up blade runners miniature building shots bukatman pp 61 63 sammon p 111 extended end scene in original theatrical release shows rachael and deckard traveling into daylight with pastoral
