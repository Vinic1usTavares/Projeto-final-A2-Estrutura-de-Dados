appaloosa is an american horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern there is a wide range of body types within breed stemming from influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history each horse s color pattern is genetically result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors color pattern of appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to leopard complex mutation lp appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness latter has been linked to leopard complex artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric cave paintings in europe images of domesticated horses with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from ancient greece and han dynasty china through early modern period in north america nez perce people of what today is united states pacific northwest developed original american breed settlers once referred to these spotted horses as palouse horse possibly after palouse river which ran through heart of nez perce country gradually name evolved into appaloosa nez perce lost most of their horses after nez perce war in 1877 and breed fell into decline for several decades a small number of dedicated breeders preserved appaloosa as a distinct breed until appaloosa horse club aphc was formed as breed registry in 1938 modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to foundation bloodstock of registry its partially open stud book allows addition of some thoroughbred american quarter horse and arabian blood today appaloosa is one of most popular breeds in united states it was named official state horse of idaho in 1975 it is best known as a stock horse used in a number of western riding disciplines but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of equestrian activity appaloosas have been used in many movies an appaloosa is mascot for florida state seminoles appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds including pony of americas nez perce horse and several gaited horse breeds breed characteristics thumb left upright mottling on skin is particularly visible around eyes and muzzle sclera of an appaloosa s eye is white alt head of a light colored horse with dark spots showing spotting around skin of eye and muzzle appaloosa is best known for its distinctive leopard complex spotted coat which is preferred in breed spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors there are three other distinctive core characteristics mottled skin striped hooves and eyes with a white sclera skin mottling is usually seen around muzzle eyes anus and genitalia striped hooves are a common trait quite noticeable on appaloosas but not unique to breed sclera is part of eye surrounding iris although all horses show white around eye if eye is rolled back to have a readily visible white sclera with eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in appaloosas than in other breeds because occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern aphc allows regular registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of other core characteristics horses with two aphc parents but no identifiable appaloosa characteristics are registered as non characteristic a limited special registration status there is a wide range of body types in appaloosa in part because leopard complex characteristics are its primary identifying factors and also because several different horse breeds influenced its development weight range varies from and heights from however aphc does not allow pony or draft breeding original old time or old type appaloosa was a tall narrow bodied rangy horse body style reflected a mix that started with traditional spanish horses already common on plains of america before 1700 then 18th century european bloodlines were added particularly those of pied horses popular in that period and shipped en masse to americas once color had become unfashionable in europe these horses were similar to a tall slim thoroughbred andalusian type of horse popular in bourbon era spain original appaloosa tended to have a convex facial profile that resembled that of warmblood jennet crosses first developed in 16th century during reign of charles v old type appaloosa was later modified by addition of draft horse blood after 1877 defeat of nez perce when u s government policy forced indians to become farmers and provided them with draft horse mares to breed to existing stallions original appaloosas frequently had a sparse mane and tail but that was not a primary characteristic as many early appaloosas did have full manes and tails there is a possible genetic link between leopard complex and sparse mane and tail growth although precise relationship is unknown after formation of appaloosa horse club in 1938 a more modern type of horse was developed after addition of american quarter horse and arabian bloodlines addition of quarter horse lines produced appaloosas that performed better in sprint racing and in halter competition many cutting and reining horses resulted from old type appaloosas crossed on arabian bloodlines particularly via appaloosa foundation stallion red eagle an infusion of thoroughbred blood was added during 1970s to produce horses more suited for racing many current breeders also attempt to breed away from sparse rat tail trait and therefore modern appaloosas have fuller manes and tails color and spotting patterns thumb few spot leopard appaloosa with wet coat showing halo effect of dark skin under white coat around spots coat color of an appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern base colors recognized by appaloosa horse club include bay black chestnut palomino buckskin cremello or roan gray dun and grulla appaloosa markings have several pattern variations it is this unique group of spotting patterns collectively called leopard complex that most people associate with appaloosa horse spots overlay darker skin and are often surrounded by a halo where skin next to spot is also dark but overlying hair coat is white it is not always easy to predict a grown appaloosa s color at birth foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair in addition appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics patterns sometimes change over course of horse s life although some such as blanket and leopard patterns tend to be stable horses with varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth developing more visible spotting as they get older aphc also recognizes concept of a solid horse which has a base color but no contrasting color in form of an appaloosa coat pattern solid horses can be registered if they have mottled skin and one other leopard complex characteristic base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category these patterns are described as follows pattern description image spots a horse that has white or dark spots over all or a portion of its body 100px blanket or snowcap a solid white area normally over but not limited to hip area with a contrasting base color 100px blanket with spots a white blanket which has dark spots within white spots are usually same color as horse s base color 100px leopard a white horse with dark spots that flow out over entire body considered an extension of a blanket to cover whole body 100px few spot leopard a mostly white horse with a bit of color remaining around flank neck and head 100px snowflake a horse with white spots flecks on a dark body typically white spots increase in number and size as horse ages 100px appaloosa roan marble or varnish roan a distinct version of leopard complex intermixed dark and light hairs with lighter colored area on forehead jowls and frontal bones of face over back loin and hips darker areas may appear along edges of frontal bones of face as well and also on legs stifle above eye point of hip and behind elbow dark points over bony areas are called varnish marks and distinguish this pattern from a traditional roan 100px mottled a leopard that is completely white with only mottled skin showing 100px roan blanket or frost horses with roaning over croup and hips blanket normally occurs over but is not limited to hip area 100px roan blanket with spots a horse with a roan blanket that has white and or dark spots within roan area 100px color genetics thumb upright striped hooves are a characteristic trait alt a brown and white striped horse hoof with a dark colored leg partially visible any horse that shows appaloosa core characteristics of coat pattern mottled skin striped hooves and a visible white sclera carries at least one allele of dominant leopard complex lp gene use of word complex is used to refer to large group of visible patterns that may occur when lp is present lp is an autosomal incomplete dominant mutation in trpm1 gene located at horse chromosome 1 eca 1 all horses with at least one copy of lp show leopard characteristics and it is hypothesized that lp acts together with other patterning genes that have not yet been identified to produce different coat patterns horses that are heterozygous for lp tend to be darker than homozygous horses but this is not consistent three single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in trpm1 gene have been identified as closely associated with lp mutation although mechanism by which pattern is produced remains unclear a commercially available dna based test is likely to be developed in near future which breeders can use to determine if lp is present in horses that do not have visible appaloosa characteristics not every appaloosa exhibits visible coat spotting but even apparently solid colored horses that carry at least one dominant lp allele will exhibit characteristics such as vertically striped hooves white sclera of eye and mottled skin around eyes lips and genitalia appaloosas may also exhibit sabino or pinto type markings but because pinto genes may cover up or obscure appaloosa patterns pinto breeding is discouraged by aphc which will deny registration to horses with excessive white markings genes that create these different patterns can all be present in same horse appaloosa project a genetic study group has researched interactions of appaloosa and pinto genes and how they affect each other history thumb left a 1674 painting of louis xiv on a spotted horse alt painting of a man holding a sword while riding a rearing horse recent research has suggested that eurasian prehistoric cave paintings depicting leopard spotted horses may have accurately reflected a phenotype of ancient wild horse domesticated horses with leopard complex spotting patterns have been depicted in art dating as far back as ancient greece ancient persia and han dynasty in china later depictions appeared in 11th century france and 12th century england french paintings from 16th and 17th centuries show horses with spotted coats being used as riding horses and other records indicate they were also used as coach horses at court of louis xiv of france in mid 18th century europe there was a great demand for horses with leopard complex spotting pattern among nobility and royalty these horses were used in schools of horsemanship for parade use and other forms of display modern horse breeds in europe today that have leopard complex spotting include and or horse spanish probably obtained spotted horses through trade with southern austria and hungary where color pattern was known to exist conquistadors and spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to americas when they first arrived in early 16th century one horse with snowflake patterning was listed with 16 horses brought to mexico by cortez and additional spotted horses were mentioned by spanish writers by 1604 others arrived in western hemisphere when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th century europe and were shipped to mexico california and oregon nez perce people thumb two nez

saddled and bridled nez perce people lived in what today is eastern washington oregon and north central idaho where they engaged in agriculture as well as horse breeding nez perce first obtained horses from shoshone around 1730 they took advantage of fact that they lived in excellent horse breeding country relatively safe from raids of other tribes and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals establishing breeding herds by 1750 they were one of few tribes that actively used practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from gene pool and thus were notable as horse breeders by early 19th century early nez perce horses were considered to be of high quality meriwether lewis of lewis and clark expedition wrote in his february 15 1806 journal entry their horses appear to be of an excellent race they are lofty formed active and durable in short many of them look like fine english and would make a figure in any country lewis did note spotting patterns saying some of these horses are pied with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with black brown bey or some other dark colour by pied lewis may have been referring to leopard spotted patterns seen in modern appaloosa though lewis also noted that much larger portion are of a uniform colour appaloosa horse club estimates that only about ten percent of horses owned by nez perce at time were spotted while nez perce originally had many solid colored horses and only began to emphasize color in their breeding some time after visit of lewis and clark by late 19th century they had many spotted horses as white settlers moved into traditional nez perce lands a successful trade in horses enriched nez perce who in 1861 bred horses described as elegant chargers fit to mount a prince at a time when ordinary horses could be purchased for 15 non indians who had purchased appaloosa horses from nez perce turned down offers of as much as 600 nez perce war peace with united states dated back to an alliance arranged by lewis and clark but encroachment of gold miners in 1860s and settlers in 1870s put pressure on nez perce although a treaty of 1855 originally allowed them to keep most of their traditional land another in 1863 reduced land allotted to them by 90 percent nez perce who refused to give up their land under 1863 treaty included a band living in wallowa valley of oregon led by widely known as chief joseph tensions rose and in may 1877 general oliver otis howard called a council and ordered non treaty bands to move to reservation chief joseph considered military resistance futile and by june 14 1877 had gathered about 600 people at a site near present day grangeville idaho but on that day a small group of warriors staged an attack on nearby white settlers which led to nez perce war after several small battles in idaho more than 800 nez perce mostly non warriors took 2000 head of various livestock including horses and fled into montana then traveled southeast dipping into yellowstone national park a small number of nez perce fighters probably fewer than 200 successfully held off larger forces of u s army in several skirmishes including two day battle of big hole in southwestern montana they then moved northeast and attempted to seek refuge with crow nation rebuffed they headed for safety in canada throughout this journey of about nez perce relied heavily on their fast agile and hardy appaloosa horses journey came to an end when they stopped to rest near bears paw mountains in montana from canada us border unbeknownst to nez perce colonel nelson a miles had led an infantry cavalry column from fort keogh in pursuit on october 5 1877 after a five day fight joseph surrendered battle and war was over with most of war chiefs dead and noncombatants cold and starving joseph declared that he would fight no more forever aftermath of nez perce war when u s 7th cavalry accepted surrender of chief joseph and remaining nez perce they immediately took more than 1 000 of tribe s horses sold what they could and shot many of rest but a significant population of horses had been left behind in wallowa valley when nez perce began their retreat and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along way nez perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central idaho were allowed few horses and were required by army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses nez perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of appaloosas in late 20th century they began a program to develop a new horse breed nez perce horse with intent to resurrect their horse culture tradition of selective breeding and horsemanship although a remnant population of appaloosa horses remained after 1877 they were virtually forgotten as a distinct breed for almost 60 years a few quality horses continued to be bred mostly those captured or purchased by settlers and used as working ranch horses others were used in circuses and related forms of entertainment such as buffalo bill s wild west show horses were originally called palouse horses by settlers a reference to palouse river that ran through heart of what was once nez perce country gradually name evolved into and then appaloosa other early variations of name included and in one 1948 book breed was called horse described as a hardy tough breed of indian and spanish horse used by of late 18th century to transport goods to new orleans for sale by 1950s appaloosa was regarded as correct spelling revitalization thumb alt an idaho car license plate with a running horse on left side horse is brown with a brown and white spotted rump state of idaho offers a license plate featuring appaloosa horse appaloosa came to attention of general public in january 1937 in western horseman magazine when francis d haines a history professor from lewiston idaho published an article describing breed s history and urging its preservation haines had performed extensive research traveling with a friend and appaloosa aficionado named george hatley visiting numerous nez perce villages collecting history and taking photographs article generated strong interest in horse breed and led to founding of appaloosa horse club aphc by claude thompson and a small group of other dedicated breeders in 1938 registry was originally housed in moro oregon but in 1947 organization moved to moscow idaho under leadership of george hatley appaloosa museum foundation was formed in 1975 to preserve history of appaloosa horse western horseman magazine and particularly its longtime publisher dick spencer continued to support and promote breed through many subsequent articles a significant crossbreeding influence used to revitalize appaloosa was arabian horse as evidenced by early registration lists that show arabian appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of first fifteen horses registered with aphc for example one of claude thompson s major herd sires was ferras an arabian stallion bred by w k kellogg from horses imported from crabbet arabian stud of england ferras sired red eagle a prominent appaloosa stallion added to appaloosa hall of fame in 1988 later thoroughbred and quarter horse lines were added as well as crosses from other breeds including morgans and standardbreds in 1983 aphc reduced number of allowable to three main breeds arabian horse american quarter horse and thoroughbred by 1978 aphc was third largest horse registry for light horse breeds from 1938 to 2007 more than 670 000 appaloosas were registered by aphc state of idaho adopted appaloosa as its official state horse on march 25 1975 when idaho governor cecil andrus signed enabling legislation idaho also offers

is included with most types of membership was at 32 000 in 2008 american appaloosa association was founded in 1983 by members opposed to registration of plain colored horses as a result of color rule controversy based in missouri it has a membership of more than 2 000 as of 2008 other appaloosa registries have been founded for horses with leopard complex genetics that are not affiliated with aphc these registries tend to have different foundation breeding and histories than north american appaloosa aphc is by far largest appaloosa horse registry and it hosts one of world s largest breed shows appaloosa is a breed defined by aphc bloodline requirements and preferred characteristics including coat pattern in other words appaloosa is a distinct breed from limited bloodlines with distinct physical traits and a desired color referred to as a color preference appaloosas are not strictly a color breed all aphc registered appaloosas must be offspring of two registered appaloosa parents or a registered appaloosa and a horse from an approved breed registry which includes arabian horses quarter horses and thoroughbreds in all cases one parent must always be a regular registered appaloosa only exception to bloodline requirements is in case of appaloosa colored geldings or mares with unknown pedigrees owners may apply for hardship registration for these non breeding horses aphc does not accept horses with draft pony pinto or paint breeding and requires mature appaloosas to stand at least if a horse has excessive white markings not associated with appaloosa pattern such as those characteristic of a pinto it cannot be registered unless it is verified through dna testing that both parents have aphc registration certain other characteristics are used to determine if a horse receives regular registration striped hooves white sclera visible when eye is in a normal position and mottled spotted skin around eyes lips and genitalia as appaloosa is one of few horse breeds to exhibit skin mottling this characteristic is a very basic and decisive indication of an appaloosa appaloosas born with visible coat pattern or mottled skin and at least one other characteristic are registered with regular papers and have full show and breeding privileges a horse that meets bloodline requirements but is born without recognized color pattern and characteristics can still be registered with aphc as a non characteristic appaloosa these solid colored non characteristic appaloosas may not be shown at aphc events unless owner verifies parentage through dna testing and pays a supplementary fee to enter horse into aphc s performance permit program ppp solid colored appaloosas are restricted in breeding color rule controversy thumb mare and foal aphc encourages early foal

horse club aphc and american quarter horse association aqha were in their formative years minimally marked or roan appaloosas were sometimes used in quarter horse breeding programs at same time it was noted that two solid colored registered quarter horse parents would sometimes produce what quarter horse aficionados call a cropout a foal with white coloration similar to that of an appaloosa or pinto for a considerable time until dna testing could verify parentage aqha refused to register such horses aphc did accept cropout horses that exhibited proper appaloosa traits while cropout pintos became core of american paint horse association famous appaloosas who were included joker b bright eyes brother and wapiti in late 1970s color controversy went in opposite direction within appaloosa registry aphc s decision in 1982 to allow solid colored or non characteristic appaloosas to be registered resulted in substantial debate within appaloosa breeding community until then a foal of appaloosa parents that had insufficient color was often denied registration although non characteristic appaloosas were allowed into registry but breeder experience had shown that some solid appaloosas could throw a spotted foal in a subsequent generation at least when bred to a spotted appaloosa in addition many horses with a solid coat exhibited secondary characteristics such as skin mottling white sclera and striped hooves controversy stirred by aphc s decision was intense in 1983 a number of appaloosa breeders opposed to registration of solid colored horses formed american appaloosa association a breakaway organization uses thumb a leopard appaloosa is part of mascot team for florida state university seminoles alt a brown and white spotted horse ridden by a sports mascot in modern day native american attire waving a flag stands on a sports field more people are visible on field and a large crowd fills stadium seating in background appaloosas are used extensively for both western and english riding western competitions include cutting reining roping and o mok see sports such as barrel racing known as camas prairie stump race in appaloosa only competition and pole bending called nez perce stake race at breed shows english disciplines they are used in include eventing show jumping and fox hunting they are common in endurance riding competitions as well as in casual trail riding appaloosas are also bred for horse racing with an active breed racing association promoting sport they are generally used for middle distance racing at distances between and an appaloosa holds all breed record for distance set in 1989 appaloosas are often used in western movies and television series examples include rojo in marlon brando film

osceola and renegade even though seminole people were not directly associated with appaloosa horses influence there are several american horse breeds with leopard coloring and appaloosa ancestry these include pony of americas and colorado ranger appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds in an attempt to create a leopard spotted ambling horse because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for aphc registration their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability in 1995 nez perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed nez perce horse based on crossbreeding appaloosa with akhal teke breed from central asia appaloosa stallions have been exported to denmark to add new blood to breed health issues genetically linked night blindness appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing equine recurrent uveitis eru than all other breeds combined up to 25 percent of all horses with eru may be appaloosas uveitis in horses has many causes including eye trauma disease and bacterial parasitic and viral infections but eru is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis rather than a single incident if not treated eru can lead to blindness which occurs more often in appaloosas than in other breeds eighty percent of all uveitis cases are found in appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light colored coat patterns little pigment around eyelids and sparse hair in mane and tail denoting most at risk individuals researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes breed more susceptible to disease appaloosas that are homozygous for leopard complex lp gene are also at risk for congenital stationary night blindness csnb this form of night blindness has been linked with leopard complex since 1970s and in 2007 a significant association between lp and csnb was identified csnb is a disorder that causes an affected animal to lack night vision although day vision is normal it is an inherited disorder present from birth and does not progress over time studies in 2008 and 2010 indicate that both csnb and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to trpm1 drug rules in 2007 aphc implemented new drug rules allowing appaloosas to show with drugs furosemide known by trade name of lasix and acetazolamide furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition and is widely used in horse racing acetazolamide acet is used for treating horses with genetic disease periodic paralysis hypp and prevents affected animals from having seizures acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for hypp and have hypp status noted on their registration papers aphc recommends that appaloosas that trace to certain american quarter horse bloodlines be tested for hypp and owners have option to choose to place hypp testing results on registration papers foals of aqha registered stallions and mares born on or after january 1 2007 that carry hypp will be required to be hypp tested and have their hypp status designated on their registration papers both drugs are controversial in part because they are considered drug and diuretics that can make it difficult to detect presence of other drugs in horse s system on one side it is argued that united states equestrian federation usef which sponsors show competition for many different horse breeds note specifically lists furosemide and international federation for equestrian sports fei which governs international and olympic equestrian competition ban use of furosemide note specifically lists furosemide on other side of controversy several major stock horse registries that sanction their own shows including american quarter horse association american paint horse association and palomino horse breeders of america does not allow lasix within 24 hours of show and only allows acetazolamide for hypp horses allow acetazolamide and furosemide to be used within 24 hours of showing under certain circumstances notes footnotes references external links appaloosa horse club american appaloosa
