system nes in 1985 and 1987 respectively players control mario or his brother luigi in multiplayer mode as they travel mushroom kingdom to rescue princess toadstool from bowser they must traverse side scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with aid of power ups such as super mushroom fire flower and starman game was designed by shigeru miyamoto and takashi tezuka as a grand culmination of famicom team s three years of game mechanics and programming design of first level world 1 1 serves as a tutorial for first time video gamers on basic mechanics of platform gameplay aggressively size optimized profile was intended as a farewell to famicom s cartridge medium in favor of forthcoming famicom disk system whose floppy disks temporarily became dominant distribution medium for a few years super mario bros is frequently cited as one of greatest video games of all time with praise on its precise controls it is one of bestselling games of all time with more than 40 million physical copies it is credited alongside nes as one of key factors in reviving video game industry after 1983 crash and helped popularize side scrolling platform game genre koji kondo s soundtrack is one of earliest and most popular in video games making music into a centerpiece of game design game inspired an expansive franchise including a long running game series an animated television series and a feature film re releases and cameos of game are on most of nintendo s following systems alongside mario himself super mario bros has become prominent in popular culture gameplay thumb left super mario bros features various unique power ups which assist mario in above picture mario yields a fire flower allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles behind mario is an invincibility star which allows him to defeat enemies on contact and withstand other hazards for a short period of time alt refer to caption in super mario bros player takes on role of mario protagonist of series mario s younger brother luigi is controlled by second player in game s multiplayer mode and assumes same plot role and functionality as mario objective is to race through mushroom kingdom survive main antagonist bowser s forces and save princess toadstool game is a side scrolling platformer player moves from left side of screen to right side in order to reach flag pole at end of each level game world features coins scattered around for mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark which when hit from below by mario may reveal more coins or a special item other secret often invisible bricks may contain more coins or rare items if player gains a super mushroom mario grows to double his size and gains ability to break bricks above him if mario gets hit in this mode then instead of dying he turns back to regular mario players start with a certain number of lives and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted orange 1 up mushrooms hidden in bricks or by collecting 100 coins defeating several enemies in a row with a koopa shell or bouncing on enemies successively without touching ground mario loses a life if he takes damage while small falls in a bottomless pit or runs out of time game ends when player runs out of lives although a button input can be used on game over screen to continue from first level of world in which player died mario s primary attack is jumping on top of enemies though many enemies have differing responses to this for example a goomba will flatten and be defeated while a koopa troopa will temporarily retract into its shell allowing mario to use it as a projectile these shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies though they can also bounce back against mario which will hurt or kill him other enemies such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops cannot be jumped on and damage player instead mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit brick that enemy is standing on mario may also acquire fire flower from certain blocks that when picked up changes color of super mario s outfit and allows him to throw fireballs a less common item is starman which often appears when mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks this item makes mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact game consists of eight worlds with four sub levels called stages in each world final stage of each world takes place in a castle where bowser is fought above a suspension bridge first seven of these bowsers are false bowsers whom are actually minions disguised as him whilst real bowser is found in 8th world bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching axe on end of bridge although they can also be defeated using a fire flower game also includes some stages taking place underwater which contain different enemies in addition there are bonuses and secret areas in game most secret areas contain more coins for mario to collect but some contain warp pipes that allow mario to advance directly to later worlds in game without completing intervening stages after completing game once player is rewarded with ability to replay game with changes made to increase its difficulty such as all goombas in game being replaced with buzzy beetles enemies similar to koopa troopas who cannot be defeated using fire flower synopsis in fantasy setting of mushroom kingdom a tribe of turtle like creatures known as koopa troopas invade kingdom and uses magic of its king bowser to turn its inhabitants known as mushroom people into inanimate objects such as bricks stones and horsehair plants bowser and his army also kidnap princess toadstool princess of mushroom kingdom and only one with ability to reverse bowser s spell after hearing news mario sets out to save princess and free kingdom from bowser after traveling through various parts of kingdom and fighting bowser s forces along way mario reaches bowser s final stronghold where he is able to defeat him by striking an axe on bridge suspended over lava he is standing on breaking bridge defeating bowser and allowing for princess to be freed and saving mushroom kingdom development super mario bros successor to 1983 arcade game mario bros was designed by shigeru miyamoto and takashi tezuka both of whom belonged to nintendo s creative department and largely programmed by toshihiko of srd company ltd though not originally using any particular character very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by a grand culmination of their technical knowledge from previous games such as excitebike devil world and kung fu by a desire to give rom cartridge format a final exclamation point in light of forthcoming famicom disk system as new dominant medium and by continuing their legacy in platform game genre miyamoto explained we felt strongly about how we were first to come up with what we called athletic game genre and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it we had built up a lot of know how since release of console and time had come when that would be possible game was made in tandem with legend of zelda another famicom game directed and designed by miyamoto which was released in japan five months after super mario bros as a result certain elements were carried over from legend of zelda to super mario bros for instance fire bars that appear in game s castle levels began as an unused object from zelda development was aimed at simplicity in order to have a new game available for end of year shopping season they started with a prototype in which player simply moves a 16 by 32 pixel square around a single screen tezuka suggested use of mario after seeing sales figures of mario bros which was still selling well throughout previous year team chose to name game super mario bros after deciding to implement super mushroom into game game initially made use of a concept in which mario or luigi could enter a rocket ship and drive it around while firing at enemies but this went unused final game s sky based bonus stages are a remnant of this concept after releasing mario bros team had reflected that it had been an illogical gameplay decision for mario to be hurt by stomping upon walking turtles so they decided that any future mario game would definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want when designing king koopa miyamoto initially imagined character as an ox taking inspiration from character design of ox king toei animation film alakazam great however when tezuka saw miyamoto s design for character he noted that it looked more akin to that of a turtle prompting two to work on defining and fleshing out character s design until coming up with his final appearance 2009 08 11 development of super mario bros is an early example of specialization in video game industry made possible and necessary by famicom s arcade capable hardware miyamoto designed game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code sprites music and sound effects developers of previous hit games joined team importing many special programming techniques features and design refinements such as these donkey kongs slopes lifts conveyor belts and ladders donkey kong jr s ropes logs and springs and mario bros s enemy attacks enemy movement frozen platforms and pow blocks team based level design around a small mario intending to later make his size bigger in final version then they decided it would be fun to let mario change his size via a power up early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from goombas and would be beneficial to them so in first level of game first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms this also resulted in game world being named mushroom kingdom team also deliberately chose not to have mario begin levels as super mario in order to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying for player miyamoto explained when we made prototype of big mario we did not feel he was big enough so we came up with idea of showing smaller mario first who could be made bigger later in game then players could see and feel that he was bigger a rumor stemming from a japanese magazine claimed that developers came up with idea to include a small mario after a bug in game caused only upper half of his body to appear but this claim has been disavowed by miyamoto miyamoto said shell kicking 1 up trick was intentionally designed and carefully tested but people turned out to be a lot better at pulling trick off for ages on end than we thought other features such as blocks containing multiple coins were inspired by programming glitches super mario bros was developed for a 256 cartridge due to this storage limitation designers happily considered their aggressive search for space saving opportunities to be akin to their own fun television game show competition for instance clouds and bushes in game s backgrounds use that same sprite recolored sound effects were also recycled sound when mario is damaged is same as when he enters a pipe and mario jumping on an enemy is same sound as each stroke when swimming after completing game development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple easy to defeat enemy rather than beginning game with koopa troopas by this point project had nearly run out of memory so designers created goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation after addition of game s music around 20 bytes of open cartridge space remained miyamoto used this remaining space to add a sprite of a crown into game which would appear in player s life counter as a reward for obtaining at least 10 lives world 1 1 during third generation of video game consoles tutorials on gameplay were rare instead players learned how a video game worked through being guided by level design opening section of super mario bros was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore mechanics of game in order to be able to advance rather than confront newly oriented player with obstacles first level of super mario bros lays down variety of in game hazards by means of repetition iteration and escalation in an interview with eurogamer miyamoto explained that he created world 1 1 to contain everything a player needs to gradually and naturally understand what they re doing so that they can quickly understand how game works according to miyamoto once player understands mechanics of game player will be able to play more freely and it becomes their game music thumb upright 8 koji kondo created all music and sound effects for game alt koji kondo nintendo sound designer koji kondo wrote six track score for super mario bros as well as all of game s sound effects at time he was composing video game music was mostly meant to attract attention not necessarily to enhance or conform to game kondo s work on super mario bros was one of major forces in shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games kondo had two specific goals for his music to convey an unambiguous sonic image of game world and to enhance emotional and physical experience of gamer music of super mario bros is coordinated with onscreen animations of various sprites which was one way which kondo created a sense of greater immersion kondo wasn t first to do this in a video game for instance space invaders features a simple song that gets faster and faster as aliens speed up eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches increasing challenge of game however kondo attempted to take idea further stating that primary question determining use of a game s music was do game and music fit one another order no unlike most games at time for which composers were hired later in process to add music to a nearly finished game kondo was a part of development team almost from beginning of production working in tandem with rest of team to create game s soundtrack kondo s compositions were largely influenced by game s gameplay intending for it to heighten feeling of how game controls before composition began a prototype of game was presented to kondo so that he could get an idea of mario s general environment and revolve music around it kondo wrote score with help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit game s environments after development of game showed progress kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit pace of game so he changed it a bit by increasing songs tempos music was further adjusted based on expectations of nintendo s play testers release super mario bros was first released in japan on september 13 1985 for family computer it was released later that year in north america for nintendo entertainment system nes its exact north american
