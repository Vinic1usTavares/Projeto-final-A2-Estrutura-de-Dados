passengers in september 2018 proposals for an airport light rail service surfaced in mid 1980s and efforts were accelerated following portland international airport s rapid expansion in 1990s conceived from an unsolicited proposal from bechtel in 1997 airport max project was designed and built under a public private partnership between a consortium of bechtel and trammell crow port of portland and local governments extension began construction in 1999 and was completed in just under two years owing its quickness to exclusion of federal funding and utilization of existing public right of way red line commenced service between downtown portland and airport on september 10 2001 amid strong westside ridership on blue line red line service was extended west to beaverton transit

downsizing freeway and including right of way reserved for future transit which was later realized as i 205 transitway in 1986 regional transit plans began calling for a light rail extension to portland international airport which was then being served by trimet buses operating from sandy boulevard with construction projected to begin around 2010 early proposals envisioned a line running from clackamas county to airport along i 205 and connecting with eastside max at gateway northeast 99th avenue transit center airport expanded rapidly in following decade with traffic more than doubling from six to fourteen million passengers between 1990 and 2000 anticipating this growth port of portland embarked on a 20 year 300 million phased expansion project in november 1991 which expanded main passenger terminal rebuilt an existing concourse and added a fifth concourse this project also provisioned for a future light rail station near southern end of arrivals hall by 1994 parking lots were operating at 90 percent capacity as projections fell short of demand with heavy vehicular traffic near terminal entrances further worsening congestion port sought to accelerate regional plans to introduce light rail service to airport meanwhile trimet had been preoccupied with construction of westside max extension and had plans to pursue its south north line proposal before it would consider extending max service to airport south north line which would have connected clark county washington and clackamas town center to downtown portland was subsequently defeated by clark county voters in 1995 in late 1996 bechtel initiated discussions with port regarding feasibility of an airport max line assigning a former federal transit official employee to develop project port expressed its support of unsolicited proposal in january 1997 after long deliberations agreements were made between bechtel port and local governments part of agreements authorized bechtel to design and build extension and to fund a portion of line in exchange for development rights to portland international center an area of undeveloped commercially zoned property situated east of airport which it later renamed cascade station project was accelerated with establishment of a public private partnership which eliminated need for federal transit administration fta funding a preliminary engineering study commenced in december 1997 in 1998 eastside community leaders who feared proposal would take away service from gresham area protested line s construction following october associated builders and contractors filed a petition in multnomah county circuit court they claimed that contract awarded to bechtel may have violated oregon procurement laws a judge ruled in favor of trimet in

trains to maximize rider capacity by november 2001 ridership averaged at 2 300 riders and peaked at 3 800 a day before thanksgiving holiday weekend all service had been using single light rail cars but this influx of riders prompted trimet to temporarily deploy two car consists for first time which it had not previously planned to do until 2006 regular use of two car trains on line began in september 2005 when overcrowding prompted trimet to change most yellow line service from two car consists to single cars in order to convert red line to two car trains red line service was extended
