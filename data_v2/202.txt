features re imagined versions of croft by well known animators comic book artists and writers including jim lee warren ellis and peter chung episodes ranged from five to seven and half minutes in length featuring minnie driver as croft creative staff was given considerable freedom to re interpret character they did not consult video game designers but were given a guide listing acceptable and unacceptable practices development history thumb upright swedish pop artist neneh cherry was an early inspiration to lara croft s creation core design a subsidiary of eidos created lara croft as lead protagonist of its video game tomb raider which began development in 1993 lead graphic artist toby gard went through about five designs before arriving at character s final appearance he initially envisioned a male lead character with a whip and a hat core design co founder jeremy smith characterised design as derivative of indiana jones and asked for more originality also known as ten years of tomb raider a gametap retrospective gard decided that a female character would work better from a design standpoint he also cited virtua fighter as an influence gard noticed that while watching people play game players selected one of two available female characters in game almost every match he saw cf gard expressed a desire to counter stereotypical female characters which he has characterised as bimbos or dominatrix types smith was sceptical of a female lead at first because few contemporary games featured them he came to regard a female lead as a great hook and put faith in gard s idea inspired by pop artist neneh cherry and comic book character tank girl gard experimented with different designs including a muscular woman and a nazi like militant he settled on a tough south american woman with a braid named laura cruz eidos management preferred a more uk friendly name and it is claimed that lara croft was selected from similar sounding british names found in an english telephone directory in derby where core design developers were based an alternate explanation is a homage to an accountant named laura croft along with name change character s backstory was altered to incorporate a british origin gard was keen to animate character realistically an aspect he felt industry at time had disregarded he sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement believing that players would empathise with character more easily lara s dual wielding of pistols was inspired by film hard boiled and an aeon flux short in first tomb raider croft s three dimensional 3d character model is made of around 230 polygons character s braid was removed from model but added back for subsequent iterations gavin programmer on first two tomb raider games explained it had been dropped from original because it just didn t work properly with all acrobatic moves it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own but on i came up with a way to get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked there is a misconception that while adjusting character model gard accidentally increased breasts dimensions by 150 percent and rest of creative team argued to keep change gard however has stated that notion came out of a silly remark made in an interview core design hired shelley blond to voice croft after game entered beta phase of development gard left core design after completing tomb raider citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to ideas he developed especially lara croft core design improved and modified character with each instalment developers for tomb raider ii increased number of polygons in character s model and added more realistic curves to its design other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres core design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option but option did not appear until tomb raider iii actress judith gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through third game for tomb raider iii developers increased number of polygons in croft s 3d model to about 300 and introduced more abilities to gameplay core design wanted to reintroduce character to players in tomb raider last revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger lara developers expanded character s set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with environment like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions and jonell elliott replaced gibbins as voice of lara croft by time development for last revelation began core design had worked on series constantly for four years and staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness feeling series lacked innovation core design decided to kill character and depicted croft trapped by a cave in during final scenes of game next title tomb raider chronicles depicted late lara croft via her friends flashbacks game introduced stealth attacks which would carry over to next game tomb raider angel of darkness while original development team worked on chronicles core design assigned a new team to develop angel of darkness for playstation 2 anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles adrian smith co founder of core design wanted to reinvent character to keep pace with updated technology core design conducted market research including fan polls to aid in angel of darknesss development development team felt it could not alter character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games playstation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model number of polygons in croft s model increased to 4 400 team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match lara croft s portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory movement control was switched from directional pad to analogue control stick to provide more precision after original team finished chronicles it joined development of angel of darkness excess content missed production deadlines and eidos s desire to time game s launch to coincide with release of 2003 tomb raider film resulted in a poorly designed game croft was brought back to life without explanation and character controls lacked precision developer switch to crystal dynamics thumb upright alt a short haired man with a beard standing in front of an advertisement poster man wears glasses and a light brown jacket over a brown top toby gard lara croft s original designer left core design in 1997 but returned to work with crystal dynamics as a consultant angel of darkness was received poorly prompting eidos fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game to give development duties for future titles to crystal dynamics another eidos subsidiary legacy of kain development team began work on a new title tomb raider legend and toby gard returned to work as a consultant development team reassessed brand value of franchise and its protagonist chip blundell eidos s vice president of brand management commented that designers understood that fans saw character and brand as their own rather than eidos s with that in mind team retooled franchise and character to emphasise aspects of original game that made them unique storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with angel of darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for legend crystal dynamics focused on believability rather than realism to re develop character posing decisions around question what could lara do and giving her action more freedom designers updated lara croft s move set to make her movements appear more fluid and continuous animations were also updated so character could better interact with environmental objects developers introduced a feature that causes character s skin and clothing to appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on ground responding to criticism directed at character controls in angel of darkness crystal dynamics redesigned character s control scheme to provide what it felt was best third person action experience developers also introduced close quarter melee manoeuvres crystal dynamics updated character model to add more realism but retained past design elements polygon count increased to over 9 800 more attention was paid to character s lip synching and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in game events in redesigning character s appearance crystal dynamics updated croft s hairstyle wardrobe and accessories her shirt was changed to a v neck crop top her body was given more muscle tone and her hair braid was switched to a pony tail voice actor for lara croft was initially rumoured to be rachel weisz but role was eventually given to keeley hawes crystal dynamics retained design changes for next game tomb raider anniversary a remake of first game designers aimed to portray croft with more emotional depth and focused on character s desire to achieve end goal of game culminating in killing one of antagonists developers used death to evoke guilt in croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice thumb left alt a blond haired woman in a white dress facing right with a large group of people in background keeley hawes portrayed lara in most games starting with tomb raider legend in 2006 tomb raider underworld continued plot line established in legend crystal dynamics used new technology to improve character for seventh generation consoles focusing on improving realism dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from legend was altered to be a real time mechanic that can involve entire game environment to achieve a more natural appearance developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in game objects like lara croft crystal dynamics made character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments featuring more texture layers that determine appearance of shadows and reflective light on it and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement number of polygons in model increased to 32 000 developers enhanced croft s facial model by increasing number of polygons bones used in animation skeleton and graphical shaders in face to add more detail and expressive capabilities hair was created as a real time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement developers kept croft s hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres character s body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions developers tried to redefine lara croft s actions by questioning what they felt character was capable of while previous games used hand animated movement for character underworld introduced motion capture based animation to display more fluid realistic movement and facial expressions stuntwoman and olympic gold medalist heidi moneymaker was motion capture actress and advised designers on practical movements animators adjusted and blended recorded animation to create seamless transitions between separate moves and their simultaneous combinations blends and additional animations give character more flexible movement actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting with one hand while other holds an object collected from environment other additions include more melee attacks as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres crystal dynamics sought to make visual appearance of xbox 360 and playstation 3 versions identical although systems use different techniques to achieve this in response to underworlds lackluster sales figures eidos reportedly considered altering character s appearance to appeal more to female fans publisher switch to square enix japanese game company square enix acquired eidos in april 2009 restructuring eidos into square enix europe crystal dynamics remained developer of tomb raider games lara croft and guardian of light introduced co operative gameplay to series a move that brand director karl stewart said was meant to show lara as a more humanistic character by placing her in a situation that differed from previous instalments

2010 square enix announced a franchise reboot titled tomb raider new lara croft would be a darker grittier reimagining of character in examining character crystal dynamics concluded that croft s largest failing was her teflon coating and that it needed a more human version that players would care about studio sought a new voice actress trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers second reboot focuses on origin of character and as a result changes previous back story staff opted to first work on character s biography rather than cosmetic aspects crystal dynamics sought to avoid embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions in redesigning character s appearance designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made lara croft iconic a ponytail m shaped lips and spatial relationship between her eyes mouth and nose company also changed character s wardrobe focusing on what it believed was more functional and practical in designing outfits staff aimed to create a look that was relevant and youthful but not too trendy or hip to gauge redesign crystal dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed new

voice performances to accompany body performances company plans to revamp croft s in game combat abilities crystal dynamics aims to make combat fresh to franchise competitive amongst similar games and relevant to story among changes is implementation of a free aiming system studio reasoned that such a system would cause players to be more invested in action by fostering a raw brutal and desperate style global brand director karl stewart stated that such desperation relates to updated character s inexperience with violence he further commented that lara croft is thrust into a situation where she is forced to kill which will be a traumatic and defining moment for her promotion and merchandising eidos s german branch and agency handled marketing for lara croft according to eidos no focus groups or scientific studies were consulted when devising marketing strategy for character eidos marketing manager david burton oversaw marketing efforts which attempted to portray character as
