players are able to customize their characters in limited ways including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender facial style hair color body size job and nation allegiance also diverging from previous games in series game takes place in a fully three dimensional landscape with enemies freely roaming in it allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to random encounters used in previous games a trend continued in every numbered final fantasy title since there are currently 16 public game worlds available for play down from 32 at game s height with approximately 15 000 to 20 000 players in each a private test server was opened to eligible players to aid in feedback of updates in development for game in mid 2011 servers are named after summoned monsters from previous final fantasy titles such as ifrit and diabolos players have ability to move between servers though square enix charges a world transfer fee to do so there are no region specific or system specific servers and unlike most online games players of different languages play in same world and can interact through automatic language translation from a library of translated phrases game servers are run by square enix as part of their playonline network interface thumb 250px left a player engages in a dialog sequence to advance story players have option of using any combination of a keyboard mouse and controller to play final fantasy xi while by default a player using a playstation 2 or an xbox 360 uses a virtual in game keyboard option player is able to use an external keyboard that is usb compatible for communication within game head up display in final fantasy xi consists of a log window menus and several game information elements log window at bottom of screen displays system messages battle messages and text input by other players players may choose to filter what appears in log window menus allow player to access different commands status windows and configuration options action command menu appears just above log window and gives player several options to interact with game world several menu options are available through use of keyboard shortcuts as well basic gameplay story related gameplay in final fantasy xi consists of two major components missions through which main storyline of game is told and quests which do not advance main storyline but fill out game s fantasy world completing missions allows a player to advance in rank which grants access to new areas several privileges and various other storylines at first a player may only complete missions for his home nation though they are able to change allegiances later on allowing access to other nations storylines quests may be undertaken for their various rewards or to acquire fame which allows a character to become well known and respected by npcs a higher fame rating will open up new interactions and quests with npcs at release over one hundred quests were available to play and each expansion pack has added its own set of missions and quests players obtain in game money known as gil by completing missions quests and defeating beastmen though unlike previous final fantasy games these monsters drop only small amounts gil can then be exchanged amongst players for goods through auction house or be used to purchase items and rewards from npcs unlike some mmorpgs there is very little focus on player versus player pvp combat instead game revolves around player versus environment pve there are numerous pve activities and events for players to partake in including instanced activities and shared spaces activities some instanced events include dynamis salvage assault and isle which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players these battle grounds give players a series of objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat generally within a certain time frame popular shared spaces activities include hunting notorious monsters fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot only way to attack other players in pvp is to enter one of two competition activities known as conflict first form of competition called ballista involves players competing to score points by throwing petras into a castle like structure known as a rook second form is known as brenner and features a capture flag type system from time to time special seasonal festivals and events are held they last only for a set period of time and offer a variety of fun or useful rewards many events have changed over time adding new features and eliminating old ones these events are geared towards any level often restricting players to level 1 so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents for example s day in place of valentine s day egg hunt egg stravaganza in place of easter and starlight celebration in place of christmas battle and party system thumbnail right a group photo of a guild in game battles in final fantasy xi take place in world in which players move around a first in series where battle had previously taken place in a separate screen via random encounters surprise of random encounter system is achieved via aggressive monsters who will attack players based on different factors such as sight and sound this format would continue in future final fantasy games monsters within game operate under a system of claim and enmity a monster is claimed moment a player performs any offensive action upon it whether physical magical or ability related with some exceptions once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in party or alliance of player that claimed it a monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up most enmity players have several means at their disposal including spells abilities and items to build up enmity or shed it to their advantage in battle a factor that features heavily in group or party play to defeat more powerful monsters and gain experience points efficiently players can join a party a regular party has room for six members like in many other games a well balanced party will consist of several archetypes namely a healer a tank party member with high defense that will be main target of monster and damage dealer enmity system comes into play heavily in parties as players try to keep monsters attention off fragile jobs and on tanks a well balanced team working together is only way to defeat many of game s enemies a party can expand into an alliance with up to three parties combined with a total of 18 players alliances are necessary to complete more difficult challenges including missions quests nation or territory driven events and defeating notorious monsters much of end game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players e g dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item final fantasy xis incarnation of limit breaks are weapon skills physical damage given and received fills a tactical points tp bar to a maximum of 3000 any amount above 1000 is able to be used up by being channelled into a weapon skill these skills vary in effect depending on job class what weapon is equipped how full tp bar is and how proficient player is with weapon if partying with other players one may use these weapon skills in succession in order to create a skillchain a skillchain creates additional damage after a series of weapon skills are used building on this even further magic used on a skillchain at right time will receive a boost to its damage this is called a magic burst in order to create best possible and magic bursts players must work together focusing on each other s actions and timing job system final fantasy xi uses concept of changing jobs in a similar fashion to final fantasy iii and currently has twenty two jobs as of latest expansion pack in 2013 there are six standard jobs available to choose from at start of game after one standard job has reached level 30 extra jobs are accessible upon completing certain quests players are able to change their jobs any time from inside their house or by speaking with a nomad moogle in june 2010 long standing level limit of 75 was incrementally increased to higher level cap of 99 finishing in december 2011 version update jobs have a combination of unique job traits job abilities and magic spells giving them a specific role within group play due to their area of expertise job traits are passive abilities that are always in effect while job abilities must be activated by player in order to come into effect they last a limited time and have a cooldown period before they can be used again magic spells are available to certain jobs and in addition to a cooldown period they often consume mp or some form of item in order to be cast while at same time requiring user to stand still additionally each job has a special one hour ability that performs an extraordinary function unique system of final fantasy xis job system is support job this system allows a player to augment their character with abilities traits and spells from another chosen job at half level of their current job for instance a level 20 warrior setting ninja as their support job would allow them to use all ninja abilities traits and spells up to that of a level 10 ninja while still primarily being a level 20 warrior support job system allows for job merges never before seen in final fantasy series however there are some exceptions to system one hour abilities and other abilities deemed signature to a particular job such as call wyvern for dragoons are restricted to being used only on main job crafting and hobbies thumb right raising breeding and racing of chocobos was a much requested addition to game in addition to completing quests and missions players can participate in several side minigames and other activities one such minigame is fishing where players can measure their strength against fish they attempt to catch another is clamming where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over their bucket s size limit gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence or mog house as it is known in game raising and breeding of chocobos was a long requested activity enabled in summer 2006 update chocobo racing began in march 2007 which allowed for racing of player raised chocobos against non player characters npcs winning racers can earn which can be used to buy for example items that assist chocobo breeding an important part of game is accumulation of items especially rare ones which allow players to create powerful weapons armour and food there are many ways to obtain items such as harvesting excavating logging mining defeating monsters and digging by using chocobos square enix attempted to increase opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize game and stop practice of gil selling or exchanging real money for in game items item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting system items can be created by consuming elemental crystals obtained by fighting monsters with other ingredients in a process called synthesis recipe results can vary widely based on player s skill quality of player s equipment worn and ingredients used there is large speculation though nothing evidently documented yet about moon phase direction player is facing in game day every day of week is assigned an element and even time of day synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce results of recipe game economy final fantasy xi has a largely player based economy with a heavy reliance on auction houses in each of major cities of vana diel there are certain economic controls in place mainly in form of fees for putting items up for auction transportation auction house item storage and fees do not go to players these gil sinks effectively remove money from economy to prevent inflation city of jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside city but it was removed in a patch in december 2008 version update square enix has stated that trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of terms of service for final fantasy xi in early 2006 square enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency which in turn drove up prices for all items across game in response 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion gil was removed from circulation in july 2006 square enix banned or suspended over 8 000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce since 2006 square enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of terms some of them using third party tools effectively removing billions of gil from in game economy synopsis setting setting of final fantasy xi is world
