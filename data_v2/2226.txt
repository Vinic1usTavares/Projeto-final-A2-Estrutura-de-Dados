insufficient documentation of levski s activities in 1870 it is known that he spent a year and a half establishing a wide network of secret committees in bulgarian cities and villages network internal revolutionary organisation iro was centred around lovech central committee also called brcc in bulgaria or provisional government goal of committees was to prepare for a coordinated uprising 2000 p 378 network of committees was at its densest in central bulgarian regions particularly around sofia plovdiv and stara zagora revolutionary committees were also established in some parts of macedonia dobruja and strandzha and around more peripheral urban centres kyustendil and vidin iro committees purchased armaments and organised detachments of volunteers according to one study organisation had just over 1 000 members in early 1870s most members were intellectuals and traders though all layers of bulgarian society were represented individuals obtained iro membership in secrecy initiation ritual involved a formal oath of allegiance over gospel or a christian cross a gun and a knife treason was punishable by death and secret police monitored each member s activities through clandestine channels of reliable people relations were maintained with revolutionary diasporic community internal correspondence employed encryption conventional signs and fake personal and committee names although levski himself headed organisation he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk turned revolutionary matey adventurous dimitar obshti and young angel kanchev left thumb vasil levski at time of creation of his internal revolutionary network apocryphal and semi legendary anecdotal stories surround creation of levski s internal revolutionary organisation persecuted by ottoman authorities who offered 500 turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels for example he is known to have dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes in autumn of 1871 levski and angel kanchev published instruction of workers for liberation of bulgarian people a brcc draft statute containing ideological organisational and penal sections it was sent out to local committees and to diasporic community for discussion political and organisational experience that levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872 at time his views on revolution had clearly matured as iro expanded it coordinated its activities more with bucharest based brcc on levski s initiative a general assembly was called between 29 april and 4 may 1872 at assembly delegates approved a programme and a statute elected lyuben karavelov as organisation s leader and authorised levski as brcc executive body s only legitimate representative in bulgarian lands after attending assembly levski returned to bulgaria and reorganised iro s internal structure in accordance with brcc s recommendations thus lovech central committee was reduced to a regular local committee and first region wide revolutionary centres were founded lack of funds however precipitated organisation into a crisis and levski s one man judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned capture and execution in that situation levski s assistant dimitar obshti robbed an ottoman postal convoy in pass on 22 september 1872 without approval from levski or leadership of movement while robbery was successful and provided iro with 125 000 groschen obshti and other perpetrators were soon arrested preliminary investigation and trial revealed revolutionary organisation s size and its close relations with brcc obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed levski s leading role right thumb kakrina inn where levski was captured by ottoman authorities in late december 1872 realising that he was in danger levski decided to flee to romania where he would meet karavelov and discuss these events first however he had to collect important documentation from committee archive in lovech which would constitute important evidence if seized by ottomans he stayed at nearby village inn in kakrina where he was surprised and arrested on morning of 27 december 1872 starting with writings of lyuben karavelov most accepted version has been that a priest named nikiforov betrayed levski to police this theory has been disputed by researchers ivan and vasil for lack of evidence initially taken to tarnovo for interrogation levski was sent to sofia on 4 january there he was taken to trial while he acknowledged his identity he did not reveal his accomplices or details related to his organisation taking full blame ottoman authorities sentenced levski to death by hanging sentence was carried out on in sofia where monument to vasil levski now stands location of levski s grave is uncertain but in 1980s writer nikolay haytov campaigned for church of st petka of as levski s burial place which bulgarian academy of sciences concluded as possible yet unverifiable levski s death intensified crisis in bulgarian revolutionary movement and most iro committees soon disintegrated nevertheless five years after his hanging russo turkish war of 1877 1878 secured liberation of bulgaria from ottoman rule in wake of april uprising of 1876 treaty of san stefano of 3 march 1878 established bulgarian state as an autonomous principality of bulgaria under de jure ottoman suzerainty revolutionary theory and ideas at end of 1860s levski developed a revolutionary theory that saw bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all bulgarians in ottoman empire insurrection was to be prepared controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors levski s theory resulted from repeated failures to implement rakovski s ideas effectively such as use of foreign based armed detachments cheti cheti to provoke a general revolt levski s idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy approval of entire population either in fact he was only prominent bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it instead many regarded an intervention by great powers as a more feasible solution left thumb a relief of vasil levski at bulgarian embassy in paris levski envisioned bulgaria as a democratic republic occasionally finding common ground with declaration of rights of man and of citizen and largely reflecting liberal ideas of french revolution and contemporary western society he said we will be free in complete liberty where bulgarian lives in bulgaria thrace macedonia people of whatever ethnicity live in this heaven of ours they will be equal in rights to bulgarian in everything we will have a flag that says pure and sacred republic it is time by a single deed to achieve what our french brothers have been seeking levski held that all religious and ethnic groups in a free bulgaria whether bulgarians turks jews or others should enjoy equal rights he reiterated that bulgarian revolutionaries fought against sultan s government not against turkish people and their religion we re not driving away turkish people nor their faith but emperor and his laws in a word turkish government which has been ruling not only us but turk himself in a barbarian way levski was prepared to sacrifice his life for revolution and place bulgaria and bulgarian people above personal interests if i shall win i shall win for entire people if i shall lose i shall lose only myself in a liberated bulgaria he did not envision himself as a national leader or a high ranking official we yearn to see a free fatherland and then one could even order me to graze ducks isn t that right in spirit of garibaldi levski planned to assist other oppressed peoples of world in their liberation once bulgaria was reestablished he also advocated strict and regular accounting in his revolutionary organisation and did not tolerate corruption commemoration thumb upright monument to levski in his

for pragmatic revolutionary purposes and voluntarily gave up his religious office to devote himself to secular struggle for liberation vasil levski s hanging is observed annually across bulgaria on 19 february instead of 18 february due to erroneous calculation of 19th century julian calendar dates after bulgaria adopted gregorian calendar in 1916 although location of levski s grave has not been
