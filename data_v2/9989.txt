ferreira family are a fictional family from bbc soap opera eastenders that appeared on screen between 2003 and 2005 created by tony jordan and introduced by louise berridge as a new asian family producers hoped they would become central to show however after indian actor dalip tahil was forced to leave due to a controversy over his work permit a major plot involving family had to be scrapped and was replaced with a kidney transplant storyline that was branded boring it was later revealed that dropped storyline involved dan being murdered by his children and buried in a shallow grave characters were also called unrealistic annoying and unlikeable by many of show s fans and critics they were blamed for a decline in show s viewing figures and were eventually axed by kathleen hutchison after bosses struggled to find storylines for family jordan later admitted family s members were least successful characters he created creation ferreiras were introduced in 2003 as first asian family in eastenders since sanjay deepak verma and gita kapoor shobu kapoor who both departed from show in 1998 they were also first large family to arrive since slater family s arrival in 2000 family were creation of writer tony jordan and bollywood star dalip tahil was cast by show s executive producer louise berridge to play dan ferreira patriarch of family family from goa in india also consisted of dan s three sons ronny played by ray ash raji james and adi ameet chana and daughter kareena pooja shah ronny s friend tariq larousi played by nabil elouahabi also joined show at same time bbc drama bosses worked on introducing an asian family who would be central to show for a couple of years berridge commented on casting after a search which has taken more than two years and in which we have met literally hundreds of people we have finally found perfect cast for our dynamic new family we re delighted to welcome ferreiras to albert square and i m sure viewers will be too berridge also claimed show didn t set out to look for an asian family saying we wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from show i thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone and said that characters were formed around actors we didn t set out knowing exactly what we wanted we workshopped constantly trying out different improvisations with actors and characters evolved it was hoped that family would have a big impact on other characters show s producers apparently vowed not to include too many racial issues in family s storylines although upon their arrival character of jim branning john bardon was heard saying they re indian they do like to pack em in don t they in reference to family s size on being cast in show tahil admitted that he wasn t aware of how big a part of british culture soap was until he arrived in united kingdom saying it s going to be a big adventure other actors in family all said they were looking forward to joining show with james saying i m really looking forward to challenges of working on such a huge programme and shah commenting joining eastenders is a dream come true i have been a fan of programme for many years and i m looking forward to joining cast family first appeared on screen on 3 june 2003 later on in year indian chef madhur jaffrey was cast in eastenders as dan s estranged wife pushpa jaffrey commented i really wanted to do role because indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn kind of women who just stay at home cooking and cleaning i thought how wonderful of eastenders to write a character that is realistic what my character has done happens all time in india there are all kinds of stories of people running away and marrying their lovers this is what commonly happens in those places but somehow image of indian womanhood is different pushpa was a guest character only appearing for duration of a storyline that revealed dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man pradeep kaleem dan s best friend development in november 2003 it emerged that actor dalip tahil faced being axed from show due to not having correct work permit it was reported that after tahil joined eastenders from appearing in stage musical bombay dreams neither he nor bbc had obtained proper authorisation from home office to make switch of employment legal bbc issued a one line statement which read we are considering any potential problems with a view to resolving them as soon as possible tahil was forced to leave show and made his last appearance on 30 december 2003 although actor was eventually allowed to remain in uk following tahil s departure plots were abandoned and many scripts had to be rewritten eastenders scriptwriter tony jordan revealed that it was intended that dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse saying family arrived in albert square in what was expected to be a huge storyline father was an oppressive and violent bully eventually his children were going to kill him it was all scripted how they buried him in a shallow grave how they dealt with it and how it all exploded and then dalip got bloody deported he was actually on studio floor and they marched him off broken legs nervous breakdowns we can deal with that but when actors are physically taken away by government and deported there s not much you can do fifty scripts had to be reworked and because all episodes had been written around this big storyline we had to keep same amount of ferreira material murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between ronny and his newly discovered half brother tariq jordan admitted they could have recast character of dan but it may have looked tacky we couldn t go tonight part of mr ferreira will be played by michael french with a suntan we were trying to do it with integrity then somebody said what if ronnie ferreira s mate tariq turns out to be his half brother and we do whole kidney transplant thing and of course it was like watching paint dry can i have your kidney no oh go on then jordan told daily mirror ferreiras were least successful characters i created through no fault of their own thumb tariq larousi nabil elouahabi was revealed to be illegitimate son of dan berridge defended family saying that tahil s departure caused a lot of problems however she added t he ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped i think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a new asian family viewers traditionally take a long time to adapt to anyone new so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from start even so we had a terrific first story for them which was to have culminated in a huge action storyline to mark exit of their father however sudden removal of actor dalip tahil for reasons beyond our control meant that story had to be abandoned quickly and 40 scripts rewritten on spot result was transplant story which i have to admit did go on for far too long especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of pregnancy of kacey ainsworth writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but i would be first to admit end result was not our finest hour i hope that viewers will not hold this against ferreira family and will be prepared to watch next stage of their stories with an open mind this is a very talented bunch of actors who ve had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and i am confident ferreiras will regain their popularity lorraine heggessey controller of bbc one said show became on kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems such as illness pregnancy rehab and a car crash berridge quit as executive producer of eastenders and was replaced by kathleen hutchison in april 2004 producers were concerned that family were losing popularity with viewers and a decision was made to write pooja shah out of show for a while but to bring her back with a sexier image to rival michelle ryan who played zoe slater shah expressed a dislike of her character saying i m fed up with it now kareena s too dowdy i wanted kareena to be different to stand out if i m completely honest i can t stand her she just grates on my nerves she hasn t got many friends but then i wouldn t be her friend if i met her family had failed and rumours began that entire family would be killed off in a house fire a further attempt to spice up family was made in july 2004 by bringing back character sasha perkins played by jemma walker and having her move in with ferreiras show struggled to find storylines for dan s children and remainder of family including sasha perkins were dropped from show by hutchison in october 2004 this was claimed to be a mutual

part should have been given to a uk actor referring to it as disgraceful actors albert moses and renu setna complained that home grown talent was being overlooked with moses saying british asian actors have been fighting for last five years to persuade bbc to bring an asian family into eastenders and when at last it happens it goes to bollywood it is a disgrace and an insult to british asian actors this is a terrible thing for bbc to do it should be ashamed setna said i have heard that for this storyline bbc has brought over a bollywood star to play father why when we have excellent asian actors of our own british immigration laws state that nationals from outside european union should not replace resident actors capable of doing same work a spokesperson for bbc responded after due consideration dalip was deemed to be most appropriate actor for job additionally it was suggested that madhur jaffrey was miscast in role of dan s wife pushpa several of family s storylines were criticised and branded as unbelievable and poorly researched and they were cited as one of main reasons viewing figures for show dropped to a low of 6 2 million one columnist for daily mirror wrote never has a family bored me so much during their transplant saga i nearly donated a kidney myself to end turgid tale get rid of em fans called for family to be axed and an editorial on daily mirror stated ferreiras father dan was probably not just worst character in soap but most annoying unlikeable person on all television inveterate gambler ash and daughter kareena are mere ciphers while adi is just weird like a gay version of a character from rainbow ronny ferreira meanwhile presided over most boring storyline in eastenders history when viewers spent several weeks watching him lying in bed growing a beard i e waiting for a kidney transplant fact that ferreiras still haven t been axed shows how indecisive and complacent show s executives have become however a poll on radio station bbc asian network found that 75 of respondents wanted family to stay one thousand young asian professionals were surveyed on their opinions of family with most respondents saying family were extremely unrealistic one girl said i think ferreiras are shit story lines are stupid unrealistic and dull most asians would not get evicted and then remain homeless they would go to an aunty a female pr manager told survey just how many shades of brown can there be in one family you can t put them in any context they have no background and another participant said ferreiras should just be killed off they are pointless boring and storylines are rubbish a barrister criticised family s names saying their first names were a mixture of muslim and hindu and their surname was portuguese so family should have been catholic following axing of family actor ameet chana accused bbc of discriminating against family saying i m not afraid to admit that ferreira family have been treated like shit we ve been made scapegoats discriminated against they wouldn t do this to watts or slater family ferreira family have had bad storylines and we ve taken blame for it family s goan origin was also criticised by samir shah a member of bbc s board of directors citing it as an example of inauthentic representation of ethnic minority communities he said if you were to cast an asian family in east end it should have been bangladeshi instead we had a family of goan descent a report by equality and human rights commission claimed that ferreiras were an example of stereotyping in media references category
