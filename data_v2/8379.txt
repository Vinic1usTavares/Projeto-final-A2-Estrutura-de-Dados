phantasmagoria is a point and click adventure horror video game designed by roberta williams for ms dos and microsoft windows and released by sierra on line on august 24 1995 it tells story of adrienne delaney victoria morsell a writer who moves into a remote mansion and finds herself terrorized by supernatural forces it was made at peak of popularity for interactive movie games and features live action actors and footage both during cinematic scenes and within three dimensionally rendered environments of game itself it was noted for its violence and sexual content williams had long planned to design a horror game but she waited eight years for software technology to improve before doing so more than 200 people were involved in making phantasmagoria which was based on williams 550 page script about four times length of an average hollywood screenplay it took more than two years to develop and four months to film game was originally budgeted for 800 000 but it ultimately cost 4 5 million to develop and was filmed in a 1 5 million studio that sierra built specifically for game game was directed by peter maris and features a cast of twenty five actors all performing in front of a blue screen most games at time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds while phantasmagoria includes more than 1 000 a professional hollywood special effects house worked on game and musical score includes a neo gregorian chant performed by a 135 voice choir sierra stressed that it was intended for adult audiences and company willingly submitted it to a ratings system and included a password protected censoring option within game to tone down graphic content phantasmagoria was released on seven discs after multiple delays but it was a financial success grossing 12 million in its opening week end and becoming one of best selling games of 1995 sierra strongly promoted game it received mixed reviews earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone while being criticized for its slow pacing and easy puzzles game also drew controversy particularly due to a rape scene compusa and other retailers declined to carry it religious organizations and politicians condemned it and it was refused classification altogether in australia sequel phantasmagoria a puzzle of flesh was released in 1996 although williams was not involved gameplay thumb 280 px right alt still from

features live action actors and cinematic footage both during scenes between gameplay and within three dimensional rendered environments of game itself game was made when interactive movie games were at peak of their popularity with release of such popular computer games as wing commander iii and under a killing moon in this single player game player controls protagonist adrienne delaney who is always on screen player can click certain areas of screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects camera angles and rooms change depending on where player moves adrienne game includes only four mouse commands look which changes to talk to when selecting a person pick up item use item and walk mouse cursor is always an arrow unlike in most earlier sierra on line games in which cursor could be changed to represent different functions like walk hand and eye by right clicking cursor turns red when it passes over an area where user can click to perform an action dembo p 64 once action has been completed cursor will not turn red again objects in game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence after which item automatically goes into inventory if an object is small enough that it can be easily missed a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it user interface is a screen surrounded by a stone border with buttons and eight inventory slots along bottom adrienne can only hold eight items at once and each black slot can contain an image of an item that user can click on to retrieve or

eye which displays any inventory item that user drags to button display shows a close up image that can be turned in multiple directions game designer roberta williams co founder of sierra on line deliberately made phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple unobtrusive and intuitive so it would be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers according to arinn dembo from computer gaming world game is focused more around story and frightening atmosphere rather than on a difficult gaming experience and therefore puzzles are relatively easy logical and straightforward plot successful mystery novelist adrienne delaney victoria morsell and her photographer husband don gordon david homb have just purchased a remote mansion off coast of a small new england island previously owned by a famous 19th century magician zoltan carno carnovasch robert miano whose five wives all died mysteriously adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home but starts

which impales and kills don his death unleashes demon which pursues adrienne through mansion she escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps demon once again game ends with adrienne walking out of mansion with a vacant stare almost catatonic development writing phantasmagoria was a radically different game for williams who was best known for designing family friendly king s quest fantasy adventure game series ultimate p 30 williams said she did not want to get typecast in a particular genre adding i felt i had more to offer than fairy stories i wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions ultimate p 32 although phantasmagoria was her first horror game williams had created murder and crime stories in her earlier mystery games mystery house and laura bow series williams was a fan of horror genre although she did not watch many horror films as a child after a traumatic experience watching horrors of black museum 1959 at age four she began watching them again as a teen and particularly enjoyed such films as halloween 1978 shannon p 8 and movies based on stephen king novels like carrie and shining 1980 williams cited works of king and edgar allan poe as inspirations behind phantasmagoria williams had wanted to make a horror game for eight years prior to phantasmagoria and had started to design one on several occasions but none came to fruition she felt computer game industry and software technology had not yet reached point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made as a result she decided to wait until cd roms were faster and could handle real actors which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt player had to be able to empathize with character to fear for them shannon p 5 williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making game in one heroine answers a magician s advertisement for an assistant and gets job but magician turns out to be insane another was set in past with female protagonist getting involved in supernatural life of a magician character that idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts final story as it appears in game has a contemporary setting but combines elements from modern fiction 19th century literature and classic horror films of 1950s phantasmagoria was first sierra on line game script to be written like a film screenplay shannon p 150 during writing stage williams was under pressure to ensure phantasmagoria was a commercial success for sierra she also faced concerns from her husband ken williams company president and co founder of sierra who wanted company to focus more on lower cost combat oriented animated games and was also concerned about level of violence in phantasmagoria williams said she knew rape scene in particular would be controversial but she felt it was essential to plot because it was a turning point that made adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with don she felt rest of story would make no sense without scene but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from game before production ended script numbered roughly 550 pages when completed about four times size of an average hollywood screenplay it also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes in preparation for writing it williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays shannon p 9 she also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify elements of fear she immersed herself so deeply into genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading she also spent about six months researching historical aspects of story before writing process williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games like laura bow series and some of king s quest games she said her own personality was a partial inspiration for protagonist adrienne although it was not purposeful i think it just kind of naturally worked out that way andy hoyos game s art director and a horror aficionado participated in brainstorming sessions and discussions with williams during writing stage shannon p 98 he conceived ideas for most of death scenes and tried to make each one different and original with what he called fresh approaches to murder williams wanted to include more scenes with adrienne and don as a happy normal couple so that don s transformation to evil would have greater impact she proved unable to do so while also maintaining correct pacing for gameplay williams wrote phantasmagoria with mass market in mind targeting casual players as well as die hard computer game fans to that end she wrote game in short chapters to break it into smaller easier to play sections her targeted demographic for game was ages 16 and older she chose title phantasmagoria after reading word in a reference book about history of magic and magicians term refers to a 17th century theatrical horror show in which spirits of dead were revealed in a darkened theater by use of a modified magic lantern design andy hoyos was art director for phantasmagoria shannon p 97 and kim white prugh and brian judy were among computer artists shannon p 102 it was first computer game prugh worked on shannon p 104 mark hood a veteran sierra programmer shannon p 144 and mark seibert served as phantasmagoria project managers shannon p 147 seibert called managing project much more of a technical and managerial problem solving job than i ever envisioned shannon p 148 unlike previous sierra games it also involved managing a great deal of outside resources such as keeping studio and outside art contractors on schedule game s three dimensional graphics were among first rendered on silicon graphics software in creating look of game hoyos drew particular inspiration from films of tim burton and he particularly tried to emulate lighting sets and imaginative edge of batman 1989 other influences included films alien 1979 and hellraiser 1987 phantasmagoria was designed using 3 d software package alias shannon p 103 hoyos started by designing rooms shannon p 105 then created furniture and added textures and lighting once complete computer rendered final images of each room which became backgrounds for game while most computer games at time had between 80 and 100 background pictures shannon p 145 phantasmagoria had more than 1 000 game developers realized early during development that game could not be completed entirely in house due to large scope of project and required working with hollywood agencies actors and special effects houses among others this added further complexity to game s development and design gerald b wolfe game s director of photography spoke to artists about how to set up camera angles during filming to best accommodate design of rooms mannequins created in computer substituted as stand ins for actors to help wolfe position shots most of artists had never created computer generated backgrounds for video captured characters and found it to be a challenging process seibert said bridging gap between hollywood and software world was difficult at first but after about four weeks of shooting two sides had come to a common language and had a greater understanding of process hoyos said biggest difficulty in designing look of game was creating a definitive scale for environment and ensuring objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism shannon p 100 once filming was completed more than 20 two hour beta sp video tapes of footage had to be edited down to fit actions of game shannon p 146 programming included editing original video footage and mixing rendered images of doors drawers chairs and other objects into footage frame by frame which was necessary for more than 100 scenes shannon p 149 game required more polishing and fine tuning than most games of its time due to many video components and programmers had to determine desired frame rate data transfer rate and desired resolution of video elements another challenge for game was cd resource management since many of scenes in game could be repeated in multiple chapters some pieces of code were written onto several different cds to reduce number of times player had to swap discs in middle of a chapter an unusual practice for computer games at time final game was on seven discs a large number for a computer game and more than four or five discs originally expected casting twenty five professional actors were cast in phantasmagoria a first look p 26 roberta williams watched audition tapes of all roles and was involved with mark seibert in picking actors only actor that siebert chose without williams input was victoria morsell as protagonist adrienne delaney williams had watched other audition tapes for part and was not happy with any of choices while she was on vacation seibert watched morsell s audition and immediately selected her for part williams was initially concerned that she was not involved in decision but later came to agree that morsell was correct choice morsell mostly had television experience but had also previously worked in film and theater roles shannon pp 127 128 she had to work 10 to 12 hours a day six days a week for three months to capture all her character s actions and movements david homb portrayed adrienne s husband don gordon shannon p 132 morsell and homb started dating in real life after filming shannon p 131 robert miano was cast as villain zoltan carno carnovasch he had previously appeared in several films by phantasmagoria director peter maris shannon p 138 comic relief roles of harriet and cyrus were played by v joy lee and steven w bailey respectively lee had mostly done theater work in atlanta and seattle areas along with appearing in some industrial films and an episode of northern exposure shannon p 139 bailey had been an actor in seattle for about three years doing mostly stage work as well as some commercials television episodes independent films and industrial films for united states navy shannon p 141 malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor douglas seale stella stevens played antiques store owner lou ann geoff played bob realtor and carl neimic played phone technician mike traci clauson portrayed marie carno s fifth and final wife filming phantasmagoria was sierra s first game to use live actors integrated with computer generated backgrounds about 600 scenes were filmed for game total filming took about four months 12 hours a day shooting six days a week more than 200 people were ultimately involved in making of game a total of 800 000 was originally budgeted for phantasmagoria but it ended up costing 4 5 million budget issues caused some friction between roberta and ken williams it was first game made in a new filming studio built by sierra in oakhurst california same location as sierra s headquarters shannon p 115 it cost 1 5 million to build and was overseen by studio manager bill crow who said phantasmagoria essentially started with design and creation of studio sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage shooting process including software to digitize video into computer some of software was built as game was being made and as need for new tools was being identified shannon p 116 sierra wanted game to have hollywood quality film sequences so they sought a director with experience in film industry they hired peter maris shannon p 112 whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies shannon p 114 maris and roberta williams collaborated a great deal from beginning of process with maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker s perspective and williams explaining her desires from a game designer s perspective ultimate p 34 maris set up camera angles and worked with actors shannon p 113 using three motion controlled cameras during shooting a first look p 27 all filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen and digitized information was later loaded into silicon graphics computers which synchronized relative motion of computer generated three dimensional background art next live action and backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by petro vlahos s system computer imaging components made phantasmagoria a very different experience for maris than his usual film industry work crow served as a production coordinator during filming helping facilitate what happened on stage he also directed scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required coordination of animated sequences with live action cindy jordan worked as makeup artist due to nature of filming for a computer game certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately like adrienne simply crossing a room many of actors including morsell lee and bailey had never done any blue screen acting before shannon p p p 143 and miano had only done it once shannon p 135 morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically shannon p 130 such items as tables chairs doors or stairs that actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match blue screen and were occasionally challenging for actors to work with williams p 14 during one scene david homb accidentally stood in such a way that his arm appeared to be going through living room wall shannon p 133 morsell found it challenging to film a scene near end of game in which adrienne is pleading with don while getting strapped into chair with a guillotine overhead several different versions of scene had to be filmed and morsell said it was difficult for her to work up genuine emotion she needed take after take torture devices featured in game were scale models made by local craftsmen during one scene mansion roof starts to collapse causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around actors to achieve this crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard which had to fall in correct sequence in another scene adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks to film scene without damaging equipment crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for shoot three hoses ran through pipe so water would spray in multiple directions shannon p 118 chase scene at end of game in which don pursues adrienne throughout entire mansion took a full week to film homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from adrienne pouring acid on him only one prosthesis was available and it was in such bad shape by end of filming that williams said we were essentially holding it in place with proverbial wire and bailing wax several scenes in phantasmagoria involved animals including a doberman pinscher two cats a beagle and several rats shannon p 123 sierra commissioned dave macmillan and other hollywood animal handlers from company worldwide movie animals to handle animals shannon p 122 two cats were required to portray adrienne s pet spaz because cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by fresno flats historical society and used as props in game society was thanked in credits as a result ultimately all of scenes filmed for phantasmagoria were used in final game some were edited for length and pacing but none were cut altogether despite a storyline running over a course of seven days adrienne wears same wardrobe throughout entire game an orange shirt and black pants williams said this is because many of adrienne s actions throughout game can be repeated by player over and over making it difficult to change her wardrobe without it becoming a nightmare of shooting only solutions she saw were to allow less decision making by player or to keep flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes williams said she decided latter option was ultimately better for game an orange shirt was chosen for character because it was best color to shoot against blue screen none of characters wear blue purple gray or any shade of green similar to blue screen for that same reason effects thumb 280 px right alt still from game with adrienne delaney s face being ripped apart in one of several special effects created by character shop a model cast of actress victoria morsell s head was pulled apart by strings to create appearance that a demon was ripping head apart for phantasmagoria s special effects sierra sought professional effects house character shop headed by senior creature maker rick lazzarini shannon p 119 core special effects team for game consisted of lazzarini michael and bill zahn shannon p 121 lazzarini said making phantasmagoria was a much faster and more cooperative process than in film industry due to tight filming schedule most effects had to be done in one shot with no cuts so there was less margin for error shannon p 120 they created effects for all death scenes in game which included creating assorted body prostheses burn makeup and what lazzarini called gallons of fake blood which was made of sugar water and dye adrienne s head is split open by a swinging pendulum blade in one death scene an effect that took several hours to set up a fake head was created from a model cast of actress victoria morsell s head shannon p 129 with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it and strings attached to either side so it could be pulled apart crew only had one head model so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take after filming was completed crew put head back together and took a picture of morsell with it shannon p 12 one scene involved a burning head which was created by taking a cast of actor s face head and body with a plaster then placing soft rubber over cast to simulate human flesh it was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned for burn effects placed on body after fire crew made a sculpture of wounds then mounted them onto rubber appliances which were glued to actor for harriet s death scene in which she is scalped and her brain is visible makeup artist cindy jordan put a cap over actress v joy lee s head and covered it with mortician s wax to make it look bumpy another special effect involved a spirit that appears in form of ectoplasm during a seance it was created from cellulose water and green food coloring shannon p 13 it proved difficult to make and several attempts were made before right consistency was achieved to create appearance of it coming out of actress v joy lee s mouth an eight foot long hose was attached to side of her face project manager mark seibert had to suck fake ectoplasm through hose to get it in then during filming he spit it out it took several shots before take was successful shannon p 14 and it looked so funny during filming that crew kept laughing during takes music sierra composers mark seibert and jay user created musical score for phantasmagoria with neal providing additional music shannon p 108 most of music is a mixture of real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds and unlike previous sierra games score was recorded live rather than created in computer shannon p 110 themes for music ranged from rock and roll to opera composers observed game and various scenes to prepare their score trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build tension with music creating stingers as needed shannon p 109 for cinematic scenes they watched tapes after scenes were shot and composed music afterward this was a new process for sierra and computer game industry in general but same concept was regularly followed in film industry shannon p 111 opening theme of game features a neo gregorian chant which was performed in studio by a 135 voice choir much of underscore music that plays when player is exploring game rather than during cinematic scenes is based upon that opening scene composers made use of silence in many scenes to build up tension for moments of a pounce effect creating effect with music that something is catching listener they deliberately saved most intense music for final chapter of phantasmagoria when game becomes most intense during some chase scenes drums and low strings are used in score to simulate a heartbeat which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments release phantasmagoria took more than two years to develop sierra officials said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously in both hollywood or computer game industries and new challenges led to complexities roberta williams said it took a full year just to get people to understand what i wanted to do game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released it was originally planned that game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994 with sierra saying it would come out no later than fall of 1994 game was previewed at consumer electronics show in chicago in june 1994 where it was announced release date had been pushed back to october 1994 and that game would be made available on two discs game ultimately required seven discs shipping date was later changed again to christmas 1994 and then february 1995 before sierra said it would be delayed yet again as company continued to refine technology of live action video it was announced game would be ready in june 1995 but when sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet date was changed once more to august 3 before it was finally released in stores on august 24 1995 same day as microsoft s operating system windows 95 version phantasmagoria came out first for windows 95 windows 3 1 and ms dos then for macintosh computers in november 1995 a hint book by sierra came out at same time as game phantasmagoria was also ported to sega saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in japan where it was fully translated and dubbed into japanese and released by outrigger under name phantasm in response to all delays vince broady executive editor of monthly publication multimedia world said sierra may have been attempting to avoid same mistakes from previous year with outpost for which company released many advertisements and reviews but then over promoted and released before it was finished sierra spokeswoman kathy gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing outpost and sierra had tried to fix them minimum system requirements were an ibm compatible 486 25 8 megabytes of ram 5 megabytes hard disk space svga 256 colors and a 2x cd rom it supported sound blaster compatible sound cards and for ms dos game worked with a megahertz chip it sold for as much as 80 in some stores but was typically sold for 69 95 phantasmagoria was heavily advertised by sierra in advance of its release and company touted it as its biggest game to date it was sierra s first computer game targeted to an adult audience there was no legislated rating system for computer games in united states in place although one was being debated before u s senate at time sierra was among several major software companies that voluntarily supported ratings system designed by entertainment software rating board which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases game was given an m rating for mature audiences meaning intended for audiences 17 or older as a result it carried a content warning on box that said contains adult subject matter game box prominently displayed this rating as well as a warning on back panel that game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children it also encouraged parents to review material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors phantasmagoria also received mature ratings in germany and united kingdom game itself includes a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored when filter is in place screen blurs during most violent sections so player can hear action but cannot see it sierra officials believed it was first cd rom adventure game that self censored upon command sierra producer mark seibert said there are some pretty gruesome things and we re concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line but gene emery of providence journal said censoring option was unlikely to stop any computer literate 10 year old and by scrambling portions of videos that might be considered offensive censorship option actually makes explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are in october 1997 first chapter of phantasmagoria was included in roberta williams anthology a limited edition collection of 15 games created by williams over 18 years phantasmagoria was made available for digital download on website gog com starting in february 2010 for 9 99 reception sales phantasmagoria quickly became best selling game in united states and was sierra s best selling computer game to date it grossed 12 000 000 and sold 300 000 units during its first week end of release debuting at number four in pc data s august 1995 list of top selling computer games for ms dos and windows it followed mechwarrior 2 microsoft flight simulator and myst by september it had reached number one on list among computer games and ranked third among all computer software following windows 95 and microsoft plus interaction a magazine published by sierra on line wrote that no other sierra game topped game charts as quickly as phantasmagoria did phantasmagoria unprecedented success p 25 by end of december it remained at number three among overall software and number one among computer games and by january it was estimated as many as 500 000 copies had been sold according to sierra on line its global sales surpassed 600 000 units by march 1996 phantasmagoria finished 1995 as ninth best selling game of year according to an analysis by pc data of sales by 42 retail chains in january 1996 phantasmagoria was fourth best seller among ms dos and windows games behind microsoft flight simulator myst and command conquer and it was number six among all computer software by february 10 it was number five among ms dos and windows games and by february 24 it was number 10 it received a boost in june 1996 possibly due to pending release of its sequel phantasmagoria a puzzle of flesh and jumped back up to seventh among best selling computer software programs according to computer life magazine one year after phantasmagoria was released it still remained in best seller charts and more than one million copies were ultimately sold making it sierra s first game to reach that milestone npd techworld which tracked sales in united states reported 301 138 units sold of phantasmagoria by december 2002 reviews phantasmagoria received mixed reviews vince broady executive editor of multimedia world said sierra was smart to try to capture adult market which was looking for sophisticated games especially after popularity of games such as 7th guest dwight silverman of houston chronicle declared it best game of year calling it a masterwork and as close as it gets to a film you control although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content entertainment weekly gave it a b and called it one of surest signs yet of computer games approaching quality level of movies review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists but also some horrific touches that seem a bit derivative such as a freddy krueger like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed kim mcdaniel of salt lake tribune called it most sophisticated computer game to date and a weird wild horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn even if you aren t normally faint of heart although mcdaniel said it might be easy for experienced players she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual players than difficult games like 7th guest a billboard magazine review said phantasmagoria lives up to advanced billing and aims to and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects in trusty scare flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex usa today writer joe wilson gave it three and a half stars and called it well produced visually appealing frighteningly realistic and a much needed change from normal fare although he said plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through gene emery of providence journal said game was an impressive work a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer generated environment coupled with a musical score that s spooky without being overwhelming he also called gameplay elegant in its simplicity san francisco chronicle writer laura evenson called it unpredictable and addictive comparing it to a good mystery novel a reviewer for next generation was pleased with story production values of cutscenes and way game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control however he found that lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced players since they would be able to finish entire game in a day or two and recommended it strictly for those who were new to adventure genre ric manning of gannett news service wrote graphics are terrific but don t play on a full stomach steve la rue of u t san diego found game visually opulent and interesting with dialogue a lot better than i expected given trite gothic novel plot but also said he had to adjust to gradual contemplative pace jack warner of atlanta journal constitution wrote it s hackneyed but art is so good acting sufficiently convincing and atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going although he said precious little happens in first few discs computer gaming world writer arinn dembo called storyline of a couple buying a haunted mansion a cliche so familiar that it needs no explanation but said it still worked in a computer game because player could directly experience it in that medium rather than simply watching it in a film dembo also praised game for featuring a female protagonist though she said adrienne was too much of an exaggeratedly feminine girlie type girl overall dembo said game achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game and was an important technological leap and represents a step forward for whole industry another computer gaming world review said appears to deliver on its ambitious promises and that although puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers appeal of game is exploring a setting that would have had even folks in amityville making tracks harley jebens of austin american statesman said some of acting was hilariously bad and storyline was predictable but that game keeps you engaged story draws you in and controls were well executed fort worth star telegram writer andy greiser said game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer built backgrounds but said action doesn t start to pick up until halfway point in a mixed review phil larose of advocate praised game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects and said it had gone further toward merging realms of film and game than any other computer game he also said game was too linear with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with so many recycled concepts in this game players will feel like they ve seen it all before other reviews were more negative gamespot writer jeff said expensive budget and long production history do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming he complimented graphics and music but considered game generally unchallenging characters weak violence over top and script just lame mike hall of albuquerque journal compared phantasmagoria to big budget films with multimillion dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed like cleopatra and waterworld he said graphics were beautiful but game ended too quickly plot was thin and puzzles were too easy to solve escapist writer brendan main said game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media and juxtaposition of real life actors on settings that were ordinary pixilated fare was odd and unflattering a one star review in video games guide published in 2013 now seems little more than a flawed though ambitious white elephant in a 2014 review ign writer kosta andreadis said game s special effects were still effective and that phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves violent content for end of game but he said it was ultimately less a bad game than a bad horror film and said execution although technically interesting is extremely goofy full of ludicrous situations weird plot turns bizarre dialogue and dated costume choices awards phantasmagoria earned an editor s choice award from pc gamer and a golden triad award from computer game review whose editors later gave it their 1995 best fmv of year prize it was nominated for best adventure role playing software in annual excellence in software awards competition known in game industry as which are among most prestigious honors in software development it was also named best adventure game of year by games magazine game of month by windows magazine and was one of three nominees for pc computing s game of year controversy before phantasmagoria was released compusa nation s largest discount computer retailer notified sierra it would not stock game company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer hal compton software comes out all time some we buy some we don t this one we chose not to analysts believed compusa objected to realistic violence in game lee s of jefferies co a global investment bank that followed computer game industry said compusa s decision probably would not harm overall sales of game and that it could in fact help it generate publicity he added that it s probably one of bloodiest games ever likewise vincent turzo of jefferies co said when you say you re not going to carry something of course consumers rush to stores to see what it s all about roberta williams said of compusa s announcement i m disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product some smaller retailers also decided not to stock phantasmagoria but others like walmart continued to carry it as well as graphic gore and violence rape scene in phantasmagoria drew particular attention and objections from game s critics one major newspaper claimed phantasmagoria makes a game of sexual violence multiple parents groups religious organizations community action committees and special interest groups called for a boycott and sent letters to sierra offices in droves voicing objections to game phantasmagoria was unable to be sold in australia after being refused classification by office of film and literature classification r 18 classification was not available for video games at time roberta williams anthology collection was also banned in australia because it featured a one chapter preview of game governments of two other countries also banned phantasmagoria game was spotlighted in u s senate hearings debating regulation of content in computer software industry and there was talk that it could re ignite debate in congress over whether to impose federally mandated ratings on computer software that stores would be required to enforce sierra found that williams tended to garner extremely favorable press even as phantasmagoria got negative press so company began having her discuss game in person in response to backlash williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television which she said often have more violent content than phantasmagoria in part because computer games are often regarded as children s entertainment rather than for adults williams said phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like doom and mortal kombat and that unlike those games phantasmagoria is good guy not going around shooting up people sierra spokeswoman rebecca buxton and dennis cloutier company s vice president of sales both expressed surprise at reaction to game because sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about adult content in its marketing box warnings and censoring options cloutier said company was essentially censoring ourselves steven l kent of seattle times said there were more violent games than phantasmagoria but that most video game violence appears in computer animations and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live action game which elicits a stronger emotional response in april 1998 three years after game was released kentucky teachers retirement system came under criticism for owning 435 000 shares worth 9 million in cendant which by this point had purchased sierra on line due to violence in phantasmagoria and other sierra games kentucky sen mitch mcconnell arkansas gov mike huckabee iowa gov terry branstad and lamar alexander former governor of tennessee all asked system to sell its stock mcconnell was particularly critical of rape scene they suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in west paducah kentucky and jonesboro arkansas and increasingly violent world many american children enter when they sit down in front of a computer screen pat miller executive secretary of kentucky teachers retirement system said system wasn t aware of phantasmagoria or sierra s products and that it invested in cendant because it s part of an index fund of 500 best stocks in country miller added that if retirement system finds a problem with sierra on line it would ask cendant to cease ownership in company and that system would divest its stock if it refused miller said we re not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children we know that our membership would not want us to do that same letter was also sent to heads of teachers retirement systems in california ohio and texas legacy commercial success of phantasmagoria had a positive financial impact on sierra on line before its release company s stock rose in july 1995 up 3 875 to 30 875 which vince turzo of jeffries co attributed in part due to anticipation of phantasmagoria sierra s stock continued to rise after it was released company closed on nasdaq stock market at 43 25 on september 8 1995 translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months which turzo attributed partially to success for quarter ending september 30 1995 sierra posted a profit of 3 26 million compared to a loss of 850 000 in 1994 this improvement exceeded expectations in analysts forecasts and was thanks largely to phantasmagoria sales williams returned to work on king s quest series after phantasmagoria was completed sierra used same technology and hollywood techniques from phantasmagoria to make beast within a gabriel knight mystery 1995 another interactive movie adventure game williams later described phantasmagoria as game that best represented her career as a game designer due to its development delays phantasmagoria was released after other interactive movie games like wing commander iii and under a killing moon so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that game subgenre as other titles harley jebens of austin american statesman said by time it was finally released computer games that incorporate video were becoming a common sight on software store racks sean clark a project leader at lucasarts feared success of phantasmagoria would set a bad precedent in that software companies would think they need huge budgets and lots of discs to have a successful game rather than focusing on quality sequel a phantasmagoria sequel phantasmagoria a puzzle of flesh 1996 was released by sierra a year after original it was written and designed by lorelei shannon roberta williams design partner on king s quest vii williams was not involved with it and game featured a very different tone and completely different characters with no direct connection to storyline of first game salter p 75 shannon said original game was a haunted house story in style of a late night creature feature while her game has more science fiction and fantasy horror elements in style of works of clive barker and tanith lee roberta williams said both she and her husband ken enjoyed sequel a preview for a puzzle of flesh was included in first cd of original phantasmagoria game ken williams had wanted roberta to work on a phantasmagoria sequel immediately after success of first game but she could not do so due to her obligations to king s quest viii ken williams felt sequel was less successful because players could sense absence of roberta s style it s as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten within a few pages fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed regardless of quality of work ken williams said a third game was not produced after a puzzle of flesh because of issues after sierra was acquired by cuc international in 1996 distribution was handled by davidson associates another cuc company which primarily sold educational software williams said company was uncomfortable with violent content in phantasmagoria and did not attempt to sell sequel as aggressively as sierra would have ramsay p 203 he also claimed jan davidson wife of chairman and ceo bob davidson personally did not like game and wanted it shut down due to these sales challenges williams said there was no reason to make a third phantasmagoria roberta williams said she was asked by sierra to make a third phantasmagoria game and that she said she would consider it but it was not ultimately made williams said references external links category 1995 video games category dark
