prior route connects several historical settlement sites in prince edward county continuing east through bath to what is now kingston in 1784 following american revolution united empire loyalists began to arrive in upper canada hoping to settle frontier near cataraqui now kingston with help of military loyalists blazed a trail west from cataraqui to bath a distance of this trail would become a section of highway 33 nearly 150 years later on june 5 1799 asa danforth jr began construction eastward from toronto on a road which was to extend governor s road through port hope and to trent river that road completed in 1801 would be described by acting surveyor general william to be good for use in dead of winter but impassible during wet summers when path turned to a bottomless mud pit it would be extended in 1802 to reach bay of quinte at stone mills now glenora and a ferry crossing established to adolphustown bath extension of danforth road 1802 provided access to a key early colonial road bath road which had long joined bath to kingston sporadic privately operated ferry services between adolphustown and stone mills glenora were initially a primitive affair in october 1835 a mr clark from cobourg tipped out of bark canoe ferrying him to glenora and was buried without an inquest a year earlier a rev mathew miller from cobourg had drowned after falling through february ice road itself was no better barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines this road would serve as initial mail road linking kingston to toronto but was poorly maintained and soon allowed to fall into disrepair by 1817 kingston road replaced or bypassed much of danforth s road following a similar path to trent river with minor improvements in routing around scarborough port hope cobourg and grafton but then blazing a more northerly route through belleville and napanee like danforth road before it this 1817 york road was initially a muddy dirt road it would however suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make two day trip from kingston to toronto and permit enterprises such as branches of newly established bank of montreal safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables by 1839 napanee kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road while area around bath and bay of quinte would remain a major agricultural region pattern of redirecting kingston toronto traffic further inland which started with construction of kingston road 1817 would be repeated with grand trunk railway 1856 and ultimately highway 401 1964 due to its historic role in early colonisation and its prime waterfront scenic location original route from kingston westward through bath and quinte region would be
