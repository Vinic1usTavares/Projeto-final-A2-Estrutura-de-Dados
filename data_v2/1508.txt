to run from love after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups she continued i think i ve developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in

power pop chorus that will stick in your brain after second or third listen song is set in time signature of common time and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute it is written in key of g major and swift s vocals span one octave from g3 to d5 it follows chord progression of c2 g5 d5 c2 d5 alan macpherson of guardian noted that song reprises joyous rush of swift s breakthrough hit love

writing i t starts in past at start of a relationship and then lets us know it s a flashback they re sitting on couch reminiscing it then jumps back to beginning and steps us through couple s years together but all while shifting perspective jumping between their separate memories james dinh of mtv noted that song features an uplifting country pop melody and a big chorus and it talks about wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past priya elan of guardian believed that mine depicts a stop start relationship between a normal guy and girl leah greenblatt of

would try something a little more out of ordinary nick levine of digital spy gave song four stars out of five commenting that although song was formulaic formula was executed convincingly chrissie dickinson of chicago tribune noted that mine is an epitome of swift s classic song craft calling it simple but honest expressions of emotion anthony benigno of daily news said that although track is reminiscent of swift s previous hits he added song s origins are grounded more in failed relationships than storybook ones blake boldt of engine 145 gave song a thumbs down criticizing swift s failure to deliver an expected big payoff through song he contended that this failure proves that swift s songwriting skills are still raw still needing that one last polish in order to shine credits and
