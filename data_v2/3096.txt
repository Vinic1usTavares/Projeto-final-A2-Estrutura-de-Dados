multi instrumentalist and programmer jonny greenwood wrote sampler software used to create king of limbs radiohead worked on king of limbs with longtime producer nigel godrich intermittently from may 2009 to january 2011 it was recorded in los angeles at home of actress drew barrymore radiohead wanted to avoid repeating protracted recording process of their previous album in rainbows 2007 according to singer thom yorke band felt that if we are gonna carry on we need to do it for a new set of reasons cover artist stanley donwood said that whereas in rainbows was very much a definitive statement band wanted to make an album that was more transitory multi instrumentalist jonny greenwood said we didn t want to pick up guitars and write chord sequences we didn t want to sit in front of a computer either we wanted a third thing which involved playing and programming whereas radiohead developed in rainbows from live performance king of limbs developed from studio experimentation yorke sought to move further from conventional recording methods after he and godrich became interested in djing during their time in los angeles godrich proposed a two week experiment whereby band used turntables and vinyl emulation software instead of conventional instruments according to godrich that two week experiment ended up being fucking six months and that s that record whole story of all of it much of album is constructed from samples of band s playing which were looped and edited radiohead used sampling software written by greenwood which he described as a wonky rubbish version of ableton live radiohead used this to create sequences of music to which yorke wrote melodies and lyrics a process he likened to editing a film guitarist ed o brien told rolling stone brick walls we tended to hit were when we knew something was great like bloom but not finished then colin greenwood had that bassline and thom started singing those things suddenly made it a hundred times better on

further from conventional rock music and song structures in favour of moody rhythm heavy electronica glacially paced ballads and ambient psychedelia it makes prominent use of sampling looping and ambient sounds including samples of natural sounds such as birdsong and wind pitchfork described its music as aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital detritus robotically repetitive yet humanly off kilter parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of melodic relief several critics noted dubstep influences mccormick neil 11 february 2011 radiohead king of limbs album

portraits of radiohead members in style of gerhard richter but abandoned idea as i d never painted with oils before and i m not gerhard richter so it was just a series of painted disasters as with

mainstream critics king of limbs has an average score of 80 based on 40 reviews indicating generally favourable reviews michael brodeur of boston globe praised tense calm these eight songs maintain a composure that feels constantly ready to crack and wrote that where in rainbows was mellow but brisk an album that felt on its way somewhere these songs are eerie and insidious creeping like shadows popmatters corey beasley wrote king of limbs is a beautiful record one that begs more of a conscious listen than its predecessor but one that provides equal if different thrills in doing so francois marchand of vancouver sun said that album bridges radiohead s many different styles and was worth embracing critic robert christgau awarded album a two star honourable mention and recommended songs little by little and bloom quietus critic ben graham felt it could be radiohead s best work writing king of limbs revisits kid a amnesiac period that alienated so many fans of ok computer but does so with a greater maturity and weight of experience that enriches both songs and process some felt king of limbs was less innovative than radiohead s prior albums mark pytlik of pitchfork called it well worn terrain for radiohead and while it continues to yield rewarding results band s signature game changing ambition is missed allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine described it as radiohead doing what they do without flash or pretension gently easing from role of pioneers to craftsmen luke lewis of nme felt it was a record to respect for its craft rather than worship for its greatness in a retrospective 2015 article for stereogum ryan leas concluded that king of limbs was very good occasionally great music by a pivotal band that nevertheless felt like something of a letdown because it wasn t ultimately some genius stroke none of us expected he argued that king of limbs live from basement was superior you hear muscle and movement and bodies existing where now tapped out ingenuity of radiohead s electronic impulses has begun to make their recorded music brittle los angeles times writer ann powers wrote that king of limbs had divided listeners with some finding it too low key abstract or doomy or too similar to radiohead s previous work some fans having waited three and a half years for follow up to in rainbows were disappointed by an album of only eight tracks that felt relatively dashed together and unfounded theories spread of a second album soon to be released king of limbs was named one of best albums of 2011 by several publications wire and guardian named it
