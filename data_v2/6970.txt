water in area is known to contain arsenic compounds and illness was believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of area inhaled vapor of boiling arsenic contaminated water however further investigations have led to conclusion that arsenic content in groundwater did not differ from that of local drinking supply and that illness reported was likely caused by vaporization of troilite a sulfur bearing compound present within meteorite in large amounts which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact

water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency four days after meteorite impact and unexplained illness most villagers reported having recovered jose orozco reported details about event such as water boiling in muddy crater for ten minutes from heat of impact presented a problem for experts because impact site is at a high altitude of more than meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through earth s denser lower atmosphere and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on earth since their heated outer layers ablate from objects before impacting it was later confirmed that meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during
