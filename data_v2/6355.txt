lassen peak commonly referred to as mount lassen is southernmost active volcano in cascade range of western united states located in shasta cascade region of northern california it is part of cascade volcanic arc which stretches from southwestern british columbia to northern california lassen peak reaches an elevation of standing above northern sacramento valley it supports many flora and fauna among its diverse habitats which are subject to frequent snowfall and reach high elevations a lava dome lassen peak has a volume of making it largest lava dome on earth volcano arose from destroyed northern flank of now collapsed brokeoff volcano about 27 000 years ago from a series of eruptions over course of a few years mountain has been significantly eroded by glaciers over last 25 000 years and is now covered in talus deposits on may 22 1915 a powerful explosive eruption at lassen peak devastated nearby areas and spread volcanic ash as far as to east this explosion was most powerful in a series of eruptions from 1914 through 1917 lassen peak and mount st helens were only two volcanoes in contiguous united states to erupt during 20th century lassen volcanic national park which encompasses an area of was created to preserve areas affected by eruption for future observation and study and to protect nearby volcanic features park along with nearby lassen national forest and lassen peak have become popular destinations for recreational activities including climbing hiking backpacking snowshoeing kayaking and backcountry skiing lassen peak is still considered active thus it poses a threat to nearby area through lava flows pyroclastic flows lahars volcanically induced mudslides landslides and debris flows ash avalanches and floods to monitor this threat lassen peak and surrounding vicinity are closely observed with sensors by california volcano observatory geography thumb aerial view of mount lassen with snow early may 2018 located in lassen volcanic national park lassen peak lies in shasta county east of city of redding in u s state of california lassen peak and rest of national park area are surrounded by lassen national forest which has an area of nearby towns include mineral in tehama county and viola in shasta county lassen peak reaches an elevation of according to 1992 data from u s national geodetic survey 1981 data from geographic names information system lists mountain s elevation at lassen peak marks southernmost major volcano in cascade range rising above northern sacramento valley bounded by sacramento valley and klamath mountains to west and sierra nevada mountain range to south it is second tallest peak in california segment of cascades behind mount shasta which lies to north due to its proximity to nearby volcanoes mount tehama and mount diller it is not easy to distinguish from its neighboring peaks physical geography lassen peak has highest known winter snowfall amounts in california there is an average annual snowfall of and in some years more than of snow falls at its base elevation of at lake helen lassen peak area receives more precipitation rain sleet hail snow etc than anywhere in cascade range south of three sisters volcanoes in oregon though volcano lies too far to south to support a permanent snow cover over entire mountain heavy annual snowfall on lassen peak creates fourteen permanent patches of snow on and around mountain top despite lassen s rather modest elevation but no glaciers lightning has been known to strike area frequently during summer thunderstorms these can initiate fires on july 23 2012 a lightning strike started reading fire to northeast of paradise meadow region which was contained after it reached an area of during summer and fall of 2016 national park service carried out prescribed fires to reduce possibly fuel for fires in mineral headquarters area and manzanita and juniper lake areas respectively ecology lassen peak supports a variety of flora that include mountain hemlock whitebark pine and alpine wildflowers mountain hemlocks generally only reach an elevation of while whitebark pines reach up to throughout national park forests can be found featuring red fir mountain alder western white pine white fir lodgepole pine jeffrey pine ponderosa pine incense cedar juniper and live oak other plants found in lassen peak area consist of coyote mint mule s ears ferns corn lilies red mountain heathers pinemat manzanitas greenleaf manzanitas bush fremont s buckwheat granite gilia mountain pride mariposa tulips and a variety of chaparral shrubs various habitats in lassen volcanic national park support about 300 vertebrate species like mammals reptiles amphibians fish and birds including bald eagles which are listed as threatened under endangered species act of 1973 and peregrine falcons which were removed from endangered species list in 1999 in forested areas below animals include american black bears mule deer martens brown creepers mountain chickadees white headed woodpeckers long toed salamanders and several bat species at higher elevations clark s nutcrackers deer mice and chipmunks can be found among mountain hemlock stands and subalpine zones with sparse vegetation host populations of gray crowned rosy finches pikas and golden mantled ground squirrels among scattered stands of pinemat manzanita red fir and lodgepole pine animals include dark eyed juncos montane voles and sagebrush lizards meadows at bottoms of valleys along streams and lakes support pacific tree frogs western terrestrial garter snakes common snipes and mountain pocket gophers other animals found within national park area include snakes like rubber boas common garter snakes and striped cougars amphibians like newts salamanders rough skinned newts

trout tui chubs speckled lahontan and tahoe suckers and four invasive fish species including brook trout brown trout golden shiners and fathead minnows prominent invertebrate species include california tortoiseshell butterflies geology thumb 300px lassen peak s northeastern face lassen peak lies near southern end of cascade volcanic arc at western edge of basin and range province like other cascade volcanoes it was fed by magma chambers produced by subduction of oceanic juan de fuca tectonic plate under western edge of continental north american tectonic plate region is also affected geologically by cascadia subduction zone which dips eastward beneath western coast of north america in pacific northwest as well as horizontal stretching to east of crustal rock in basin and range province about 3 million years ago southern limit of active volcanoes in cascades corresponded to yana volcanic center to south of lassen peak but currently southern edge of lassen volcanic national park now marks same border indicating that cascade arc s southern end migrates at a rate of annually in southern segment of cascades volcanoes exhibit widespread and long lived activity produced by magma that ranges from low silica basalt to siliceous silica rich rhyolite lassen volcanic center is fed by two magma chambers one calc alkaline reservoir common to rest of cascade volcanoes and other a smaller volume of low potassium olivine tholeiitic basalt associated with basin and range province within region most if not all of volcanic rock has erupted in past 3 million years during this period at least five large andesitic stratovolcanoes such as mount maidu formed in vicinity of lassen volcanic national park building volcanic cones before going extinct and undergoing erosion for most volcanic centers in southern cascades one volcano becomes active and normally becomes extinct as another begins to erupt but at lassen locus maidu and dittmar volcanic centers overlapped during late pliocene to early pleistocene volcanism within lassen vicinity follows a trend of intermittent episodic eruptions punctuating long periods of dormancy a pattern which persisted through late pleistocene and holocene during past 825 000 years area has produced hundreds of explosive eruptions over an area of and past 50 000 years have seen seven major silicic eruptive episodes that produced dacitic lava domes tephra and pyroclastic flows along with five periods of basaltic and andesitic lava flows local activity began 600 000 years ago with formation of brokeoff volcano alternatively known as mount tehama around same time about 614 000 years ago an explosive eruption southwest of lassen peak produced of pumice and ash covering area between vent and what is now city of ventura california this deposit referred to as rockland tephra reaches up to several inches in thickness within san francisco bay area and can be found as far as northern nevada and southern idaho same eruption also formed one of three known calderas within cascade others being crater lake and kulshan caldera at mount baker shortly after lassen volcanic center a cluster of closely spaced volcanoes formed in area covering nearby caldera during late pleistocene it produced andesite lava flows that built brokeoff composite volcano stratovolcano following end of volcanism at brokeoff volcano hydrothermal fluids began chemically weathering minerals in andesite flows altering once strong rocks into easily eroded materials glaciers and streams were able to rapidly erode deep channels into these altered volcanic rocks reducing once lofty peak of brokeoff volcano into landscape we see today following demise of brokeoff volcano volcanism migrated to lassen domefield to northeast thumb left dacitic volcanic rock on lassen peak s summit lassen peak s lava dome formed about 27 000 years ago from a series of eruptions over a few years undergoing significant glacial erosion between 25 000 and 18 000 years ago bowl shaped depression on volcano s northeastern flank called a cirque was eroded by a glacier that extended out from dome by 18 000 years ago lassen peak started to form a mound shaped dacite lava dome pushing its way through tehama s destroyed northern flank as lava dome grew it shattered overlaying rock which formed a blanket of angular talus around emerging steep sided volcano likely resembling nearby 1 100 year old chaos crags lassen peak reached its present height in a relatively short time probably in just a few years within past 1 000 years or so activity at lassen peak has produced six dacite lava domes erupted tephra and pyroclastic flows and built cinder cone and fantastic lava beds it also created rockfalls at chaos jumbles only cascade volcano with an elevation above that is not a stratovolcano lassen peak is a rhyodacitic lava dome it represents one of largest lava domes on earth with a height of above its surroundings and an approximate volume of unlike more conventional conical stratovolcanoes like mount shasta or mount rainier lassen peak is part of a volcanic center that erupts from different vents which each remain active for a number of years or decades but often do not erupt from same vent twice also known as a monogenetic volcanic field 2000 years after lassen s formation it was surrounded by glaciers which ate away at its spiny protrusions of dacite due to glacial erosion from last local glacial advance which ceased roughly 15 000 years ago lassen s lava dome is now covered in broken rock fragments at base of crags called talus deposits only its crag formations on its southern flank near summit trailhead have not been significantly altered by glacial erosion subfeatures thumb right 250px chaos crags and lassen peak as seen from manzanita lake lassen volcanic center includes brokeoff volcano lassen s dacitic lava dome and a number of small andesitic shield volcanoes found northeast of lassen peak lassen dome field includes 30 dacitic lava domes such as bumpass mountain mount helen ski heil peak and reading peak other major lava domes include chaos crags eagle peak sunflower flat and vulcans castle nearby shield volcanoes include prospect peak and west prospect peak and there are three cones close to lassen peak cinder cone hat mountain and raker peak hydrothermal area inside lassen peak volcanic center with features located southeast and southwest of lassen peak represents largest geothermal area in united states besides one present at yellowstone national park chaos crags a series of five small lava domes represent youngest part of lassen volcanic center s dome field reaching an elevation of about above their surroundings they were produced by vigorous explosive eruptions of pumice and ash followed by effusive activity which created unstable edifices that partially collapsed and formed pyroclastic flows made of incandescent lava blocks and lithic ash six domes were originally formed though one was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow roughly 350 years ago one of domes collapsed to produce chaos jumbles an area where three enormous rockfalls transformed local area and traveled as far as down dome s slopes cinder cone which reaches an elevation of above its surrounding area in northeastern region of lassen volcanic national park forms a symmetrical pyroclastic cone youngest mafic volcano in lassen volcanic center it is surrounded by unvegetated block lava and has concentric craters at its summit cinder cone is comprised by five basaltic andesite and andesite lava flows and it also has two cinder cone volcanoes with two scoria cones first of which was mostly destroyed by lava flows from its base in 1850 and 1851 a number of observers reported an eruption at cinder cone visible from more than away with one observer near mountain claiming to have observed a lava flow running down sides of volcano however despite these testimonies and accounts in newspaper articles and several scientific journals veracity of these eruptions has been questioned by scientists from united states geological survey in addition to fact that cinder cones usually erupt lava from base vents there is a lack of physical evidence suggesting activity at volcano since its formation in 1650 in addition an old willow bush growing near summit crater that was documented during 1850s was still present in 1880s after alleged eruptions suggesting that no eruptions took place during 1850s human history thumb right 150px lassen peak national monument later expanded into lassen volcanic national park was established by united states president theodore roosevelt pictured in 1907 areas surrounding lassen peak especially to its east south and southeast represented a meeting ground for maidu yana yahi and native americans volcano is known among native populations as kai which means mountain ripped apart or fire mountain because area was not suitable for permanent habitation there is relatively scarce archaeological evidence of a native presence in lassen area first white man to reach lassen peak was jedediah smith who passed through area in 1821 as he made his way for western coast of united states after california gold rush brought increased numbers of settlers into area lassen peak was named in honor of a danish blacksmith peter lassen who guided immigrants past peak to sacramento valley during 1830s this trail was replaced by nobles emigrant trail named for guide william nobles who pioneered trail in 1851 lassen peak s first recorded ascent took place in 1851 led by grover k godfrey in 1864 helen tanner brodt became first woman to reach summit of lassen peak wanting to sketch surrounding landscape a tarn lake on lassen peak is named lake helen in her honor bumpass hell a hydrothermal vent area near lassen peak was named after a pioneer who suffered burns there and lost his leg shortly after other historic names for lassen peak include mount joseph from 1827 snow butte sister buttes and mount lassen lassen volcanic national park united states president theodore roosevelt established lassen peak national monument in 1907 despite native population claims that lassen peak was full of fire and water and would erupt again this motion was based on general belief that lassen peak was now extinct and that its vicinity contained intriguing volcanic phenomena which could be studied and observed once volcano became active again in 1914 monument was expanded to establish lassen volcanic national park on august 9 1916 park in area can be reached from california state route 89 highway eruptive history thumb lassen peak before 1914 ancient activity between 385 000 and 315 000 years ago volcanism at lassen center shifted from andesitic stratovolcano construction to production of dacite domes over past 300 000 years lassen peak area has produced more than 30 lava domes lassen peak being largest these lava domes formed as a result of rising lava that was pushed up but was too viscous to escape its source creating steep edifices lassen peak s lava dome formed 27 000 years ago from a series of eruptions over a few years undergoing significant glacial erosion between 25 000 and 18 000 years ago no volcanic activity took place 190 000 years ago to roughly 90 000 years ago but during last 100 000 years there have been at least 12 periods of eruptive activity in lassen volcanic center and since 90 000 years ago twin lakes sequence has been producing mixed lavas with variable appearances and compositions including andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows and agglutinated volcanic cones made of fused pyroclastic rocks located by lassen domefield twin lakes sequence includes construction of chaos crag dome complex between 1100 and 1000 years ago and eruptions at lassen peak beginning in 1914 prior to 1914 lassen peak likely underwent at least one explosive eruption which created a summit crater in depth with a diameter of deposits from older mudflows that can be traced specifically to lassen dome have also been found in hat creek lost creek and in a region to east of devastated area 1914 1921 on may 30 1914 despite an apparent lack of precursor earthquakes lassen became volcanically active again after 27 000 years of dormancy when it produced a steam explosion that carved out a small crater with a fairly deep lake on volcano s summit crater grew as it was carved by more than 180 similar phreatic explosions over span of more than 11 months reaching a length of on may 14 1915 lassen peak erupted lava blocks which extended as far as manton west of mountain by next day volcano had produced a dacitic lava dome between 63 and 68 percent silica which occupied its summit crater on may 19 a large eruption destroyed this dome and a new crater formed at summit no lava erupted but parts of dome fell on upper flanks of mountain which were covered in more than of snow lava mixed with snow and rock to form a lahar volcanically induced mudslide landslide and debris flow in width which coursed down side of volcano traveling and reaching hat creek after being deflected to northwest at emigrant pass lahar extended an additional down lost creek on may 20 lower hat creek valley flooded with muddy water which damaged ranch houses in old station area and caused minor injuries among a few people all of whom escaped removing homes from their foundation lahar also uprooted trees more than tall flood continued for another killing fish in pit river simultaneously dacite lava with lower viscosity than dacite from previous eruption filled summit crater overflowing and extending in two streams for down mountain s western and northeastern sides left thumb 250px great explosion eruption column of may 22 1915 was seen as far as away in foreground is loomis hot rock one of many large boulders dislodged in eruption that were too hot to touch for days after photograph by b f loomis modern photo on may 22 1915 at about 4 00 p m lassen peak produced a violent explosive eruption that ejected rock and pumice and formed a larger and deeper crater at its summit within 30 minutes volcanic ash and gas formed a column that reached altitudes of more than and could be seen from city of eureka to west this column underwent a partial collapse generating a pyroclastic flow composed of hot ash pumice rock and gas that destroyed of land and spawned a lahar extending from volcano and again reaching hat creek valley smaller mudflows also formed on every side of volcano as well a layer of pumice and volcanic ash that reached as far as northeast volcanic ash was detected up to east at city of elko nevada additionally lava flow on volcano s northeastern flank was removed by this eruption but not similar deposit on western flank eruptive output volume totaled dwarfed by 1980 eruption of mount st helens which had a volume of region on volcano s northeastern flank destroyed by eruptions in area is now known as devastated area and it along with other deposits from volcano has been altered by erosion and regrowth of vegetation though vegetation in devastated area is sparse due to its siliceous rich in silica nutrient deprived soil which cannot sustain normal tree growth due to its lack of water retention due to their small size and thin deposits 1915 eruptions will likely not be well preserved geologically after 1915 steam explosions continued for several years indicating extremely hot rock beneath lassen peak s surface in may 1917 an especially strong steam explosion formed northern crater on lassen peak s summit with eruptions lasting two days and producing an ash cloud that extended into sky june saw 21 additional explosions reported further transforming crater and creating a new vent on lassen peak s northwestern summit in june 1919 steam eruptions occurred and similar activity was observed on april 8 and april 9 in 1920 followed by steam eruptions lasting 10 12 hours in october of same year during february 1921 white steam erupted from eastern fissures on volcano in total about 400 eruptions were observed between 1914 and 1921 which were last eruptions in cascades before 1980 eruption of mount st helens which was only other volcanic eruption in contiguous united states during 20th century documentation of 20th century eruptions through pictures and film during its eruptions in early 20th century lassen peak attracted widespread media attention as first volcano to erupt in united states during 20th century unlike eruptions at mount baker mount rainier mount st helens or mount hood during 19th century lassen peak s eruptions were very well documented by newspapers and extensively photographed though there is a large supply of images documenting these eruptions at lassen peak best and most complete images were taken by local businessman benjamin franklin loomis using an 8x10 inch camera with glass plate negatives loomis made his own film and set up a darkroom in a tent he wrote of eruption he witnessed on june 14 1914 sight was fearfully grand loomis s pictures were published in his book pictorial history of lassen volcano 1926 a number of his original plates remain in archives of national park service his photographs have been used to help understand timeline and geology of 1915 eruptions of lassen peak one of lassen peak s 1917 eruptions was captured on film by justin hammer from nearby catfish lake originally silent film features sound effects added by his grandson craig martin film was rediscovered and published in 2015 by shasta historical society recent activity and current threats thumb right 250px lassen volcanic national park has an extensive hydrothermal system that includes

zones blue dashed lines indicate heavy ash fall zones blue dotted lines mark moderate ash fall zones and green spaces mark flood zones any red space indicates combined hazard zones including lahars pyroclastic flows avalanches and ash lassen peak remains an active volcano as volcanic activity including fumaroles steam vents hot springs and mudpots can be found throughout lassen volcanic national park their activity varies based on season during spring when meltwater is more abundant fumaroles and pools of water have lower temperatures while mudpots have more fluid mud supplies during summer and droughts they become drier and hotter since they cannot be cooled by ground water geothermal activity can be observed at bumpass hell little hot springs valley pilot pinnacle sulphur works devils kitchen boiling springs lake and terminal geyser as well as morgan and growler hot springs south of national park in mill canyon these are produced by boiling of underground bodies of water which generates steam at bumpass hell these features are at their most vigorous with temperatures reaching at big boiler park s biggest fumarole and one of hottest hydrothermal fumaroles in world because of their acidic conditions and heat none of these hydrothermal bodies are safe for bathing except for at guest ranch fumaroles near lassen peak in particular remained active through 1950s but have grown weaker over time they can still be found among volcano s summit craters these hydrothermal features are monitored continuously for their physical and chemical conditions by united states geological survey climbers reported steam eruptions in summit craters for decades after activity apparently ceased in 1921 and naturalist paul schulz documented 30 steam vents at summit in 1950s a report from united states geological survey declared that no one can say when but it is almost certain that lassen area will experience volcanic eruptions again similarly california volcano observatory lists its threat level as very high at time of early 20th century eruptions area surrounding volcano was only sparsely populated but a similar eruption today would threaten many lives and northern californian economy volcanic eruptions occur with similar frequency to major earthquakes from san andreas fault and at least 10 eruptions have taken place within state during past 1 000 years most recent at lassen peak under 1 percent of state s population lives within hazard zones that could be affected by an eruption but collectively hazard zones are visited by more than 20 million people each year moreover a number of potentially active californian volcanoes reside less than from highly populated areas and explosive eruptions could produce ash that travels for several hundred miles in case of signs that suggest impending volcanic activity united states geological survey has a plan in place to utilize portable monitoring instruments deploy scientists to area and implement an emergency response plan developed by national park service if an eruption were imminent although basaltic lava flows are most common eruptive activity in lassen volcanic center they could also produce more violent and thus more hazardous silicic lava flows in addition to building additional unstable lava domes that could collapse and spawn pyroclastic flows that could extend for several miles because lassen peak has a significant amount of snow and ice these pyroclastic flows or hot volcanic ash might mix with water to form lahars volcanically induced mudslides landslides and debris flows that could destroy nearby communities dacitic eruptions could produce volcanic columns of gas and ash that could threaten aircraft in area moreover lassen volcanic center poses threats to visitors from sudden avalanches that could be entirely unrelated to eruptive activity due to threat of an avalanche from nearby chaos crag if volcanic activity renewed in area or an earthquake occurred visitor center for lassen peak located at manzanita lake closed in 1974 in 1993 a rockfall with a volume of fell down lassen peak s northeastern flank but no visitors were harmed despite volcano s current quiet state rockfalls still pose significant hazards due to peak s inherent instability volcano is monitored by california volcano observatory which has a sensor network that can measure increased seismicity ground deformation or gas emissions suggesting movement of magma towards surface near volcano united states geological survey in cooperation with national park service has been monitoring lassen peak and other volcanic areas in park with tiltmeters seismometers and prior to 1996 geodetic surveys at lassen peak did not detect ground deformation but interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar surveys between 1996 and 2000 suggested that downward subsidence was occurring at a rate of each year within a circular area with a diameter of centered just of volcano as a result additional surveys using global positioning system took place in 2004 and further insar surveys showed that subsidence continued through 2010 lassen peak is one of four cascade volcanoes that has undergone subsidence since 1990 with medicine lake volcano mount baker and mount st helens though not conclusively linked to a possible eruption this subsidence may offer insight into how magma is stored within region tectonic setting and how hydrothermal systems evolve over long periods of time gps receivers have been in place to monitor deformation within lassen volcanic center since 2008 and 13 seismometers in vicinity first installed in 1976 and since updated each decade continually survey earthquakes within locale recreation thumb right snow covered summit of lassen peak lassen volcanic
