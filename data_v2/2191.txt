a 12 6 elbow referred to in commentary as a twelve to six elbow and officially downward elbow strikes is a strike used in combat sport of mixed martial arts mma name of 12 6 elbow is based on concept of a clock on wall with bringing of an elbow from straight up 12 o clock to straight down 6 o clock 12 6 elbow strikes are illegal under unified rules of mixed martial arts defined as striking downwards using point of elbow such bans were justified for medical and safety reasons due to possibility of serious injuries to opponents that could result from their use definition most commonly accepted definition of a 12 6 elbow was originally based on a principle by referee john mccarthy of a clock on wall this came about after it was felt that official definition of foul was too broad a 12 6 elbow was defined as bringing elbow from twelve o clock to six o clock which is where name comes from similar elbow movements from a fighter on their back does not count as a 12 6 elbow because as explained by mccarthy clock doesn t move mccarthy s definition became accepted as official definition of 12 6 elbows under unified rules and mma referees were encouraged to use this definition when making judgments on elbow strikes generally for usage of 12 6 elbows fight is stopped and fighters are given a warning however there have been occasions where points have been deducted or fighter using that strike in competition has been disqualified due to move incapacitating fighters in 2009 matt hamill defeated jon jones by disqualification due to jones using 12 6 elbows hamill said that he was unable to defend against elbows in mixed martial arts before 2000 mma had a number of different rule sets with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes 12 6 elbows in ufc 1 first ufc event where there were very few rules kevin used 12 6 elbows on zane frazier in 2000 unified rules of mixed martial arts were drawn up to try to make sport more mainstream meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major mma organisations including ultimate fighting championship ufc pride fighting championships and international fighting championships ifc as well as doctors and referees in new jersey united states in meeting doctors raised concerns about 12 6 elbows after seeing an ifc match where 12 6 elbows were used to back of a fighter s head one doctor argued that they could be life threatening and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn t prohibit them thumb right 150px a 12 6 elbow being used on bricks mccarthy argued that rules already prohibited strikes to back of head and questioned if it was just 12 6 elbow strike that was problem following this discussion nick lembo wrote unified rules including a rule prohibiting downward elbow strikes mccarthy felt that lembo wrote rule relating to downward elbow strikes poorly as he felt definition was broad and left rule open to interpretation pride eventually did not adopt unified rules however their ruleset prohibited any elbow strikes to head eventually rule on 12 6 elbows meant that very few fighters attempted them which could also be attributed to fact that it is difficult for fighters to get into a position where they could use them primary justification for banning 12 6 strikes was damage that could result from such a strike on orbital bone and potential for spinal injuries if 12 6 elbows were used in certain positions due to size differences between fighters this was before weight classes were standardised there was a popular story often repeated by joe rogan in ufc commentary that 12 6 elbows were banned because representatives of athletic commissions had seen traditional martial artists breaking hard objects with downward elbow strikes and felt that those strikes could be lethal and banned them however keith kizer of nevada state athletic commission dismissed this as being revisionist history in 2006 association of boxing commissions abc held a committee meeting to revise unified rules during it kizer and lembo proposed altering rule on downward elbow strikes to permit 12 6 elbows to anywhere except head of a downed opponent however proposal was strongly rejected by doctors on committee on grounds that 12 6 elbows could still cause serious injury even when not done on head abc despite endorsing unified rules does not have statutory authority over individual state athletic commissions in united states but instead governs through influence as a result in some states such as mississippi 12 6 elbows are permitted in mma fights as a result a commission was set up by abc to look at regional mma rule variations including 12 6 elbows to standardise mma in united states criticism 12 6 elbow has often been criticized for its brutality however rules prohibiting them have also been criticized in particular it has been argued that term downward elbow strikes is too strict as it only applies to straight motions and does not make elbows on an arc illegal matt hume chief referee of one fighting championship explained that while 12 6 elbows were illegal if you change time to 11 59 it is no longer illegal hume felt that authors of unified rules did not have an understanding of mma with mccarthy affirming that view by stating that lembo wasn t a big mma guy at time hume also argued that rule meant that other elbow strikes that could gain more velocity than 12 6 elbows were legal yet were hitting with same point of elbow because of initially broad definition of 12 6 elbows in unified rules referees often had differences in interpretation of what was classed as one referee herb dean differed from mccarthy s definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with floor in side control sometimes called 9 3 elbows were classed as 12 6 elbows as he considered 12 6 elbows as being based on where fighter throwing them was positioned see also soccer kick another controversial mma strike references category mixed martial
