be standing as a candidate for party leader she was subsequently joined by neil findlay and jim murphy katy clark and kezia dugdale entered deputy leadership race findlay was among those to call on former british prime minister gordon brown to enter contest but he ruled out doing so other senior labour figures who decided not to put their names forward included sarwar jackie baillie and jenny marra voting took place between 17 november and 10 december using three tier electoral college system which gives parliamentarians individual members and affiliated bodies such as trade unions an equal say in outcome during this time candidates toured scotland for a number of hustings meetings at which they set out their direction for party if elected policy options raised were centred on issues such as health education employment and prospect of further devolution to scotland three leadership candidates were from different wings of party murphy from labour right boyack from centre and findlay from left controversy ensued when unite trade union issued a mock ballot paper instructing members on which candidates to elect and when two prominent labour figures engaged in an argument about contest on social media on 13 december murphy was elected to lead party while dugdale was chosen to become his deputy in his victory speech murphy said that his election was a fresh start for scottish labour 2014 referendum had seen a 55 per cent vote in favour of keeping scotland in united kingdom however opinion polls in weeks following referendum suggested an increased support for snp at labour s expense while snp membership quadrupled after his election as its leader murphy led labour into 2015 uk general election which saw party s worst ever election result in scotland and a landslide victory for snp labour lost all but one of its 41 scottish westminster seats including murphy s own east renfrewshire constituency while snp won 56 of 59 seats in scotland although murphy subsequently said that he wished to remain as scottish labour leader poor result prompted senior party figures and trade unionists to question viability of his future in post after narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence on 16 may murphy announced his intention to relinquish role triggering a fresh leadership contest dugdale was elected to succeed murphy on 15 august background johann lamont was elected to lead scottish labour in 2011 thumb right lamont was elected to lead scottish labour party in december 2011 following resignation of iain gray who stepped down in wake of party s second consecutive defeat by alex salmond s scottish national party in 2011 scottish parliament election she was first leader to take charge of entire scottish labour party previous leaders having only had responsibility for labour s msps at holyrood and she initiated a review of labour policy on issues such as devolution and party s commitment to free universal public services euan mccolm wrote that although lamont was given greater autonomy over labour in scotland her westminster colleagues restrained her attempts to develop a devolution policy and her debate on universal benefits resulted in snp portraying her as a politician dedicated to seizing from people that which was rightfully theirs her leadership was further harmed by a controversy over 2013 falkirk candidate selection in which trade union unite allegedly tried to engineer selection process in falkirk constituency an investigation into matter was led from london rather than edinburgh lamont also led party through 2014 referendum on scottish independence during which labour joined conservatives and liberal democrats in better together campaign an alliance of parties that campaigned for a no vote lamont herself had a relatively low profile during period prior to poll while labour s association with conservatives was viewed as a betrayal among its traditional supporters referendum was held on 18 september 2014 and saw a turnout of 3 619 915 or 85 per cent of those eligible to vote scotland rejected independence with a 55 per cent vote in favour of staying part of united kingdom salmond announced his resignation as snp leader and first minister day after referendum in subsequent leadership election snp selected nicola sturgeon as its leader also on 19 september uk prime minister david cameron established smith commission to look at prospect of devolving further powers to scotland chaired by lord smith of kelvin cross party commission published its findings on 27 november among its recommendations were proposals to give scottish parliament responsibility for some welfare payments and for setting income tax levels although it had previously been opposed to giving holyrood greater tax powers amid concerns it could diminish role of scottish mps at westminster and lead to independence by back door labour confirmed its intention to support income tax devolution shortly before details of commission s report were made public although scotland had voted to remain part of uk independence referendum had returned yes votes in some traditional labour strongholds particularly glasgow and north lanarkshire prompting media speculation about lamont s future as party s leader shortly after referendum a daily mail article claimed that shadow international development secretary jim murphy was being lined up to take over party leadership herald reported that party delegates concerned about referendum results had started to view murphy as a possible successor lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at 25 september 2014 session of first minister s questions first of post referendum era when first minister is long gone i will still be doing my job on behalf of people of scotland her position remained uncertain daily telegraphs alan cochrane wrote that many labour mps in scotland feared losing their seats in 2015 uk general election without a change of leadership in weeks following referendum snp membership increased fourfold reaching more than 100 000 by mid december labour s membership over same period was less clear paul hutcheon noted in 9 november edition of sunday herald that labour had consistently declined to confirm number of its members in scotland but quoted an informed source suggesting figure was slightly short of 13 500 however peter jones of scotsman subsequently quoted a less favourable figure of fewer than 10 000 with most of existing constituency membership comprising relatives and friends of councillors msps mps who would not welcome an influx of new members who might try to oust second rate post holders in favour of somebody new and better in october two former first ministers voiced their concern about direction of party jack mcconnell expressed fears that labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining confidence of scottish voters following election of nicola sturgeon as snp leader and described labour as a political machine that is angry about what has happened in scotland in recent past shortly afterwards his predecessor henry mcleish suggested labour had ceded enormous ground to snp unnecessarily because its supporters no longer understood what party stands for margaret curran shadow secretary of state for scotland said that although party was changing it needed to reconnect with its socialist principles lamont s deputy anas sarwar later suggested that during referendum campaign labour had stopped being a movement for change and fell into a trap of being defenders of past and defenders of establishment new statesman claimed that labour had spent decades treating scotland as little more than a one party state and needed to make itself relevant again for people whom it was established to represent stephen daisley political editor of stv news suggested that labour had responded to nationalist advance by electing a succession of decent but ineffectual holyrood leaders who were dominated by westminster party machine resignations thumb right anas sarwar seen here in 2011 became acting leader following lamont s resignation lamont announced her resignation in an interview with daily record on 24 october 2014 saying that it was her intention to step down immediately she told newspaper that she was resigning because labour s westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform party in scotland and had treated scottish labour like a branch office of london in her letter of resignation submitted to scottish labour party chairman jamie lamont accused senior members of party of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself out of equation to allow scottish labour to have a discussion about best way forward anas sarwar became labour s acting leader on 26 october following a meeting of party s executive committee he outlined details of leadership election it was confirmed next day that jackie baillie would represent labour in scottish parliament at following session of first minister s questions on 30 october an ipsos mori poll conducted for stv indicated that snp had much greater support among scottish voters than labour putting snp at 52 per cent compared to 23 per cent for labour on same day a yougov poll conducted for times gave two parties 43 and 27 per cent respectively bbc s mark later noted that a total of four polls in october and november gave snp an average 20 percentage point lead over labour which he suggested could allow snp to win as many as 30 westminster seats from labour in next election also on 30 october anas sarwar announced his resignation as deputy leader at a scottish labour fundraising dinner in glasgow triggering a deputy leadership election sarwar said that he disagreed with lamont s assessment of uk labour and that he was stepping down because he felt that it was right that we have a concurrent leadership and deputy leadership election this will allow a scottish labour party its members and affiliates opportunity to not only elect a leader but a new leadership team focused on winning in 2016 election details anas sarwar announced details of timetable for contest on 26 october 2014 following a meeting of scottish labour s executive committee potential candidates would be invited to declare their interest from following day with nominations open from 31 october to
