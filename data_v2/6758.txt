independent nation to coming under political control of united states and events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented most historical sources for life of irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to east coast and california and on conflicts in arizona territory some mohave versions of events also exist in early 20th century anthropologist a l kroeber interviewed jo nelson mohave chooksa homar a mohave man who participated in many of events and knew irataba personally another version was told to ethnographer george devereux by irataba s granddaughter tcatc and versions recounted by members of fort mohave band of mohave descendants of homoseh

carpenter henry grinnell releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads olive was released to henry grinnell olive and mary ann taken captive irataba may have learned about anglo americans and their society from oatman and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards whites whipple expedition on february 23 1854 irataba cairook and other mohave people encountered an expedition led by military officers amiel whipple and j c ives as group approached colorado en route to california whipple and his men counted six hundred mohave gathered

again accompanied expedition and was impressed with mohave guides later noting irataba s enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language he also noted that irataba and mohave readily began wearing european clothes given to them by members of expedition and showed great interest in smoking tobacco aside from friendship shown to him by irataba and cairook ives noted that mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions a change that he attributed to their contact with mormons who were in conflict with us and had succeeded in converting some mohave irataba guided party into mohave canyon indicating location of rapids and advising explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for night when they reached entrance to black canyon of colorado ship crashed against a submerged rock throwing several men overboard dislodging boiler and damaging wheelhouse using their skiff crew towed explorer to shore where they camped for three days while repairing vessel expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by mohave during previous weeks as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about arrival of a resupply pack train from fort yuma irataba volunteered to hike towards mohave valley to try to locate supplies that had been requested several days earlier he also warned that expedition was being watched by paiutes when irataba returned he informed ives that he would not venture any deeper into territory of but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in region before parting company irataba was reluctant to venture into canyon because he feared party would be ambushed by paiutes aligned with mormons after enlisting three hualapai guides irataba prepared to take his leave from expedition and return to mohave community on april 4 mohave received payment for their services mollhausen described exchange lieutenant ives informed irataba that he had been authorized by great grandfather in washington to give him two mules for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley next morning as they were preparing to leave irataba was visibly moved and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature i maintain that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with a harmless soul leave mohave war and aftermath following their experiences with sitgreaves and whipple expeditions and encounters with mormons and soldiers at fort yuma mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to region in increasing numbers it was difficult for mohave to predict behavior of arriving whites some of whom like whipple were amiably disposed towards them whereas others such as mormons were hostile kwanami were divided on how situation should be approached some advocated an aggressive posture denying whites all passage through their territory but others including irataba preferred a peaceful approach or even an alliance with them that could put mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies paiute chemehuevi and walapai on september 1 1857 a joint force of mohave and quechan warriors launched a major attack with hundreds of warriors on a maricopa village close to maricopa wells arizona on gila river battle of pima butte was described by a group of white mail carriers who witnessed it they stated that battle was fought mostly with clubs as well as bows and arrows and that probably more than 100 warriors died most of them from attacking party it is unknown whether irataba participated in attack but given his status as kwanami it is likely that he did battle has been described as last major battle involving only native american nations this defeat put mohave on defensive wary of possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands rose baley party attack in october 1857 an expedition led by edward fitzgerald beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along 35th parallel from fort smith arkansas to los angeles california from fort smith his journey continued through fort defiance arizona before crossing colorado near needles california this route became known as beale s wagon road and location where beale crossed river as beale s crossing beale s journal and subsequent report to united states secretary of war did not mention any problems with irataba and mohave but an assistant named humphrey stacy recorded that mohave had prevented beale from traveling downriver in 1858 rose baley party comprising at least a hundred settlers with wagons and a large herd of cattle was first emigrant train to venture onto beale s wagon road upon entering mohave territory settlers started cutting down cottonwood trees which were an important resource for mohave most warlike of organized an attack on party and drove away and slaughtered many of party s cattle on august 30 three hundred mohave warriors attacked emigrants but were repelled with one member of party killed in battle and eleven wounded another family who were not with main party during attack were killed in an event that has often been blamed on mohave but which in colonel william hoffman s opinion was more likely carried out by a band of walapai along with seven renegade mohave emigrants killed seventeen mohave warriors emigrant train and attack seventeen mohave warriors incident was widely publicized in media and labeled a massacre scaring many white californians who feared being cut off from eastern us by hostile natives and it motivated war department to quickly subjugate tribe irataba was away at fort yuma during attack on settlers and upon hearing of it he scolded mohave chooksa homar participated in events and reported that irataba told warriors i hear you fought though i told you not to and you will have war again i know it you used to fight maricopa i want to go to phoenix to see maricopa and tell them mohave will not come any more to attack you irataba weary of constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from us soldiers organized a peace expedition to maricopa settling ancient disputes between two

dragoons from fort tejon were dispatched to cross desert and confront mohave irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting but hoffman ordered his troops to fire on warriors who counterattacked and repelled force irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting mohave attacked and repelled force he returned in april 1859 by way of fort yuma with four companies of 6th infantry regiment when they arrived at beale s crossing mohave decided against attacking army of five hundred soldiers on april 23 at hoffman s request he and his officers met with several hundred mohave warriors and their leaders indigenous leaders included cairook irataba homoseh quahote also called seck a hoot and hota and pascual leader of quechan homoseh quahote attended meeting irataba and cairook during meeting mohave were surrounded by armed soldiers who prevented them from leaving hoffman gave mohave a choice between war and peace and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white settlers along wagon trail he also declared that as punishment mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in attack hoffman demanded that chief who had ordered attack on settlers offer himself up as a hostage according to chooksa homar chief who had ordered attack was homoseh quahote who was reluctant to give himself up cairook offered himself in his place along with eight others including tokwatha irataba s son tekse thume and irataba s nephews qolho qorau and aspamekelyeho other hostages were named and they were transported in river steamer general jessup to fort yuma many soldiers remained to begin construction on beale s crossing fort which was named fort mohave soldiers remained to build a fort fort was initially called fort colorado although irataba visited garrison several times and argued for their release hostages were held for more than a year on june 21 1859 cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration most of other mohave captives escaped in july 1861 commander of fort mohave major lewis armistead ordered soldiers to fire into a group of mohave who he suspected of having attacked a mail carrier and slaughtered his mule mohave did not respond violently to attack but armistead decided to punish them for harassing mail party he arrived at irataba s ranch where a group of mohave boys were planting beans and from a hidden position he shot one of planters killing him this attack prompted an assault on armistead s detachment who from an advantageous position on high ground were able to repel mohave killing many of them in a battle that lasted most of day armistead s report of assault of irataba s ranch reported 23 dead mohave warriors but mohave remember a much higher number of casualties including women and children killed by soldiers sherer speculated that given that 50 soldiers fired around 10 shots each casualty count could have been much higher than reported attack on irataba s ranch is remembered by mohave as first and last battle with federal troops as aha macave yaltanack thumb left upright alt a wood block depiction of a man

understanding people and position of head of mohave was traditionally inherited only by someone from that clan because irataba was of huttoh pah in order for him to become leader of mohave nation homoseh quahote had to step down so irataba as an elected leader could take his place despite accepted english translations words yaltanack and do not mean a ruler or boss devereux describes mohave government as one of least understood segments of mohave culture and notes that while white officials tended to act on assumption that indian chiefs exercised absolute authority as an elected leader irataba was primarily a servant of tribe by mid 1860s a deep rift had developed between irataba who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers and homoseh quahote who passively tolerated but did not approve of white encroachment on mohave lands irataba was aha macave yaltanack of mohave from 1861 to 1866 but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ and by 1870 us government correspondence suggests that homoseh quahote had succeeded him as leader of fort mohave group mining ventures probably first to bring national attention to potential gold in region was f x aubry who in 1853 reported finding gold at a crossing of colorado and that he traded for legendary gold bullets further east with tonto apache newspapers across country copied gold strike story over next decade mining discoveries up

concern for protecting incoming miners brought together tribal leaders to ft yuma in april 1863 including irataba where they pledged to allow prospectors into their country on his return home mohave joined a prospecting party led by mountain man joseph r walker who had prospected among them on river in 1860 in 1863 irataba acted as a guide for walker party gold prospectors led by walker and including jack swilling who later founded phoenix arizona irataba brought them to a river that he called later named hassayampa river where they found plentiful gold central arizona s first mining district was established there following year which led to founding of prescott arizona soon afterward relations between settlers and mohave were positive during this period but as emigration increased gold seekers founded towns largest on river being named la paz stirring fear among settlers of a native uprising against further encroachment on mohave land following year a group of soldiers from fort mohave discovered an area between needles fort mohave and colorado river that was abundant in copper ore parcel was named irataba mining district and within year a mining company had been formed to work it a small mining town named irataba city was established on a bluff two miles below fort mohave high copper market prices during civil war brought into operation bill williams

formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between mohave and us government following military campaigns and establishment of fort mohave poston promoted idea of establishing a reservation in southern portion of mohave country many mohave opposed proposed location and instead argued for a smaller parcel further north in mohave valley which had more fertile land with irataba and an engineer poston traveled down colorado river to survey a location in august 1864 post commander at fort mohave captain charles atchisson stated that irataba was against proposed location in september 1864 poston gave impression that irataba was in favor of it in a letter to general richard c drum atchisson reported that irataba and four mohave leaders were unhappy with how poston was

installing an irrigation system at colorado that would make most of reservation arable this apparently convinced irataba who traveled to colorado river valley with about 800 people almost a fifth of entire mohave nation relocating to colorado river valley a fifth of entire mohave nation 800 mohave general james henry carleton thought a reservation was unnecessary and engineer herman ehrenberg disagreed with poston s proposed location on basis that soil was too alkaline for farming need for irrigation too great and task of raising river too insurmountable nonetheless on march 3 1865 congress established colorado river indian reservation at poston s proposed location soil was too alkaline ehrenberg s concerns proved valid and neither poston nor any subsequent us authority was willing to dedicate considerable resources required to make location suitable for farming reservation was established without a treaty having been established between mohave and us government boundaries were expanded and clarified by executive orders issued by president grant in 1873 1874 and 1867 most of mohave refused to leave their ancestral homelands for reservation but irataba s conviction that reservation was their best option marked beginning of a rift between his group and those who stayed behind to follow homoseh quahote nation s hereditary leader according to an eyewitness account by chooksa homar irataba explained his decision to move as promised irrigation assistance was not immediately forthcoming first year at reservation brought a drought that made it necessary for mohave to request food assistance in 1867 irataba and mohave began to build an irrigation canal digging by hand a ditch that ran for a report by a us official visiting reservation in

and into california desert but they soon returned to avoid fighting a two front war irataba attacked chemehuevi first then turned his attention to paiutes who were planning an attack on mohave farm and granary on colorado s cottonwood island during a subsequent battle with chemehuevi in october 1865 irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general s uniform according to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from soldiers stationed at fort mohave so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten in mohave account of events as told by chooksa homar irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with chemehuevi and offered his uniform to their chief as a gesture of peace in 1867 a treaty signed by irataba and chemehuevi leader pan coyer restored peaceful relations between two nations irataba also welcomed bands of yavapai onto reservation after they had been subject to massacres by us troops or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands meager resources of reservation proved unable to sustain additional population and eventually yavapai had to leave irataba frequently served as a mediator between yavapai and walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with us army and participated in peace parlays in 1871 72 general george crook came to mohave reservation looking for a group of yavapai thought to be responsible for wickenburg massacre and irataba had no choice but to turn war party over to army he traveled to trial proceedings at fort date creek where he was instructed to hand tobacco to yavapai he believed to be responsible as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it as soldiers attempted to arrest men that irataba identified fighting broke out and one of yavapai leaders ohatchecama and his brother were shot despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize tolkepaya yavapai in resistance against us army yavapai felt betrayed by irataba and plotted to kill him in revenge but were eventually persuaded that he was not one who had turned them over to crook colorado river band of mohave never replaced irataba he was their leader when he died at their reservation on may 3 or 4 1874 his cause of death is

heroic figure to others he was a white collaborator who did not stand up for mojave rights from standpoint of white men who were conquering a wilderness he was indeed mojave who worked unswervingly for peace irataba s influence as a leader may even have left its mark on mohave language a list of mohave words that he dictated to an anthropologist during his visit in washington shows that he was among first mohave speakers to shift sounds s and similar to sh as in shack to th as in thick and s respectively by late 19th century all mohave speakers had adopted this change linguist leanne hinton has suggested that this may be due in part to irataba s influence both because he was a prestigious leader whose ways of speaking may have been emulated by other mohave and also because when he led mohave onto reservation old distinctions between dialect groups were erased through dialect leveling making new changes spread quickly through community irataba society a non profit charity run by
