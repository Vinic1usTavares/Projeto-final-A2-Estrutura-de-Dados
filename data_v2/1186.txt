catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around world architectural program at university of pennsylvania stood out to him wiseman p 34 other major factor was hollywood pei was fascinated by representations of college life in films of bing crosby which differed tremendously from academic atmosphere in china college life in u s seemed to me to be mostly fun and games he said in 2000 since i was too young to be serious i wanted to be part of it you could get a feeling for it in bing crosby s movies college life in america seemed very exciting to me it s not real we know that

modern architecture and also felt intimidated by high level of drafting proficiency shown by other students he decided to abandon architecture and transferred to engineering program at massachusetts institute of technology mit once he arrived however dean of architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced pei to return to his original major wiseman p 35 mit s architecture faculty was also focused on beaux arts school and pei found himself uninspired by work in library he found three books by swiss french architect le corbusier pei was inspired by innovative designs of

used to call him were probably most important days in my architectural education boehm p 36 pei was also influenced by work of u s architect frank lloyd wright in 1938 he drove to spring green

month later pei suspended his work at harvard to join national defense research committee which coordinated scientific research into u s weapons technology during world war ii pei s background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset one member of committee told him if you know how to build you should also know how to destroy quoted in von boehm p 42 a slightly different wording appears in wiseman p 39 if you know how to build a building you know how to destroy it fight against germany was ending so he focused on pacific war u s realized that its bombs used against stone

that had advanced cause of modernist design nazi regime had condemned bauhaus school and its leaders left germany two of these walter gropius and marcel breuer took positions at harvard gsd their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to pei and he worked closely with both men wiseman pp 41 43 boehm pp 37 40 one of pei s design projects at gsd was a plan for an art museum in shanghai he wanted to create a mood of chinese authenticity in architecture without using traditional materials or styles quoted in wiseman p 44 design was based on straight modernist structures

loud speech and gruff demeanor nevertheless they became good friends and pei found experience personally enriching zeckendorf was well connected politically and pei enjoyed learning about social world of new york s city planners wiseman pp 48 49 his first project for webb and knapp was an apartment building with funding from housing act of 1949 pei s design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings areas closest to supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation apartments themselves were located toward outer edge zeckendorf loved design and even showed it off to le corbusier when they met cost of such an unusual design was too high however and building never moved beyond model stage wiseman p 51 thumb left pei s first project 1949 131 ponce de leon avenue atlanta pei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949 when he designed a two story corporate building for gulf oil in atlanta georgia building was demolished in february 2013 although front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development his use of marble for exterior curtain wall brought praise from journal architectural forum wiseman p 52 pei s designs echoed work of mies van der rohe in beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend house in katonah new york in 1952 soon pei was so inundated with projects that he asked zeckendorf for assistants which he chose from his associates at gsd including henry n cobb and ulrich franzen they set to work on a variety of proposals including roosevelt field shopping mall team also redesigned webb and knapp office building transforming zeckendorf s office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory they also installed a control panel into desk that allowed their boss to control lighting in his

building into less than 25 percent of total site rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain dotted plazas wiseman pp 57 58 one block away pei s team also redesigned denver s courthouse square which combined office spaces commercial venues and hotels these projects helped pei conceptualize architecture as part of larger urban geography i learned process of development he said later and about city as a living organism boehm p 52 these lessons he said became essential for later projects pei and his team also designed a united urban area for washington d c called l enfant plaza named for french american architect pierre charles l enfant williams 2005 p 120 moeller and weeks 2006 p 59 pei s associate was lead architect for plaza s north building 955 l enfant plaza sw and

states postal service headquarters team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both washington post and washington star which rarely agreed on anything but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale wiseman pp 60 62 in 1955 pei s group took a step toward institutional independence from webb and knapp by establishing a new firm called i m pei associates name changed later to i m pei partners they gained freedom to work with other companies but continued working primarily with zeckendorf new firm distinguished itself through use of detailed architectural models they took on kips bay residential area on east side of manhattan where pei set up kips bay towers two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows to provide shade and privacy in a neat grid adorned with rows of trees pei involved himself in construction process at kips bay even inspecting bags of concrete to check for consistency of color wiseman pp 62 64 company continued its urban focus with society hill project in central philadelphia pei designed society hill towers a three building residential block injecting cubist design into 18th century milieu of neighborhood as with previous projects abundant green spaces were central to pei s vision which also added traditional townhouses to aid transition from classical to modern design boehm p 51 from 1958 to 1963 pei and ray affleck developed a key downtown block of montreal in a phased process that involved one of pei s most admired structures in commonwealth cruciform tower known as royal bank plaza place ville

1960s tower s smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate pei s adherence to mainstream of 20th century modern design canadian encyclopedia online version although these projects were satisfying pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself in 1959 he was approached by mit to design a building for its earth science program green building continued grid

shanghai broke severely from cubist grid patterns of his urban projects wiseman p 67 wiseman pp 66 68 challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on pei he found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising plans for them as a result he felt disconnected from actual creative work design is something you have to put your hand to he said while my people had luxury of doing one job at a time i had to keep track of whole enterprise quoted in wiseman p 69 pei s dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing zeckendorf

were sad to part ways wiseman pp 69 71 ncar and related projects thumb left alt a series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain pei said he wanted mesa laboratory of national center

laboratory for national center for atmospheric research outside boulder colorado project differed from pei s earlier urban work it would rest in an open area in foothills of rocky mountains he drove with his wife around region visiting assorted buildings and surveying natural environs he was impressed by united states air force academy in colorado springs but felt it was detached from nature boehm p 59 conceptualization stages were important for pei presenting a need and an opportunity to break from bauhaus tradition he later recalled long periods of time he spent in area i recalled places i had seen with my mother when i was a little boy mountaintop buddhist retreats there in colorado mountains i tried to listen to silence again just as my mother had taught me investigation of place became a kind of religious experience for me pei also drew inspiration from mesa verde cliff dwellings of ancestral puebloans he wanted buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings wiseman pp 75 76 to this end he called for a rock treatment process that could color buildings to match nearby mountains he also set complex back on mesa overlooking city and designed approaching road to be long winding and indirect wiseman p 80 roberts disliked pei s initial designs referring to them as just a bunch of towers quoted in wiseman p 79 roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation rather than artistic critique still pei was frustrated his second attempt however fit roberts vision perfectly a spaced out series of clustered buildings joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels complex uses many elements of cubist design and walkways are arranged to increase probability of casual encounters among colleagues

harmony when designing dormitories at new college of florida in mid 1960s wiseman p 94 once laboratory was built several problems with its construction became apparent leaks in roof caused difficulties for researchers and shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in buildings which were expensive to repair still both architect and project manager were pleased with final result pei referred to ncar complex as his breakout building and he remained a friend of roberts until scientist died in wiseman pp 91 and 74 success of ncar brought renewed attention to pei s design acumen he was recruited to work on a variety of projects including s i newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university everson museum of art in syracuse new york terminal at john f kennedy

make final decision group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects wiseman pp 96 98 eventually kennedy chose pei to design library based on two considerations first she appreciated variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects he didn t seem to have just one way to solve a problem she said he seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful quoted in wiseman p 98 ultimately however kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with pei calling it really an emotional decision she explained he was so full of promise like jack they were born in same year i decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him quoted in wiseman p 99 project was plagued with problems from outset first was scope president kennedy had begun considering structure of his library soon after taking office and he wanted to include archives from his administration a museum of personal items and a political science institute after assassination list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to slain president variety of necessary inclusions complicated design process and caused significant delays wiseman pp 95 and 100 pei s first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill interior with sunlight meant to represent optimism and hope that kennedy s administration had symbolized for so many in united states mrs kennedy liked design but resistance began in cambridge first proposed site for building as soon as project was announced many community members worried that library would become a tourist attraction causing particular problems with traffic congestion others worried that design would clash with architectural feel of nearby harvard square by mid 70s pei tried proposing a new design but library s opponents resisted every effort wiseman pp 102 113 these events pained pei who had sent all three of his sons to harvard and although he rarely discussed his frustration it was evident to his wife i could tell how tired he was by way he opened door at end of day she said his footsteps were dragging it was very hard for i m to see that so many people didn t want building

triangular tower and a circular walkway wiseman pp 115 116 john f kennedy presidential library and museum was dedicated on 20 october 1979 critics generally liked finished building but architect himself was unsatisfied years of conflict and compromise had changed nature of design and pei felt that final result lacked its original passion i wanted to give something very special to memory of president kennedy he said in 2000 it could and should have been a great project pei s work on kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note wiseman p 119 pei plan in oklahoma city pei

william pedersen and yann weymouth their first obstacle was unusual shape of building site a trapezoid of land at intersection of constitution and pennsylvania avenues inspiration struck pei in 1968 when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper larger building would be public gallery smaller would house offices and archives this triangular shape became a singular vision

and build a new one as usual he approached project by carefully considering context and purpose likewise he considered modernist styles inappropriate for setting thus he said it was necessary to find a third way quoted in wiseman p 192 wiseman pp 189 92 after visiting his ancestral home in suzhou pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential chinese buildings among these were abundant gardens integration with nature and consideration of relationship between enclosure and opening pei s design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like large central space in his east building of national gallery openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view natural scenery beyond younger chinese who had hoped building would exhibit some of cubist flavor for which pei had become known were disappointed but new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects wiseman pp 192 193 hotel with 325 guest rooms and a four story central atrium was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat trees in area were of special concern and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible he worked with an expert from suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from original hotel one of only five in country pei was also meticulous about arrangement of items in garden behind hotel he even insisted on transporting of rocks from a location in southwest china to suit natural aesthetic an associate of pei s said later that he never saw architect so involved in a project wiseman pp 201 203 during construction a series of mistakes collided with nation s lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders whereas 200 or so workers might have been used for a similar building in us fragrant hill project employed over 3 000 workers this was mostly because construction company lacked sophisticated machines used in other parts of world problems continued for months until pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with chinese officials he later explained that his actions included shouting and pounding table in frustration quoted in wiseman p 205 design staff noticed a difference in manner of work among crew after meeting as opening neared however pei found hotel still needed work he began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors project s difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on pei family wiseman pp 204 205 fragrant hill hotel opened on 17 october 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair a member of pei s staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed dilapidated condition of hotel he and pei attributed this to country s general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings quoted in wiseman p 206 chinese architectural community at time gave structure little attention as their interest at time centered on work of american postmodernists such as michael graves wiseman pp 206 207 javits convention center new york thumb alt a building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street corners of building are smoothed at 45 degree angles pei said of jacob k javits convention center complications exceeded even my expectations quoted in wiseman p 211 as fragrant hill project neared completion pei began work on jacob k javits convention center in new york city for which his associate james freed served as lead designer hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run down neighborhood on manhattan s west side freed developed a glass coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres wiseman pp 211 216 convention center was plagued from start by budget problems and construction blunders city regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over project so architects and program manager richard kahan had to coordinate wide array of builders plumbers electricians and other workers forged steel globes to be used in space frame came to site with hairline cracks and other defects 12 000 were rejected these and other problems led to media comparisons with disastrous hancock tower one new york city official blamed kahan for difficulties indicating that building s architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises wiseman pp 222 224 javits center opened on 3 april 1986 to a generally positive reception during inauguration ceremonies however neither freed nor pei was recognized for their role in project le grand louvre paris thumb right alt a classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd rounded archways line front of structure pei was acutely aware as he said that history of paris was embedded in stones of louvre boehm p 84 when francois mitterrand was elected president of france in 1981 he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects one of these was renovation of louvre museum mitterrand appointed a civil servant named emile biasini to oversee it after visiting museums in europe and united states including u s national gallery he asked pei to join team architect made three secretive trips to paris to determine feasibility of project only one museum employee knew why he was there wiseman p 233 boehm p 77 pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible but necessary for future of museum he thus became first foreign architect to work on louvre wiseman p 234 heart of new design included not only a renovation of cour napoleon in midst of buildings but also a transformation of interiors pei proposed a central entrance not unlike lobby of national gallery east building which would link three major buildings below would be a complex of additional floors for research storage and maintenance purposes at center of courtyard he designed a glass and steel pyramid first proposed with kennedy library to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight it was mirrored by another inverted pyramid underneath to reflect sunlight into room these designs were partly an homage to fastidious geometry of famous french landscape architect andre le notre 1613 1700 wiseman pp 235 236 pei also found pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency and considered it most compatible with architecture of louvre especially with faceted planes of its roofs biasini and mitterrand liked plans but scope of renovation displeased louvre director andre he resigned from his post complaining that project was unfeasible and posed architectural risks quoted in wiseman p 240 public also reacted harshly to design mostly because of proposed pyramid wiseman pp 249 250 one critic called it a gigantic ruinous gadget quoted in wiseman p 249 another charged mitterrand with despotism for inflicting paris with atrocity pei estimated that 90 percent of parisians opposed his design i received many angry glances in streets of paris he said boehm p 80 some condemnations carried nationalistic overtones one opponent wrote i am surprised that one would go looking for a chinese architect in america to deal with historic heart of capital of france quoted in wiseman p 250 thumb left alt a grey pyramid sits in center of a courtyard surrounded by ancient buildings pei decided that a pyramid was most compatible with other structures at louvre complementing their roofs faceted planes soon however pei and his team won support of several key cultural icons including conductor pierre boulez and claude pompidou widow of former french president georges pompidou after whom another controversial museum was named in an attempt to soothe public ire pei took a suggestion from then mayor of paris jacques chirac and placed a full sized cable model of pyramid in courtyard during four days of its exhibition an estimated 60 000 people visited site some critics eased their opposition after witnessing proposed scale of pyramid wiseman pp 251 252 to minimize impact of structure pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes pyramid was constructed at same time as subterranean levels below which caused difficulties during building stages as they worked construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25 000 historical items these were incorporated into rest of structure to add a new exhibition zone wiseman p 257 new louvre courtyard was opened to public on 14 october 1988 and pyramid entrance was opened following march by this time public opinion had softened on new installation a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for pyramid with 23 percent still opposed newspaper le figaro had vehemently criticized pei s design but later celebrated tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at pyramid wiseman pp 255 259 prince charles of britain surveyed new site with curiosity and declared it marvelous very exciting quoted in wiseman p 259 a writer in le de paris wrote much feared pyramid has become adorable experience was exhausting for pei but also rewarding after louvre he said later i thought no project would be too difficult boehm p 90 pyramid achieved further international recognition for its central role in plot at denouement of da vinci code by dan brown and its appearance in final scene of subsequent screen adaptation louvre pyramid has become pei s most famous structure meyerson symphony center dallas opening of louvre pyramid coincided with four other projects on which pei had been working prompting architecture critic paul goldberger to declare 1989 year of pei in new york times it was also year in which pei s firm changed its name to pei cobb freed partners to reflect increasing stature and prominence of his associates at age of 72 pei had begun thinking about retirement but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light wiseman pp 263 264 thumb right alt a beige cube rises at an angle around a half cone made of glass and steel in front a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard although he usually designed entirely by hand pei used a computer to confirm spaces for morton h meyerson symphony center in dallas wiseman p 272 one of projects took pei back to dallas texas to design morton h meyerson symphony center success of city s performing artists particularly dallas symphony orchestra then led by conductor eduardo mata led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival best halls in europe organizing committee contacted 45 architects but at first pei did not respond thinking that his work on dallas city hall had left a negative impression one of his colleagues from that project however insisted that he meet with committee he did and although it would be his first concert hall committee voted unanimously to offer him commission as one member put it we were convinced that we would get world s greatest architect putting his best foot forward quoted in wiseman p 267 project presented a variety of specific challenges because its main purpose was presentation of live music hall needed a design focused on acoustics first then public access and exterior aesthetics to this end a professional sound technician was hired to design interior he proposed a shoebox auditorium used in acclaimed designs of top european symphony halls such as amsterdam concertgebouw and vienna musikverein pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from designs of german architect johann balthasar neumann especially basilica of fourteen holy helpers he also sought to incorporate some of panache of paris opera designed by charles garnier wiseman pp 269 270 pei s design placed rigid shoebox at an angle to surrounding street grid connected at north end to a long rectangular office building and cut through middle with an assortment of circles and cones design attempted to reproduce with modern features acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree project was risky its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after hall s completion pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together i can imagine only 60 percent of space in this building he said during early stages rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else quoted in wiseman p 272 as project developed costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support billionaire tycoon ross perot made a donation of us 10 million on condition that it be named in honor of morton h meyerson longtime patron of arts in dallas wiseman pp 273 274 building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise especially for its acoustics after attending a week of performances in hall a music critic for new york times wrote an enthusiastic account of experience and congratulated architects one of pei s associates told him during a party before opening that symphony hall was a very mature building he smiled and replied ah but did i have to wait this long quoted in wiseman p 286 bank of china hong kong a new offer had arrived for pei from chinese government in 1982 with an eye toward transfer of sovereignty of hong kong from british in 1997 authorities in china sought pei s aid on a new tower for local branch of bank of china chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength given elder pei s history with bank before communist takeover government officials visited 89 year old man in new york to gain approval for his son s involvement pei then spoke with his father at length about proposal although architect remained pained by his experience with fragrant hills he agreed to accept commission wiseman pp 286 287 proposed site in hong kong s central district was less than ideal a tangle of highways lined it on three sides area had also been home to a headquarters for japanese military police during world war ii and was notorious for prisoner torture small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary and pei had usually shied away from such projects in hong kong especially skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach building pei took a weekend vacation to family home in katonah new york there he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence wiseman pp 287 288 pei felt that his design for bank of china tower needed to reflect aspirations of chinese people quoted in wiseman p 288 design that he developed for skyscraper was not only unique in appearance but also sound enough to pass city s rigorous standards for wind resistance building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base supported by a visible truss structure that distributes stress to four corners of base using reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him pei organized facade around diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates triangle motif established in plan at top he designed roofs at sloping angles to match rising aesthetic of building some influential advocates of feng shui in hong kong and china criticized design and pei and government officials responded with token adjustments wiseman pp 289 291 as tower neared completion pei was shocked to witness government s massacre of unarmed civilians at tiananmen square protests of 1989 he wrote an opinion piece for new york times titled china won t ever be same in which he said that killings tore heart out of a generation that carries hope for future of country quoted in wiseman p 294 massacre deeply disturbed his entire family and he wrote that china is besmirched 1990 2019 museum projects thumb right alt a grey tiled building rises over a lake with a cylinder set on a narrow pole and a sloping glass wall on one end one staff member sympathized with pei s frustrations with lack of organization at rock and roll hall of fame admitting that he was operating in a vacuum as 1990s began pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm staff had begun to shrink and pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity before he made this change however he set to work on his last major project as active partner rock and roll hall of fame in cleveland ohio considering his work on such bastions of high culture as louvre and u s national gallery some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture sponsors of hall however sought pei for specifically this reason they wanted building to have an aura of respectability from beginning as in past pei accepted commission in part because of unique challenge it presented wiseman pp 303 306 using a glass wall for entrance similar in appearance to his louvre pyramid pei coated exterior of main building in white metal and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space combination of off centered wraparounds and angled walls was pei said designed to provide a sense of tumultuous youthful energy rebelling flailing about quoted in wiseman p 306 building opened in 1995 and was received with moderate praise new york times called it a fine building but pei was among those who felt disappointed with results museum s early beginnings in new york combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed quoted in wiseman p 307 although city of cleveland benefited greatly from new tourist attraction pei was unhappy with it at same time pei designed a new museum for luxembourg musee d art moderne grand duc jean commonly known as mudam drawing from original shape of fort walls where museum was located pei planned to remove a portion of original foundation public resistance to historical loss forced a revision of his plan however and project was nearly abandoned size of building was halved and it was set back from original wall segments to preserve foundation pei was disappointed with alterations but remained involved in building process even during construction wiseman pp 311 313 in 1995 pei was hired to design an extension to deutsches historisches museum or german historical museum in berlin returning to challenge of east building of u s national gallery pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure he described glass cylinder addition as a beacon quoted in wiseman p 315 and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside pei had difficulty working with german government officials on project their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics they thought i was nothing but trouble he said quoted in wiseman p 316 pei also worked at this time on two projects for a new japanese religious movement called shinji he was approached by movement s spiritual leader kaishu koyama who impressed architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom one of buildings was a bell tower designed to resemble used when playing traditional instruments like shamisen pei was unfamiliar with movement s beliefs but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in tower as he said it was a search for sort of expression that is not at all technical quoted in wiseman p 300 thumb left alt a curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in front door pei s tunnel through a mountain leading to miho museum was partly inspired by a story from fourth century chinese poet tao yuanming boehm pp 99 100 experience was rewarding for pei and he agreed immediately to work with group again new project was miho museum to display koyama s collection of tea ceremony artifacts pei visited site in shiga prefecture and during their conversations convinced koyama to expand her collection she conducted a global search and acquired more than 300 items showcasing history of silk road wiseman pp 317 319 one major challenge was approach to museum japanese team proposed a winding road up mountain not unlike approach to ncar building in colorado instead pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety six steel cables and supported by a post set into mountain museum itself was built into mountain with 80 percent of building underground wiseman pp 318 320 when designing exterior pei borrowed from tradition of japanese temples particularly those found in nearby kyoto he created a concise spaceframe wrapped into french limestone and covered with a glass roof pei also oversaw specific decorative details including a bench in entrance lobby carved from a 350 year old keyaki tree because of koyama s considerable wealth money was rarely considered an obstacle estimates at time of completion put cost of project at us 350 million wiseman pp 320 322 during first decade of 2000s pei designed a variety of buildings including suzhou museum near his childhood home he also designed museum of islamic art in doha qatar at request of al thani family although it was originally planned for corniche road along doha bay pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide needed space he then spent six months touring region and surveying mosques in spain syria and tunisia he was especially impressed with elegant simplicity of mosque of ibn tulun in cairo once again pei sought to combine new design elements with classical aesthetic most appropriate for location of building sand colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement with small arched windows at regular intervals into limestone exterior inside galleries are arranged around a massive atrium lit from above museum s coordinators were pleased with project its

cubist themes wiseman p 11 boehm pp 45 46 he was known for combining traditional architectural principles with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns circles squares and triangles are common elements of his work in both plan and elevation as one critic wrote pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method heyer p 309 in 2000 biographer carter wiseman called pei most distinguished member of his late modernist generation still in practice wiseman p 323 at same time pei himself rejected simple dichotomies of architectural trends he once said talk about modernism versus post modernism is unimportant it s a side issue an individual building style in which it is going to be designed and built is not that important important thing really is community how does it affect life quoted in diamonstein p 145 pei s work is celebrated throughout world of architecture his colleague john portman once told him just once i d like to do something like east building but this originality did not always bring large financial reward as pei replied to successful architect just once i d like to make kind of money you do quoted in wiseman p 215 his concepts moreover were too individualized and dependent on context to have given rise to a particular school of design pei referred to his own analytical approach when explaining lack of a pei school for me he said important distinction is between a stylistic approach to design and an analytical approach giving process of due consideration to time place and purpose my analytical approach requires a full understanding of three essential elements to arrive at an ideal balance among them boehm p 113 awards and honors in words of his biographer pei won every award of
