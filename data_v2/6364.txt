tropical storm morakot known in philippines as tropical storm juaning brought significant rainfall to taiwan before alleviating drought conditions in mainland china in august 2003 tenth named storm in western pacific that year morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in philippine sea on july 31 tracking northwest favorable conditions allowed for intensification of system to tropical storm strength on august 2 morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km h 50 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar hpa 28 29 inhg this intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened system this was followed by morakot making landfall on southern taiwan on august 3 subsequently storm weakened and moved into taiwan strait before making its final landfall near quanzhou china next day storm quickly weakened over chinese mainland and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall in taiwan where morakot first made landfall heavy rainfall resulted in flooding commercial flights schools and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of storm precipitation there peaked at 653 mm 25 71 in over a period of nearly two days in taitung county crop damage also resulted from rainfall and was estimated at over nt 70 million us 2 million in china record rainfall was reported worst impacted city was quanzhou where losses due to morakot reached cny 240 million us 29 million and one death was reported power outages were also widespread across southeastern china due to preexisting drought conditions 703 cloud seeding operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over targeted area overall morakot caused roughly 31 million in damage and three deaths meteorological history in late july 2003 an area of disturbed weather began to persist northwest of chuuk in philippine sea and was first noted by joint typhoon warning center jtwc early on july 30 as atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout day s duration system organized and was upgraded to tropical depression status by philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa at 0600 utc on july 31 followed by jtwc at 0600 utc and japan meteorological agency jma six hours later pagasa consequently named system juaning for local purposes tracking north northwestward under influence of a passing trough system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600 utc on august 2 thus receiving name morakot at time storm was well organized with a steady outflow pattern intensification continued and at 1800 utc on august 2 jma determined morakot to have peaked in intensity with winds of 85 km h 50 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar hpa 28 29 inhg however jtwc still considered morakot to have been a strengthening tropical cyclone at time appearance of a ragged eye prompted agency to upgrade storm to typhoon status at 0600 utc on august 3 though other agencies still maintained morakot s tropical storm classification over rest of day cyclone moved rather erratically before making its first landfall on tainan taiwan late on august 3 morakot had slightly weakened prior to landfall and as such estimates from jma of storm s intensity at time of landfall were slightly lowered to 75 km h 45 mph despite slowing of storm s forward motion as it moved across island passage over taiwan was brief and morakot entered taiwan strait by early on august 4 cyclone s northwesterly track brought storm to a second landfall this time near quanzhou china at approximately 1000 utc that day weakening was quick over china and by two hours after landfall jma declared morakot to have weakened below tropical depression intensity jtwc continued to monitor system until it was determined to have dissipated by 0000 utc on august 5 preparations and impact due to storm s projected path into taiwan central weather bureau issued a sea and land warning on august 2 commercial flights between taiwan and green and orchid islands were cancelled as well as rail service along taiwan s eastern coast morakot s passage over southern taiwan resulted in significant rainfall across island precipitation from tropical cyclone peaked at 653 mm 25 71 in over nearly two days in taitung county rains uprooted trees in southeastern taitung city and triggered some landslides flash flooding was reported in pingtung county additional landslides blocked highways there and elementary and junior high schools in county were forced to close power outages also occurred and impacted hundreds of residences crop damage ensued from precipitation and amounted to over nt 70 million us 2 million heavy rainfall and flooding also occurred in china a station in jinjiang fujian recorded 544 mm 21 42 in of rain in an 18 hour period this was most torrential rainfall event for city since records began heavy rains also fell in town where 334 mm 13 15 in of rain was documented in eight hours quanzhou city was heavily impacted by rainfall and total losses there reached cny 240 million us 29 million one death resulted in city further south in heyuan widespread power outages were caused by torrential rainfall winds blew two people off of a high falsework killing both rainfall from morakot in china somewhat relieved persistent drought conditions in region following passage of tropical storm however 703 cloud seeding missions were carried out in fujian province in order to produce enhanced artificial rainfall this included deployment of 1 027 rockets and 14 700 cannonballs containing silver iodide as a result of these rainfall totals ranging from over a area were attributed to anthropologically enhanced precipitation though not directly related to morakot storm s cyclonic circulation helped in part to produce thick smog and low visibility conditions in parts of hong kong naming in 2002 name hanuman was replaced prior to being used due to objection by india meteorological department for reason of religion see also typhoon 2007 typhoon 2001 tropical storm 2013 notes
