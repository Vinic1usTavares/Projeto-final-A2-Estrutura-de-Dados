cited limbo braid and as influences for game s aesthetics comics and cartoons served as influences for spidy s design character was given a pair of large yellow eyes which allowed character to emote two of legs were removed bringing total from eight to six which andrew mckerrow described as an effort to avoid triggering fears of people with and make character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy it was only after making these changes to spidy that developers decided to make spidy an extraterrestrial as that would justify character design s deviations from regular spiders

lorenzo opined that adorable characters beautiful visuals and upbeat music stand out as high points of alien spidy a large number of reviewers called game and its characters cute while a few of reviewers praised game s music jeremy peeples of hardcore gamer found that it lacked staying power he noted however that music could be muted without also muting sound effects allowing people to play their own music critics near universally took issue with game s controls critics found that webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go and multiple reviewers described navigation as trial and error reviewers also found that they could not always jump when they wanted to and one reviewer found that power ups failed to activate when she wanted them to reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to next forcing players to replay same levels over and over again because points are subtracted each time spidy dies problems with control scheme exacerbate how difficult it is to get enough stars to progress opinions on game s mid level checkpoint system were mixed matt cullen of canadian online gaming noted that checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into level after each death saving time official xbox magazine s taylor cocke however noted that checkpoints save players point progress meaning that players would have to start level over if their performance wasn t good enough before they reached checkpoint notes metacritic tracks ratings for each platform separately and does not assign aggregate scores for a platform until it receives at least four reviews specific to that platform as metacritic only lists two reviews for playstation 3 version and one review for personal computer version it has not issued aggregate scores for those platforms gamerankings like metacritic tracks scores for each platform separately and had only two reviews for playstation 3 version and one review for personal computer version unlike metacritic gamerankings does provide a score for platforms with too few reviews to be a true aggregate for both playstation 3 and personal computer versions that score was 50 00 references external links official website category 2013 video games category xbox 360 live arcade games category playstation network games category macos games category
