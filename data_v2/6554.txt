orjen class of eight motor torpedo boats was built for royal yugoslav navy between 1936 and 1939 at lurssen shipyard at vegesack germany they were based on german s 2 motor torpedo boats at start of axis invasion of yugoslavia two boats managed to escape to alexandria in egypt where they continued serving with allied forces including in operations against vichy french forces in syria remaining ones were captured by italian forces and commissioned in regia marina royal italian navy with modified armament they were also used by italians as model for italian built crda 60 t motor torpedo boats at time of italian armistice in september 1943 two boats were scuttled by their crews four surviving italian boats were taken over by german forces and commissioned in kriegsmarine german navy serving largely in aegean sea until they were finally scuttled in october 1944 as germans withdrew from greece two boats that had escaped to allies in 1941 returned to yugoslavia after war they were commissioned in new yugoslav navy and remained in service until early 1960s background and description during early 1930s yugoslavia faced an economic recession brought on by great depression which was further complicated by internal political instability in mid 1930s yugoslav government sought to improve relations with italy and germany to create new economic opportunities for country such cooperation resulted in acquisition of new german constructed ships for royal yugoslav navy jkrm which had previously obtained ships from france and great britain first such deal came in 1936 when navy ordered eight motor torpedo boats that were to be built by lurssen shipyard based on existing german design of s 2 class boats measured in length overall with a beam and a draught of fully loaded they displaced main propulsion consisted of three daimler benz 12 cylinder four stroke petrol engines rated at giving boats a maximum speed of a maybach engine rated at was also installed for use when cruising and boats had a crew of sixteen armament consisted of two torpedo tubes and a anti aircraft gun on stern boats name namesake builder launched first italian designation 1941 second italian

of axis invasion of yugoslavia seven of eight orjen class boats and two smaller boats were assigned to 2nd torpedo division in sibenik with velebit as division flagship at time orjen was being refitted at naval arsenal at tivat in bay of kotor on 11 april a naval force consisting of several orjen class boats among other ships was expected to assist ground forces in attacking italian enclave of zara which yugoslav high command feared would be used as a bridgehead during invasion attack however never materialized and yugoslav ships were instead attacked by italian bombers forcing them to retreat to bay of kotor by 17 april complete collapse of yugoslav defences was imminent prompting commander of 3rd torpedo boat division ivan kern to suggest that durmitor kajmakcalan dinara triglav rudnik and suvobor sail out of bay of kotor to evade capture by axis and continue their fight alongside allied forces kern approached commanding officers of durmitor kajmakcalan rudnik and suvobor with idea only to be rejected by all of them at same time saboteurs caused a fire on triglav further eroding crew morale already under pressure from desertion elsewhere in bay of kotor milan and died blowing up destroyer zagreb to prevent her from falling into enemy hands following this kern decided to sail out with just two boats durmitor and kajmakcalan which he deemed had most trustworthy crews leaving bay of kotor on 17 april because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel maximum speed they could achieve was 29 knots before passing through strait of otranto boats successfully evaded two groups of italian ships they arrived at navarino bay in southern greece on 19 april and at souda bay in crete on 22 april where they were tasked with escorting a convoy to alexandria protecting it from possible attacks from junkers ju 87 dive bombers once in alexandria they joined with other jkrm vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape forming jkrm in exile two boats were first tasked with patrolling outside of harbour in anticipation of an attack by axis coastal craft in june they operated against vichy french forces in syria in 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between alexandria and port said however with time serviceability of boats became a problem because of lack of spare parts needed for their german built engines axis service remaining six boats were captured by italian forces and commissioned in regia marina royal italian navy receiving designations mas 3 8 d with mas standing for motoscafo armato silurante torpedo armed motorboat and prefix d denoting they were captured in dalmatia captured boats were used as a model for italian built crda 60 t motor torpedo boats which were designated as ms or motor torpedo boat to distinguish them from smaller mas boats already in italian service mas 3 5 d formed 24th mas squadron and were deployed in aegean sea designations of former yugoslav boats were changed again in july 1942 to conform with new ms prefix and new numerals from 41 to 46 during their italian service boats were re armed on ms 41 44 original gun and a machine gun were both removed in favor of two single mount breda model 35 l 65 guns on ms 45 46 armament consisted of one 40 mm l 43 gun and one 15 mm l 38 machine gun boats were also equipped to carry 12 to 20 depth charges in italian service crew was increased to 22 following italian armistice in september 1943 at least four of boats were taken over by kriegsmarine german navy ms 41 was scuttled by its crew on 9 september at monfalcone sources are inconsistent regarding boat s ultimate fate according to italian sources it was raised and repaired by german forces before being sunk by a mine between porto corsini and porto garibaldi in october 1944 german sources on other hand claim it was never commissioned by kriegsmarine ms 45 was also scuttled by its crew just a few days later on 18 september at cattolica remaining four boats ms 42 44 and ms 46 were commissioned with kriegsmarine as s 601 604 respectively they formed part of 24th s boat flotilla soon after their acquisition by germans s 601 and s 603 were travelling from piraeus in occupied greece to bay of kotor when s 603 suffered from a main engine failure while operating on her cruising engine she and s 601 were attacked by four supermarine spitfire fighter bombers of royal air force one of attackers was shot down by s 601 but both boats were damaged and several crew on both boats were killed or wounded they put into corfu for repairs on 22 february 1944 two boats attempted to continue their voyage but two fires on s 603 forced a return to port this was followed by a fire during a test run and several crew were badly burnt another attempt to leave began on 14 march but cruising engine on s 603 exploded injuring two crewmen due to rough seas in central adriatic two boats were diverted to salamis with s 601 towing her disabled sister boat in meantime s 602 and s 604 had also been sent to salamis by late march s 601 was conducting anti partisan operations following a british special boat service raid on stampalia on 29 march she intercepted and scuttled a sailing vessel carrying fuel near oxeia following day she transported 20 german soldiers and towed artillery lighter to oxeia to assist with mopping up operations but by time they arrived enemy was gone in late march s 602 604 were loaded with ammunition and supplies and sailed to salonika with s 603 still under tow arriving on 18 april 1944 all four german operated boats were scuttled or sunk in october 1944 at salonika as germans withdrew from greece due to red army advances in balkans post war service after end of war durmitor and kajmakcalan along with other jkrm ships and personnel in exile returned to sibenik in may 1945 they were commissioned in new yugoslav navy as tc 5 and tc 6 later being redesignated as tc 391 and tc 392 both were stricken in 1963
