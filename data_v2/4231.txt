ahmad ibn tulun ca 20 september 835 10 may 884 was founder of tulunid dynasty that ruled egypt and syria between 868 and 905 originally a turkic slave soldier in 868 ibn tulun was sent to egypt as governor by abbasid caliph within four years ibn tulun had established himself as a virtually independent ruler by evicting caliphal fiscal agent ibn al mudabbir taking over control of egypt s finances and establishing a large military force personally loyal to himself this process was facilitated by volatile political situation in abbasid court and preoccupation of abbasid regent al muwaffaq with wars against saffarids and zanj rebellion ibn tulun also took care to establish an efficient administration in egypt after reforms to tax system repairs to irrigation system and other measures annual tax yield grew markedly as a symbol of his new regime he built a new capital al qata i north of old capital fustat after 875 6 he entered into open conflict with al muwaffaq who tried unsuccessfully to unseat him in 878 with support of al muwaffaq s brother caliph al mu tamid ibn tulun took over governance of syria as well as frontier districts with byzantine empire although control of tarsus in particular proved tenuous during his absence in syria his eldest son and deputy abbas tried to usurp power in egypt leading to imprisonment of abbas and nomination of ibn tulun s second son khumarawayh as his heir defection in 882 of a senior commander lu lu to al muwaffaq and defection of tarsus forced ibn tulun to return to syria now virtually powerless al mu tamid tried to escape from his brother s control to ibn tulun s domains but was captured by al muwaffaq s agents and ibn tulun convened an assembly of jurists at damascus to denounce al muwaffaq as a usurper his attempt in autumn 883 to bring tarsus to heel failed and he fell sick returning to egypt he died in may 884 and was succeeded by khumarawayh ibn tulun stands out as first governor of a major province of abbasid caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of abbasid court but to also pass power on to his son he was thus also first ruler since ptolemaic pharaohs to make egypt an independent political power again with a sphere of influence encompassing syria and parts of maghreb setting tone for later egypt based islamic regimes from ikhshidids to mamluk sultanate of cairo primary sources several medieval authors wrote about ahmad ibn tulun two major sources are two biographies by two 10th century authors ibn al daya and al balawi both are called sirat ahmad ibn tulun and al balawi s work relies to a large extent on ibn al daya s although it is much more extensive ibn al daya also wrote a book kitab al a with anecdotes from tulunid era egyptian society further information comes from ibn tulun s contemporary geographer and traveler ya whose works cover first years of his rule in egypt and from later egyptian authors especially 15th century historians ibn duqmaq and al maqrizi who drew on a variety of earlier sources to write on history of tulunid state several other medieval arabic chroniclers from 13th to 16th centuries mention ibn tulun or his officials but most are of a later date and not very reliable especially in comparison to ibn duqmaq and al maqrizi see also on modern scholarship regarding ibn tulun and his works life early life and career ahmad ibn tulun was born on 23rd day of month of ramadan 220 ah 20 september 835 or slightly later probably in baghdad his father tulun was a turk from a locality known in arabic sources as or o i e uyghur confederation in year 815 6 200 ah tulun was taken captive along with other turks and sent as part of tribute of samanid governor of bukhara nuh ibn asad to caliph al ma mun reigned 813 833 who at time resided in khurasan after al ma mun returned to baghdad in 819 these turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers ghilman sing ghulam entrusted to al ma mun s brother and eventual successor al mu tasim r 833 842 tulun did well for himself eventually coming to command caliph s private guard ahmad s mother called qasim was one of his father s slaves in 854 5 tulun died and qasim is commonly held to have married a second time to turkish general or bakbak this report however does not appear in ibn al daya or al balawi and may be spurious according to al balawi after his father s death ahmad came under tutelage of a close companion of tulun who had been taken captive alongside him at his deathbed tulun urged his friend to take care of his wife and son and bakbak thereafter treated young ahmad as his own son young ahmad ibn tulun received a thorough education involving military training at new abbasid capital of samarra and studies in islamic theology at tarsus acquiring a reputation not only for his knowledge but also for his pious and ascetic way of life he became popular among his fellow turks who would confide secrets and entrust their money and even their women to him while at tarsus ibn tulun fought in frontier wars with byzantine empire there he also met another senior turkish leader yarjukh whose daughter variously given as or khatun became his first wife and mother of his eldest son abbas and his daughter fatimah sources also report that during his time at tarsus ibn tulun had ties to caliph al mutawakkil s vizier ubayd allah ibn yahya ibn khaqan and latter s cousin ahmad ibn muhammad ibn khaqan on one occasion while returning to samarra he saved a caravan bearing a caliphal envoy returning from constantinople from a bedouin raiding party and accompanied it to samarra this act gained him favour of caliph al musta in r 862 866 as well as a thousand gold dinars and hand of slave mother of his second son khumarawayh when caliph abdicated and went into exile at wasit in 866 he chose ibn tulun to be his guard mother of new caliph al mu tazz r 866 869 schemed to remove deposed al musta in and offered ibn tulun governorship of wasit if he would murder him ibn tulun refused and was replaced by another who carried out deed ibn tulun himself played no part in assassination but gave his master a burial and returned to samarra governor of egypt thumb upright 0 8 alt photo of a minaret in four levels with battlements in foreground spiral minaret of mosque of ibn tulun in cairo already under caliph al mu tasim senior turkish leaders began being appointed as governors of provinces of caliphate as a form of appanage thereby they secured immediate access to province s tax revenue for themselves and their troops bypassing civilian bureaucracy turkish generals usually remained close to centre of power in samarra sending deputies to govern in their name thus when al mu tazz gave bakbak charge of egypt in 868 bakbak in turn sent his stepson ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor ahmad ibn tulun entered egypt on 27 august 868 and egyptian capital fustat on 15 september ibn tulun s position after his appointment was far from undisputed within his province as governor of fustat he oversaw province s garrison and was head of muslim community as recognized in his title of overseer of army and friday prayer wali al jaysh wa l salat but fiscal administration in particular collection of land tax kharaj was in hands of powerful veteran administrator ibn al mudabbir latter had been appointed as fiscal agent amil already since ca 861 and had rapidly become most hated man in country as he doubled taxes and imposed new ones on muslims and non muslims alike ibn tulun quickly signalled his intention to be sole master of his province on his arrival at fustat when both ibn al mudabbir and shukayr head of postal service barid and of correspondence with caliphal government came out to meet him with a gift of 10 000 dinars he refused to accept it for next four years ibn tulun and his rivals fought via their emissaries and relatives at caliphal court in samarra to neutralize each other in end ibn tulun managed to secure ibn al mudabbir s transfer to syria in july 871 and assumed collection of kharaj himself at same time ibn tulun also secured dismissal of shukayr who died shortly after thus by 872 ibn tulun had assumed control of all branches of administration in egypt becoming de facto independent of abbasid central government at time of ibn tulun s appointment egypt was undergoing a transformative process in 834 its early muslim elite arab settler families jund of fustat lost their privileges and government pay and power passed to officials sent by abbasid court at about same time for first time muslim population began surpassing coptic christians in numbers and rural districts were increasingly subject to both arabization and islamization rapidity of this process and influx of settlers after discovery of gold and emerald mines at aswan meant that upper egypt in particular was only superficially controlled by local governor furthermore persistence of internecine strife and turmoil at heart of abbasid state so called anarchy at samarra led to appearance of millennialist revolutionary movements in province under a series of alid pretenders one of them was ibn al sufi a descendant of ali s son umar who rebelled in late 869 and massacred populace of esna in winter 870 he defeated an army sent against him by ibn tulun but was driven to oases of desert in spring he remained there until he was defeated in a struggle with another regional strongman abu abdallah ibn abd al hamid al umari in 872 fleeing to mecca there he was seized and imprisoned for a while by ibn tulun one of his followers abu rebelled in oases in 873 4 and was successful enough for ibn tulun to offer him an amnesty ibn al sufi s vanquisher al umari was another descendant of ali who had created an autonomous principality around gold mines defeating forces sent against him another revolt broke out in 874 5 by governor of barqa muhammad ibn al faraj al farghani ibn tulun tried to reconcile him at first but was eventually forced to send an army to besiege and storm city although reprisals were limited re imposition of his authority over barqa however led to strengthening of ties with ifriqiya to west including according to ibn al athir erection of a series of lighthouses and messaging beacons along coast in meantime in palestine local governor isa ibn al shaykh al shaybani had used anarchy in iraq to set up a quasi independent bedouin regime intercepting tax caravans from egypt and threatening damascus when caliph al muhtadi ascended throne in july 869 he offered a general amnesty and wrote to ibn al shaykh offering a pardon in exchange for him handing over treasure he had wrongfully appropriated when ibn al shaykh refused caliph ordered ibn tulun to march against him ibn tulun complied and began a mass purchase of black african sudan and greek rum slaves to form an army over winter of 869 70 but no sooner had he arrived at al arish with his army in summer 870 than orders came to turn back ibn al shaykh s revolt was crushed soon after by another turkish soldier amajur al turki who continued to govern syria for abbasids until his death in 878 this episode was nevertheless of major importance as it allowed ibn tulun to recruit an army of his own with caliphal sanction tulunid army which eventually grew to reportedly 100 000 men other sources give a breakdown of 24 000 turkish ghilman and 42 000 black african and greek slaves as well as a mercenary corps composed mostly of greeks became foundation of ibn tulun s power and independence for his personal protection ibn tulun reportedly employed a corps of ghilman from ghur ibn tulun s stepfather bakbak was murdered in 869 70 but luckily for him in summer of 871 supervision of egypt passed to his father in law yarjukh yarjukh not only confirmed ibn tulun in his post but in addition conferred to him authority over alexandria and barqa in 873 ibn tulun entrusted government of alexandria to his eldest son abbas ibn tulun s growing power was manifested in establishment of a new palace city to northeast of fustat called al qata i in 870 project was a conscious emulation of and rival to abbasid capital samarra just like samarra new city was designed as quarters for ibn tulun s new army with aim of reducing frictions with urban populace of fustat each unit received an allotment or ward whence city s name to settle after which ward was named new city s centrepiece was mosque of ibn tulun which was built in 878 880 under supervision of mesopotamian christian architect ibn katib al farghani a royal palace adjoined mosque and rest of city was laid out around them beside government buildings it included markets a hospital al that provided services free of charge and a hippodrome nevertheless ibn tulun himself preferred to reside in coptic monastery of qusayr outside fustat ibn tulun s new regime administration of egypt was already well developed before ibn tulun s arrival with a number of departments diwans responsible for collection of land tax supervision of post public granaries diwan al ahra nile delta lands diwan al ard and possibly a privy purse diwan al khass for governor s personal use a chancery diwan al possibly also already existed or else was established under ibn tulun when he remodelled egyptian administration after abbasid central government most of officials employed by ibn tulun were like him trained in caliphal court at samarra ibn tulun s chancellor was capable abu ja far muhammad ibn abd al kan died 891 while other important positions in administration were held by four banu al muhajir brothers and ibn al daya al balawi also reports several anecdotes about ibn tulun s extensive use of spies and his own ability to uncover spies sent against him and claims that chancery was established so that ibn tulun could check up on every piece of correspondence with caliphal court unsurprisingly given his own origins as a slave soldier ibn tulun s regime was in many ways typical of ghulam system that became one of two main paradigms of islamic polities in 9th and 10th centuries as abbasid caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged these regimes were based on power of a regular army composed of ghilman but in turn according to hugh n kennedy paying of troops was major preoccupation of government it is therefore in context of increased financial requirements that in 879 supervision of finances in egypt and syria passed to abu bakr ahmad ibn ibrahim al madhara i founder of al madhara i bureaucratic dynasty that dominated fiscal apparatus of egypt for next 70 years although as zaky m hassan notes fragmentary evidence does not permit a thorough assessment of tulunid economic and financial policies it appears that peace and security provided by tulunid regime establishment of an efficient administration and repairs and expansions to irrigation system coupled with a consistently high level of nile floods resulted in a major increase in revenue by time of ibn tulun s death income from land tax alone had risen from 800 000 dinars under ibn al mudabbir to sum of 4 3 million dinars and ibn tulun bequeathed his successor a fiscal reserve of ten million dinars crucial to this was reform of tax assessment and collection system including introduction of tax farming which at same time led to rise of a new landholding class additional revenue was collected from commercial activities most notably textiles and in particular linen ibn tulun s regime was highly centralized but also featured consistent attempts to win backing of egypt s commercial religious and social elite according to zaky m hassan notably wealthy merchant ma mar al jawhar functioned both as ibn tulun s personal financier and as head of an informal intelligence network through his contacts in iraq a further notable characteristic of ibn tulun s rule according to historian thierry bianquis was quality of relations it maintained with christians and jews according to a letter by patriarch of jerusalem elias iii when he took over palestine he appointed a christian as governor of jerusalem and possibly even of provincial capital ramla thereby putting an end to persecution of christians and allowing renovation of churches expansion into syria thumb right upright 1 2 alt geophysical map of eastern mediterranean with cities marked in black and provinces in red map of tulunid domains following conquest of syria in early 870s a major change took place in abbasid government as abbasid prince al muwaffaq emerged as de facto regent of empire sidelining his brother caliph al mu tamid r 870 892 officially al muwaffaq controlled eastern half of caliphate while al mu tamid s son and first heir al mufawwad controlled western with aid of turkish general musa ibn bugha in reality al muwaffaq held actual reins of power al muwaffaq however was preoccupied with more immediate threats to abbasid government presented by rise of saffarids in east and by zanj rebellion in iraq itself as well as with keeping in check turkish troops and managing internal tensions of caliphal government this gave ibn tulun necessary space to consolidate his own position in egypt ibn tulun kept himself out of zanj conflict and even refused to recognize al mufawwad as his suzerain who in turn did not confirm him in his position open conflict between ibn tulun and al muwaffaq broke out in 875 6 on occasion of a large remittance of revenue to central government counting on rivalry between caliph and his over mighty brother to maintain his own position ibn tulun forwarded a larger share of taxes to al mu tamid instead of al muwaffaq 2 2 million dinars went to caliph and only 1 2 million dinars to his brother al muwaffaq who in his fight against zanj considered himself entitled to major share of provincial revenues was angered by this and by implied machinations between ibn tulun and his brother al muwaffaq sought a volunteer to replace him but all officials in baghdad had been bought off by ibn tulun and refused al muwaffaq sent a letter to egyptian ruler demanding his resignation which latter predictably refused both sides geared for war ibn tulun created a fleet and fortified his borders and ports including alexandria and a new fortress on rawda island to protect fustat al muwaffaq nominated musa ibn bugha as governor of egypt and sent him with troops to syria in event due to a combination of lack of pay and supplies for troops and fear generated by ibn tulun s army musa never got further than raqqa after ten months of inaction and a rebellion by his troops musa returned to iraq in a public gesture of support for al mu tamid and opposition to al muwaffaq ibn tulun would assume title of servant of commander of faithful mawla amir al mu minin in 878 ibn tulun now seized initiative having served in his youth in border wars with byzantine empire at tarsus he now requested to be conferred command of frontier districts of cilicia thughur al muwaffaq initially refused but following byzantine successes of previous years al mu tamid prevailed upon his brother and in 877 8 ibn tulun received responsibility for entirety of syria and cilician frontier ibn tulun marched into syria in person he received submission of son of amajur who had recently died whom he appointed governor at ramla and proceeded to take possession of damascus homs hama and aleppo at damascus ibn tulun encountered his old rival ibn al mudabbir who since his eviction from egypt had served as amajur s amil for palestine and damascus ibn al mudabbir was fined 600 000 dinars and thrown into prison where he died in 883 4 in rest of provincial administration however he largely left people who had served under amajur in place only governor of aleppo sima al tawil resisted and fled to antioch ibn tulun laid siege to city until sima was killed reportedly by a local woman he then continued on to tarsus where he began preparing for a campaign against byzantines presence of his numerous soldiers however led to a rapid rise in prices causing great hostility among tarsians who demanded that he either leave or reduce his army at this juncture news arrived from egypt that his son abbas whom he had left as his regent was preparing to usurp his position under influence of his entourage ibn tulun hastily withdrew from tarsus but as more information about situation in egypt began to arrive clarifying that abbas posed no real threat ibn tulun decided to spend more time in syria and consolidate his authority he redressed injustices of sima installed troops in aleppo under his ghulam lu lu and harran secured co operation of banu kilab tribe and their leader ibn al abbas and captured rebel musa ibn at some point after his takeover of syria ibn tulun ordered refortification of akka a task undertaken by abu bakr al grandfather of al muqaddasi who provides a detailed description of work only then in april 879 did ibn tulun return to egypt abbas fled west with his supporters and from barqa tried to take over ifriqiya defeated by probably in winter of 880 881 he retreated back east to alexandria where he was finally confronted and captured by ibn tulun s forces after being publicly paraded seated on a mule ibn tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions who had driven him to rebel ibn tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse to do such a dishonourable act but he agreed weeping ibn tulun had abbas whipped and imprisoned he then named his second son khumarawayh as his heir apparent final years and death thumb upright 1 2 alt obverse and reverse of round gold coin with arabic inscriptions gold dinar of ahmad ibn tulun minted in fustat in 881 2 following his return from syria ibn tulun added his own name to coins issued by mints under his control along with those of caliph and heir apparent al mufawwad in autumn of 882 tulunid general lu lu defected to abbasids at same time tulunid appointed governor of tarsus and thughur died and his replacement yazaman al khadim with popular backing refused to acknowledge tulunid rule ibn tulun immediately left in person for syria taking chained abbas with him as a precaution and headed for tarsus at damascus he received a message from al mu tamid informing him that by now nearly powerless caliph had escaped samarra and was heading for syria taking custody of al mu tamid would have immensely boosted ibn tulun s standing not only would sole source of political legitimacy in muslim world reside under his control but he would also be able to pose as rescuer of caliph ibn tulun therefore decided to halt and await al mu tamid s arrival in event however caliph was overtaken at al haditha on euphrates by governor of mosul ishaq ibn kundaj who defeated caliphal escort and brought him back to samarra february 883 and thence south to wasit where al muwaffaq could better control him this opened anew rift between two rulers al muwaffaq nominated ishaq ibn kundaj as governor of egypt and syria in reality a largely symbolic appointment while ibn tulun organized an assembly of religious jurists at damascus which denounced al muwaffaq as a usurper condemned his maltreatment of caliph declared his place in succession as void and called for a jihad against him only three participants including chief qadi of egypt bakkar ibn qutayba refused to pronounce call for jihad publicly ibn tulun had his rival duly denounced in sermons in mosques across tulunid domains while abbasid regent responded in kind with a ritual denunciation of ibn tulun despite belligerent rhetoric however neither made moves to confront other militarily after his failure to take control of caliph ibn tulun turned on tarsus he appointed abdallah ibn fath in lu lu s place in aleppo and marched in person to cilicia egyptian ruler laid siege to tarsus in autumn 883 but yazaman diverted local river inundating tulunid camp and forcing ibn tulun to retreat ibn tulun fell ill on his return to egypt and was carried to fustat on a wheeled vehicle in same year a campaign to take over two holy cities of islam mecca and medina also failed back in egypt he ordered bakkar to be arrested and replaced him with muhammad ibn al jawhari a thorough examination of bakkar s accounts while head of charitable endowments however revealed no although ibn tulun ordered him released elderly and sick qadi refused to leave his cell at same time illness of ibn tulun himself worsened muslims christians and jews including women and children converged separately upon flank of muqattam to implore god to save him as bianquis writes but ibn tulun died at fustat on 10 may 884 and was interred on slopes of muqattam according to al balawi ibn tulun left his heir 24 000 servants 7 000 men and 7 000 horses 3 000 camels 1 000 mules 350 ceremonial horses and 200 fully equipped warships at ibn tulun s death khumarawayh with backing of tulunid elites succeeded without opposition ibn tulun bequeathed his heir with a seasoned military a stable economy and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against abbasid attempt to overthrow him at battle of tawahin and even made additional territorial gains but his extravagant spending exhausted treasury and his assassination in 896 began rapid decline of tulunid regime internal strife sapped tulunid power khumarawayh s son jaysh was a drunkard who executed his uncle mudar ibn ahmad ibn tulun he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother harun ibn khumarawayh harun too was a weak ruler and although a revolt by his uncle rabi ah in alexandria was suppressed tulunids were unable to confront attacks of qarmatians who began at same time in addition many commanders defected to abbasids whose power revived under capable leadership of al muwaffaq s son caliph al mu tadid r 892 902 finally in december 904 two other sons of ibn tulun ali and shayban murdered their nephew and assumed control of tulunid state far from halting decline this event alienated key commanders in syria and led to rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of syria and egypt by abbasids under muhammad ibn sulayman al katib who entered fustat in january 905 with exception of great mosque of ibn tulun victorious abbasid troops pillaged al qata i and razed it to ground offspring according to al balawi from his various wives and concubines ibn tulun had 33 children 17 sons and 16 daughters only modern edition of al balawi provides following list male children abu al fadl al abbas eldest abu al jaysh

empire with areas still under direct control of abbasid central government dark green and under autonomous rulers light green adhering to nominal abbasid suzerainty despite brief duration of his dynasty ibn tulun s rule was a seminal event not only for egypt but for entire islamic world for egypt itself his reign marks a turning point as country for first time since pharaohs ceased being a passive province subject to a foreign imperial power and became once again a political actor in its own right new realm ibn tulun forged encompassing egypt and syria as well as jazira and cilicia and to a lesser extent eastern parts of maghreb established a new political zone separated from islamic lands further east restoring in a fashion frontier that had existed between roman byzantine and sassanid persian realms in antiquity egypt was basis of ibn tulun s power he paid particular attention to restoring its economy as well as establishing an autonomous bureaucracy army and navy these policies were continued by later egypt based regimes ikhshidids 935 969 and eventually fatimids 969 1171 who likewise used egypt s wealth to establish control over parts or even most of syria indeed as thierry bianquis remarks territory ruled by ibn tulun in syria was remarkably similar to that controlled by later egypt based regimes of saladin and mamluk sultanate according to historian matthew gordon ibn tulun s relations with and quest for autonomy from abbasids is a central problem of tulunid history modern scholars see in ibn tulun s policies a careful balancing act and notice that he never fully severed himself from caliphate remaining conspicuously loyal to person of al mu tamid who after all was a powerless figurehead nevertheless move towards increasing autonomy is evident throughout his reign his relations with abbasid government were dominated by his conflict with al muwaffaq resulting from latter s attempts to establish control over egypt whose wealth was needed during costly war against zanj and prevent further rise of ibn tulun in a certain sense writes matthew gordon many of ibn tulun s measures were as much means by which imperial interests were protected against ambitions of al muwaffaq and his largely turkish military coterie in iraq as they were efforts to secure tulunid authority given that ibn tulun at least twice in 871 and 875 6 remitted huge sums to caliphal treasury it remains an open question whether without conflict with al muwaffaq this would have been a more regular occurrence nevertheless in retrospective ibn tulun s role in wider context of islamic history is as herald of abbasid caliphate s disintegration and rise of local dynasties in provinces this became particularly evident with succession of khumarawayh as thierry bianquis explains this was first time in abbasid history with regard to government of so large and rich a territory that a wali whose legitimacy derived from caliph who had designated him was succeeded openly by an amir who claimed his legitimacy by inheritance thus zaky m hassan calls ibn tulun a typical example of turkish slaves who from time of harun al rashid were enlisted in private service of caliph and principal officers of state and whose ambition and spirit of intrigue and independence eventually made them real masters of islam see also list of rulers of egypt references
