bad pharma how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients is a book by british physician and academic ben goldacre about pharmaceutical industry its relationship with medical profession and extent to which it controls academic research into its own products luisa dillner bad pharma by ben goldacre review guardian 17 october 2012 it was published in uk in september 2012 by fourth estate imprint of harpercollins and in united states in february 2013 by faber and faber goldacre argues in book that whole edifice of medicine is broken because evidence on which it is based is systematically distorted by pharmaceutical industry he writes that industry finances most of clinical trials into its own products and much of doctors continuing education that clinical trials are often conducted on small groups of unrepresentative subjects and negative data is routinely withheld and that apparently independent academic papers may be planned and even ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies or their contractors without disclosure bad pharma x xi pick your pill out of a hat economist 29 september 2012 describing situation as a murderous disaster he makes suggestions for action by patients groups physicians academics and industry itself bad pharma xii responding to book s publication association of british pharmaceutical industry issued a statement in 2012 arguing that examples book offers were historical that concerns had been addressed that industry is among most regulated in world and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards abpi statement on ben goldacre s book bad pharma association of british pharmaceutical industry 5 october 2012 p ben adams goldacre takes abpi to task over book snub pharma times 12 october 2012 in january 2013 goldacre joined cochrane collaboration british medical journal and others in setting up alltrials a campaign calling for results of all past and current clinical trials to be reported about alltrials net tracey brown it s time for alltrials registered and reported cochrane library 30 april 2013 british house of commons public accounts committee expressed concern in january 2014 that drug companies were still only publishing around 50 percent of clinical trial results david tovey why public accounts committee report on tamiflu is important for us all huffington post 3 january 2014 p rajeev syal drug companies accused of holding back complete information on clinical trials guardian 3 january 2014 author thumb alt photograph ben goldacre after graduating in 1995 with a first class honours degree in medicine from magdalen college oxford goldacre obtained an ma in philosophy from king s college london then undertook clinical training at ucl medical school qualifying as a medical doctor in 2000 and as a psychiatrist in 2005 as of 2014 he was wellcome research fellow in epidemiology at london school of hygiene and tropical medicine ben goldacre about badscience net goldacre is known for his bad science column in guardian which he has written since 2003 and for his first book bad science 2008 this claims of several forms of alternative medicine and criticized certain physicians and media for a lack of critical thinking it also looked at mmr vaccine controversy aids denialism placebo effect and misuse of statistics ben goldacre bad science harper perennial 2008 goldacre was recognized in june 2013 by health service journal as having done more than any other single individual to shine a light on how science and research gets distorted by media politicians quacks pr and pharmaceutical industry nick black and ben goldacre named among clinical leaders making greatest impact london school of hygiene and tropical medicine 12 june 2013 p clinical leaders 2013 health service journal 14 june 2013 synopsis introduction goldacre writes in introduction of bad pharma that he aims to defend following drugs are tested by people who manufacture them in poorly designed trials on hopelessly small numbers of weird unrepresentative patients and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design in such a way that they exaggerate benefits of treatments unsurprisingly these trials tend to produce results that favour manufacturer when trials throw up results that companies don t like they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug s true effects regulators see most of trial data but only from early on in a drug s life and even then they don t give this data to doctors or patients or even to other parts of government this distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion in their forty years of practice after leaving medical school doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions from sales reps colleagues or journals but those colleagues can be in pay of drug companies often undisclosed and journals are too and so are patient groups and finally academic papers which everyone thinks of as objective are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for companies without disclosure sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company aside from all this for several of most important and enduring problems in medicine we have no idea what best treatment is because it s not in anyone s financial interest to conduct any trials at all bad pharma xi paragraph break added for ease of reading chapter 1 missing data in missing data goldacre argues that clinical trials undertaken by drug companies routinely reach conclusions favourable to company for example in a 2007 journal article published in plos medicine researchers studied every published trial on statins drugs prescribed to reduce cholesterol levels in 192 trials they looked at industry funded trials were 20 times more likely to produce results that favoured drug bad pharma 2 for study he writes that these positive results are achieved in a number of ways sometimes industry sponsored studies are flawed by design for example by comparing new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely in addition data is analysed as trial progresses if trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and results are not published or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer term effects are not examined he writes that this publication bias where negative results remain unpublished is endemic within medicine and academia as a consequence he argues doctors may have no idea what effects are of drugs they prescribe bad pharma 4 7 12 an example he gives of difficulty of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir tamiflu manufactured by roche to reduce complications of bird flu governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this based in large part on a meta analysis that was funded by industry bad pharma charts efforts of independent researchers particularly tom jefferson of cochrane collaboration respiratory group to gain access to information about drug bad pharma tom jefferson et al a review of unpublished regulatory information from trials of neuraminidase inhibitors tamiflu oseltamivir and zanamivir for influenza cochrane summaries 17 october 2012 chapter 2 where do new drugs come from in second chapter book describes process as new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 first in man study phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials phase 1 participants are referred to as volunteers but in us are paid 200 400 per day and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year earning potential becomes main reason for participation bad pharma 104 110 participants are usually taken from poorest groups in society and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations cros rate of growth for clinical trials in india is 20 percent a year in argentina 27 percent and in china 47 percent while trials in uk have fallen by 10 percent a year and in us by six percent bad pharma 113 114 shift to outsourcing raises issues about data integrity regulatory oversight language difficulties meaning of informed consent among a much poorer population standards of clinical care extent to which corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries and ethical problem of raising a population s expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford it also raises question of whether results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere there are both social and physical differences goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in china are really same as patients diagnosed with depression in california and notes that people of asian descent metabolize drugs differently from westerners bad pharma 115 there have also been cases of available treatment being withheld during clinical trials in 1996 in kano nigeria drug company pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that was known to be effective at a higher dose than was used during trial goldacre writes that 11 children died divided almost equally between two groups families taking part in trial were apparently not told that competing antibiotic at effective dose was available from medecins sans frontieres in next door building bad pharma 117 chapter 3 bad regulators chapter three describes concept of regulatory capture whereby a regulator such as medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in uk or food and drug administration fda in united states ends up advancing interests of drug companies rather than interests of public goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons including revolving door of employees between regulator and companies and fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval and difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from market once they have been approved bad pharma he argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available or even that they be particularly effective bad pharma 143ff chapter 4 bad trials bad trials examines ways in which clinical trials can be flawed goldacre writes that this happens by design and by analysis and that it has effect of maximizing a drug s benefits and minimizing harm there have been instances of fraud though he says these are rare more common are what he calls wily tricks close calls and elegant mischief at margins of acceptability bad pharma 171 these include testing drugs on unrepresentative freakishly ideal patients comparing new drugs to something known to be ineffective or effective at a different dose or if used differently conducting trials that are too short or too small and stopping trials early or late bad pharma 176 180 187 191 193 it also includes measuring outcomes packaging data so that it is misleading ignoring patients who drop out i e using per protocol analysis where only patients who complete trial are counted in final results rather than intention to treat analysis where everyone who starts trial is counted changing main outcome of trial once it has finished producing subgroup analyses that show apparently positive outcomes for certain tightly defined groups such as chinese men between ages of 56 and 71 thereby hiding an overall negative outcome and conducting seeding trials where objective is to persuade physicians to use drug bad pharma 194 198 200 212 another criticism is that outcomes are presented in terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate apparent benefits of treatment for example he writes if four people out of 1 000 will have a heart attack within year but on statins only two will that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction but if expressed as absolute risk reduction it is a reduction of just 0 2 percent bad pharma 216 217 chapter 5 bigger simpler trials in chapter five goldacre suggests using general practice research database in uk which contains anonymized records of several million patients to conduct randomized trials to determine most effective of competing treatments for example to compare two statins atorvastatin and simvastatin doctors would randomly assign patients to one or other patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels heart attacks strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records trials would not be blind patients would know which statin they had been prescribed but goldacre writes that they would be unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable to extent that it could affect their health bad pharma 225 227 233 p pieter van ben goldacre et al pragmatic randomised trials using routine electronic health records putting them to test british medical journal 7 february 2012 chapter 6 marketing in final chapter goldacre looks at how doctors are persuaded to prescribe me too drugs brand name drugs that are no more effective than significantly cheaper off patent ones he cites as examples statins atorvastatin made by pfizer and simvastatin which he writes seem to be equally effective or at least there is no evidence to suggest otherwise simvastatin came off patent several years ago yet there are still three million prescriptions a year in uk for atorvastatin costing national health service nhs an annual ps165 million extra bad pharma 243 he addresses issue of medicalization of certain conditions or as he argues of personhood whereby pharmaceutical companies widen boundaries of diagnosis before offering solutions female sexual dysfunction was highlighted in 1999 by a study published in journal of american medical association which alleged that 43 percent of women were suffering from it after article appeared new york times wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for pfizer which at time was preparing to launch uk 414 495 known as female viagra journal s editor said that failure to disclose relationship with pfizer was journal s mistake bad pharma 261 262 p for 1999 study e o laumann et al sexual dysfunction in united states prevalence and predictors journal of american medical association 281 6 10 february 1999 537 544 p denise grady sure we ve got a pill for that new york times 14 february 1999 chapter also examines celebrity endorsement of certain drugs extent to which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced and whether direct to consumer advertising currently permitted in us and new zealand ought to be allowed bad pharma 247 251 271 it discusses how pr firms promote stories from patients who complain in media that certain drugs are not made available by funder which in uk is nhs and national institute for health and clinical excellence nice two breast cancer patients who campaigned in uk in 2006 for trastuzumab to be available on nhs were being handled by a law firm working for roche drug s manufacturer historian lisa jardine who was suffering from breast cancer told guardian that she had been approached by a pr firm working for company bad pharma 254 sarah selling of a wonder drug guardian 29 march 2006 chapter also covers influence of drug reps how ghostwriters are employed by drug companies to write papers for academics to publish how independent academic journals really are how drug companies finance doctors continuing education and how patients groups are often funded by industry bad pharma 274 287 303 311 afterword better data in afterword and throughout book goldacre makes suggestions for action by doctors medical students patients patient groups and industry he advises doctors nurses and managers to stop seeing drug reps to ban them from clinics hospitals and medical schools to declare online and in waiting rooms all gifts and hospitality received from industry and to remove all drug company promotional material from offices and waiting rooms he praises website of american medical student association www org which ranks institutions according to their conflict of interest policies writing that it makes him feel weepy he also suggests that regulations be introduced to prevent pharmacists from sharing doctors prescribing records with drug reps bad pharma 284 286 339 340 amsa scorecard american medical students association he asks academics to lobby their universities and academic societies to forbid academics from being involved in ghostwriting and to lobby for film credit contributions at end of every academic paper listing everyone involved including who initiated idea of publishing paper bad pharma 302 he also asks for full disclosure of all past clinical trial results and a list of academic papers that were as he puts it rigged by industry so that they can be retracted or annotated bad pharma 350 351 he asks drug company employees to become whistleblowers either by writing an anonymous blog or by contacting him bad pharma 363 364 he advises patients to ask their doctors whether they accept drug company hospitality or sponsorship and if so to post details in their waiting rooms and to make clear whether it is acceptable to patient for doctor to discuss his or her medical history with drug reps patients who are invited to take part in a trial are advised to ask among other things for a written guarantee that trial has been publicly registered and that main outcome of trial will be published within a year of its completion he advises patient groups to write to drug companies with following we are living with this disease is there anything at all that you re withholding if so tell us today bad pharma 357 358 reception book was generally well received economist described it as slightly technical eminently readable consistently shocking occasionally hectoring and unapologetically polemical pick your pill out of a hat economist 29 september 2012 helen lewis in new statesman called it an important book helen lewis lies damn lies and drug trials new statesman 4 october 2012 while luisa dillner writing in guardian described it as a thorough piece of investigative medical journalism andrew jack wrote in financial times that goldacre is at his best in methodically dissecting poor clinical trials he is less strong in explaining complex background reality such as general constraints and individual slips of regulators and pharma companies employees jack also argued that book failed to reflect how many lives have been improved by current system for example with new treatments for hiv rheumatoid arthritis and cancer andrew jack extremes of drug development dissected financial times 26 september 2012 max pemberton a psychiatrist wrote in daily telegraph that this is a book to make you enraged because it s about how big business puts profits over patient welfare allows people to die because they don t want to disclose damning research evidence and tricks they play to make sure doctors do not have all evidence when it comes to whether a drug really works or not max pemberton bad pharma by ben goldacre review daily telegraph 22 october 2012 association of british pharmaceutical industry abpi replied in new statesman that goldacre was stuck in a bygone era where pharmaceutical companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing on dotted line dr ben goldacre vs association of british pharmaceutical industry new statesman 19 october 2012 abpi issued a press release writing that pharmaceutical industry is responsible for discovery of 90 percent of all medicines and that it takes an average of 10 12 years and ps1 1bn to introduce a medicine to market with just one in 5 000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval this makes research and development an expensive and risky business they wrote that industry is one of most heavily regulated in world and is committed to ensuring full transparency in research and development of new medicines they also maintained that examples goldacre offered were long documented and historical and companies concerned have long addressed these issues goldacre argues in book that most dangerous tactic of all is industry s enduring claim that these problems are all in past bad pharma 343 humphrey rang of british pharmacological society wrote that goldacre had chosen his target well and had produced some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty particularly nondisclosure of data on antidepressant chapter one in which only one trial out of seven was published published study showed positive results while unpublished trials suggested otherwise he argued that goldacre had gone over top in devoting a whole chapter chapter five to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners without fully pointing out how problematic these can be such trials raise issues for example about informed consent and regulatory oversight rang also criticized goldacre s style describing book as too long repetitive hyperbolic and in places too conversational he particularly objected to line medicine is broken calling it a foolish remark humphrey rang book review bad pharma
