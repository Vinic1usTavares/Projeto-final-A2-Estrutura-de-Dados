delegates securing approval he then immediately replaced stevens with mary nelson winslow stevens did not go quietly and clash continued throughout 1939 with eleanor roosevelt backing winslow and suffragists backing stevens eleanor s objection to stevens was multi faced in that she did not think that equal rights amendment would protect women and on a personal level she believed stevens behaved in an unladylike manner in 1940 stevens was elected to serve on national council of national woman s party following year when alice paul returned from a two year trip to switzerland to

relationship with belmont after paul s resignation in 1945 stevens did not support paul s hand selected replacement anita pollitzer and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for paul and an internal dispute arose over nwp s emphasis on wwp and international rights rather than domestic organizing during these tensions a dissenting faction of nwp members tried to take over party headquarters and elect their own slate of officers but pollitzer s claim to leadership was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge stevens parted ways with nwp in 1947 and turned instead to activity in lucy stone league a women s rights organization based on lucy stone s retention of her maiden name after marriage after world war ii ended
