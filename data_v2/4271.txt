mauna loa or hawaiian is one of five volcanoes that form island of hawaii in u s state of hawai i in pacific ocean largest subaerial volcano in both mass and volume mauna loa has historically been considered largest volcano on earth dwarfed only by tamu massif it is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes with a volume estimated at approximately although its peak is about lower than that of its neighbor mauna kea lava eruptions from mauna loa are silica poor and very fluid and they tend to be non explosive mauna loa has probably been erupting for at least 700 000 years and may have emerged above sea level about 400 000 years ago oldest known dated rocks are not older than 200 000 years volcano s magma comes from hawaii hotspot which has been responsible for creation of hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years slow drift of pacific plate will eventually carry mauna loa away from hotspot within 500 000 to one million years from now at which point it will become extinct mauna loa s most recent eruption occurred from march 24 to april 15 1984 no recent eruptions of volcano have caused fatalities but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages and city of hilo is partly built on lava flows from late 19th century because of potential hazards it poses to population centers mauna loa is part of decade volcanoes program which encourages studies of world s most dangerous volcanoes mauna loa has been monitored intensively by hawaiian volcano observatory since 1912 observations of atmosphere are undertaken at mauna loa observatory and of sun at mauna loa solar observatory both located near mountain s summit hawaii volcanoes national park covers summit and southeastern flank of volcano and also incorporates kilauea a separate volcano geology setting like all hawaiian volcanoes mauna loa was created as pacific tectonic plate moved over hawaii hotspot in earth s underlying mantle hawaii island volcanoes are most recent evidence of this process that over 70 million years has created long hawaiian emperor seamount chain prevailing view states that hotspot has been largely stationary within planet s mantle for much if not all of cenozoic era however while hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic mauna loa is one of five subaerial volcanoes that

december 2017 following pattern of hawaiian volcano formation mauna loa would have started as a submarine volcano gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from sea through a series of surtseyan eruptions about 400 000 years ago since then volcano has remained active with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions including 33 eruptions since first well documented eruption in 1843 although mauna loa s activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor kilauea it remains active structure mauna loa is largest subaerial and second largest overall volcano in world behind tamu massif covering a land area of and spans a maximum width of consisting of approximately of solid rock it makes up more than half of surface area of island of hawai i combining volcano s extensive submarine flanks to sea floor and subaerial height mauna loa rises from base to summit greater than elevation of mount everest from sea level to its summit in addition much of mountain is invisible even underwater its mass depresses crust beneath it by another in shape of an inverse mountain meaning total height of mauna loa from start of its eruptive history is about thumb upright 1 36 snow covered moku aweoweo caldera in 2016 mauna loa is a typical shield volcano in form taking shape of a long broad dome extending down to ocean floor whose slopes are about 12deg at their steepest a consequence of its extremely fluid lava shield stage lavas that built enormous main mass of mountain are tholeiitic basalts like those of mauna kea created through mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust mauna loa s summit hosts three overlapping pit craters arranged northeast southwest first and last roughly in diameter and second an oblong feature together these three craters make up summit caldera moku aweoweo so named for hawaiian aweoweo fish priacanthus meeki purportedly due to resemblance of its eruptive fires to coloration of fish moku aweoweo s caldera floor lies between beneath its rim and it is only latest of several calderas that have formed and reformed over volcano s life it was created between 1 000 and 1 500 years ago by a large eruption from mauna loa s northeast rift zone which emptied out a shallow magma chamber beneath summit and collapsed it into its present form additionally two smaller pit craters lie southwest of caldera named lua hou new pit and lua deep pit mauna loa s summit is also focal point for its two prominent rift zones marked on surface by well preserved relatively recent lava flows easily seen in satellite imagery and linearly arranged fracture lines intersected by cinder and splatter cones these rift zones are deeply set structures driven by dike intrusions along a fault that is believed to reach down all way to volcano s base deep first is a rift trending southwest from caldera to sea and a further underwater with a prominent 40deg directional change along its length this rift zone is historically active across most of its length second northeastern rift zone extends towards hilo and is historically active across only first of its length with a nearly straight and in its latter sections poorly defined trend northeastern rift zone takes form of a succession of cinder cones most prominent of which high puu or red hill there is also a less definite northward rift zone that extends towards saddle marking intersection of mauna loa and mauna kea simplified geophysical models of mauna loa s magma chamber have been constructed using interferometric synthetic aperture radar measures of ground deformation due to slow buildup of lava under volcano s surface these models predict a wide magma chamber located at a depth of about below sea level near southeastern margin of moku aweoweo this shallow magma chamber is significantly higher placed than mauna loa s rift zones suggesting magma intrusion into deeper and occasional dike injections into shallower parts of rift zone drive rift activity a similar mechanism has been proposed for neighboring kilauea earlier models based on mauna loa s two most recent eruptions made a similar prediction placing chamber at deep in roughly same geographic position mauna loa has complex interactions with its neighbors hualalai to west mauna kea to north and particularly kilauea to east lavas from mauna kea intersect with mauna loa s basal flows as a consequence of kea s older age and mauna kea s original rift zones were buried beneath post shield volcanic rocks of mauna loa additionally mauna kea shares mauna loa s gravity well depressing ocean crust beneath it by there are also a series of normal faults on mauna loa s northern and western slopes between its two major rift zones that are believed to be result of combined circumferential tension from two rift zones and from added pressure due to westward growth of neighboring kilauea because kilauea lacks a topographical prominence and appears as a bulge on southeastern flank of mauna loa it was historically interpreted by both native hawaiians and early geologists to be an active satellite of mauna loa however analysis of chemical composition of lavas from two volcanoes show that they have separate magma chambers and are thus distinct nonetheless their proximity has led to a historical trend in which high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at other when kilauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952 mauna loa became active and when latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974 reverse was true this is not always case 1984 eruption of mauna loa started during an eruption at kilauea but had no discernible effect on kilauea eruption and ongoing inflation of mauna loa s summit indicative of a future eruption began same day as new lava flows at kilauea s pu u o o crater geologists have suggested that pulses of magma entering mauna loa s deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside kilauea and triggered concurrent eruptions mauna loa is slumping eastward along its southwestern rift zone leveraging its mass into kilauea and driving latter eastward at a rate of about per year interaction between two volcanoes in this manner has generated a number of large earthquakes in past and has resulted in a significant area of debris off of kilauea s seaward flank known as hilina slump a system of older faults exists on southeastern side of mauna loa that likely formed before kilauea became large enough to impede mauna loa s slump lowest and northernmost of which fault remains an active earthquake center today west side of mauna loa meanwhile is unimpeded in movement and indeed is believed to have undergone a massive slump collapse between 100 000 and 200 000 years ago residue from which consisting of a scattering of debris up to several kilometers wide and up to distant is still visible today damage was so extensive that headwall of damage likely intersected its southwestern rift zone there is very little movement there today a consequence of volcano s geometry thumb right upright 1 6 a view of mauna loa taken from a hill near onizuka center for international astronomy visitor information station at 9 300 ft level of mauna kea mauna loa is tall enough to have experienced glaciation during last ice age 25 000 to 15 000 years ago unlike mauna kea on which extensive evidence of glaciation remains even today mauna loa was at time and has remained active having grown an additional in height since then and covering any glacial deposits beneath new flows strata of that age doesn t occur until at least down from volcano s summit too low for glacial growth mauna loa also lacks its neighbor s summit permafrost region although sporadic ice persists in places it is speculated that extensive phreatomagmatic activity occurred during this time contributing extensively to ash deposits on summit eruptive history prehistoric eruptions thumb right a cinder cone and surrounding flows on mauna loa to have reached its enormous size within its relatively short geologically speaking 600 000 to 1 000 000 years of life mauna loa would logically have had to have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history and extensive charcoal based radiocarbon dating perhaps most extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on earth has amassed a record of almost two hundred reliably dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis oldest exposed flows on mauna loa are thought to be ninole hills on its southern flank subaerial basalt rock dating back approximately 100 to 200 thousand years they form a terrace against which younger flows have since banked heavily eroded and incised against its slope in terms of direction this is believed to be result of a period of erosion because of a change in direction of lava flow caused by volcano s prehistoric slump these are followed by two units of lava flows separated by an intervening ash layer known as pahala ash layer older basalt sparsely exposed on lower southwest rift and younger and far more widespread ka u basalt which appear more widely on volcano pahala ashes themselves were produced over a long period of time circa 13 to 30 thousand years ago although heavy vitrification and interactions with post and pre creation flows has hindered exact dating their age roughly corresponding with glaciation of mauna loa during last ice age raising distinct possibility that it is product of phreatomagmatic interaction between long gone glaciers and mauna loa s eruptive activities studies have shown that a cycle occurs in which volcanic activity at summit is dominant for several hundred years after which activity shifts to rift zones for several more centuries and then back to summit again two cycles have been clearly identified each lasting 1 500 2 000 years this cyclical behavior is unique to mauna loa among hawaiian volcanoes lockwood j p 1995 mauna loa

pp 81 94 between about 7 000 and 6 000 years ago mauna loa was largely inactive cause of this cessation in activity is not known and no known similar hiatus has been found at other hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in post shield stage between 11 000 and 8 000 years ago activity was more intense than it is today however mauna loa s overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over last 100 000 years and volcano may in fact be nearing end of its tholeiitic basalt shield building phase recent history thumb lava fountains and a a channel flow from mauna loa 1984 ancient hawaiians have been present on hawai i island for about 1 500 years but they preserved almost no records on volcanic activity on island beyond a few fragmentary accounts dating to late 18th and early 19th centuries possible eruptions occurred around 1730 and 1750 and sometime during 1780 and 1803 a june 1832 eruption was witnessed by a missionary on maui but between two islands and lack of apparent geological evidence have cast this testimony in doubt thus first entirely confirmed historically witnessed eruption was a january 1843 event since that time mauna loa has erupted 32 times historical eruptions at mauna loa are typically hawaiian in character and rarely violent starting with emergence of lava fountains over a several kilometer long rift colloquially known as curtain of fire often but not always propagating from mauna loa s summit and eventually concentrating at a single vent its long term eruptive center activity centered on its summit are usually followed by flank eruptions up to a few months distant and although mauna loa is historically less active than that of its neighbor kilauea it tends to produce greater volumes of lava over shorter periods of time most eruptions are centered at either summit or either of its two major rift zones within last two hundred years 38 percent of eruptions occurred at summit 31 percent at northeast rift zone 25 percent at southwest rift zone and remaining 6 percent from northwest vents 40 percent of volcano s surface consists of lavas less than a thousand years old and 98 percent of lavas less than 10 000 years old in addition to summit and rift zones mauna loa s northwestern flank has also been source of three historical eruptions 1843 event was followed by eruptions in 1849 1851 1852 and 1855 with 1855 flows being particularly extensive 1859 marked largest of three historical flows that have been centered on mauna loa s northwestern flank producing a long lava flow that reached ocean on hawaii island s west coast north of kiholo bay an eruption in 1868 occurred alongside enormous 1868 hawaii earthquake a magnitude eight event that claimed 77 lives and remains largest earthquake ever to hit island following further activity in 1871 mauna loa experienced nearly continuous activity from august 1872 through 1877 a long lasting and voluminous eruption lasting approximately 1 200 days and never moving beyond its summit a short single day eruption in 1877 was unusual in that it took place underwater in kealakekua bay and within a mile of shoreline curious onlookers approaching area in boats reported unusually turbulent water and occasional floating blocks of hardened lava further eruptions occurred in 1879 and then twice in 1880 latter of which extended into 1881 and came within present boundaries of island s largest city hilo however at time settlement was a shore side village located further down volcano s slope and so was unaffected mauna loa continued its activity and of eruptions that occurred in 1887 1892 1896 1899 1903 twice 1907 1914 1916 1919 and 1926 three in 1887 1919 and 1926 were partially subaerial 1926 eruption in particular is noteworthy for having inundated of a village near destroying 12 houses a church and a small harbor after an event in 1933 mauna loa s 1935 eruption caused a public crisis when its flows started to head towards hilo a bombing operation was decided upon to try and divert flows planned out by then lieutenant colonel george s patton bombing conducted on december 27 was declared a success by thomas a jaggar director of hawaiian volcano observatory and lava stopped flowing by january 2 1936 however role bombing played in ending eruption has since been heavily disputed by volcanologists a longer but summit bound event in 1940 was comparatively less interesting mauna loa s 1942 eruption occurred only four months after attack on pearl harbor and united states entry into world war ii and created a unique problem for wartime united states occurring during an enforced nighttime blackout on island eruption s luminosity forced government to issue a gag order on local press hoping to prevent news of its occurrence spreading for fear that japanese would use it to launch a bombing run on island however as flows from eruption rapidly spread down volcano s flank and threatened ola a flume mountain view s primary water source united states army air force decided to drop its own bombs on island in hopes of redirecting flows away from flume sixteen bombs weighing between each were dropped on island but produced little effect eventually eruption ceased on its own following a 1949 event next major eruption at mauna loa occurred in 1950 originating from volcano s southwestern rift zone eruption remains largest rift event in volcano s modern history lasting 23 days emitting 376 million cubic meters of lava and reaching ocean within 3 hours 1950 eruption was not most voluminous eruption on volcano long lived 1872 1877 event produced more than twice as much material but it was easily one of fastest acting producing same amount of lava as 1859 eruption in a tenth of time flows overtook village of ho okena mauka in south kona crossed hawaii route 11 and reached sea within four hours of eruption although there was no loss of life village was permanently destroyed after 1950 event mauna loa entered an extended period of dormancy interrupted only by a small single day summit event in 1975 however it rumbled to life again in 1984 manifesting first at mauna loa s summit and then producing a narrow channelized a a flow that advanced downslope within of hilo close enough to illuminate city at nighttime however flow got no closer as two natural levees further up its pathway consequently broke and diverted active flows mauna loa has not erupted since and as of may 2018 volcano has remained quiet for nearly 34 years its longest period of quiet in recorded history although not counting minor activity in 1975 mauna loa was inactive for a 34 year period between 1950 and 1984 its recent inactivity is most likely not long term as even a century of low activity is a very short period in mauna loa s several hundred thousand year history hazards mauna loa has been designated a decade volcano one of sixteen volcanoes identified by international association of volcanology and chemistry of earth s interior iavcei as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas united states geological survey maintains a hazard zone mapping of island done on a one to nine scale with most dangerous areas corresponding smallest numbers based on this classification mauna loa s continuously active summit caldera and rift zones have been given a level one designation much of area immediately surrounding rift zones is considered level two and about 20 percent of area has been covered in lava in historical times much of remainder of volcano is hazard level three about 15 to 20 percent of which has been covered by flows within last 750 years however two sections of volcano first in naalehu area and second on southeastern flank of mauna loa s rift zone are protected from eruptive activity by local topography and have thus been designated hazard level 6 comparable with a similarly isolated segment on kilauea although volcanic eruptions in hawai i rarely produce casualties only direct historical fatality due to volcanic activity on island occurred at kilauea in 1924 when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard hawaiian type eruptions usually produce extremely slow moving flows that advance at walking pace presenting little danger to human life but this is not strictly case mauna loa s 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as kilauea s current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start overrunning village of ho okena mauka and a major highway on way there an earlier eruption in 1926 overran village of ho makai and hilo partly built on lavas from 1880 81 eruption is at risk from future eruptions 1984 eruption nearly reached city but stopped short after flow was redirected upstream a potentially greater hazard at mauna loa is a sudden massive collapse of volcano s flanks like one that struck volcano s west flank between 100 000 and 200 000 years ago and formed present day kealakekua bay deep fault lines are a common feature on hawaiian volcanoes allowing large portions of their flanks to gradually slide downwards and forming structures like hilina slump and ancient ninole hills large earthquakes could trigger rapid flank collapses along these lines creating massive landslides and possibly triggering equally large tsunamis undersea surveys have revealed numerous landslides along hawaiian chain and evidence of two such giant tsunami events 200 000 years ago moloka i experienced a tsunami and 100 000 years ago a megatsunami high struck lana i a more recent example of risks associated with slumps occurred in 1975 when hilina slump suddenly lurched forward several meters triggering a 7 2 earthquake and a tsunami that killed two campers at monitoring established on kilauea in 1912 hawaiian volcano observatory hvo presently a branch of united states geological survey is primary organization associated with monitoring observance and study of hawaiian volcanoes thomas a jaggar observatory s founder attempted a summit expedition to mauna loa to observe its 1914 eruption but was rebuffed by arduous trek required see ascents after soliciting help from lorrin a thurston in 1915 he was able to persuade us army to construct a simple route to summit for public and scientific use a project completed in december of that year observatory has maintained a presence on volcano ever since eruptions on mauna loa are almost always preceded and accompanied by prolonged episodes of seismic activity monitoring of which was primary and often only warning mechanism in past and which remains viable today seismic stations have been maintained on hawai i since observatory s inception but these were concentrated primarily on kilauea with coverage on mauna loa improving only slowly through 20th century following invention of modern monitoring equipment backbone of present day monitoring system was installed on volcano in 1970s mauna loa s july 1975 eruption was forewarned by more than a year of seismic unrest with hvo issuing warnings to general public from late 1974 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983 modern monitoring system on mauna loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of gps stations tiltmeters and strainmeters that have been anchored on volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in mauna loa s subterranean magma chamber which presents a more complete picture of events proceeding eruptive activity gps network is most durable and wide ranging of three systems while tiltmeters provide most sensitive predictive data but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation nonetheless a survey line across caldera measured a increase in its width over year preceding 1975 eruption and a similar increase in 1984 eruption strainmeters by contrast are relatively rare observatory also maintains two gas detectors at moku aweoweo mauna loa s summit caldera as well as a publicly accessible live webcam and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging human history pre contact first ancient hawaiians to arrive on hawaii island lived along shores where food and water were plentiful flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source early settlements had a major impact on local ecosystem and caused many extinctions particularly amongst bird species as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland some of this change was caused by use of fire but main reason appears to have been introduction of polynesian rat rattus exulans ancient hawaiian religious practice holds that five volcanic peaks of island are sacred and regards mauna loa largest of them all with great admiration but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from 18th century first compiled in 19th most of these stories agree that hawaiian volcano goddess pele resides in halema uma u on kilauea however a few place her home at mauna loa s summit caldera moku aweoweo and mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on island regardless kilauea s lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to mauna loa led to it being considered an offshoot of mauna loa by ancient hawaiians meaning much of mythos now associated with kilauea was originally directed at mauna loa proper as well ancient hawaiians constructed an extensive trail system on hawai i island today known as ala national historic trail network consisted of short trailheads servicing local areas along main roads and more extensive networks within and around agricultural centers positioning of trails were practical connecting living areas to farms and ports and regions to resources with a few upland sections reserved for gathering and most lines marked well enough to remain identifiable long after regular use has ended one of these trails ainapo trail ascended from village of over in about and ended at moku aweoweo at mauna loa s summit although journey was arduous and required several days and many porters ancient hawaiians likely made journey during eruptions to leave offerings and prayers to honor pele much as they did at halema uma u neighboring kilauea s more active and more easily accessible caldera several camps established along way supplied water and food for travelers european summiting attempts james cook s third voyage was first to make landfall on hawai i island in 1778 and following adventures along north american west coast cook returned to island in 1779 on his second visit john ledyard a corporal of royal marines aboard proposed and receiving approval for an expedition to summit mauna loa to learn about that part of island particularly peak tip of which is generally covered with snow and had excited great curiosity using a compass ledyard and small group of ships mates and native attendants attempted to make a direct course for summit however on second day of traveling route became steeper rougher and blocked by impenetrable thickets and group was forced to abandon their attempt and return to kealakekua bay reckoning they had penetrated 24 miles and we suppose were within 11 miles of peak in reality moku aweoweo lies only east of bay a severe overestimation on ledyard s part another of cook s men lieutenant james king estimated peak to be at least high based on its snow line thumb scottish botanist and naturalist archibald menzies was first european to reach summit of mauna loa on his third attempt next attempt to summit mauna loa was an expedition led by archibald menzies a botanist and naturalist on 1793 vancouver expedition in february of that year menzies two ships mates and a small group of native hawaiian attendants attempted a direct course for summit from kealakekua bay making it inland by their reckoning an overestimation before they were turned away by thickness of forest on a second visit by expedition to island in january of next year menzies was placed in charge of exploring island interior and after traversing flanks of hualalai he and his party arrived at high plateau separating two volcanoes menzies decided to make a second attempt above objections of accompanying island chief but again his progress was arrested by unassailable thickets menzies made a third attempt to summit mauna loa in february 1794 this time botanist consulted king kamehameha i for advice and learned that he could take canoes to south and follow ainapo trail not knowing of its existence beforehand significantly better prepared menzies lieutenant joseph baker and midshipman george mckenzie of discovery and a servant most likely jonathan ewins listed on ship s muster as botanist s l t reached summit which menzies estimated to be high with aid of a barometer consistent with a modern value of he was surprised to find heavy snow and morning temperatures of and was unable to compare heights of mauna loa and kea but correctly supposed latter to be taller based on its larger snow cap feat of summitting mauna loa was not to be repeated for forty years hawaiian islands were site of fervent missionary work with first group of missionaries arrived at honolulu in 1820 and second in 1823 some of these missionaries left for hawai i island and spent ten weeks traveling around it preaching at local villages and climbing kilauea from which one of its members william ellis observed mauna loa with aid of a telescope and ascertained it and kea to be perhaps 15 000 to 16 000 feet above level of sea they did not however attempt to climb volcano itself it is sometimes reported that missionary joseph goodrich reached summit around this time but he never claimed this himself though he did summit mauna kea and describe moku aweoweo with aid of another telescope next successful ascent was made on january 29 1834 by scottish botanist david douglas who also reached summit caldera using ainapo trail by time douglas reached summit environment had put him under extreme duress but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of summit caldera s proportions and record barometric data on its height both now known to be wildly inaccurate douglas collected biological samples on way both up and down and after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples he planned to return to england but instead several months later his body was discovered mysteriously crushed in a pit beside a dead wild boar isidor successfully climbed mauna loa in february 1839 only third successful climb in 60 years wilkes expedition united states exploring expedition led by lieutenant charles wilkes was tasked with a vast survey of pacific ocean starting in 1838 in september 1840 they arrived in honolulu where repairs to ships took longer than expected wilkes decided to spend winter in hawaii and take opportunity to explore its volcanoes while waiting for better weather to continue expedition king kamehameha iii assigned american medical missionary dr gerrit p judd to expedition as a translator wilkes sailed to hilo on island of hawai i and decided to climb mauna loa first since it looked easier than mauna kea on december 14 he hired about 200 porters but after he left he realized only about half equipment had been taken so he had to hire more hawaiians at higher pay when they reached kilauea after two days their guide headed off to established ainapo trail wilkes did not want to head back downhill so he blazed his own way through dense forest directed by a compass hawaiians were offended by waste of sacred trees which did not help morale at about elevation they established a camp called sunday station at edge of forest two guides joined them at sunday station bird catcher and another whose hawaiian name is not recorded called although wilkes thought he was almost to summit guides knew they were less than halfway up since there was no water at sunday station porters had to be sent back ten miles 16 km to a lava tube on ainapo trail which had a known supply after an entire day replenishing stocks they continued up to a second camp they called recruiting station at about elevation after another full day s hike they established flag station on december 22 and by this time were on ainapo trail most of porters were sent back down to get another load at flag station wilkes and his eight remaining men built a circular wall of lava rocks and covered shelter with a canvas tent a snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from altitude sickness that night december 23 snow on canvas roof caused it to collapse at daylight some of group went down trail to retrieve firewood and gear abandoned on trail day before after another day s climb nine men reached rim of moku aweoweo they could not find a way down its steep sides so chose a smooth place on rim for camp site at coordinates their tent was pitched within of crater s edge secured by lava blocks next morning they were unable to start a fire using friction due to thin air at that altitude and sent for matches by this time naval officers and hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters so sailors and marines were ordered from ships dr judd traveled between summit and recruiting station to tend many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on rough rock christmas day was spent building rock walls around camp to give some protection from high winds and blowing snow it took another week to bring all equipment to summit including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity thumb right sketch of moku aweoweo from wilkes journal on december 31 1840 pre fabricated pendulum house was assembled axes and chisels cut away rock surface for pendulum s base it took another three days to adjust clock to point where experiments could begin however high winds made so much noise that ticks could often not be heard and varied temperature to make measurements inaccurate grass had to be painstakingly brought from lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements on monday january 11 wilkes hiked around summit crater using an optical method he estimated mauna kea was higher while modern measurements indicate a difference of about on january 13 1841 he had pendulum peak january 1841 u s ex ex cut into a rock at site tents were dismantled and hawaiians carried gear down over next three days while wilkes enjoyed a hawaiian massage he continued his measurements at lower elevations and left island on march 5 for all effort he did not obtain any significant results attributing gravity discrepancies to tides wilkes expedition s camp site s ruins are only known physical evidence in pacific of u s exploring expedition camp site was listed on national register of historic places on july 24 1974 as site and is state historic site 10 52 historic places in hawaii county on official state web site today a summit shelter was built with some of stones from wilkes camp site and mortar in 1934 in 1916 moku aweoweo was included in hawaii volcanoes national park and a new trail was built directly from park headquarters at kilauea an even more direct route than one taken by wilkes this trail arriving at summit from east via red hill became preferred route due to its easier access and gentler slope historic ainapo trail fell into disuse and was reopened in 1990s a third modern route to summit is from saddle road up to mauna loa observatory which is at elevation a few miles north of moku aweoweo and north pit trail climate trade winds blow from east to west across hawaiian islands and presence of mauna loa strongly affects local climate at low elevations eastern windward side of volcano receives heavy rain city of hilo is wettest in united states rainfall supports extensive forestation western leeward side has a much drier climate at higher elevations amount of precipitation decreases and skies are very often clear very low
