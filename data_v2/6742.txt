orb is an electronic music group founded in 1988 by alex paterson and klf member jimmy cauty beginning as ambient and dub djs in london their early performances were inspired by electronic artists of 1970s and 1980s most notably brian eno and kraftwerk because of their psychedelic sound orb developed a cult following among clubbers coming down from drug induced highs orb have maintained their drug related science fiction themes despite personnel changes including departure of cauty and members kris weston andy falconer simon phillips nick burton and andy hughes paterson has been only permanent member continuing to work as orb with swiss german producer thomas fehlmann and later with martin youth glover bassist of killing joke beyond recognition on their albums and concerts his unauthorised use of other artists works has led to disputes with musicians most notably with rickie lee jones during their live shows of 1990s orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media despite changes in performance method orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert these visually intense performances prompted critics to compare group to pink floyd whose guitarist david gilmour collaborated with them on album metallic spheres in 2010 they released their fifteenth studio album no sounds are out of bounds on 22 june 2018 via cooking vinyl history 1988 1990 paterson cauty alex paterson began his music career in early 1980s as a roadie for post punk rock band killing joke for whom his childhood friend martin youth glover played bass after leaving killing joke in 1986 paterson met future klf member jimmy cauty and duo began dj ing and producing music together under name orb paterson and cauty s first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track tripping on sunshine released on german record compilation eternity project one following year orb released kiss ep a four track ep based on samples from new york city s kiss fm it was released on paterson and glover s new record label wau mr modo records which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels after spending a weekend of making what paterson described as really shit drum sounds duo decided to abandon beat heavy music and instead work on music for after hours listening by removing percussion tracks paterson and cauty began dj ing in london and landed a deal for orb to play chill out room at london nightclub heaven resident dj paul oakenfold brought in duo as ambient djs for his land of oz event at heaven though orb s monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially their chill out room act grew popular over course of their six month stay to point that room was often packed with around 100 people orb s performances became most popular among weary djs and clubbers seeking solace from loud rhythmic music of dancefloor orb built up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer group incorporated many cds cassettes and bbc sound effects into act often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as sueno latino though group used a variety of samples they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted most often group played dub and other chill out music which it described as ambient house for e generation this phrase was printed on reverse of a huge ever growing pulsating brain vinyl single throughout 1989 orb along with martin glover developed a music production style that incorporated ambient music with a diverse array of samples and recordings british music press later labelled music ambient house culmination of group s musical work came toward end of same year when they recorded a session for john peel on bbc radio 1 track then known as loving you was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays nature sounds and minnie riperton s lovin you for its release as a single on record label big life orb changed title to a huge ever growing pulsating brain that rules from centre of ultraworld upon single s release riperton s management forced big life to remove unlicensed riperton sample ensuring that only initial first week release of single contained original vocals of minnie riperton subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound alike despite its running time of 22 minutes sample laden single reached 78 on british singles charts soon thereafter orb were commissioned by dave stewart to remix his top 20 single lily was here group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including erasure and system 7 in 1990 paterson and cauty held several recording sessions at cauty s studio when offered an album deal by big life orb found themselves at a crossroads cauty preferred that orb release their music through his klf communications label whereas paterson wanted to ensure that group did not become a side project of klf because of these issues cauty and paterson split in april 1990 with paterson keeping name orb as a result of break up cauty removed paterson s contributions from in progress recordings and released album as space on klf communications also out of these sessions came klf album chill out on which paterson appeared in an uncredited role following split paterson began working with youth on track little fluffy clouds group incorporated samples from steve reich s electric counterpoint signature of piece centres around repeated phrases sampled from voice of singer songwriter rickie lee jones her spaced out childlike ramble taken from a promotional cd released by geffen records for her 1989 flying cowboys cd in it she muses on picturesque images of clouds from her arizona childhood 1991 1994 paterson weston in 1991 paterson invited freelance studio engineer andy falconer to join orb he was closely followed by studio engineer kris thrash weston steve hillage who paterson had met while dj ing in london also joined as a guitarist along with producer thomas fehlmann orb completed several additional tracks for their first album orb s adventures beyond ultraworld at least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during three weeks of recording falconer s and weston s technical abilities and hillage s guitar work allowed group to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel including launch of apollo 11 adventures sold well in united kingdom and received praise for its balance of ambient music house music and sampling retrospectively adventures is considered ground breaking for changing way musicians view sampling and as a vital work for genres of ambient and dance music completion of adventures saw departure of andy falconer whose last contribution was to one of orb s peel sessions to promote release of an edited single disc version for an american release on mercury records orb embarked on their first tour of united states beginning in phoenix arizona in october 1991 in late 1991 and early 1992 paterson and weston wrote their next single blue room assisting with recording was bassist jah wobble keyboardist miquette giraudy and guitarist hillage despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes blue room entered british charts at no 12 and peaked at no 8 making it longest track to reach charts orb promoted this single with a legendary avant garde performance on top of pops where patterson and weston played a game of chess in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of blue room ran in background in july 1992 u f orb was released featuring blue room and in us release orb s next single assassin weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with paterson s eno influenced ambience on u f orb combining drum and bass rhythms with velvet keyboards and rippling synth lines u f orb reached no 1 on british album charts to shock of critics who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock despite orb s success paterson and weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music to be focus of attention because of this partial anonymity and orb s rotating membership they are often recognised as more of a musical collective than a band over next year and a half paterson and weston continued to produce new material this led to intense disagreements with big life and orb soon left label to sign a deal with island records their first release on island records was live album live 93 which gathered highlights from their recent performances in europe and asia it featured live crew of paterson weston producers nick burton and simon phillips as well as audio engineer andy hughes who had stepped in previously when weston had decided to stop touring orb s first studio production on island records was pomme fritz a chaotic ep noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies though pomme fritz reached no 6 on british charts critics panned it as doodling island records hated it and didn t understand it at all according to paterson soon after production finished on pomme fritz paterson weston and orb contributor thomas fehlmann joined with robert fripp to form group ffwd as a side project ffwd released a single self titled album on paterson s inter modo label which fehlmann later described as an orb track which became so long that it became a whole album due to this aimlessness ffwd lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release soon after release of ffwd in august 1994 weston suddenly left orb paterson claimed that weston s departure was due to his desire to have more control in orb in an interview with i d weston attributed split to paterson saying that paterson didn t do his 50 per cent of work paterson reaffirmed status of orb saying orb is orb and nothing can change that and continued work with hughes and fehlmann 1995 2001 paterson fehlmann hughes following weston s departure from orb thomas fehlmann joined as a full time studio member but did not always participate in live performances paterson hughes and fehlmann then finished producing album orbus terrarum on which paterson and weston had been working orbus terrarum released in 1995 featured more earthbound and organic sounds than their previous trippy science fiction themed music orbus terrarum suffered as paterson described it a good kicking at hands of british press who described it as generic and a low point for paterson s creativity orbus terrarum alienated many of group s fans and reached only no 20 on british charts search for orb albums american critics gave it great acclaim including rolling stone who made it their album of month citing its symphonic flow coupled with orb s uniquely british wit after a long world tour orb with andy hughes and steve hillage settled down to produce their next album orblivion process of which saw a return to their spacey sounds though orblivion was recorded in may 1996 it was not released until almost a year later due to island records desire to promote it as a follow up to u2 s techno rock album pop orblivion sold well in europe as well as united states where it reached billboard top 200 first orblivion single toxygene was highest charting single by orb reaching no 4 in united kingdom on 8february 1997 despite high sales orblivion received a lukewarm reception from british press as with orbus terrarum orblivion was better received by american critics including rolling stone who praised its contrast of chaos and euphony meanwhile stresses of touring sat heavily on paterson he considered retiring orb but continued touring and producing in 1997 band sold their studio joe s garage to godfrey brothers of morcheeba sound on sound morcheeba studio 1997 sue sillitoe morcheeba from clapham to orb sound on sound december 1997 paterson and fehlmann along with usual collaborators hughes nick burton and phillips wrote and produced cydonia for a planned 1999 release featured on album were appearances from robert fripp john roome and fil le one of orb s live performers singers nina walsh and aki omori appeared on two tracks each providing vocals and co writing lyrics with paterson paterson felt that this new direction of songwriting for orb was more similar to experimental work of orbus terrarum than to techno pop of orblivion island records was in a period of restructuring due to its recent purchase by universal music group and cydonia was not released until 2001 upon release critics noted that cydonia merged pop trance and ambient dub music which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked appeal of orb s earlier work nme harshly described it as a stillborn relic flawed throughout by chronically stunted ambitions and describing its only appropriate audience to be old ravers seeking nostalgia orb were generally regarded by british press as past their prime and an ambient dinosaur out of place in current dance music environment after release of cydonia hughes left group for undisclosed reasons becoming another acrimonious departure from orb according to guardian 2001 2004 paterson fehlmann phillips thumb right paterson s record label badorb com had only fourteen releases in its brief existence in 2001 alex paterson formed record label badorb com as an outlet for orb members side projects to promote both badorb com and cydonia orb toured internationally including their first visit to united states in four years nme described orb s tour as charming and that they were freed from pretensions that dogged band throughout mid 90s orb now composed of paterson phillips and fehlmann with guest john roome accepted an invitation to join area one concert tour with moby paul oakenfold new order and other alternative and electronic artists though orb were paired with more mainstream artists during tour such as incubus paterson and fehlmann made their next releases a series of several low key eps for german label kompakt in 2002 orb found critical success on kompakt but badorb com collapsed soon after releasing compilation bless you badorb com had released fourteen records over course of fourteen months from artists including guy pratt conduit ayumi hamasaki and takayuki shiraishi as well as orb s three track daleth of ep though badorb com was an internet based record label they sold only vinyl releases with one exception orb ep which paterson later remarked was a poor idea because not many people have record players though their musical style had changed somewhat since 1990s orb continued to use their odd synthetic sounds on 2004 s bicycles tricycles to mixed reviews daily telegraph praised bicycles tricycles as being inclusive exploratory and an enjoyable journey other publications dismissed it as stoner dub and irrelevant to current electronic music like cydonia bicycles tricycles featured vocals including rapper mc t who added a hip hop contribution to album orb left island records and released album on cooking vinyl and sanctuary records to promote album band began a uk tour with dub artist mad professor though orb still pulled in large crowds guardian noted that they lacked intensity found in their earlier performances 2004 2007 paterson fehlmann transit kings thumb right transit kings performing at fringe festival in dublin after two more eps on kompakt orb now composed of only paterson and fehlmann released okie dokie it s orb on kompakt which featured new material in addition to tweaked versions of their previous kompakt output by this stage allmusic observed thomas fehlmann had become primary creative figure in orb inhibiting alex paterson s whimsical impulses because of this okie dokie was considerably more focused and less goofy than cydonia and bicycles tricycles fehlmann s trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him centre of okie dokie production and according to pitchfork media made it difficult to say where paterson is in picture orb s releases with kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with press and showed that they could age gracefully in august 2006 founders of orb paterson and cauty released living in a giant candle winking at god their debut album as transit kings with guy pratt and pratt s associate dom beken album featured appearances from smiths guitarist johnny marr and comedian simon day beken described living in a giant candle winking at god as self consciously musically written and less sample based compared to members previous work living had been in production since 2001 but due to members other obligations it was delayed for several years album received mixed critical reactions with reviewers such as sun comparing album favourably to music of dj shadow and royksopp while other publications such as times called it orb lite and proclaimed it to be deep forest style sludge soon after album s release cauty left transit kings on extended leave leaving project in indefinite limbo paterson and beken reunited in 2008 as high frequency bandwidth an ambient hip hop group on malicious damage label 2007 present orb s next studio album dream was released in japan in 2007 and following year in united states and united kingdom fehlmann is absent on dream and paterson was instead reunited with martin glover and joined by tim bran of album saw a return to orb s sounds of early 1990s with peculiar vocals and playful samples orb also brought in jazz and house music singer juliet roberts and guitarist steve hillage after july 2006 re release of orb s adventures beyond ultraworld 3 cd deluxe edition 2007 and 2008 saw releases of expanded 2 cd editions of band s subsequent regular studio records u f orb pomme fritz ep orbus terrarum orblivion and cydonia in late 2008

out of bounds during 2019 orb have been touring with a 30 year anniversary tour performed by alex paterson and michael rendall london based producer sound engineer themes and influences inspiration orb s members have drawn from an assortment of influences in their music orb s central figure alex paterson had early musical tastes and influences that included king tubby alice cooper prince kraftwerk and t rex among these paterson cites kraftwerk as one of most important claiming they created foundation from which all modern dance music has been built while in brixton with martin glover as a teenager paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music such as mighty diamonds abyssinians and bob marley reggae influence on paterson and orb can readily be heard in tracks such as single perpetual dawn and u f orb s towers of dub earliest ambient influences of orb came in 1979 during paterson s roadie days with killing joke while with band in neuss paterson listened to brian eno s music for films while on lsd and watched ruhr steel works explode in distance noting that t he scene seemed to be taking place in music as well same night paterson was also inspired while listening to cluster s grosses wasser and found that steel works huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to music which was something he d never seen or heard anything like it before along with cluster and kraftwerk paterson was also influenced by other german experimental music from can and composer karlheinz stockhausen modulations calls paterson s music a maximal version of brian eno s minimal ambience though according to paterson eno resents paterson s use of his music as an influence orb have often been described as pink floyd of nineties but paterson has stated that their music is more influenced by experimental electronic music than progressive rock of 1970s he has noted though that pink floyd album meddle was influential to him as a child in 1970s psychedelic prog rock similarities have led critics to describe orb as hippie revivalists paterson has strongly rejected tag claiming that even as a youth he was one of those punks who hated hippies during production of cydonia and bicycles tricycles paterson s biggest influences were drum and bass and trip hop music as seen on tracks thursday s keeper and aftermath orb s more recent influences consist largely of german techno producers such as triola who were inspired by orb s earlier work paterson cites music of kompakt as one of his primary modern influences and claims it to be among best modern ambient music imagery imagery has always been an important part of orb s persona this is most prominent during live performances where they often project surreal images against onstage screens common images include morphing faces futuristic cityscapes and aliens they have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs this has carried over to their music videos most of which are spacy brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts clouds and neon dolphins because of their use of psychedelic images at shows orb s shows are frequently compared to those of pink floyd who also used in show imagery and films paterson cites godfrey reggio s and philip glass s film koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery orb s album art features much of same imagery as their live act graphic design group designers republic created cover art for earlier work including adventures beyond ultraworld u f orb and singles from those two albums for their next album orb poked fun at their pink floyd comparisons with cover of live 93 featuring a floating stuffed sheep over battersea power station which had appeared on cover of pink floyd s animals artwork found in badorb com releases was similar to orb s odd artwork of mid 1990s as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing science fiction and space some of more prominent motifs in orb s work are outer space and science fiction including alien visitations space flight and mind control these have included use of samples from serious sources such as nasa transmissions to comedic clips from films like woody allen s sleeper u f orb especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in album s title itself title of its most popular single blue room is a reference to supposed blue room of wright patterson air force base which was investigated as a possible ufo evidence holding room their 2001 album is named after cydonia mensae region of mars due to paterson s focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena guardian described paterson as pop music s primary spokesperson on aliens techniques technology live performances thumb left paterson and fehlmann at a 2006 performance at walt disney concert hall in orb s early dj events in 1980s paterson and cauty performed with three record decks a cassette player and a cd player all of which were mixed through an akai 12 track mixer they used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an endless sound continuum for audiences of worn out dancers even after orb began producing original material they kept same sample heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre recorded tracks during promotional tours for adventures beyond ultraworld and u f orb they performed using a digital audio tape machine and experimented with other media sources such as tape machines held individual chords rhythms and basslines for each composition allowing orb to reprocess them and mimic act of dj ing members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect racks often orb had a live musician accompanying them such as steve hillage on guitar their shows in early 1990s would often be three hours of semi improvised continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples voices and pre recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as original piece orb began performing regularly at brixton academy in early 1990s where they used high ceilings and large space for their well suited amorphous sound frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there andy hughes took weston s place at live performances after 1993 tour though weston did reappear for orb s concert at rainy woodstock 94 orb played for late night raves on first two nights of woodstock 94 in addition to artists including aphex twin orbital and deee lite next year orb s touring group consisted of paterson hughes nick burton on drums and simon phillips on bass this live setup created a cacophony of gigantic swarming sounds though orb s performances use much onstage equipment and many props paterson prefers to present them as a non centralised figure of amusement on stage orb used adat recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48 track decks which paterson described as being a studio onstage they hooked synthesisers such as arp 2600 to midi interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums orb s methods of studio music creation changed as well for more recent albums such as cydonia they used inexpensive equipment such as korg s products which paterson described as employing more of a bedroom techno approach despite their use of laptops during performances and in studio computers paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing cds or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying sampling and remixing one of orb s most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring distinction between sampling and remixing albums such as pomme fritz though released as a piece of original work consist largely of manipulated samples conversely orb s remixes typically use only small sections of original track most notably in case of their single toxygene toxygene was originally commissioned as a remix of jean michel jarre s oxygene 8 from oxygene 7 13 orb obliterated it and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix much to chagrin of jarre who reportedly refused to release it orb released track themselves under name toxygene which further irritated jarre to whom paterson retorted french are always five years behind us anyway in statements made after release of toxygene jarre denied that he rejected original remix because of disliking it other artists have become agitated due to orb sampling their work though paterson jokingly suggests that t hey don t know half of it paterson says that he finds a beauty and a cleverness with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it even though fans often try to guess origins of many of samples paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would die if they discovered for example where drums on little fluffy clouds originated from he has said that record labels have cautioned him don t tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared orb have used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from mccarthy era speeches to prank phone calls by victor lewis smith to david thewlis apocalypse driven rant from film naked paterson obtains many samples from recording tv and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favourite clips he and other members of orb record nature sounds for use on albums especially ffwd and orbus terrarum orb s combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a fuzzy texture in sound quality orb s music orb are lauded for their monty python esque levity in their use of audio samples though nme asserts that paterson sabotage s his majestic soundscapes with irritatingly zany sounds orb has been a prolific remixing team having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989 even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo orb found steady work remixing for artists including depeche mode lisa stansfield and front 242 orb s remixes from early and mid 1990s feature a large number of comical samples progressive sounds describe them as ahead of their time and nme notes them as not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling some pieces such as their bee gees cover collaboration with robbie williams received criticism for being beyond a joke for their use of strange noises orb s remix of nine inch nails perfect drug too was described as silly as they made it sound like trent reznor was drowning in his bathtub though paterson maintains that much of orb s remix work is done to support other artists he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so they could pay bills orb s adventures
