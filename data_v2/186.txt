neversoft while game boy advance version was developed by vicarious visions mobile version by jamdat and windows version created by beenox activision which had acquired neversoft in 1999 published all versions of game underground was created with a theme of individuality it stars an amateur skater in a true story mode whereas each previous tony hawk s game had starred professional skaters and had lacked a plot one reason for only allowing player to use a custom character was that certain criminal acts completed in plot would not reflect well on real world skaters previous games in series had included character creation features as well but neversoft expanded customization in underground by implementing face scanning for playstation 2 version if player emailed a photograph of their face to faces com company would digitize it for use in game regarding customization options especially park editor producer stacey stated that neversoft was trying to create most customizable game ever developers used storytelling and exploration to distance their product from plotless task based format of previous tony hawk s games which led neversoft president joel jewett to describe underground as an adventure game design levels in console versions of underground were significantly larger than those of earlier tony hawk s games neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly then shrunk it slightly most of levels were modelled closely after real world locations designers traveled to locales representative of each city in game and took photographs and videos as reference new jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist henry ji had grown up as a young skater neversoft wanted player to become familiar with basic game mechanics quickly and to notice undergrounds differences from previous tony hawk s titles immediately to accomplish this they introduced ability to travel on foot and ability to climb along ledges in first few missions of game while neversoft wanted to keep underground realistic and relatable for most part they added driving side missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games however these missions were intended not to take away from main experience of skateboarding pro skater 4 undergrounds predecessor in tony hawk s series had received criticism for its difficulty neversoft had not realized that each game in series was drawing new fans who were unaccustomed to demanding tasks as a result neversoft added four difficulty settings to undergrounds story mode ranging from too easy to sick neversoft wanted players to develop skills for higher difficulty settings on too easy while still progressing through story company had included extremely difficult missions in each previous tony hawk s game methods used to create these missions were inspiration for undergrounds sick mode development of basic gameplay mechanics and structure began quickly but by end of august 2003 only two months before game s american release work was still in progress while game s cutscenes are animated with 3d graphics team recorded live action videos to introduce real world skateboarding teams so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in skateboarding world then compiled elements of these stories into game s script every skater who appears in plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character promotion and release game was promoted with a playable demo at microsoft s event held at lollapalooza in july 2003 activision stirred up enthusiasm for underground with tony hawk s face off mobile tour a series of promotional events across 29 cities in october 2003 attendees could play game early and compete in it for tickets to boom boom huck jam 2003 which tony hawk himself attended activision which sponsored october 2003 gravity games extreme sports competition promoted game at event and used its rendering engine to model tricks performed by real world skaters console and game boy advance versions were released on october 28 in united states november 14 in europe and may 2004 in japan mobile version was released worldwide in january 2004 reception critical response tony hawk s underground received universal acclaim according to review aggregator metacritic gamezone s michael knutson stated that underground is one of best skating games around and that players of every skill level would enjoy it eurogamer s tom bramwell concurred as a pick up and play sort of game thug is endlessly rewarding once you get your head round basics and it s best entry point for series to date story was well received joe rybicki of official u s playstation magazine celebrated that for first time i can remember an extreme sports game actually has a real story with honest to goodness characters ign s douglas perry called it a kick albeit relatively lightweight in nature he especially praised pervasive sense of humor in narrative and in portrayal of real world skaters knutson called story unique and stated i really like that neversoft had guts to try something this radical and ditch formula that they know works so well ben silverman of game revolution described game s plot as a silly cross between those of 1980s films north shore and gleaming cube but he praised it for giving context to level goals and keeping distance between skill unlocks bramwell called it hackneyed rybicki found that plot hurt game s replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic by contrast game informers justin leeper thought that it serves to make some of less entertaining goals tolerable because there s a reason for doing them game s aesthetics were generally well received bramwell called graphics unchanged and increasingly antiquated and criticized presence of sharp angular character models eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb knutson meanwhile was positive regarding graphics art and animation he called them nearly flawless and praised realism they brought to inherently fantastical skateboarding genre williams said that thugs cityscapes are incredibly well designed and singled out gamecube version of underground as exceptionally well rendered rybicki called levels big and beautiful knutson commended soundtrack s large size and sound effects realism perry appreciated hilariously hurtful injury sounds and extensive song list by contrast ign s craig harris praised graphics of game boy advance version but was more mixed on soundtrack alternate gameplay modes were received very well knutson lauded game s high degree of customization he summarized that everything is expounded a hundred fold from create a skater to create a park mode it is simply amazing he singled out level editor as one of deepest he had ever seen gamespy s bryn williams identified level editor as an extremely well designed feature that contributed to overall brilliance of full product leeper said that each customization mode is intuitive and user friendly and both he and rybicki especially enjoyed trick creation feature reviewers for famitsu magazine praised story mode whose open world format they compared to grand theft auto series knutson and perry enjoyed multiplayer particularly online firefight mode williams thought similarly and stated that most notable disappointment of game was lack of online play for non playstation 2 owners harris found board customization of game boy advance version to be poorly implemented though in depth despite his praise for customization modes leeper admitted that his greatest enjoyment still came from seeking out great lines and beating my scores walking and driving controls were criticized bramwell claimed that these modes felt like they ve been attached with an old stick of glue that s about as adhesive as baby oil knutson agreed though he praised novelty of these diversions he stated that tony hawk series has always had exceptional controls and that underground overall was no exception perry felt that feature increased levels replay value similarly famitsu reviewers noted that although game s fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times high difficulty provides a sense of accomplishment when jumps and tricks are performed correctly williams found gamecube version s controls mediocre albeit manageable damon brown from gamespot stated that mobile version s restrictive controls many tricks require three button inputs were that version s only caveat sales and accolades underground won best sports game at 2003 game critics
