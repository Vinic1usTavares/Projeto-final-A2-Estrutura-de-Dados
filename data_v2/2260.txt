small shelly fauna small shelly fossils ssf or early skeletal fossils esf are mineralized fossils many only a few millimetres long with a nearly continuous record from latest stages of ediacaran to end of early cambrian period they are very diverse and there is no formal definition of small shelly fauna or small shelly fossils almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites since most ssfs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate and this method of preservation is mainly limited to late ediacaran and early cambrian periods animals that made them may actually have arisen earlier and persisted after this time span some of fossils represent entire skeletons of small organisms including mysterious cloudina and some snail like molluscs however bulk of fossils are fragments or disarticulated remains of larger organisms including sponges molluscs slug like halkieriids brachiopods echinoderms and onychophoran like organisms that may have been close to ancestors of arthropods one of early explanations for appearance of ssfs and therefore evolution of mineralized skeletons suggested a sudden increase in ocean s concentration of calcium however many ssfs are constructed of other minerals such as silica because first ssfs appear around same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation it is more likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well defended prey on other hand mineralized skeletons may have evolved simply because they are stronger and cheaper to produce than all organic skeletons like those of insects nevertheless it is still true that animals used minerals that were most easily accessible although small size and often fragmentary nature of ssfs makes it difficult to identify and classify them they provide very important evidence for how main groups of marine invertebrates evolved and particularly for pace and pattern of evolution in cambrian explosion besides including earliest known representatives of some modern phyla they have great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of early cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts history of discovery term small shelly fossils was coined by samuel matthews and v v missarzhevsky in 1975 it is quite a misnomer since as stefan bengtson says they are not always small they are commonly not shelly and term might equally well apply to pleistocene periwinkles paleontologists have been unable to invent a better term and have vented their frustration in parodies such as small silly fossils and small term is often abbreviated to small shellies or ssf great majority of all morphological features of later shelled organisms appear among ssfs no one has attempted a formal definition of small shelly fauna small shelly fossils or other similar phrases specimens and sometimes quite rich collections of these fossils were discovered between 1872 and 1967 but no one drew conclusion that early cambrian contained a diverse range of animals in addition to traditionally recognized trilobites etc in late 1960s soviet paleontologists discovered even richer collections of ssfs in beds below and therefore earlier than those containing cambrian trilobites unfortunately papers that described these discoveries were in russian and 1975 paper by matthews and missarzhevsky first brought ssfs to serious attention of non russian reading world there was already a vigorous debate about early evolution of animals preston cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that process was explosive and and in early 1970s niles eldredge and stephen jay gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium which views evolution as long intervals of near stasis punctuated by short periods of rapid change on other hand around same time wyatt durham and martin glaessner both argued that animal kingdom had a long proterozoic history that was hidden by lack of fossils and occurrence rich collections have been found in china mongolia kazakhstan australia and antarctica and moderately diverse ones in india pakistan iran europe and north america there are different views about time range of ssfs russian discoveries of late 1960s were assigned to tommotian age of cambrian period and for some time term small shelly fauna was applied only to that age on other hand includes in ssf ediacaran fossils like cloudina and post tommotian fossils like microdictyon from maotianshan shales lagerstatte ssfs have been found in layers that also contain fossil trilobites mass extinction at end of cambrian period s botomian age was thought to have wiped out most of ssf with exception of halkieriids and e g mode of preservation small shelly fossils are typically although not always preserved in phosphate whilst some shellies were originally phosphatic in most cases phosphate represents a replacement of original calcite they are usually extracted from limestone by placing limestone in a weak acid typically acetic acid fossils remain after rock is dissolved away preservation of microfossils by phosphate seems to have become less common after early cambrian perhaps as a result of increased disturbance of sea floors by burrowing animals without this fossil forming mode many small shelly fossils may not have been preserved or been impossible to extract from rock hence animals that produced these fossils may have lived beyond early cambrian apparent extinction of most ssfs by end of cambrian may be an illusion for decades it was thought that halkieriids whose armor plates are a common type of ssf perished in end botomian mass extinction but in 2004 armor plates were reported from mid cambrian rocks in australia a good 10 million years more recent than that minerals used in shells small shelly fossils are composed of a variety of minerals most important being silica calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate minerals used by each organism are influenced by chemistry of oceans organism first evolved in but then continue to be used even if ocean chemistry changes for example in ediacaran period and age of cambrian those animals that used calcium carbonate used form called aragonite on other hand animals that first appeared in following tommotian age used another form calcite a recently discovered modern gastropod that lives near deep sea hydrothermal vents illustrates influence of both earlier and contemporary local chemical environments its shell is made of aragonite which is found in earliest fossil molluscs but it also has armor plates on sides of its foot and these are mineralized with iron sulfides pyrite and greigite which had never previously been found in any metazoan but whose ingredients are emitted in large quantities by vents methods of constructing shells vary widely among ssf and in most cases exact mechanisms are not known evolution of skeletons and biomineralization biomineralized no yes skeleton no dickinsonia halkieria sclerites yes kimberella helcionellids biomineralization is production of mineralized parts by organisms hypotheses to explain evolution of biomineralization include physiological adaptation to changing chemistry of oceans defense against predators and opportunity to grow larger functions of biomineralization in ssfs vary some ssfs are not yet understood some are components of armor and some are skeletons a skeleton is any fairly rigid structure of an animal irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is biomineralized although some ssfs may not be skeletons ssfs are biomineralized by definition being shelly skeletons provide a wide range of possible advantages including protection support attachment to a surface a platform or set of levers for muscles to act on traction when moving on a surface food handling provision of filtration chambers and storage of essential substances it has often been suggested that biomineralization evolved as a response to an increase in concentration of calcium in seas which happened around ediacaran cambrian boundary and that biomineralization s main benefit was to store harmlessly minerals that might have disrupted organisms internal processes for example mikhail a fedonkin suggested that an increase in length of food chains may have contributed as animals higher up food chain accumulate greater amounts of waste products and toxins relative to their size and biomineralization may have been a way of isolating excess carbonates or silicates consumed with prey however a skeleton is a fairly expensive way to dispose safely of excess minerals as main construction cost is organic matrix mostly proteins and polysaccharides with which minerals are combined to form composite materials idea that biomineralization was a response to changes in ocean chemistry is also undermined by fact that small shelly fossils made of calcite aragonite calcium phosphate and silica appeared virtually simultaneously in a range of environments organisms started burrowing to avoid predation at around same time jerzy dzik suggested that biomineralization of skeletons was a defense against predators marking start of an evolutionary arms race he cited as another example of hardened defenses from this time fact that earliest protective skeletons included glued together collections of inorganic objects for example early cambrian worm built a tube covered with mica flakes such a strategy required both anatomical adaptations that allowed organisms to collect and glue objects and also moderately sophisticated nervous systems to co ordinate this behavior on other hand bernard cohen argued that biomineralized skeletons arose for engineering reasons rather than as defenses there are many other defensive strategies available to prey animals including mobility and acute senses chemical defenses and concealment mineral organic composites are both stronger and cheaper to build than all organic skeletons and these two advantages would have made it possible for animals to grow larger and in some cases more muscular in animals beyond a certain size larger muscles and their greater leverage produce forces all organic skeletons are not rigid enough to withstand development of modern brachiopods includes a progression from all organic to mineral organic composite shells which may be a clue to their evolutionary development evolution of rigid biomineralized exoskeletons may then have started an arms race in which predators developed drills or chemical weapons capable of penetrating shells some prey animals developed heavier tougher shells etc fedonkin suggested another explanation for appearance of biomineralization around start of cambrian ediacara biota evolved and flourished in cold waters which slowed their metabolisms and left them with insufficient spare energy for biomineralization but there are signs of global warming around start of cambrian which would have made biomineralization easier a similar pattern is visible in living marine animals since biomineralized skeletons are rarer and more fragile in polar waters than in tropics evolutionary significance in some locations up to 20 of cloudina fossils show borings holes that are thought to have been made by predators very similar shelly fossil sinotubulites which is often found in same locations was not affected by borings in addition distribution of borings in cloudina suggests selection for size largest holes appear in largest shells this evidence of selective attacks by predators suggests that new species may have arisen in response to predation which is often presented as a potential cause of rapid diversification of animals in early cambrian thumb 275px stem groups small shellies provide a relatively continuous record throughout early cambrian and thus provide a more useful insight into cambrian explosion than instances of exceptional preservation although most of ssfs are difficult to identify those assigned positions in modern taxa or in their stem groups of evolutionary aunts or cousins enable scientists to assess pattern and speed of animal evolution on strength of small shelly evidence such an assessment shows that earliest small shellies are most basal as time goes on they can be placed in stem group to an ever smaller clade in other words earliest ediacaran small shellies can be tentatively considered diploblastic in other words made of two main tissue layers later shellies are more convincingly triploblastic as all higher animals are subsequently helcionellids are first shelly fossils that can be placed in stem group to a phylum mollusca as one looks at more recent ssfs arguments for stem group placements become stronger and by some ssfs can be assigned to crown group of a modern phylum echinoderms this gives impression that first ssf animals from late ediacaran were basal members of later clades with phyla subsequently appearing in a rapid but nevertheless resolvable and orderly fashion rather than as a sudden jumble and thus reveals true pace of cambrian explosion types of small shelly fossil ediacaran forms few collections of ssf from ediacaran period have a limited range of forms fully and partially mineralized tubes are common and form a really mixed collection structures and compositions of their walls vary widely specimens have been classified as members of a wide range of clades including foraminiferans cnidarians polychaete and pogonophoran annelids and others cloudina s tube which was long consisted of nested cones that were mineralized with calcium carbonate but left gaps between cones sinotubulites built long thin tubes that were more flexible but probably had mineralized ridges namapoikia was probably either a sponge or a coral like organism and built dwellings up to across out of calcium carbonate spicules are spines or star like combinations of spines made of silica and are thought to be remains of sponges namacalathus which may have been a cnidarian closely related to jellyfish and corals built goblet like dwellings with stalks up to long this type of shape is known as a stalked test since test in biology means a roughly spherical shell cambrian forms in finds from early cambrian tubes and spicules become more abundant and diverse and new types of ssf appear many have been attributed to well known groups such as molluscs slug like halkieriids brachiopods echinoderms and onychophoran like organisms that may have been close to ancestors of arthropods a multitude of problematic tubular fossils such as anabaritids or characterize earliest cambrian small shelly fossil skeletal assemblages thumb right 150px fossil of halkieria showing numerous sclerites on sides and back and cap like shells at both ends most of cambrian ssf consists of sclerites fragments that once made up external armor of early animals such as halkieria or scale worms fairly complete and assembled sets which are rare are called scleritomes in many cases body shapes of sclerites creators and distribution of sclerites on their bodies are not known coat of mail generally disintegrated once animal died and its fragments became dispersed and sometimes fossilized reconstructing these elements usually relies upon a fully articulated fossil being found in an exceptionally preserved lagerstatte such discoveries may in turn enable paleontologists to make sense of other similar fragments such as those labelled many sclerites are of type called coelosclerites which have a mineralized shell around a space originally filled with organic tissue and which show no evidence of accretionary growth it is not clear whether coelosclerites evolved independently in different groups of animals or were inherited from a common ancestor halkieriids produced scale or spine shaped coelosclerites and complete specimens show that animals were slug shaped and had cap shaped shell plates at both ends in addition to sclerites produced star shaped composite coelosclerites they are known to have been animals that looked like cacti and have been described as internally like sponges although they may have been more closely related to halkieriids thumb right tiny fossil is thought to be an early mollusc this restoration shows water flowing in under shell over gills and out through exhaust pipe some sclerites are mineralized with calcium phosphate rather than calcium carbonate have a wide range of sclerite shapes and internal structures and may in fact represent a polyphyletic set of lineages in other words they may have independently developed phosphatic scleritomes rather than inheriting them from a common ancestor on other hand they may be closely related to ancestors of modern brachiopods animals that at first sight look like bivalve molluscs but brachiopods stand on fleshy stalks and their internal anatomy is different there is a reconstruction of at some sclerites and small pieces of debris are regarded as remains of echinoderms other phosphatic sclerites include tooth shaped hook shaped and plate like objects mostly of unknown origin however it is known that some including microdictyon were produced by animals that looked like worms with legs and are thought to be close to ancestors of arthropods univalved and bivalved shells are fairly common some cap shaped shells are thought to be only sclerite covering their creators while others are known to be parts of a more complex armor system like halkieria s helcionellids are thought to be early molluscs with somewhat snail like shells some have horizontal exhaust pipes on concave edges of their shells and there is debate about whether these pointed forwards or backwards hyoliths left small conical shells these animals may have been molluscs or worm like sipuncula other molluscan univalved shells have been found in canada some bivalve shells have been found with both parts still joined and include both brachiopods and bivalve molluscs fossils have been found that resemble lids used by snails to close openings in their armor and are attributed to hyoliths small animals that had conical shells and may have been molluscs or worm like sipuncula small arthropods with bivalve like shells have been found in early cambrian beds in china and other fossils represent spines that snapped off bivalved arthropod carapaces post cambrian forms ssfs after cambrian start to pick up more recognizable and modern groups by mid ordovician majority of ssfs simply represent larval molluscs mostly
