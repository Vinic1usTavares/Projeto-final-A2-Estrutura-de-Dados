model was third episode of series directed by jeffrey blitz blitz had previously directed convict and negotiation episode was written by b j novak who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager ryan howard novak was originally going to name episode michael dating but title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with dvrs would have seen it before dinner party aired and deduced that michael and jan s relationship had completely fallen apart for a while parking was going to be title but even that was decided against because that refers to subplot and also because it was generic and boring even by show s no frills titles standard eventually someone suggested chair model which was eventually kept as name originally novak wrote jim putting dwight through a phony management training but nbc pointed out that it felt like writers had done it before even though they had not as a group writers tried to think of a new idea for plot they considered having pam move in with jim but they thought that first two should be engaged ref name npr cite web author dan url https www npr org blogs 2008 05 offices bj novak uncut html title office s bj novak uncut accessdate july 7 2008 work publisher npr date may 12 2008 ref there was an auditioning process for both chair model and young blond woman that michael sees in coffee shop according to novak chair model was supposed to be pretty and perhaps even prettier than your average model but more of just an average single girl because episode is more about michael wanting to start dating again than model herself in scene with five families one of actors paul faust was only first time actor faust is cousin of writer paul lieberstein and had been on a tour of set and talked to many of writers he made a good impression and so character of cool guy paul was based on him day before they were scheduled to shoot show still had not cast anyone for role so they called paul in new york city and had him read lines into a camera and e mail to them in less than an hour faust had landed part and was flown out to los angeles although novak wrote majority of episode jennifer celotta and paul lieberstein were actually ones that came up with graveyard scene in end original song for michael to sing was going to be a parody of candle in wind by elton john elton john however refused to give office permission to use song because 30 rock had requested permission for a parody of candle in wind that offended elton john and he did not want to have his song parodied again so then writers wrote parodies of legs by zz top and ruby tuesday by rolling stones but eventually american pie by don mclean cleared so writers went with that cultural references michael calls oscar martinez oscar nunez an oscar mayer weiner lover a reference to both sausage of same name as well as oscar s homosexuality andy and kevin hold a meeting with head of five families of office building a reference to five families from godfather trilogy michael later tries to call a hot and juicy redhead named wendy but it turns out it was number for wendy s fast food restaurant reception chair model first aired on nbc on april 17

office fans but that he enjoyed entry calling grave scene unexpectedly sweet he also enjoyed maturation of andy describing him as coming into his own and becoming something more than just a foil for dwight m giant of television without pity awarded episode an a buddytv senior writer oscar dahl wrote that office is sharp as ever and jim saying he was going to propose was a big time moment in jim pam story dahl also praised parking lot storyline saying what started as merely a joke kevin was dumped became a feel good moment ign s travis fickett said that michael falling in love with chair model was a hysterical turn and highlights just how deluded michael and dwight can be fickett was critical of parking storyline saying that it was a bit over top and runs a bit thin but he did think that scene at end with kevin was a sweet and genuine moment aubry d arminio of entertainment weekly stated that in relation to previous episode dinner party last night s show took another approach don t get me wrong it was a blinder but a totally different animal so to speak d arminio went on to praise dual plots of episode references external links chair model at nbc com category office american
