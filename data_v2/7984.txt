tennis for two also known as computer tennis is a sports video game which simulates a game of tennis and was one of first games developed in early history of video games american physicist william higinbotham designed game in 1958 for display at brookhaven national laboratory s annual public exhibition after learning that government research institution s donner model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance he designed game displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers in a few hours after which he and technician robert v dvorak built it over three weeks game s visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from side and players adjust angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit ball over net by pressing a button game was very popular during three day exhibition with players lining up to see game especially high school students it was shown again following year with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels it was then dismantled and largely forgotten until late 1970s when higinbotham testified in court about game during lawsuits between magnavox and ralph h baer over video game patents since then it has been celebrated as one of earliest video games and brookhaven has made recreations of original device under some definitions tennis for two is considered first video game as while it did not include any technological innovations over prior games it was first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product rather than for academic research or commercial technology promotion development right thumb 150px frame none reproduced version of game built at brookhaven for game s 25th anniversary in 1958 american physicist william higinbotham worked in brookhaven national laboratory in upton new york as head of instrumentation division higinbotham had a bachelor s degree in physics from williams college and had previously worked as a technician in physics department at cornell university while unsuccessfully pursuing a ph d there he served as head of electronics division of manhattan project from 1943 to 1945 and began working at brookhaven in 1947 which focused on researching peaceful uses of atomic power once a year government research facility held an exhibition for public with one day each for high school students college students and general public exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays with some attempts at making displays with action so for 1958 exhibition higinbotham decided to make an interactive display to entertain visitors while reading instruction manual for one of brookhaven s computers a donner model 30 analog computer he learned that computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories or a bouncing ball with wind resistance and he decided to use this ability to form foundation of a game he later recalled his intentions were that it might liven up place to have a game that people could play and which could convey message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society left thumb 150px modern recreation of controller higinbotham designed a game that used an oscilloscope to display path of a simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from side attached computer calculated path of ball and reversed its path when it hit ground game also simulated ball hitting net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance two aluminum controllers were attached to computer each consisting of a button and a knob pressing button hit ball and turning a knob controlled angle of shot originally higinbotham considered having a second knob to control velocity of shot but decided it would make controller too complicated device was designed in a few hours and was assembled over three weeks with help of technician robert v dvorak while most of circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays circuits to display graphics on oscilloscope used transistors then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in electronics industry excluding oscilloscope and controller game s circuitry approximately took up space of a microwave oven presentation thumb setup for tennis for two as exhibited in 1959 tennis for two was first shown on october 18 1958 game was rendered as a horizontal line representing tennis court and a short vertical line in center representing tennis net first player would press button on their controller to send ball a point of light over net and it would either hit net reach other side of court or fly out of bounds second player could then hit ball back with their controller while it was on their side either before or after it bounced on ground hundreds of visitors lined up to play new game during its debut higinbotham claimed later that high schoolers liked it best you couldn t pull them away from it due to game s popularity an upgraded version was shown following year with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity players could set game to simulate gravity levels of moon or jupiter higinbotham referred to game as tennis for two though a placard attached to 1959 version titled it computer tennis after 1959 exhibition game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses legacy after being dismantled tennis for two was largely forgotten it remained virtually unknown until late 1970s and early 1980s when higinbotham was called on to testify in court cases for defendants sued by magnavox over video game patents of ralph h baer having discovered game lawyers for defense unsuccessfully attempted to have game declared prior art to invalidate baer s patents on television video games resulting in attention being given to nearly 20 year old game as possibly first video game it received further attention as subject of articles in creative computing and video replay in 1982 and 1983 highlighting its possible status as first video game editor of creative computing david h ahl had played tennis for two at brookhaven in 1958 and dubbed higinbotham grandfather of video games higinbotham himself felt that game was an obvious extension of donner model 30 s bouncing ball program and therefore not worthy of patenting or a large part of his legacy he preferred to be remembered for his post world war ii nuclear non proliferation work thumb left 1997 recreation of original tennis for two setup in 1997 a team at brookhaven recreated game for brookhaven s 50th anniversary reconstruction took about three months partially because parts were not readily available this recreation was also displayed at 2008 celebration of 50th anniversary of original game replica implemented an analog computer using solid state operational amplifier devices instead of vacuum tubes as original donner model 30 did in 2010 it was replaced with a restored donner model 3400 analog computer in 2011 stony brook university founded william a higinbotham game studies collection dedicated to documenting material culture of screen based game media and collecting and preserving texts ephemera and artifacts that document history and work of early game innovator and brookhaven national laboratory scientist william a higinbotham who in 1958 invented first interactive analog computer game tennis for two tennis for two is considered under some definitions to be first video game other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include 1947 cathode ray tube amusement device earliest known interactive electronic game though it did not run on a computing device 1950 bertie brain earliest known game to run on a computer though it used light bulbs for a display and oxo and a draughts game by christopher strachey in 1952 earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen tennis for two though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games has distinction of being earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate computing power of underlying machine with exception of non computer based cathode ray tube amusement device this therefore makes tennis for two first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in early history of video games notes references external links video of tennis
