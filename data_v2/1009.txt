kumar majumdar 11 august 1938 20 june 2000 was an indian condensed matter physicist and founder director of s n bose national centre for basic sciences known for his research in quantum mechanics majumdar was an elected fellow of all three major indian science academies indian national science academy national academy of sciences india and indian academy of sciences as well a member of new york academy of sciences and american physical society majumdar was mentor of dipan ghosh with whom he co developed majumdar ghosh model an extension of heisenberg model which improved upon latter and was a protege of walter kohn and maria goeppert mayer both nobel laureates council of scientific and industrial research apex agency of government of india for scientific research awarded him shanti swarup bhatnagar prize for science and technology one of highest indian science awards for his contributions to physical sciences in 1976 biography thumb 235px left presidency college a francis frith image c k majumdar was born on 11 august 1938 in krishnanagar in bengal of british india to sita and nirmal kanti majumdar a political science professor as one of their three sons he and his brothers and mukul did well in their studies he did his schooling at c m s st john s high school in krishnanagar and completed his early college education in calcutta at presidency college and university of calcutta after undertaking postgraduate research at saha institute of nuclear physics during 1960 61 he enrolled at university of california san diego and worked at laboratory of walter kohn who would go on to receive a nobel prize in chemistry in 1998 kohn was his thesis supervisor and their relationship lasted majumdar s lifetime majumdar s research on effect of interactions on positron annihilation in solids guided by maria goeppert mayer who had won nobel prize for physics in 1963 earned him a phd in 1965 and he did his post doctoral work at carnegie mellon university then known as carnegie institute of technology while continuing his work with kohn for a while on his return to india in 1966 majumdar joined tata institute of fundamental research as an associate professor where he stayed until his move to university of calcutta in 1975 in between he had a short stint at university of manchester in 1969 70 working alongside sam edwards at calcutta university majumdar served as palit professor of physics at university college of science technology agriculture and as head of department of magnetism and solid state physics of indian association for cultivation of science iacs carrying out his research at palit laboratory of iacs and at variable energy cyclotron centre when department of science and technology established s n bose national centre for basic sciences snbncbs an autonomous institute for basic research in mathematics majumdar was appointed as its first director in 1987 following a decade of service at snbncbs he retired from official service in 1999 after retirement from regular service majumdar served as a senior scientist of indian national science academy at indian statistical institute but his stint there was he succumbed to a heart attack on 20 june 2000 in kolkata aged 61 he was survived by his wife utpala ghosh whom he had married soon after his return from us in 1968 and their two children and legacy thumb an electrostatic analogue for a magnetic moment majumdar developed methods for measuring magnetic a major turning point in majumdar s career came during his doctoral work with walter kohn in early 1960s austrian born american scientist had already been known in scientific world for his development of luttinger kohn model he would later win 1998 nobel prize for chemistry and his association with majumdar resulted in development of kohn majumdar theorem which explained continuity in a fermi gas in relation to its bound and unbound states they described theorem in an article continuity between bound and unbound states in a fermi gas published in physical review in 1965 later during his days at majumdar guided dipan ghosh on magnetic hamiltonians for latter s doctoral studies together they developed majumdar ghosh model an extension of heisenberg model which serves as a stepping stone to a broader understanding of complex spin models model is detailed in their article on next nearest neighbor interaction in linear chain i published in journal of mathematical physics in 1969 a year later majumdar worked on non debye stress relaxation of glassy systems along with samuel edwards which also resulted in publication of a notable article subsequently he developed methods for calculating effective magnetic moment and physical quantities such as specific heat of finite heisenberg chains his work proved that violation of rules related to non degeneracy and avoided crossing existed thumb 150px left soda lime glass bottles majumdar used scattering theory techniques to study bound magnon states and his findings have since been experimentally verified he modified work of michael r douglas and sam edwards on soda lime glass and proposed a simpler explanation for its time dependent stress relaxation and a formula to assess long time scales with regard to its order of magnitude some of his other achievements include calculation of critical isotherm of lennard jones gas effect determination of fe ii and fe iii ratio determination of critical parameters of gas liquid phase transition ising model of ferromagnetism and development of a theoretical method for measuring fermi momentum of metals his studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and article repository of indian academy of sciences has listed 45 of them majumdar also published two books annihilation of positrons in metals and s n bose man and his work and contributed chapters to books published by others on academic front majumdar was instrumental in modernising physics laboratories at calcutta university he was associated with a number of national and international agencies he was a member of indian national commission for cooperation with unesco and indo us in physics he sat on physics panel of university grants commission as well as commission on higher education in west bengal he served as a member of advisory committees on physics of department of science and technology and council of scientific and industrial research he was editor of indian journal of physics and was a member of editorial board of journal he was associated with conference on observational evidence for black holes in universe held in kolkata in 1998 as a member of its scientific advisory committee he was president of indian physical society 1988 90 and indian centre for space physics 1999 2000 and served as an executive council member of raman centre for applied and interdisciplinary sciences controversy towards end of his career at s n bose centre he faced allegations of misappropriation of funds his mentor walter kohn later argued that allegations stemmed from majumdar s troubled relationship with trade unions of communist party of india when state was run by a left front government led by jyoti basu awards and honours council of scientific and industrial research awarded majumdar shanti swarup bhatnagar prize one of highest indian science awards in 1976 same year he was elected a fellow of indian academy of sciences he received m n saha medal of asiatic society in 1978 and was selected as a national lecturer by university grants commission ugc same year p a pandya award of indian physics association reached him a year later in 1982 indian national science academy insa elected him as a fellow and in 1983 ugc honoured him again with saha award for research in theoretical sciences he received another honour from insa by way of satyendranath bose medal in 1989 he became an elected fellow of american physical society and delivered santanu ghosh memorial lecture of indian science news association calcutta both honours coming in 1991 indian science congress association awarded him satyendranath bose birth centenary award in 1997 he was also a fellow of national academy of sciences india indian physical society and new york academy of sciences indian association for cultivation of science has instituted an annual oration c k majumdar memorial lecture in his honour inaugural lecture was delivered by walter kohn past speakers of lecture include notable names such as michael berry david logan peter littlewood mukunda jainendra k jain and daniel i an issue of physics letters b in 2000 year of his death was published as a festschrift on him to commemorate his 60th birthday an international conference on statistical physics calcutta iii was held at s n bose centre in january 1999 a year after his death indian statistical institute organised a workshop on strongly correlated electron systems to honour his memory selected bibliography books chapters
