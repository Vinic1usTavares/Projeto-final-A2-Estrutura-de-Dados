family he wrote of his first view of valley splendor of yosemite burst upon us and it was glorious one wonder after another descended upon us there was light everywhere a new era began for me his father gave him his first camera during that stay an eastman kodak brownie box camera and he took his first photographs with his usual hyperactive enthusiasm he returned to yosemite on his own next

during 1918 flu pandemic from which he needed several weeks to recuperate he read a book about lepers and became obsessed with cleanliness he was afraid to touch anything without immediately washing his hands afterwards over objections of his doctor he prevailed on his parents to take him back to yosemite and visit cured him of his disease and compulsions adams avidly read photography magazines attended camera club meetings and went to photography and art exhibits he explored high sierra during summer and winter with retired geologist and amateur ornithologist francis holman whom he called uncle frank holman taught him camping and climbing however their shared ignorance of safe climbing techniques such as almost led to disaster on more than one occasion while in yosemite adams had need of a piano to practice on a ranger introduced him to landscape painter harry best who kept a studio home in yosemite and lived there during summers best allowed adams to practice on his old square piano adams grew interested in best s daughter virginia and later married her on her father s death in 1936 virginia inherited studio and continued to operate it until 1971 studio is now known as

he is credited with several first ascents in sierra nevada during his twenties most of his friends had musical associations particularly violinist and amateur photographer cedric wright who became his best friend as well as his philosophical and cultural mentor their shared philosophy was from edward carpenter s towards democracy a literary work which endorsed pursuit of beauty in life and art for several years adams carried a pocket edition with him while at yosemite and it became his personal philosophy as well he later stated i believe in beauty i believe in stones and water air and soil people and their future and their fate during summer adams would enjoy a life of hiking camping and photographing and rest of year he worked to improve his piano playing perfecting his piano technique and musical expression he also gave piano lessons for extra income that allowed him to purchase a grand piano suitable to his musical ambitions adams was still planning a career in music he felt that his small hands limited his repertoire but qualified judges considered him a gifted pianist however when he formed trio with a violinist and a dancer he proved a poor accompanist it took seven more years for him to conclude that at best he might only become a concert pianist of limited range an accompanist or a piano teacher photographic career 1920s pictorialism thumb right lodgepole pines lyell fork of merced river yosemite national park 1921 adams s first photographs were published in 1921 and best s studio began selling his yosemite prints next year his early photos already showed careful composition and sensitivity to tonal balance in letters and cards to family he wrote of having dared to climb to best viewpoints and to brave worst elements during mid 1920s fashion in photography was pictorialism which strove to imitate paintings with soft focus diffused light and other techniques adams experimented with such techniques as well as bromoil process which involved brushing an oily ink onto paper an example is lodgepole pines lyell fork of merced river yosemite national park originally named tamarack pine taken in 1921 adams used a soft focus lens capturing a glowing luminosity that captured mood of a magical summer afternoon for a short time adams used hand coloring but declared in 1923 that he would do this no longer by 1925 he had rejected pictorialism altogether for a more realistic approach that relied on sharp focus heightened contrast precise exposure and darkroom craftsmanship monolith thumb monolith face of half dome yosemite national park california 1927 in 1927 adams began working with albert m bender a san francisco insurance magnate and arts patron bender helped adams produce his first portfolio in his new style prints of high sierras which included his famous image monolith face of half dome which was taken with his korona view camera using glass plates and a dark red filter to heighten tonal contrasts on that excursion he had only one plate left and he visualized effect of blackened sky before risking last image he later said i had been able to realize a desired image not way subject appeared in reality but how it felt to me and how it must appear in finished print one biographer calls monolith adams s most significant photograph because extreme manipulation of tonal values was a departure from all previous photography adams s concept of visualization which he first defined in print in 1934 became a core principle in his photography adams s first portfolio was a success earning nearly 3 900 with sponsorship and promotion of bender soon he received commercial assignments to photograph wealthy patrons who bought his portfolio he also began to understand how important it was that his carefully crafted photos were reproduced to best effect at bender s invitation he joined roxburghe club an association devoted to fine printing and high standards in book arts he learned much about printing techniques inks design and layout which he later applied to other projects adams married virginia best in 1928 after a pause from 1925 to 1926 during which he had brief relationships with various women newlyweds moved in with his parents to save expenses following year they had a home built next door and connected it to older house by a hallway 1930s pure photography thumb alt a black and

of photograph close up of leaves in glacier national park 1942 between 1929 and 1942 adams s work matured and he became more established 1930s were a particularly experimental and productive time for him he expanded technical range of his works emphasizing detailed close ups as well as large forms from mountains to factories bender took adams on visits to taos new mexico where adams met and made friends with poet robinson jeffers artists john marin and georgia o keeffe and photographer paul strand his talkative high spirited nature combined with his excellent piano playing made him popular among his artist friends his first book taos pueblo was published in 1930 with text by writer mary hunter austin strand proved especially influential adams was impressed by simplicity and detail of strand s negatives which showed a style that ran counter to soft focus impressionistic pictorialism still popular at time strand shared secrets of his technique with adams and convinced him to pursue photography fully one of strand s suggestions that adams adopted was to use glossy paper to intensify tonal values adams put on his first solo museum exhibition pictorial photographs of sierra nevada mountains by ansel adams at smithsonian institution in 1931 it featured 60 prints taken in high sierra and canadian rockies he received a favorable review from washington post his photographs are like portraits of giant peaks which seem to be inhabited by mythical gods despite his success adams felt that he was not yet up to standards of strand he decided to broaden his subject matter to include still life and close up photos and to achieve higher quality by visualizing each image before taking it he emphasized use of small apertures and long exposures in natural light which created sharp details with a wide range of distances in focus as demonstrated in rose and driftwood 1933 one of his finest still life photographs in 1932 adams had a group show at m h de young museum with imogen cunningham and edward weston and they soon formed group f 64 which espoused pure or straight photography over pictorialism being a very small aperture setting that gives great depth of field group s manifesto stated pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of technique composition or idea derivative of any other art form imitating example of photographer alfred stieglitz adams opened his own art and photography gallery in san francisco in 1933 he also began to publish essays in photography magazines and wrote his first instructional book making a photograph in 1935 sierra nevada during summers adams often participated in sierra club high trips outings as a paid photographer for group and rest of year a core group of club members socialized regularly in san francisco and berkeley in 1933 his first child michael was born followed by anne two years later during 1930s adams began to deploy his photographs in cause of wilderness preservation he was inspired partly by increasing incursion into yosemite valley of commercial development including a pool hall bowling alley golf course shops and automobile traffic he created limited edition book sierra nevada john muir trail in 1938 as part of sierra club s efforts to secure designation of kings canyon as a national park this book and his testimony before congress played a vital role in success of that effort and congress designated kings canyon as a national park in 1940 thumb georgia o keeffe and orville cox canyon de chelly national monument arizona 1937 alt a black and white photograph shows georgia o keeffe and orville cox wearing hats with sky and clouds behind them in 1935 adams created many new photographs of sierra nevada and one of his most famous clearing winter storm depicted entire yosemite valley just as a winter storm abated leaving a fresh coat of snow he gathered his recent work and had a solo show at stieglitz s an american place gallery in new york in 1936 exhibition proved successful with both critics and buying public and earned adams strong praise from revered stieglitz following year negative for clearing winter storm was almost destroyed when darkroom in yosemite caught fire with help of edward weston and charis wilson weston s future wife adams put out fire but thousands of negatives including hundreds that had never been printed were lost desert southwest in 1937 adams o keeffe and friends organized a month long camping trip in arizona with orville cox head wrangler at ghost ranch as their guide both artists created new work during this trip adams made a candid portrait of o keeffe with cox on rim of canyon de chelly adams once remarked some of my best photographs have been made in and on rim of that canyon their works set in desert southwest are often published and exhibited together during rest of 1930s adams took on many commercial assignments to supplement income from struggling best s studio he depended on such assignments financially until 1970s some of his clients included kodak fortune magazine pacific gas and electric company at t and american trust company he photographed timothy l pflueger s new patent leather bar for st francis hotel in 1939 same year he was named an editor of u s camera travel most popular photography magazine at that time 1940s thumb left adams in 1940 adams created a pageant of photography largest and most important photography show in west to date attended by millions of visitors with his wife adams completed a children s book and very successful illustrated guide to yosemite valley

center school of los angeles now known as art center college of design mural project in 1941 adams contracted with department of interior doi to make photographs of national parks indian reservations and other locations managed by department for use as mural sized prints to decorate department s new building contract was for 180 days adams set off on a road trip with his friend cedric and his son michael intending to combine work on mural project with commissions for u s potash company and standard oil with some days reserved for personal work while in new mexico for project adams photographed a scene of moon rising above a modest village with snow covered mountains in background under a dominating black sky photograph is one of his most famous and is named moonrise hernandez new mexico adams s description in his later books of how it was made probably enhanced photograph s fame light on crosses in foreground was rapidly fading and he could not find his exposure meter however he remembered luminance of moon and used it to calculate proper exposure adams s earlier account was less dramatic stating simply that photograph was made after sunset with exposure determined using his weston master meter however exposure was actually determined foreground was underexposed highlights in clouds were quite dense and negative proved difficult to print initial publication of moonrise was in u s camera 1943 annual after being selected by photo judge for u s camera edward steichen this gave moonrise an audience before its first formal exhibition at museum of modern art in 1944 over nearly 40 years adams re interpreted image his most popular by far using latest darkroom equipment at his disposal making over 1 369 unique prints mostly in 16 by 20 format many of prints were made during 1970s with their sale finally giving adams financial independence from commercial projects total value of these original prints exceeds 25 000 000 highest price paid for a single print of moonrise reached 609 600 at a 2006 sotheby s auction in new york mural project ended on june 30 1942 and because of world war murals were never created adams sent a total of 225 small prints to doi but held on to 229 negatives these include many famous images such as tetons and snake river although they were legally property of u s government he knew that national archives did not take proper care of photographic material and used various to evade queries ownership of one image in particular has attracted interest moonrise although adams kept meticulous records of his travel and expenses he was less disciplined about recording dates of his images and he neglected to note date of moonrise but position of moon allowed image to be eventually dated from astronomical calculations and in 1991 dennis di of sky telescope determined that moonrise was made on november 1 1941 since this was a day for which he had not billed department image belonged to adams world war ii thumb farm farm

valley at base of mount williamson resulting photo essay first appeared in a museum of modern art exhibit and later was published as born free and equal story of loyal japanese americans upon its release book was met with some distressing resistance and was rejected by many as disloyal this work was a significant departure stylistically and philosophically from work for which adams is generally known he also contributed to war effort by doing many photographic assignments for military including making prints of secret japanese installations in aleutians in 1943 adams had a camera platform mounted on his station wagon to afford him a better vantage point over immediate foreground and a better angle for expansive backgrounds most of his landscapes from that time forward were made from roof of his car rather than from summits reached by rugged hiking as in his earlier days adams was recipient of three guggenheim fellowships during his career first being awarded in 1946 to photograph every national park at that time there were 28 national parks and adams photographed 27 of them missing only everglades national park in florida this series of photographs produced

images 1985 p 5 love that americans poured out for work and person of ansel adams during his old age and that they have continued to express with undiminished enthusiasm since his death is an

in these places tetons and snake river 1942 romantic landscape artists albert bierstadt and thomas moran portrayed grand canyon and yosemite during 19th century followed by photographers carleton watkins eadweard muybridge and george fiske adams s work is distinguished from theirs by his interest in transient and ephemeral he photographed at varying times of day and of year capturing landscape s changing light and atmosphere his grand highly detailed images originated in his interest in natural environment his black and white photographs were not pure documents but reflected a sublime experience of nature as a spiritual place with increasing environmental degradation in west during 20th century his photos show a commitment to conservation art critic john szarkowski wrote ansel adams attuned himself more precisely than any photographer before him to a visual understanding of specific quality of light that fell on a specific place at a specific moment for adams natural landscape is not a fixed and solid sculpture but an insubstantial image as transient as light that continually redefines it this sensibility to specificity of light was motive that forced adams to develop his legendary photographic technique in 1955 edward steichen selected adams s mount williamson for world touring museum of modern art exhibition family of man which was seen by nine million visitors at his was largest print in exhibition presented floor to ceiling in a prominent position as backdrop to section relationships sollors werner 2018 family of man looking at photographs now and remembering a visit in 1950s in as a reminder of essential reliance of humanity on soil however despite its striking and prominent display adams expressed displeasure at gross enlargement and poor quality of print group f 64 in 1932 adams helped form anti pictorialist group f 64 a loose and relatively short lived association of like minded straight or pure photographers on west coast whose members included edward weston and imogen cunningham modernist group favoured sharp focus f 64 being a very small aperture setting that gives great depth of field on large format view cameras contact printing precisely exposed images of natural forms and found objects and use of entire tonal range of a photograph adams wrote group s manifesto for their exhibition at de young museum group 64 limits its members and invitational names to those workers who are striving to define photography as an art form by a simple and direct presentation through purely photographic methods group will show no work at any time that does not conform to its standards of pure photography pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of technique composition or ideas derivative of any other art form production of pictorialist on other hand indicates a devotion to principles of art which are directly related to painting and graphic arts members of group 64 believe that photography as an art form must develop along lines defined by actualities and limitations of photographic medium and must always remain independent of ideological conventions of art and aesthetics that are reminiscent of a period of culture antedating growth of medium itself f 64 school met with opposition from particularly william mortensen who called their work hard and brittle adams disliked work of mortensen and disliked him personally referring to him as anti christ purists were friends with prominent historians and their influence led to exclusion of mortensen from histories of photography adams later developed this purist approach into zone system zone system thumb upright 1 75 alt a black and white photograph shows a large still lake extending horizontally off frame and halfway up vertically

mcdonald lake glacier national park 1942 while adams and portrait photographer fred archer were teaching at art center school in los angeles around 1939 1940 they developed zone system for managing photographic process which was based on study of light sensitivity of photographic materials and relationship between exposure time and resulting density on a negative zone system provides a calibrated scale of brightness from zone 0 black through shades of gray to zone x white photographer can take light readings of key elements in a scene and use zone system to determine how film must be exposed and developed to achieve desired brightness or darkness although it originated for black and white sheet film zone system is also applicable to roll film both black and white and color negative and reversal and to digital photography photography department at in 1940 with trustee david h mcalpin and curator beaumont newhall adams helped establish photography department at museum of modern art moma in new york was first major american art museum to establish a photography department adams acted as mcalpin and newhall s primary advisor and peter chief curator of department in later years said adams s dedication and boundless energy were vital to creation of department and to its programs in its early years for those who had sought institutional recognition for photography founding of department was an important moment marking medium s recognition as a subject equal to painting and sculpture on december 31 1940 department opened its first exhibition sixty photographs a survey of camera esthetics which resembled large survey exhibitions that adams and newhall had previously mounted independently exhibition took aesthetic quality as a guiding principle a philosophy that ran counter to that of many writers and critics who argued that medium s more vernacular use as a means of communication should be more fully represented photographer ralph steiner writing for pm remarked on whole it moma seems to regard photography as soft music at high tea rather than as a jazz at a beefsteak supper tom maloney publisher of u s camera wrote that exhibition was very choice very pristine very small very ultra according to newhall exhibition was meant to showcase artistic excellence and not to define but to suggest possibilities of photographic vision environmental protection in his autobiography adams expressed his concern about americans loss of connection to nature in course of industrialization and exploitation of land s natural resources he stated we all know tragedy of cruel unforgivable of soil depletion of fish or game and shrinking of noble forests and we know that such catastrophes shrivel spirit of people wilderness is pushed back man is

black and white photography which he believed could be manipulated to produce a wide range of bold expressive tones and he felt constricted by rigidity of color process most of his color work was done
