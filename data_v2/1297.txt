canadian horse is a horse breed from canada it is a strong well muscled breed of horse usually dark in colour horses are generally used for riding and driving descended from draft and light riding horses imported to canada in late 1600s it was later crossed with other british and american breeds during 18th century canadian horse spread throughout northeastern us where it contributed to development of several horse breeds during peak popularity of breed three subtypes could be distinguished a draft horse type a trotting type and a pacing type thousands of horses were exported in 19th century many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in american civil war these exports decreased purebred canadian population almost to point of extinction prompting formation of a studbook and passage of a law against further export experimental breeding programs in early 20th century succeeded in re establishing breed to some extent but mechanization combined with two world wars again resulted in breed almost becoming extinct in 1980s concerned with declining population numbers interested breeders undertook a promotional program which resulted in renewed interest in breed by 1990s population numbers were higher and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed however livestock conservation organizations still consider breed to be at risk due to low population numbers breed characteristics most canadian horses are dark coloured black bay or brown a few chestnuts are found occasionally with manes and tails and cream gene appears in breed as result of genetic influence of one stallion while some sources state that gene for grey is no longer found in breed after genetic bottleneck of late 20th century preservation society for breed states that they can be rarely grey their height averages and stallions average in weight while mares weigh canadian horse has a rather short high set head with a broad forehead neck is arched and graceful and chest back and loins broad and strongly muscled shoulders and croup are sloping with a relatively high set tail overall breed gives impression of strength and agility their heavy and wavy mane and tail arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of andalusian and barb ancestry their trot is described as flashy they are hardy horses and easy keepers today most canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses and are known for their jumping ability they are seen in competition in almost every discipline as well as for leisure riding they can also be found in light draft work trail riding and working as a stock horse unlike most breeds there is a set naming system that is used to identify individuals based on registration format employed by canadian livestock records corporation first comes prefix farm or breeding establishment of which foal was born into followed by sire s name and lastly given name for foal each year a different letter is assigned to begin given name for foal and it is by year s letter that foal is named some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred canadian lines originally horses were tattooed with identification numbers but now is identification technology chosen by breed registry history left thumb 200px a canadian horse canadian horse descended from french stock louis xiv sent to canada in late 17th century initial shipment in 1665 consisted of two stallions and twenty mares from royal stables in normandy and brittany centre of french horse breeding only 12 of 20 mares survived trip two more shipments followed one in 1667 of 14 horses mostly mares but with at least one stallion and one in 1670 of 11 mares and a stallion shipments included a mix of draft horses and light horses latter of which included both pacing and trotting horses exact origins of all horses are unknown although shipments probably included bretons normans arabians andalusians and barbs horses were leased to gentleman farmers or religious orders for money or in exchange for a foal and they remained property of king for three years despite poor conditions and hard work horses thrived in canada and were given nicknames that included little iron horse and horse of steel population numbers rose quickly from early stock with 148 horses by 1679 218 horses by 1688 684 by 1698 and by 1709 enough that government limited farmers to owning two horses and a foal with additional horses to be slaughtered although this law was a failure in terms of enforcement during 1700s french canadian horse spread through what is now eastern michigan and illinois in united states and lived a generally feral existence with many escaping human control completely during expulsion of acadians in mid 18th century english seized livestock of acadians including horses some of these animals were transported to sable island where their descendants became sable island horse in late 18th century imported horses from us and british isles were crossbred with existing canadian stock by 19th century they were found performing light draft work as well as riding and driving duties cornelius a 19th century canadian painter was known for his works featuring canadian horse who he usually showed in association with french habitants as opposed to english settlers in area his paintings generally portrayed canadian horse in a utilitarian workhorse role often in winter scenes in 1849 there were estimated to be more than 150 000 canadian horses and many were exported from canada annually some were shipped to west indies where they possibly contributed to gaited breeds such as paso fino by middle of 19th century canadian horses had spread through northeastern us where they were used for racing as roadsters and due to their stamina to pull freight wagons and stagecoaches many played a role in development of other breeds including morgan horse american saddlebred and standardbred although used extensively in us no efforts were made to establish a purebred population studbook or breed association in that country thousands of horses imported to us from canada were used as artillery and cavalry horses in american civil war where many were killed one equine historian states that canadian horse played a major role in history of that war it has even been said that north won simply on fact that its soldiers had better horse canadian by 1880 through exports and war casualties canadian horses had almost become extinct in 1885 canadian horse breeders association was formed to inspect and approve breeding stock with aim of creating a studbook for breed and in 1886 further export from canada was forbidden by quebec law in 1913 an experimental breeding program was begun at cap rouge by canadian government program s goal was to breed larger horses that retained endurance and vitality for which breed was known and succeeded in increasing size of stallions to high and in weight with mares slightly smaller however mechanization combined with world war i and world war ii ended federal breeding program and in 1940 all breeding stock was sold at auction however province of quebec re established program at program lasted there until 1979 when herd was again disbanded and sold at auction 1970s to present by 1970s popularity of breed had decreased significantly and there were approximately 400 canadian horses worldwide with only around five annual registrations between 1970 and 1974 several interested breeders began a campaign of preservation and promotion which resulted in a canadian team winning 1987 north american driving championships popularity began to increase and by mid 1990s population numbers were between 2 500 and 3 000 and livestock conservancy which had classified breed as critical changed its designation to rare with increase in popularity came pressure for breed standard to change to meet modern show and market trends by breeding for taller horses with more refinement in 2002 canadian horse heritage and preservation society was formed in response to these pressures with a goal of preserving original canadian horse type canadian horse breeders association remains official registering body for canadian horse as governed by canadian federal animal pedigree act with responsibility to monitor registration identification and keeping of stud book for canadian horses it is also responsible for inspecting breeding stock before they are registered with studbook studbook is maintained by canadian livestock records corporation since beginning of studbook there have been over 13 600 horses registered in 2012 208 new horses were registered mainly in quebec livestock conservancy still considers breed to be threatened a designation given to breeds with a global population of less than 5 000 and annual us registrations of fewer than 1 000 rare breeds canada considers breed to be at risk with fewer than 500 annual registrations of female breeding stock in a study of mitochondrial dna published in 2012 canadian horse and newfoundland pony were found to be most genetically diverse of canadian breeds studied which also included sable island horse and lac la croix pony canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity sharing haplotypes with all canadian populations as well as draft breeds nordic pony breeds and british mountain and moorland pony breeds also tested in study canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds including percheron belgian and clydesdale in previous microsatellite loci studies this relationship was supported by findings in 2012 study high levels of diversity in canadian horse supported conclusions of a 1998 study which determined that small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation 1998 paper also stated that canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other more popular breeds canadian horse is a common animal symbol of canada in 1909 parliament of canada declared it national breed of country and in 2002 was made an official animal symbol of canada by parliamentary act in 2010 provincial legislature of quebec named it a heritage breed of province sub types during peak popularity of breed three main types could be distinguished all three are now considered extinct having disappeared or been merged back into main canadian horse population first canadian heavy draft or st lawrence which disappeared by late 1700s probably developed from shire and clydesdale crosses they were probably a popular export to new england which bred large numbers of horses for caribbean plantations second sometimes also called st lawrence was a trotting horse known for its power and speed resulting from crosses with thoroughbreds mixed with french trotting lines they played a role in development of us trotting horses canadian pacer thumb right an american saddlebred a descendant of canadian pacer in early 1900s third type was canadian pacer which was historically better documented than other two types canadian pacers were likely result of breeding pacing horses imported from france with narragansett pacers from new england resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice from there they were exported to united states where north carolina became a breeding centre later exporting them to tennessee in late 1700s pedigrees were not maintained so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace canadian pacer influenced tennessee walker american saddlebred and standardbred commonly called canucks fastest members of breed came from quebec near st lawrence river racing began in this area during long severe winters when sunday races after attending church for mass became common eventually these races became large enough to endanger church going populace and races were banned within a certain distance of churches they instead moved to local rivers whose smooth frozen surfaces provided useful raceways and resulting contests drew attention to pacers from quebec several horses imported to united states from canada had a lasting impact on american horse breeding in early 1800s a roan coloured stallion named copperbottom was imported to lexington kentucky from quebec through michigan he began to be offered for stud service in 1816 and his progeny spread throughout eastern us known mainly as saddle stock they also included several pacing horses another roan stallion tom hal a successful pacer in his own right founded an important family of pacers in us appearing in kentucky in 1824 he was offered for stud and his offspring many of whom carried on family name being differentiated only by name of owner began family of standardbreds that included little brown jug brown hal star pointer adios and good time all champion harness racing horses another pacing import to us was a black stallion named old pilot said to have been bred near montreal who originated pilot family of trotting horses old pilot produced a son also named pilot who was acclaimed as a sire of trotting horses as well as being a successful harness horse himself references external links canadian horse breeders association
