beneath nintendo 64 development of mother 3 began in 1994 as a game for super famicom with shigeru miyamoto and satoru iwata as producers team mostly consisted of members involved in development of earthbound inspired by nintendo 64 launch title super mario 64 development team transitioned from super famicom to newer console believing that they could also creatively flourish by making a 3d world without technical restrictions however their early specifications exceeded capabilities and memory limits of console halfway through development team scaled back its large scope and changed platform to 64dd a nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that was later released only in japan in 1999 mother 3 was expected to be a launch title for peripheral but development shifted back to nintendo 64 after 64dd was considered a commercial failure a demo of mother 3 was showcased at 1999 nintendo space world trade show game was expected to be released in north america under title earthbound 64 and game was also stated to be released on a 256 megabit cartridge similar to legend of zelda ocarina of time ign reacted favorably to demo and compared multi character narrative to japan only super famicom rpg live a live and famitsu readers ranked game as one of their top ten most anticipated towards end of 1999 shigesato itoi announced in late august 2000 that mother 3 was cancelled following a number of delays iwata and miyamoto clarified in an interview that resources had been moved to development of gamecube next nintendo console itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish game which was 30 complete at time of cancellation iwata stated retrospectively that focus on 3d graphics made project overly complex miyamoto also stated that mother franchise was not abandoned and that he was still interested in bringing game to fruition mother 3 was later announced in 2003 to have restarted development for game boy advance handheld console in a japanese commercial for mother 1 2 itoi had earlier assumed that restarting project was impossible but later decided to continue following encouragement from mother fanbase nintendo subsidiary brownie brown developed game with input from itoi while graphics were changed from 3d to 2d game s original story was not altered mother 3 was about 60 complete by july 2004 and was released on april 20 2006 in japan design thumb 350px flint in an inn setting as compared between nintendo 64 and game boy advance versions itoi thought of concept behind mother 3 towards end of mother 2 production a detective story where city was main character he thought of a hack small time womanizing private investigator who would become engrossed in a big murder case and story would unfold from a young female clerk at a flower shop who would slowly recall parts of a story consequential to plot thus city would appear to grow this idea of a single place changing over time was central to mother 3 unlike previous rpgs which he saw as road movies with little reason to revisit he wanted player to see town gossip grow dynamically it was enough of a departure from series that development team questioned whether fans would consider it part of series itoi intended game to have 12 chapters with various game mechanics and rotating player characters he conceptualized development as moving 3d puppets before realizing degree of programming required as development wore on itoi reduced scope of chapters until seven or nine were left uncomfortable beauty of chimera multiple creatures fused into one was central to game and idea behind metallic and wooden mother 3 logo itoi served less of a manager role and more as a team member and scriptwriter than in previous mother development cycles he saw himself as simultaneously making game he wanted to play and setting traps for player and as making a game nintendo could not itoi chose to use pixelated style of mother 2 for game boy advance mother 3 because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends series games were written in hiragana alphabet instead of in kanji chinese characters so as to remain accessible to young children itoi described game world as governed by a might equals right macho power struggle antagonist porky was designed as a symbol of humankind complementing itoi s view of evil on a fungible morality spectrum with pranks and crimes at its extremes itoi compared way in which characters realize their psychic powers with menstruation and added that human physiology was one of his themes players sweat when learning an ability based on itoi s belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth he also included characters like magypsies and duster who has a bad leg to show value of having friends with different qualities another of his themes was duality of seriousness and lightheartedness of games which is why he added a serious death scene to first chapter itoi s nintendo 64 version of ending was darker dirtier and more upsetting though final version changed little in concept itoi attributed change in tone to his own growth and character composition of new development team itoi later reflected on ending s lesson on virtue of helping bad people itoi felt that ending s renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on earth in light of planet s inevitable end much of rest of script was written after hours at a local hotel where they would continue their work music shogo sakai a video game composer at hal laboratory whose previous works include music for kirby air ride and super smash bros melee composed mother 3 soundtrack shigesato itoi stated that sakai was chosen for role given his deep understanding of game s story and earthbound series in general in addition to fact that earthbound composers keiichi suzuki and hirokazu tanaka were both unavailable sakai worked to make music feel similar to previous entries in series mother 3 soundtrack was released on compact disc on november 2 2006 kyle miller of rpgfan wrote that game retained quirkiness of previous soundtracks in series despite change in composers he found second half of album which included reinterpreted classics from series to be its strongest love theme main theme of mother 3 was composed late in game s development earlier in development itoi intended to use pigmask army theme as main theme of game during creation of an important scene in game however sakai was asked to create a song that would have a greater impact than pigmask theme upon its creation it was chosen to be used as main theme instead of pigmask army song itoi claims that given how quickly sakai composed song that he had been waiting for order to make a song like love theme itoi requested that love theme be playable on a piano with only one finger as eight melodies theme from mother had gained popularity and been played in elementary schools due to its simplicity ok desu ka that plays after player chooses character s name was recorded without itoi s knowledge by hirokazu tanaka more than a decade before release of mother 3 release thumb mother 3 development spanned four consoles game was eventually released for handheld game boy advance mother 3 was released in japan on april 20 2006 where it became a bestseller prior to its release game was in top five most wanted games of famitsu and at top of japanese preordered game charts at one point leading up to its release game s love theme would play as music on hold for japan post a limited edition deluxe box set was produced with a special edition game boy micro and franklin badge pin game was marketed in japan with a television commercial that has japanese actress ko shibasaki on verge of tears as she explains her feelings about mother 3 itoi has said that her performance was unscripted on december 17 2015 game was released for japanese virtual console on wii u according to game informer editor imran khan nintendo planned an english localization but canceled it due to fears that central theme of bereavement as well as instances of drug use and animal cruelty would generate controversy fan translation mother 3 did not receive an official release outside japan on october 17 2008 starmen net released a fan translation patch that when applied on a copy of mother 3 rom image translates all game s text into english reid young co founder of starmen net stated that when they realized nintendo was not going to localize mother 3 they decided to undertake task for themselves and for fans of game translation team consisted of around a dozen individuals including project lead clyde tomato mandelin a professional japanese to english translator project took two years and thousands of work hours to complete it was estimated that theoretical freelance cost of translation was 30 000 project included translating writing and revising about 1 000 pages of game script in addition to extensive rom hacking and testing to ensure that game properly and correctly displays translated text translation included minor deviations from original such as localization of place names and puns few dramatic changes were made but some characters and locations were renamed for example character loosely derived from was renamed loosely derived from french word facade and incidentally arabic word fsd corruption rom hacking entailed assembly level changes to game code to support features such as variable width fonts team reported that highest levels of nintendo of america knew about their project though they did not intervene localization team planned to end project if nintendo were to make an announcement about future of game or if they were asked to cease development of translation they acknowledged that legality of localization was unclear since final translation required use of an emulator localization patch was downloaded over 100 000 times in first week following its release along with translation team announced mother 3 handbook an english player s guide for game that had been in development since june 2008 wired reported full color 200 page player s guide to be akin to a professional strategy guide with quality on par with prima games and bradygames verge cited two year fan translation of mother 3 as proof of fan base s dedication and jenni lada of technologytell called it one of best known fan translations in existence with active into other languages reception mother 3 sold around 200 000 copies in its first week of sales in japan it was one of japan s top 20 bestselling games for first half of 2006 and received a platinum hall of fame score of 35 40 from japanese reviewer weekly famitsu it ended year with over 368 000 copies sold 36th highest of year in japan jenni lada of technologytell called it perfect game boy advance role playing game reviewers praised its story even though game was only available in japanese and graphics and lamented its 1990s role playing game mechanics critics also complimented its music famitsu reviewers noted level of detail from game s direction accessibility and wit of story unconventional art style and conventional game mechanics they considered timed battles to be both useful and difficult eurogamer simon parkin detailed 12 year development series legacy as both one of japan s most beloved and video game cognoscenti s sacred cow and endurance of its fan community he was impressed by quality of fan translation and described itoi as a storyteller who chose japanese role playing game medium to tell his story parkin noted how excellent script unfurled from a straightforward tale into breadth and depth of quality that few titles many times its budget achieve with affecting scenes and unexpected impact he compared chapter approach with method of dragon quest iv parkin wrote that script allowed for somewhat heavy handed juxtaposition of nature and technology feudalism and capitalism individuals and community and that what he first considers a name customization trick becomes useful later in game ngc magazine mark green wrote that game felt like mother 2 5 in its look and feel which he did not consider negative albeit somewhat antiquated lada of technologytell said mother 3 was surprisingly darker than its forebears eurogamer parkin wrote that childlike and unusually western graphics were similar to earthbound in flat pastel textures devoid of shading as juxtaposed with background art that fizzes with life and character he described cutscenes animations as bespoke rare for 16 bit role playing games and of greater dramatic impact rpgamer jordan jackson wrote that visuals are typical of series and fit game s mood and website s mike moehnke criticized inventory limits carried over from previous game green of ngc said game mechanics were depressingly basic against more advanced role playing games eurogamer parkin felt that role playing game elements were less interesting and added that mother 3 had few standout selling points other than its attention to detail and only systemic innovation rhythm based battle system kotaku richard eisenbeis praised system and gamespot greg kasavin compared it with that of mario luigi series jackson wrote that music was just as catchy as previous games despite being almost completely new moehnke agreed calling it nothing less than stunning he noted overtones of wagner and chuck berry jackson said that game was somewhat easier than rest of series and somewhat shorter at about 30 hours in length both rpgamer reviewers noted that mother 3 has few penalties for death jackson reflected that while game is humorous and grows in enjoyment it has some somber moments as well eisenbeis of kotaku cited importance of mothers as a key theme about which game revolves which he preferred to mid game slapstick insanity and final plot twist parkin wrote that game was filled with memorable moments including a character who criticizes player for not giggling at puns frogs with progressively silly costumes that save game a reconstructed mecha caribou battle a bad haiku and campfire scene and that while game s simpleness could have lent towards raw stupidity instead it was elegant in its simplicity legacy multiple critics wrote that mother 3 was one of best role playing games for game boy advance gamepro jeremy signor listed it among his best unreleased japanese role playing games for its script and attention to detail tim rogers posited that mother 3 was closest games have yet come to literature nintendo is often criticized for mother 3 lack of an international release ign referred to mother series as neglected in regards to earthbound being only game to be released outside japan across decades until 2015 bob mackey of 1up com wrote of mother 3 that no other game in history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation and chris plante of ugo networks wrote that lack of an official mother 3 english localization was one of 2008 s worst heartbreaks frank caron of ars technica said that fan translation s massive undertaking stands as a massive success and that one cannot even begin to fathom why nintendo wouldn t see fit to release game in west although acclaimed mother series writer shigesato itoi has stated that he does not have any plans to create a fourth installment in series super smash bros series features characters ness and lucas as playable fighters as well as minor characters as collectibles items or stage hazards during nintendo s digital event at e3 2014 nintendo made a humorous reference to mother 3s lack of a localization by presenting a stop motion animation created by robot chicken short features a fan in attendance talking to then nintendo of america president reggie fils aime after fan says come on reggie give us mother 3 fils aime responds by saying how about this and then proceeds to eat a fire flower from super mario series in order to throw a fireball at fan notes references sources external
