lake toba is a large natural lake in sumatra indonesia occupying caldera of a supervolcano lake is located in middle of northern part of island of sumatra with a surface elevation of about lake stretches from to lake is about long wide and up to deep it is largest lake in indonesia and largest volcanic lake in world lake toba caldera is one of nineteen in indonesia which is proposed to be included in unesco global geopark lake toba is site of a massive supervolcanic eruption estimated at vei 8 that occurred 69 000 to 77 000 years ago representing a climate changing event recent advances in dating methods suggest a more accurate identification of 74 000 years ago as date ref vogel gretchen how ancient humans survived global volcanic winter from massive eruption science 12 march 2018 ref it is largest known explosive eruption on earth in last 25 million years according to toba catastrophe theory it had global consequences for human populations it killed most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east africa and india which affects genetic make up of human worldwide population to present it has been accepted that eruption of toba led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decrease in temperature between and up to in higher latitudes additional studies in lake malawi in east africa show significant amounts of ash being deposited from toba eruptions even at that great distance but little indication of a significant climatic effect in east africa geology thumb batu hanging stone in lake toba thumb map of lake toba caldera complex in north sumatra comprises four overlapping volcanic craters that adjoin sumatran volcanic front with it is world s largest quaternary caldera and fourth and youngest caldera it intersects three older calderas an estimated of dense rock equivalent pyroclastic material known as youngest toba tuff was released during one of largest explosive volcanic eruptions in recent geological history following this eruption a resurgent dome formed within new caldera joining two half domes separated by a longitudinal graben at least four cones four stratovolcanoes and three craters are visible in lake tandukbenua cone on northwestern edge of caldera has only sparse vegetation suggesting a young age of several hundred years also hill center volcano above sea level on south edge of caldera is active major eruption thumb left location of lake toba shown in red on map toba eruption toba event occurred at what is now lake toba about 75 000 900 years ago it was last in a series of at least four caldera forming eruptions at this location with earlier calderas having formed around 788 000 2 200 years ago this last eruption had an estimated vei 8 making it largest known explosive volcanic eruption within last 25 million years bill rose and craig of michigan technological university have estimated that total amount of material released in eruption was about about of ignimbrite that flowed over ground and approximately that fell as ash mostly to west however based on new method crystal concentration and exponential toba possibly erupted of ignimbrite and co ignimbrite pyroclastic flows of eruption destroyed an area of least with ash deposits as thick as by main vent eruption was large enough to have deposited an ash layer approximately thick over all of south asia at one site in central india toba ash layer today is up to thick and parts of malaysia were covered with of ash fall noted by weber in addition it has been variously calculated that of sulfurous acid or of sulfur dioxide were ejected into atmosphere by event subsequent collapse formed a caldera that filled with water creating lake toba island in center of lake is formed by a resurgent dome thumbnail right landsat photo of sumatra surrounding lake toba exact year of eruption is unknown but pattern of ash deposits suggests that it occurred during northern summer because only summer monsoon could have deposited toba ashfall in south china sea eruption lasted perhaps two weeks and ensuing volcanic winter resulted in a decrease in average global temperatures by for several years ice cores from greenland record a pulse of starkly reduced levels of organic carbon sequestration very few plants or animals in southeast asia would have survived and it is possible that eruption caused a planet wide die off however global cooling has been discussed by and self their conclusion is that cooling had already started before toba s eruption this conclusion was supported by lane and zielinski who studied lake core from africa and gisp2 they concluded that there was no volcanic winter after toba eruption and that high h2so4 deposits do not cause long term effects evidence from studies of mitochondrial dna suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given age of species according to toba catastrophe theory proposed by stanley h ambrose of university of illinois at urbana champaign in 1998 effects of toba eruption may have decreased size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals however this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck gathorne hardy f j and harcourt smith w e h super eruption of toba did it cause a human bottleneck journal of human evolution 45 2003 227 230 more recent activity since major eruption 70 000 years ago eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at toba small cone of formed on southwestern margin of caldera and lava domes most recent eruption may have been at tandukbenua on northwestern caldera edge suggested by a lack of vegetation that could be due to an eruption within last few hundred years some parts of caldera have shown uplift due to partial refilling of magma chamber for example pushing samosir island and peninsula above surface of lake lake sediments on samosir island show that it has risen by at least since cataclysmic eruption such uplifts are common in very large calderas apparently due to upward pressure of below ground magma toba is probably largest resurgent caldera on earth large earthquakes have recently occurred in vicinity of volcano notably in 1987 along southern shore of lake at a depth of such earthquakes have also been recorded in 1892 1916 and 1920 1922 lake toba lies near great sumatran fault which runs along centre of sumatra in sumatra fracture zone volcanoes of sumatra and java are part of sunda arc a result of northeasterly movement of indo australian plate which is sliding under eastward moving eurasian plate subduction zone in this area is very active seabed near west coast of sumatra has had several major earthquakes since 1995 including 9 1 2004 indian ocean earthquake and 8 7 2005 nias earthquake epicenters of which were around from toba people thumb batak canoes near on lake toba circa 1920 most of people who live around lake toba are ethnically bataks traditional batak houses are noted for their distinctive roofs which curve upwards at each end as a boat s hull does and their colorful decor flora and fauna flora of lake includes various types of phytoplankton emerged macrophytes floating macrophytes and submerged macrophytes while surrounding countryside is rainforest including areas of sumatran tropical pine forests on higher mountainsides fauna includes several species of zooplankton and benthic animals since lake is oligotrophic nutrient poor native fish fauna is relatively scarce and only endemics are rasbora strictly speaking near endemic since also found in some tributary rivers that run into lake and locally known as batak fish latter species is threatened by deforestation causing siltation pollution changes in water level and numerous fish species that have been introduced to lake other native fishes include species such as channa channa striata barbonymus barbonymus danio vittatus rasbora tor betta betta and albus fishbase 2012 species in toba accessed 25 january 2012 among many introduced species are oreochromis mossambicus oreochromis niloticus cyprinus carpio pectoralis reticulata and sinking of mv sinar bangun on 18 june 2018 lake toba was scene of a ferry disaster in which over 190 people drowned mv sinar bangun was an irregular operating vessel traveling at lake capsized with many passengers on board incident caused death of 190 people and injuries to a number of others preliminary reports found vessel was in operation with irregularities ignoring overloading on vessel and operating in rough weather conditions were concluded as main reason leading to disaster around 50 cars and 100 motorbikes which were aboard also sank into lake on that day gallery see also list of lakes of indonesia list of volcanoes in indonesia mount
