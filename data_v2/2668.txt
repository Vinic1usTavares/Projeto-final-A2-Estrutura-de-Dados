adam s song is a song recorded by american rock band blink 182 for its third studio album enema of state 1999 it was released as third and final single from enema of state on september 5 2000 through mca records adam s song shares writing credits between band s guitarist tom delonge and bassist mark hoppus but hoppus was primary composer of song track concerns suicide depression and loneliness it incorporates a piano in its bridge section and was regarded as one of most serious songs band had written to that point hoppus was inspired by loneliness he experienced while on tour while his bandmates had significant others to return home to he was single he was also influenced by a teen suicide letter he read in a magazine song takes form of a suicide note and contains lyrical allusions to nirvana song come as you are adam s song was one of last songs to be written and recorded for enema of state and it was nearly left off album though hoppus worried subject matter was too depressing his bandmates were receptive to its message song was produced by jerry finn adam s song peaked at number two on us billboard hot modern rock tracks chart it was also a top 25 hit in canada and italy but did not replicate its success on other charts it received praise from music critics who considered it a change of pace from trio s more lighthearted singles single s music video a hit on mtv was directed by liz friedlander though song was intended to inspire hope to those struggling with depression it encountered controversy when a student of columbine high school died by suicide with track playing on repeat in 2000 background beginning in summer of 1997 blink 182 would enter an extended period of touring to support their second studio album dude ranch group had played a handful of dates on vans warped tour 1996 a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music however upon dude ranch release and popularity blink 182 would play every date of 1997 tour worldwide with bands nofx and social distortion group were gone from their hometown of san diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997 when we did our longest tour stretch it was right when i started dating my fiancee recalled vocalist guitarist tom delonge we were all new and in love and i had to leave it was just hey i ll see you in nine months it was really hard thumb 125px right bassist mark hoppus song s lyricist was inspired by a teen suicide note as well as touring related loneliness bassist mark hoppus penned adam s song to vent these frustrations and loneliness he experienced on tour while other members had longtime girlfriends to return home to hoppus was single when you re on tour you re so lonely hoppus said you hang out with all your bros and it s a great time and everything but everybody wants to come home and have a girlfriend and every time we d fly home tom and former drummer scott raynor always had girlfriends waiting for them at airport and i didn t it s about me being depressed and lonely out on tour and not really having anything to come home to couplet i couldn t wait til i got home to pass time in my room alone originally ended to get off plane alone in opposition to what hoppus was feeling was fact that band were reaching professional highs dude ranch had gone gold and band were on verge of stardom it feels ridiculous saying our band s doing really good but personally i m not feeling like i m connecting it felt like i had too much good fortune to complain about anything he recalled in a later interview hoppus said song s inspiration came from reading a magazine where some teenage kid had killed himself and left a letter for his family untrue online rumors purported that song was inspired by a friend from hoppus high school years who committed suicide or a play titled adam s letter 2005 that has same focus but was not written until years after song s release john writer behind adam s letter said naming of central character was a coincidence name goes back to original script i had no knowledge of blink 182 or their music at that time in his memoir can i say drummer travis barker wrote that song s title was taken from a sketch on mr show about a band that writes a song with that name encouraging one particular fan to kill himself david cross co creator of mr show confirmed this commenting they were fans of show and that was a knowing tribute that i thought was pretty cool recording and production adam s song was among last tracks composed and recorded for enema of state and was nearly absent from final album band was halfway finished with recording when hoppus developed idea though he worried it was a bit too far and depressing for what we were trying to do his bandmates were receptive towards idea although vocals would usually take many alternate takes to complete hoppus completed much of vocal track for adam s song in a single take it s in a pretty high register for me so i just blasted it out one night after dinner that s like 90 percent of what s on final track he told kerrang idea to include piano in track came without much forethought we realized well this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here so we tried it out and it sounded rad said hoppus piano was performed by session musician roger joseph manning jr best known for his work with beck composition adam s song was a departure from content of band s previous singles in favor of a slower tempo and more depressing lyrics brian wallace of mtv wrote that blink 182 explores new ground on adam s song setting aside their normal pop punk punch for a more emo influenced approach song is a pop punk emo and alternative rock track composed in key of c major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 136 beats per minute hoppus vocal range spans from g3 to g4 song begins with narrator contemplating suicide with lyrics i never thought i d die alone lyrics continue i m too depressed to go on you ll be sorry when i m gone adam s song includes a reference to come as you are by nirvana come as you are by nirvana includes lyrics take your time hurry up choice is yours don t be late adam s song in turn includes lyrics i took my time i hurried up choice was mine i didn t think enough barker s drum track was labeled by drummerworld as one of most creative beats of his career and mainly consists of same basic beat repeated in sections throughout verses first measure begins with kick drum and splash cymbal playing on downbeat followed by a hit on bell of ride cymbal on and of beat two preceding an open hi hat that rings out for a full count on beat three kick snare and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four followed by floor tom hits on last two sixteenth note triplets of beat four snare is hit on beats two and four respectively song gradually builds to a powerful piano laden crescendo and song s final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of world tomorrow holds such better days days when i can still feel alive when i can t wait to get outside delonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for gigantic sad choruses but upon mixing only four were used extra ones

emotional maturity they d show on later releases particularly their eponymous 2003 release richard harrington of washington post deemed song a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression alex pappademas writing for spin compared song to music of weezer katy kroll of billboard recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 calling it a good old fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair geoff boucher writing for los angeles times called it a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide conversely steve appleford of los angeles times dubbed it a moving if unremarkable examination scott mervis of pittsburgh post gazette called it a rare departure from usual blink fare writers for a v club listed it among other suicide related songs in 2009 describing it as surprisingly affecting especially when band reaches bombastic chorus and when song describes suicide s crushing aftermath in a retrospective review chris payne of billboard wrote stylistically it s also a blink breakthrough rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed band dials back verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit resulting chorus achieves an arena worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on enema of state suicide of greg barnes song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17 year old greg barnes a teenager who attended columbine high school and had lost one of his best friends in massacre previous year hanged himself in garage of his family s home both hoppus and delonge were sympathetic but stressed song s meaning during an mtv news interview in 2001 hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following song s release from fans that had contemplated suicide but decided not to go through with it after hearing song rolling stone compared controversy to that of ozzy osbourne s suicide solution which was played before a teen committed suicide in january of 1986 music video song s music video was directed by liz friedlander and debuted on mtv s total request live on march 7 2000 it consists of performance footage of trio in a warehouse in front of a wall decorated with photographs in between verses photos origins are explored through different perspectives of individuals near band as band prepares to play a show a man has a conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone in another while delonge and hoppus read magazines inside a late night convenience store a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone other montages show trio in company of friends and practicing a man looking out upon sea and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant final montage consists of personal photos from band s past friedlander s vision for video was to focus on everyday individuals going through difficult moments in their lives we never know what s going on in other people s lives she told andrew limbong of npr in 2018 we all are dealing with our stuff and we don t look and don t see and so then we don t notice legacy in 2015 a mashup combining adam s song with hotline bling by drake surfaced online called hotline blink
