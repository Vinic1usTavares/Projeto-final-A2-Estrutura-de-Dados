county to try and get him to sign clough but storer had told him he had spent club s budget on signing martin mcdonnell and paddy ryan manager bob dennison led boro to 14th in second division in 1955 56 seeing both clough and taylor only as useful reserves pair spent their spare time coaching schoolboys to boost their wages and to gain experience clough went on to become club s star striker with

before their arrival hartlepools had been forced to apply for re election to football league five times in previous six years and taylor stated that squad were all free transfer signings and some of players struggled with drink debt or abandoned wives two gradually turned around club s fortunes and started by painting victoria park taylor had little chance to show his skills in transfer market as

would go on to win club s player of year award pair went on to lead club to an eighth place finish in fourth division in 1966 67 after replacing most of playing staff an improvement on 1965 66 when

initiated included winger john mcgovern whom pair had signed at hartlepools and would follow clough on to leeds and nottingham and full back john robson after 1967 68 season had finished with club

scouted signing midfielder archie gemmill from preston north end for ps64 000 most signings involved scouting from taylor with only two transfers he had played no part in being clough s former sunderland teammates colin todd and john o hare following a ninth place finish in 1970 71 derby went on to win league championship in 1971 72 first in club s history clough and taylor continued to strengthen club in transfer market however with taylor noting that a manager should always be looking for signs of disintegration in a winning side and then sell players responsible before their deterioration is noticed by possible buyers derby reached semi finals of european cup following season controversially losing to juventus taylor had spotted juventus player helmut haller talking with referee gerhard schulenberg at half time and described how a squad of heavies restrained him after he attempted to overhear pair s conversation clough went on to call italian team cheating bastards on 15 october 1973 both he and clough resigned partially after a dispute with derby board over taylor s crucial but largely undefined role although numerous reasons were behind clough and taylor s resignation taylor in particular had been frustrated by what he felt was a lack of support from club s directors over pair s transfer policy pair had come close to leaving derby earlier turning down offers to manage coventry city and greece national team fans protested against board following their resignation and players also demanded they be reinstated but chairman sam longson s relationship with clough and taylor was irreparable brighton hove albion clough was appointed as manager at third division brighton hove albion on 1 november 1973 with taylor joining as his assistant just after

avoiding relegation to fourth division and pair began to rebuild team by signing peter andy rollings ian mellor steve and ken taylor felt that clough never settled at brighton however and spent too much time away on media commitments clough left for leeds united in july 1974 but taylor refused to go with clough as he felt brighton and club chairman mike bamber had treated them well and so partnership ended after nine years as taylor stayed at goldstone ground as sole manager he went on to sign striker peter ward and midfielder brian horton but admitted that both he and clough were much more effective as a duo he felt that he had struggled to make good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that clough had bought and sold poorly as leeds manager he stayed on at south coast club for a further two seasons guiding team to a fourth place finish in 1975 76 missing promotion by two points his successor alan mullery managed to lead team taylor left behind to promotion in 1976 77 and then into top flight in 1978 79 nottingham forest on 16 july 1976 taylor resigned as brighton manager and joined once again with clough who had by this time moved on to

reasoned shilton wins you matches after spending some time secretly following kenny burns he came to conclusion that burns s reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated and he sanctioned a ps145 000 move for player who would become fwa footballer of year in 1977 78 after being converted from centre forward to a sweeper role signing a hooligan and a shankly team talk how clough set up

resigned in early april 1984 with club third from bottom of second division before derby went on to be relegated however team did manage to reach quarter finals of fa cup and revenue obtained from cup run helped to keep club afloat relationship with clough clough was quoted as saying i m not equipped to manage successfully without peter taylor i am shop window and he is goods in back two worked as a pair by complementing each other s strengths as clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players whilst taylor was more reserved though he had an ability to spot talented players former hartlepools player cliff wright described pair as good cop bad cop would knock you to ground verbally at least and pete would pick you up and put you back together as bigger personality and man with title of manager clough garnered much greater publicity than taylor which caused taylor to grumble that i sometimes wonder why he never says to bell s whisky for instance when they re handing out manager of month awards you ll have to present an extra gallon bottle there are two of us on a personal level they were very close and often finished each other s sentences though taylor s friendship and partnership with clough had been strong their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion while at derby in 1971 taylor was riled when he learned that clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of ps5 000 from chairman sam longson he was also annoyed that clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of work with players relationship worsened in autumn of 1980 when taylor published with clough by taylor an autobiography which was largely based on taylor s work with clough taylor had not told clough that he was writing book and did not give him a share of proceeds although they initially parted on good terms when taylor retired in may 1982 and spent time together that summer in cala ever says thank you jonathan wilson relationship was severely strained when taylor became manager of derby county in november 1982 and finally damaged permanently after a dispute over transfer in may 1983 of john robertson from forest to derby where taylor was now managing clough was apparently angered that taylor did not inform him about deal clough attacked taylor in a tabloid article on 3 july 1983 as being a rattlesnake a snake in grass and said that we pass each other on a52 going to work on most days of week but if his car broke down and i saw him thumbing a lift i wouldn t pick him up i d run him over two men would never speak to one another again death on 4 october 1990 peter taylor died suddenly of pulmonary fibrosis while on holiday in costa de los pinos mallorca at age of 62 when
