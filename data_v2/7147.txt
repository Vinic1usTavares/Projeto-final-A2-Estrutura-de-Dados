controlled colonies on indian subcontinent and when french national convention declared war on britain on 1 february 1793 both sides were prepared for conflict in india british india was centred on principal ports of bombay madras and calcutta administered by east india company french india was governed from pondicherry modern puducherry on coromandel coast british forces in india were considerably stronger than french with british indian army supported by british army detachments and a royal navy squadron under rear admiral william cornwallis pondicherry s defenses were strong but garrison was too small to effectively man walls and although a french frigate squadron was stationed at distant ile de france it was unable to effectively protect french indian coast news of outbreak of war took five months to reach indian ocean but british forces recently engaged in third anglo mysore war were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized ports of french india only pondicherry was able to resist and a siege was instigated on 1 august 1793 by colonel john braithwaite while cornwallis imposed a naval blockade british forces constructed trenches and batteries often under heavy fire over following weeks twenty days after city was cut off braithwaite began a bombardment of defences within hours french commander colonel prosper de clermont requested a truce followed next morning by an unconditional surrender background in 1790s great britain was largest colonial power on indian subcontinent its administration based at port of calcutta in bengal supported by cities of madras and bombay and a network of subsidiary coastal trading stations administration of british india was largely delegated to east india company which maintained standing british indian army supported by detachments from regular british army this force had been heavily engaged in third anglo mysore war of 1789 to 1792 naval support was provided by a squadron under rear admiral william cornwallis in frigate hms minerva which had blockaded tellicherry during mysore war french military position in india was considerably weaker than british with no significant investment in colonies since outbreak of seven years war in 1754 french held a number of small trading ports including karaikal yanam mahe and chandernagore but most important colony was at pondicherry close to madras pondicherry was fortified extensive and modern defences designed by camille charles leclerc chevalier de fresne but garrison was far too small to effectively man walls in face of a determined siege french navy presence in indian ocean at outbreak of war comprised two frigates cybele and prudente under contre amiral but were not based in india at all but on distant ile de france modern mauritius tensions in europe had been steadily mounting since french revolution of 1789 and in 1792 french revolutionary wars began with war between new french republic and austrian and prussian empires great britain was not initially engaged in this conflict but diplomatic relations with france were rapidly deteriorating on 1 february 1793 shortly after execution of deposed king louis xvi french national convention declared war on britain and dutch republic due to long distances involved it took five months for news of outbreak of war to reach india passing through british consul at alexandria george baldwin on 2 june news arrived at madras and passed to calcutta on 11 june governor general of india lord cornwallis issued instructions for operations against territories of french india lord cornwallis brother to william originally intended to participate in surrender of pondicherry himself in seized french merchant ship bien aime but was eventually dissuaded siege of pondicherry admiral cornwallis was anchored at trincomalee in dutch ceylon when he learned of outbreak of war on 19 june he immediately gave orders to sail for pondicherry which he placed under blockade shortly afterward he captured a merchant ship carrying ammunition supplies to french port and after a brief stop at madras minerva and three accompanying east indiamen captured french privateer concorde leaving pondicherry on 3 july and seized a snow in roads on 9 july on 13 july sails appeared to southeast and cornwallis assumed they belonged to british reinforcements on investigation however this ship proved to be 40 gun cybele and three smaller vessels carrying supplies and a unit of artillerymen to pondicherry to reinforce garrison on closing with french frigate cornwallis discovered that east india company ships supporting his blockade had become scattered and in delay gathering them cybele escaped pursuit on land army at madras was placed under command of colonel john braithwaite after assembling his forces at braithwaite marched on pondicherry occupying to southwest and arian to south cutting off garrison from supporting hinterland of city on 28 july braithwaite reached city and established positions on red hill overlooking pondicherry sending a demand to its commander colonel prosper de clement that he surrender demand was refused and braithwaite ordered detachments from 71st and 74th regiments of foot to occupy positions to south of city s walls on 30 july a manoeuvre which prompted heavy fire from bastions this move was however a feint braithwaite planned to launch his main assault on northeast corner where defences were weaker and ground drier attempts were then made to establish batteries to west and north of city but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain delaying construction of defensive earthworks which allowed garrison to maintain a constant fire on work parties which suffered consequent casualties fire was especially heavy against siege lines to north of city which were easily targeted by french gunners on 12 august operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted on 15 august lieutenant colonel george maule braithwaite s chief engineer was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of trenches on night of 21 august main battery known as royal battery came under heavy shellfire and was damaged but repairs were successful and on morning of 22 august its 24 pounder long guns opened return fire on city within hours of first shots from royal battery french defenses opposite fell silent only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries british fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment and at 16 30 flags of truce were raised over city s bastions clermont s offer requested a 24 hour ceasefire to negotiate terms but braithwaite allowed only until 08 00 following morning during which time construction of british earthworks would continue clermont isolated and unsupported accepted terms and following morning braithwaite s army entered city and took possession although french garrison had seized liquor supplies during night and were too drunk to surrender formally aftermath british losses during siege of 88 killed and 131 wounded were relatively heavy french casualties were not recorded but were thought to be negligible as few defenders were exposed to british fire during only day of bombardment captured in city were 645 french soldiers and 1 014 sepoys with 167 guns of varying sizes and materials and substantial quantities of ammunition elsewhere other french indian colonies of karaikal yanam mahe and chandernagore all surrendered when summoned without conflict assuring british dominance among european powers on indian subcontinent it has been noted that british naval forces in bay of bengal were unusually weak during this period minerva only warship on active operations and had french managed to concentrate their forces in region they might have considerably extended siege of pondicherry and caused considerable damage to british merchant shipping in region french made no efforts to recapture their lost indian territories during war but regained them under terms of peace of amiens in 1802 citations references category battles of war of first coalition category sieges of french
