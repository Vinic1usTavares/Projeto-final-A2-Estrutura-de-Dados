virgin and child enthroned also known as thyssen madonna is a small oil on oak panel painting dated 1433 usually attributed to early netherlandish artist rogier van der weyden panel was attributed at various times in late 19th and early 20th centuries to hubert van eyck and jan van eyck see hand et al 2006 324 it is closely related to his madonna standing completed during same period panel is filled with christian iconography including representations of prophets annunciation christ s infancy and resurrection and mary s coronation it is generally accepted as earliest extant work by van der weyden one of three works attributed to him of virgin and child enclosed in a niche on an exterior wall of a gothic church panel is housed in museo thyssen bornemisza in madrid panel seems to be left hand wing of a dismantled diptych perhaps with saint george and dragon panel now in national gallery of art washington d c as an early van der weyden it takes influence from robert campin and jan van eyck van der weyden served his apprenticeship under campin and older master s style is noticeable in architecture of niche virgin s facial type her exposed breast and treatment of her hair description left thumb robert campin virgin and child before a firescreen c 1430 national gallery london panel is smallest extant work by van der weyden and follows tradition of a madonna lactans with significant differences christ is dressed in a red garment as opposed to swaddling he usually wears in 15th century virgin and child portrayals this is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed other is robert campin s madonna in frankfurt where he is shown in blue clothing mary s unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms showing influence of campin it is brushed behind ears she wears a crown as queen of heaven and a ring on a finger as bride of christ reinforcing this blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son birkmeyer 1962 329 folds of her dress are reminiscent of lengthy crisp curved intertwined gowns of gothic sculpture pictorial space is bathed in soft light probably an influence from jan van eyck light falls from right throwing shadows of both mary and child s heads on left wall of niche ward 1968 354 virgin and child are shown seated in a small gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail for example there are four small holes above each arch likely to hold scaffolding ward 1968 356 as with other early van der weyden depictions of madonna her head is slightly too large for her body her dress is creased and almost paper like however description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in campin s virgin and child before a firescreen it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg this seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in depiction of a body under clothing ward 1968 355 chapel is unrealistically small compared to virgin van der weyden s intention was to emphasise virgin s presence while also symbolically representing church and entire doctrine of redemption panofsky 1971 146 panel is one of three surviving of van der weyden s in which both madonna and child are enclosed in this way however it is unusual in that niche exists as a separate feature within picture compared to two other works where enclosure is coterminous with edge of painting almost as part of frame a reason why it is thought to predate madonna standing there are symmetrical differences between left and right hand sides of painting this is most noticeable with buttress where receding edges are over half again size of those on front sides in addition breadth of buttress contradicts spatial depth of much tighter space inhabited by virgin and child this is a technical issue with foreshortening campin also struggled with but which van der weyden resolves in his mature work iconography work is rich in symbolism and iconographic elements to an extent far more pronounced than that in madonna standing an iris grows to side of representing virgin s sorrow at passion and on other side a columbine recalling sorrows of virgin this symbolic use of flowers is again a van eyckian motif while they may appear incongruous with architectural setting this was probably effect that van der weyden was seeking birkmeyer 1962 331 thumb left figures to left of virgin david standing in centre holds a harp lintel contains six reliefs from new testament of scenes from life of virgin first four annunciation visitation nativity and adoration of magi are associated with motherhood and infancy they are followed by resurrection and pentecost above them surmounting a cross flower is coronation of virgin acres 2000 83 jambs on either side of virgin are adorned with statues most likely of old testament prophets of these only david second to left has been identified bearded man to david s left is probably moses man in cap to right is most likely weeping prophet jeremiah on opposite side outer figures may be zechariah and isaiah in his usage of grisaille van der weyden distinguishes between earthly realm of flesh and blood and divine represented by ancient sculptural figures who appear frozen in time art historian shirley blum believes these figures were relegated to architectural elements so as not to crowd central devotional image arrangement of sculptural elements may have been influenced by claus s well of moses c 1395 1403 which has a similar alignment in chartreuse de prophets represent judges of christ secundum mori according to that law he ought to die and are thus tied to crucifixion in van der weyden they are associated with virgin although portraying figures in niches has a long tradition in northern art rendering figures as sculpture was unique to 1430s and first appears in van eyck s ghent altarpiece diptych panel may have been conceived as either left hand wing of a since dismantled diptych or as front piece of a double sided panel hand et al 2006 26 art historian erwin panofsky suggests that washington saint george and dragon of 1432 35 is most likely opposite wing in that work st george facing inwards and to right slays dragon before a libyan princess although pairing might seem incongruous his madonna standing is widely thought to have been attached with st catherine of alexandria in vienna saint catherine panel is usually attributed to his workshop based on a design by van der weyden see panofsky 1971 251 in both panels saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes in contrast in both left hand panels madonna and child are positioned frontally although eye contact is avoided and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces panofsky 1971 251 blum suggests that van der weyden sought to juxtapose otherworldly realm of madonna and child with earthly setting and contemporary dress of saints she describes couplings as serving to position each saint as a living witness to static eternal presence of virgin and child she writes that only in such early works do we find this kind of obvious solution by time of descent from cross and duran madonna van der weyden has already worked out a far more complex and effective means of mixing temporal and non temporal effects blum 1977 121 dating and attribution panel closely resembles van der weyden s c 1430 32 madonna standing and seems influenced by work of robert campin under whom he served his apprenticeship it is especially close to campin s 1430 virgin and child before a firescreen now in london one of last works campin completed before van der weyden left his studio on 1 august 1432 in both virgin has large full breasts her fingers pressing as she nurses child there are further similarities in her facial features and expression colour style and position of her hair as well her pose lorne campbell attributes work to van der weyden s workshop acres 2000 105 while art historian john ward credits it to campin and gives a date of c 1435 ward 1968 354 56 thumb 380px in van der weyden s descent from cross flesh and blood figures take on a distinctly sculptural appearance clarke 1960 47 ward s thesis is based on fact that thyssen panel so named after its home at thyssen bornemisza museum is overwhelmingly influenced by campin while contemporaneous and more sophisticated madonna standing draws heavily from van eyck he finds such a sudden shift unlikely while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that campin was never to resolve especially in respect to foreshortening and rendering of body beneath robes he also points to architectural similarities in campin s marriage of mary although this may be a matter of influence painting was completed early in van der weyden s career probably just after his apprenticeship with robert campin ended although highly accomplished it is filled with symbolism of a kind absent from his more mature works it is one of three attributed paintings all early works that show virgin and child set within an architectural setting surrounded with painted sculptural figures others being madonna standing and duran madonna birkmeyer 1962 330 sculptural figuration was to become a hallmark of van der weyden s mature work and is best typified by madrid descent where mourning figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture blum 1977 103 erwin panofsky identified this work and madonna standing as van der weyden s earliest extant work they are also his smallest panels panofsky dated both panels as 1432 34 and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons their near miniature scale and because of evident influences
