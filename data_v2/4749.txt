allen 2006 film s opening voiceover from wilton introduces its themes of chance and fate which he characterises as simple luck to him all important sequence establishes protagonist as an introvert a man who mediates his experience of world through deliberation and positions film s subjective perspective through his narrative eyes charalampos goyios argued that this hero as an opera lover maintains a sense of distance from outer world and that ramifications therein pale in comparison to purity of interior experience goyios charalampos living life as an opera lover on uses of opera as musical accompaniment in woody allen s match point senses of cinema issue 40 retrieved 21 january 2012 film is a debate with fyodor dostoyevsky s crime and punishment which wilton is seen reading early on identifying him with anti hero raskolnikov that character is a brooding loner who kills two women to prove that he is a superior being but is racked by guilt and is finally redeemed by confession of his crime love of a young woman forced into prostitution and discovery of god wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him knows little guilt and avoids detection through luck allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities both are almost caught by a painter s unexpected appearance in stairwell and both play cat and mouse with suspect allen argues unlike dostoyevsky that there is neither god nor punishment nor love to provide redemption theme of parody and reversal of dostoyevsky s motifs and subject matter has been visited by allen before in his film love and death in love and death dialogue and scenarios parody russian novels particularly those by dostoyevsky and tolstoy such as brothers karamazov crime and punishment gambler idiot and war and peace in match point allen moves theme from parody to more direct engagement of dostoyevsky s motifs and narratives allen revisits some of themes he had explored in crimes and misdemeanors 1989 such as existence of justice in universe both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress and offer a depressing view on fate fidelity

clever twist on themes of chance and fate money is an important motivator for characters both wilton and nola come from modest backgrounds and wish to enter hewett family using their sex appeal that

companies and nola reports being swept off her feet by hewett s attention and presents ebert roger review match point 6 january 2006 retrieved 22 january 2012 roger ebert posed film s underlying question as to what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness wilton is facing a choice between greed and lust but his sweet wife chloe herself has no qualms about having her father essentially buy her husband for her jean baptiste morain writing in les inrockuptibles noticed how strong do not accept their own weakness and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests this wider political sense is he argued accentuated by its english setting where class differences are more marked than in usa film pits passion and dream of happiness against ambition and resolving dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice musical accompaniment film s soundtrack consists almost entirely of pre world war i 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by italian tenor enrico caruso this bold use despite caruso s variety of musical styles constitutes a first for allen opera has been used before in his work as an indicator of social class such as in husbands and wives 1992 in match point arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on actions of characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in movie s narrative furthermore given wilton s status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime 10 minute murder scene which forms film s climax is scored with almost whole of act ii duet between otello and iago from giuseppe verdi s otello this is an atypical scoring for a film since verdi s piece is not an aria but a dramatic dialogue in which words are as important as music thus astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment since score s events do not match story unfolding onscreen arias and extracts include work by verdi in particular macbeth la traviata il trovatore and rigoletto gaetano donizetti s l elisir d amore georges bizet s les pecheurs de perles and antonio carlos gomes s salvator rosa sung by caruso una from l elisir d amore is featured repeatedly including during opening credits caruso arias are supplemented by diegetic music from contemporary performances that characters attend over course of film there are scenes at royal opera house and elsewhere performed by opera singers scenes from la traviata performed by janis kelly and alan oke from rigoletto performed by mary hegarty accompanied by a piano performed by tim reception allen has said that match point is one of his few a films and even arguably may be best film that i ve made this is strictly accidental it just happened to come out right you know i try to make them all good but some come out and some don t with this
