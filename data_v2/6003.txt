wales part 1 was filmed back to back with harry potter and deathly hallows part 2 from 19 february 2009 to 12 june 2010 director david yates who shot film alongside director of photography eduardo serra described part 1 as quite real a road movie that s almost like a verite documentary originally set for a single theatrical release idea to split book into two parts was suggested by executive producer lionel wigram due to what david heyman called creative imperative heyman initially responded negatively to idea but wigram asked no david how are we going to do it after rereading book and discussing it with screenwriter steve kloves he agreed with division production filmed at dartford crossing for dramatic chase where harry and hagrid are being ambushed by death eaters sets stuart craig set designer for all of previous harry potter films returned for final two parts he said we made a very different kind of film which was shot a great deal on location we travelled quite far we built sets and they spend a lot of time in a forest he explained we built forest sets and integrated them into real forests so there were challenges there as you might imagine craig was ultimately nominated for an academy award for his work on part 1 on wedding tent for bill and fleur s wedding in part 1 craig commented on his aim to rather than make it an extension of house which is rather eccentric homemade we decided to make it rather elegant it s lined with silk and beautiful floating candelabra so it s a nice contrast with house for ministry of magic set he noted this is an underground world this is a ministry so we went to real ministries muggle ministries whitehall in london and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries craig also commented on his design of malfoy manor saying that it is a very strong architectural set exterior is based on an elizabethan house here in this country called hardwick hall and it has massive windows and these windows are kind of blinded out shutters are drawn so they are like blind windows and they have a real kind of presence an ominous presence so that gave us basis for a good exterior there s an extraordinary magical roof that s added and surrounded by forest which isn t there in reality but again is one of devices to make it more threatening and mysterious costumes costumes for part 1 were designed by jany temime who has been costume designer on harry potter productions since harry potter and prisoner of azkaban 2004 temime was involved in a controversy regarding her work on fleur delacour s wedding dress she was accused of copying design from a similar dress from alexander mcqueen s fall 2008 collection temime spoke about dress saying that she wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a halloween dress dress is white but it needed to have something fantastic to it so there is phoenix motif bird which is a symbol of love in a way because there is rebirth love never dies it is born again visual effects thumb 200 px right motorcycle with a used by hagrid and harry in film after working on every film since prisoner of azkaban double

enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all magic while rowling s stories are endlessly inventive potter onscreen just gives you a headache lou lumenick of new york post found film to
