thumb upright 1 35 in strada nomentana richard wilson in praise of limestone is a poem written by w h auden in italy in may 1948 central to his canon and one of auden s finest poems it has been subject of diverse scholarly interpretations auden s limestone landscape has been interpreted as an allegory of mediterranean civilization and of human body poem sui generis is not easily classified as a topographical poem it describes a landscape and infuses it with meaning it has been called first postmodern pastoral in a letter auden wrote of limestone and poem s theme that that rock creates only human landscape mendelson 1999 p 290 first published in horizon in july 1948 poem then appeared in his important 1951 collection nones a revised version was published beginning in 1958 and is prominently placed in last chronological section of auden s collected shorter poems 1922 1957 1966 themes thumb a view of ischia where auden wrote limestone auden visited ischia an island in gulf of naples with chester kallman in spring and summer 1948 and spent about six weeks on ischia in praise of limestone was first poem he wrote in italy titular limestone is characteristic of mediterranean landscape and is considered an allegory of history in poem properties of this sedimentary rock invoke sedentary and domestic picture of mediterranean culture calcium in limestone makes it water soluble and easily eroded yet limestone builds up over eons a stratum at a time out of organic matter recalling stratified history of mediterranean civilisation interpreting metaphor of ground in poetry critic rainer writes ground is a perfect symbol of cultural ethnic and national identity a confluence of historical and mythical individual and collective according to critic alan w france mediterranean s religious tradition and culture are contrasted in limestone with protestant and rationalistic gothic north he views poem as an attempt to rediscover sacramental quality of nature a quality still animate in under developed regions of mediterranean south in particular italy below rome mezzogiorno but thoroughly extirpated in germanic north by protestant asceticism and modern science auden then is looking on this landscape from outside as a member of northern community yet includes himself as one of inconstant ones thumb left rembrandt s scholar in meditation 1633 seeks an internal landscape other outsiders however constant and more single minded best and worst do not share his appreciation for landscape rather they never stayed here long but sought immoderate soils where beauty was not so external granite wastes attracted ascetic saints to be clays and gravels tempted would be tyrants who left slamming door an allusion to goebbels taunt that if nazis failed they would slam door with a bang that would shake universe and an older colder voice oceanic whisper beckoned really reckless romantic who renounce or deny life immoderate soils together represent danger of humans trying to be little gods on earth while limestone landscape promises that life s pleasures need not be incompatible with public responsibility and salvation after seeming to dismiss landscape as historically insignificant in these middle sections of poem auden justifies it in theological terms at end in a world where sins can be forgiven and bodies rise from dead limestone landscape makes a further point blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from having nothing to hide poem concludes by envisioning a realm like that of kingdom of god in physical not idealistic terms thumb limestone landscape rejects abstractions such as platonic idealism notion that substantive reality is only a reflection of a higher truth auden s literary executor and biographer edward mendelson and others interpret poem as an allegory of human body whose characteristics correspond to those of limestone landscape poet recognises that this landscape like body is not witness to great historical events but exists at a scale most suitable to humans limestone questions valuation of that which exists on a scale different from body politics fascination with consciousness and other abstractions smith 2004 pp 56 57 in this interpretation poem s ending lines justify landscape in theological terms and are also a theological statement of body s sacred significance poem is thus an argument against platonic and idealistic theologies in which body is inherently fallen and inferior to spirit this interpretation is consistent with auden s many prose statements about theological importance of body mendelson 1999 karst topography of auden s birthplace yorkshire also contains limestone some readings of poem have thus taken auden to be describing his own homeland auden makes a connection between two locales in a letter written from italy in 1948 to elizabeth mayer i hadn t realized how like italy is to my pennines maternal theme in poem is a point of entry into psychoanalytical interpretation of poem in which limestone landscape is a suitable backdrop for narcissism poem s band of rivals cavorting about steep stone exists in an aesthetic and spiritual torpor unable to conceive a god whose temper tantrums are moral and not to be pacified by a clever line or a good lay lacking inner conflict these youth will never separate or produce a new kind of art compared to trait s earlier literary treatments limestone s narcissism bodes not so much promise of a powerful aesthetic but an artistic culture which while it seduces is ultimately by gratification of its own desire structure and narration narrator s tone is informal and conversational attempting to conjure picture of a dialogue between reader and speaker who is evidently auden himself speaking directly in first person as he does in a large proportion of his work informality is established syntactically by enjambment only 13 of poem s 93 lines are clearly end stopped there are few instances of rhyme and about half lines end on unaccented syllables lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents auden adapted this syllabic construction from marianne moore smith 2004 57 pattern is reinforced by line indentation and confirmed by auden s own reading this structure mitigates tendency of normally accented english speech to fall into rhythm of iambic pentameter swift changes in sophistication of diction also occur in poem as in conversation and lend it an immediate informal quality poet s audience seems to change between halves of poem he first addresses in first person plural an audience of like minded readers or perhaps humans in general he is discursive and speaks from a historical perspective using imperatives such as mark these rounded slopes hear springs and examine this region at line 44 his listener becomes a single beloved person and tone becomes more private auden now refers to himself specifically and addresses an intimate as dear with a greater sense of urgency legacy mendelson auden s biographer summarises response to in praise of limestone in years following its publication readers found poem memorable but even critics who praised it did not pretend to understand it those who without quite knowing why felt grateful to it were perhaps responding to its secret defense of a part of themselves that almost everything else written in their century was teaching them to discredit or deny mendelson 1999 p 292 english poet stephen spender 1909 1995 called in praise of limestone one of century s greatest poems describing it as perfect fusion between auden s personality and power of acute moral observation of a more generalized psychological situation which is his great gift literary critic david daiches found it loose and unfulfilling poem became in praise of sandstone at hand of australian poet john tranter 1943 who created a poetic form called terminal in which only line ending words of source poem are kept in writing of a new work see also 1948 in poetry notes references category poetry by w h auden category 1948 poems category 1951 poems category works
