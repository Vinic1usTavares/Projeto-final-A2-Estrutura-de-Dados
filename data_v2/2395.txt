and fell trees for timber a pollen core extracted from a mire revealed that in late quaternary period area had a semi arid climate and a species restricted plant community since sri lanka has a long non written history there is a significant and logical folk story which also goes with epic ramayana with some deviations it is believed that mountain in horton plain to be place where king rawana

potash for sri lankans horton plains is very significant in their history and culture sir joseph dalton hooker had advised british government to leave all montane forests above 5000 ft undisturbed and an administrative order to this effect had been issued in 1873 that prevented clearing and felling of forests in region horton plains was designated as a wildlife sanctuary on 5 december 1969 and because of its biodiversity value was elevated to a national park on 18 march 1988 peak wilderness sanctuary which lies in west is contiguous with park land area covered by horton plains is horton

sri seen across grasslands of park frequent fire and grazing characterises communities of grassland flora grasslands are dominated by villosa and chrysopogon zeylanicus waterlogged swamps or slow

areas grass species such as juncus mutica eriocaulon spp and exacum trinervium are common tussock grasses such as chrysopogon zeylanicus and are found in wet hollows herbaceous flora of grasslands include temperate species including ranunculus pedicularis senecio gentiana and alchemilla and also tropical species such as eriocaulon and speciosa a rare endemic daffodil orchid most widespread

tree ferns cyathea spp a foliose lichen genus belonging to family which had not been recorded in sri lanka before was discovered here in 2007 there are conflicting views on how grasslands of park came into being whether man made or natural it is now believed that grasslands on dry slopes were created by forest clearance and fires while grasslands in low lying areas were naturally created by wet conditions frost and soil erosion fauna right thumb alt front view of a large brown deer with antlers sri lankan sambar deer occur in large herds vertebrate fauna of region includes 24 species of

threats and conservation management horton plains was a part of a large system of plains and forest cover that included agra moon plains and elk plains between 1831 and 1948 it became a sambar deer hunting ground elephants and wild boar were also hunted to a lesser extent during this period lower slopes were cleared initially for coffee and then for tea plantations as a result horton plains and peak wilderness became isolated from other forest and grassland areas potatoes were cultivated in grasslands but planting ceased in 1977 after being declared a national park these areas were reinstated as grasslands tourism related issues such as plant removal littering fires and noise pollution are major conservation issues gem mining timber logging collection of plants for ornamental and medicinal purposes encroachment poaching and vehicle traffic are other threats spread of invasive alien species such as gorse ulex europaeus mist flower ageratina riparia crofton weed ageratina

invasive species on horton plains some sambar deer have died due to eating polythene litter that blocked their food passages and visitors are banned from bringing polythene into park sambar have benefited from introduced pennisetum grass species a recent threat first reported in 1978 is forest dieback in some areas especially in peripheral region this has been severe with nearly a 50 in vegetation water deficiency has been attributed as main cause of dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with calophyllum walkeri being most affected a study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing dieback leaching of nutrients and resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to dieback tourist attractions right thumb alt view down a steep wooded
