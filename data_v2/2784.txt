red fox vulpes vulpes is largest of true foxes and one of most widely distributed members of order carnivora being present across entire northern hemisphere from arctic circle to north africa north america and eurasia it is listed as least concern by iucn its range has increased alongside human expansion having been introduced to australia where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations due to its presence in australia it is included on list of world s 100 worst invasive species red fox originated from smaller sized ancestors from eurasia during middle villafranchian period and colonised north america shortly after wisconsin glaciation among true foxes red fox represents a more progressive form in direction of carnivory apart from its large size red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments despite its name species often produces individuals with other colourings including leucistic and melanistic individuals forty five subspecies are currently recognised which are divided into two categories large northern foxes and small basal southern foxes of asia and north africa red foxes are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families such as a mated pair and their young or a male with several females having kinship ties young of mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits species primarily feeds on small rodents though it may also target rabbits game birds reptiles invertebrates and young ungulates fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes although red fox tends to kill smaller predators including other fox species it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators such as wolves coyotes golden jackals and medium and large sized felines species has a long history of association with humans having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology because of its widespread distribution and large population red fox is one of most important furbearing animals harvested for fur trade too small to pose a threat to humans it has extensively benefited from presence of human habitation and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas domestication of red fox is also underway in russia and has resulted in domesticated red fox terminology thumb juvenile red foxes are known as kits females are called vixens and young cubs are known as kits although arctic fox has a small native population in northern scandinavia while corsac fox s range extends into european russia red fox is only fox native to western europe and so is simply called fox in colloquial british english word fox comes from old english which derived from proto germanic compare with west frisian dutch vos and german fuchs this in turn derives from proto indo european puk thick haired tail compare to hindi puch tail b paka tail and lithuanian fur bushy tail also forms basis for fox s welsh name literally bushy from bush likewise from rabo tail lithuanian from tail and ojibwa from waa which refers to up and down bounce or flickering of an animal or its tail scientific term vulpes derives from latin word for fox and gives adjectives and evolution thumb comparative illustration of skulls of red fox left and ruppell s fox right note more developed facial area of former red fox is considered a more specialised form of vulpes than afghan corsac and bengal foxes in direction of size and adaptation to carnivory skull displays far fewer neotenous traits than in other species and its facial area is more developed it is however not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as tibetan fox origins species is eurasian in origin and may have evolved from either vulpes or related chinese v both of which lived during middle villafranchian earliest fossil specimens of v vulpes were uncovered in baranya hungary dating from 3 4 1 8 million years ago collection no authorized by alan turner liverpool john moores university entry by h o regan 8 december 2003 ancestral species was likely smaller than current one as earliest red fox fossils are smaller than modern populations earliest fossil remains of modern species date back to mid pleistocene in association with refuse of early human settlements this has led to theory that red fox was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts colonisation of north america red foxes colonised north american continent in two waves during or before illinoian glaciation and during wisconsinan glaciation gene mapping demonstrates that red foxes in north america have been isolated from their old world counterparts for over 400 000 years thus raising possibility that speciation has occurred and that previous binomial name of vulpes fulva may be valid in far north red fox fossils have been found in sangamonian stage deposits in fairbanks district and medicine hat fossils dating from wisconsinan are present in 25 sites in arkansas california colorado idaho missouri new mexico tennessee texas virginia and wyoming although they ranged far south during wisconsinan onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward north and have only recently reclaimed their former american ranges because of human induced environmental changes genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in north america which have been separated since wisconsinan northern or boreal refugium occurs in alaska and western canada and consists of large subspecies v v alascensis v v abietorum v v regalis and v v southern or montane refugium occurs in subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of rocky mountains cascade range and sierra nevada it encompasses subspecies v v macroura v v cascadensis and v v necator latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since last glacial maximum and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations although european foxes were introduced to portions of united states in 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of european fox haplotypes in any north american populations also introduced

feet have only four and lack dewclaws they are very agile being capable of jumping over fences and swim well vixens normally have four pairs of teats though vixens with seven nine or ten teats are not uncommon testes of males are smaller than those of arctic foxes their skulls are fairly narrow and elongated with small braincases their canine teeth are relatively long sexual dimorphism of skull is more pronounced than in corsac foxes with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males with wider nasal regions and hard palates as well as having larger canines their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles less crowded premolars more slender canine teeth and concave rather than convex profiles dimensions red foxes are largest species of genus vulpes however relative to dimensions red foxes are much lighter than similarly sized dogs of genus canis their limb bones for example weigh 30 percent less per unit area of bone than expected for

among northern foxes north american varieties generally have guard hairs while most eurasian red foxes have coarser fur fur in thermal windows areas such as head and lower legs is kept dense and short all year round while fur in other areas changes with seasons foxes actively control peripheral vasodilation and peripheral vasoconstriction in these areas to regulate heat loss there are three main colour morphs red silver black and cross see mutations in typical red morph their coats are generally bright reddish rusty with yellowish tints a stripe of weak diffuse patterns of many brown reddish chestnut hairs occurs along spine two additional stripes pass down shoulder blades which together with spinal stripe form a cross lower back is often a mottled silvery colour flanks are lighter

on angle of jaw and mandible behaviour thumb a pair of european red foxes at british wildlife centre surrey england thumb a pregnant fox in abruzzo national park italy social and territorial behaviour red foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode they use their urine to mark their territories a male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him whereas a female fox squats down so that urine is sprayed in ground between hind legs urine is also used to mark empty cache sites used to store found food as reminders not to waste time investigating them use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control position of scent mark red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory in favourable habitats and or areas with low hunting pressure subordinate foxes may be present in a range subordinate foxes may number one or two sometimes up to eight in one territory these subordinates could be formerly dominant animals but are mostly young from previous year who act as helpers in rearing breeding vixen s kits alternatively their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success non breeding vixens will guard play groom provision and retrieve kits an example of kin selection red foxes may

sperm formation in males begins in august september with testicles attaining their greatest weight in december february vixen s oestrus period lasts three weeks during which dog foxes mate with vixens for several days often in burrows male s bulbus glandis enlarges during copulation forming a copulatory tie which may last for more than an hour gestation period lasts 49 58 days though foxes are largely monogamous dna evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny incest and mixed paternity litters subordinate vixens may become pregnant but usually fail to whelp or have their kits killed postpartum by either dominant female or other subordinates thumb red fox cub thumb kits coming out of their den average litter size consists of four to six kits though litters of up to 13 kits have occurred large litters are typical in areas where fox mortality is high kits are born blind deaf and toothless with dark brown fluffy fur at birth they weigh and measure in body length and in tail length at birth they are short legged large headed and have broad chests mothers remain with kits for 2 3 weeks as they are unable to thermoregulate during this period fathers or barren vixens feed mothers vixens are very protective of their kits and have been known to even fight off terriers in their defence if mother dies before kits are independent father takes over as their provider kits eyes open after 13 15 days during which time their ear canals open and their upper teeth erupt with lower teeth emerging 3 4 days later their eyes are initially blue but change to amber at 4 5 weeks coat colour begins to change at three weeks of age when black eye streak appears by one month red and white patches are apparent on their faces during this time their ears erect and their muzzles elongate kits begin to leave their dens and experiment with solid food brought by their parents at age of 3 4 weeks lactation period lasts 6 7 weeks their woolly coats begin to be coated by shiny guard hairs after 8 weeks by age of 3 4 months kits are long legged narrow chested and sinewy they reach adult proportions at age of 6 7 months some vixens may reach sexual maturity at age of 9 10 months thus bearing their first litters at one year of age in captivity their longevity can be as long as 15 years though in wild they typically do not survive past 5 years of age denning behaviour thumb side and above view of a red fox den outside breeding season most red foxes favour living in open in densely vegetated areas though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes ravines bluffs steep banks of water bodies ditches depressions gutters in rock clefts and neglected human environments red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils dens built among tree roots can last for decades while those dug on steppes last only several years they may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks possibly as a defence mechanism against spread of disease in eurasian desert regions foxes may use burrows of wolves porcupines and other large mammals as well as those dug by gerbil colonies compared to burrows constructed by arctic foxes badgers marmots and corsac foxes red fox dens are not overly complex red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment main entrance of burrow leads downwards 40 45deg and broadens into a den from which numerous side tunnels branch burrow depth ranges from rarely extending to ground water main passage can reach in length standing an average of in spring red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements first with forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs throwing discarded soil over from burrow when kits are born discarded debris is trampled thus forming a spot where kits can play and receive food they may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers unlike badgers which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9 8 hours per day communication body language thumb left a european red fox v vulpes crucigera in an inquisitive posture thumb right a european red fox v vulpes crucigera in an alert posture red fox body language consists of movements of ears tail and postures with their body markings emphasising certain gestures postures can be divided into aggressive dominant and fearful submissive categories some postures may blend two together thumb a pair of wasatch mountain foxes v v macroura squabbling inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs male foxes courting females or after successfully evicting intruders will turn their ears outwardly and raise their tails in a horizontal position with tips raised upward when afraid red foxes grin in submission arching their backs curving their bodies crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls when merely expressing submission to a dominant animal posture is similar but without arching back or curving body submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture so that their muzzles reach up in greeting when two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food they approach each other sideways and push against each other s flanks betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls when launching an assertive attack red foxes approach directly rather than sideways with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways during such fights red foxes will stand on each other s upper bodies with their forelegs using open mouthed threats such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of same sex vocalisations red foxes have a wide vocal range and produce different sounds spanning five octaves which grade into each other recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits majority of sounds can be divided into contact and interaction calls former vary according to distance between individuals while latter vary according to level of aggression contact calls most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking wow wow wow sound which is often made by two foxes approaching one another this call is most frequently heard from december to february when they can be confused with territorial calls of tawny owls wow wow wow call varies according to individual captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre recorded calls of their pen mates but not those of strangers kits begin emitting wow wow wow call at age of 19 days when craving attention when red foxes draw close together they emit greeting similar to clucking of chickens adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises interaction calls when greeting one another red foxes emit high pitched whines particularly submissive animals a submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a siren like shriek during aggressive encounters with conspecifics they emit a throaty rattling sound similar to a ratchet called gekkering gekkering occurs mostly during courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances thumb left fox barks uk january 1977 another call that does not fit into two categories is a long drawn out monosyllabic sound as it is commonly heard during breeding season it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males when danger is detected foxes emit a monosyllabic bark at close quarters it is a muffled cough while at long distances it is sharper kits make warbling whimpers when nursing these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied ecology diet hunting and feeding behaviour thumb red fox with red foxes are omnivores with a highly varied diet research conducted in former soviet union showed red foxes consuming over 300 animal species and a few dozen species of plants they primarily feed on small rodents like voles mice ground squirrels hamsters gerbils woodchucks pocket gophers and deer mice secondary prey species include birds with galliformes and waterfowl predominating leporids porcupines raccoons opossums reptiles insects other invertebrates and flotsam marine mammals fish and echinoderms on very rare occasions foxes may attack young or small ungulates they typically target mammals up to about in weight and they require of food daily red foxes readily eat plant material and in some areas fruit can amount to 100 of their diet in autumn commonly consumed fruits include blueberries blackberries raspberries cherries persimmons mulberries apples plums grapes and acorns other plant material includes grasses sedges and tubers red foxes are implicated in predation of game and song birds hares rabbits muskrats and young ungulates particularly in preserves reserves and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are

although they typically forage alone they may aggregate in resource rich environments when hunting mouse like prey they first pinpoint their prey s location by sound then leap sailing high above their quarry steering in mid air with their tails before landing on target up to away they typically only feed on carrion in late evening hours and at night they are extremely possessive of their food and will defend their catches from even dominant animals red foxes may occasionally commit acts of surplus killing during one breeding season four foxes were recorded to have killed around 200 black headed gulls each with peaks during dark windy hours when flying conditions were unfavorable losses to poultry and penned game birds can be substantial because of this red foxes seem to dislike taste of moles but will nonetheless catch them alive and present them to their kits as playthings a 2008 2010 study of 84 red foxes in czech republic and germany found that successful hunting in long vegetation or under snow appeared to involve an alignment of fox with earth s magnetic field enemies and competitors thumb left red fox confronting a grey fox thumb golden eagle feeding on red fox thumb fox challenging two badgers red foxes typically dominate other fox species arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north where food is too scarce to support

to almost every island from aleutian islands to alexander archipelago during 1830s 1930s by fur companies red foxes invariably displaced arctic foxes with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident arctic foxes on a small island in 1866 where they are sympatric arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam rather than voles as favoured by red foxes both species will kill each other s kits given opportunity red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes as they hunt same prey all year red species is also stronger is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large sized rodents corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi desert and steppe areas in israel blanford s foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding open plains inhabited by red foxes red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human induced environmental changes red foxes will kill both species and compete for food and den sites grey foxes are exceptional as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet historically interactions between two species were rare as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes however interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox inhabited areas wolves may kill and eat red foxes in disputes over carcasses in areas in north america where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric fox ranges tend to be located outside coyote territories principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by foxes interactions between two species vary in nature ranging from active antagonism to indifference majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together in israel red foxes share their habitat with golden jackals where their ranges meet two canids compete due to near identical diets foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves in areas where jackals become very abundant population of foxes decreases significantly apparently because of competitive exclusion red foxes dominate raccoon dogs sometimes killing their kits or biting adults to death cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens both species compete for mouse like prey this competition reaches a peak during early spring when food is scarce in red fox predation accounted for 11 1 of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs and amounted to 14 3 of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north western russia red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels stone martens pine martens stoats and young sables eurasian badgers may live alongside red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows it is possible that two species tolerate each other out of mutualism foxes provide badgers with food scraps while badgers maintain shared burrow s cleanliness however cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them wolverines may kill red foxes often while latter are sleeping or near carrion foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses as latter s stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes foxes may harass hyenas using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid hyena s attacks sometimes foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake some foxes may their attacks and are killed fox remains are often found in hyena dens and hyenas may steal foxes from traps in eurasia red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards caracals and eurasian lynxes lynxes chase red foxes into deep snow where their longer legs and larger paws give them an advantage over foxes especially when depth of snow exceeds one metre in district in russia red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do north american felid predators of red foxes include cougars canadian lynxes and bobcats occasionally large raptors such as eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes while golden eagles have been known to kill adults distribution thumbnail right multicolored north american red fox red foxes are wide ranging animals whose range covers nearly they are distributed across entire northern hemisphere from arctic circle to north africa central america and asia they are absent in iceland arctic islands some parts of siberia and in extreme deserts red foxes are not present in new zealand and are classed as a prohibited new organism under hazardous substances and new organisms act 1996 preventing them from being imported australia in australia 2012 estimates indicate that there are more than 7 2 million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of continental mainland species became established in australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in british colonies of van diemen s land as early as 1833 and port phillip district of new south wales as early as 1845 for purpose of traditional english sport of fox hunting a permanent fox population was not established on island of tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by tasmanian devil on mainland however species was successful as an apex predator it is generally less common in areas where dingo is more prevalent however it has primarily through its burrowing behaviour achieved niche differentiation with both feral dog and feral cat as such it has become one of continent s most invasive species red fox has been implicated in extinction and decline of several native australian species particularly those of family including desert rat kangaroo spread of red foxes across southern part of continent has coincided with spread of rabbits in australia and corresponds with declines in distribution of several medium sized ground dwelling mammals including brush tailed bettongs burrowing bettongs rufous bettongs numbats bridled and most of these species are now limited to areas such as islands where red foxes are absent or rare local eradication programs exist although eradication has proven difficult due to denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting so focus is on management with introduction of state bounties refers to book australia s mammal extinctions a 50 000 year history christopher n johnson according to tasmanian government red foxes were introduced to previously fox free island of tasmania in 1999 or 2000 posing a significant threat to native wildlife including eastern and an eradication program conducted by tasmanian department of primary industries and water has been established sardinia italy origin of subspecies in sardinia italy is uncertain as it is absent from pleistocene deposits in their current homeland it is possible it originated during neolithic following its introduction to island by humans it is likely then that sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in mediterranean this latter theory may explain subspecies phenotypic diversity diseases and parasites left thumb european red fox with mange red foxes are most important rabies vector in europe in london arthritis is not uncommon in foxes being particularly frequent in spine foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia though they are not overly susceptible to latter they may also fall ill from listeriosis and as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas brucellosis and tick borne encephalitis a mysterious fatal disease near lake in novosibirsk oblast was noted among local red foxes but cause was undetermined possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes individual cases of foxes infected with pestis are known red foxes are not readily prone to infestation with fleas species like are probably only caught from fox s prey species while others like are caught whilst travelling fleas that feed on red foxes include irritans canis and ticks such as ixodes and i are not uncommon in foxes and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths louse vulpis specifically targets foxes but is found infrequently mite is most important cause of mange in red foxes it causes extensive hair loss starting from base of tail and hindfeet then rump before moving on to rest of body in final stages of condition foxes can lose most of their fur 50 of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities in epizootic phase of disease it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection other endoparasites include demodex which is frequently found in ear canal serrata which infects nasal passages and ringworms up to 60 helminth species are known to infect foxes in fur farms while 20 are known in wild several species of genera isospora and eimeria are also known to infect them most common nematode species found in fox guts are canis and capillaria aerophila and vulpis latter two infect their lungs capillaria infect

upright beagle and fox 1885 by bruno earliest historical records of fox hunting come from fourth century bc alexander great is known to have hunted foxes and a seal dated from 350 bc depicts a persian horseman in process of spearing a fox xenophon who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man s education advocated killing of foxes as pests as they distracted hounds from hares romans were hunting foxes by 80 ad during dark ages in europe foxes were considered secondary quarries but gradually grew in importance cnut great foxes as beasts of chase a lower category of quarry than beasts of venery foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as beasts of chase to point that by late 1200s edward i had a royal pack of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman in this period foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds rather than underground with terriers edward second duke of york assisted climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his master of game by renaissance fox hunting became a traditional sport of nobility after english civil war caused a drop in deer populations fox hunting grew in popularity by mid 1600s britain was divided into fox hunting territories with first fox hunting clubs being formed first was charlton hunt club in 1737 popularity of fox hunting in britain reached a peak during 1700s although already native to north america red foxes from england were imported for sporting purposes to virginia and maryland in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters these american fox hunters considered red species more sporting than grey species

their pelts are used for trimmings scarfs muffs jackets and coats they are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments including evening wraps pelts of silver morph foxes are popular as capes while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming number of sold fox scarves exceeds total number of scarves made from other furbearers however this amount is overshadowed by total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes silver morphs are most valued by furriers followed by cross and red morphs respectively in early 1900s over 1 000 american fox skins were imported to britain annually while 500 000 were exported annually from germany and russia total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985 86 was 1 543 995 pelts foxes amounted to 45 of us wild caught pelts worth 50 million pelt prices are increasing with 2012 north american wholesale auction prices averaging 39 and 2013 prices averaging 65 78 north american red foxes particularly those of northern alaska are most valued for their fur as they have guard hairs of a silky texture which after dressing allow wearer unrestricted mobility red foxes living in southern alaska s coastal areas and aleutian islands are an exception as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one third of price of their northern alaskan cousins most european peltries have coarse textured fur compared to north american varieties only exceptions are nordic and far eastern russian peltries but they are still inferior to north american peltries in terms of livestock and pet predation thumb carcass of a lamb near a fox den thumb fox in a birmingham garden investigates a rabbit hutch red foxes may on occasion prey on lambs usually lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens but not invariably lambs belonging to small breeds such as blackface are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as merino twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously crossbreeding small upland ewes with larger lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to heaviness of resulting offspring thus making lambs more at risk to fox predation lambs born from gimmers ewes breeding for first time are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers who stick closer to their young red foxes may prey on domestic rabbits and guinea pigs if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens this problem is usually averted by housing them in robust and runs urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them in physical confrontations cats usually have upper hand authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens although most foxes do not prey on cats some may do so and may treat them more as competitors rather than food taming and domestication in their unmodified wild state red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well meaning people during spring period though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young actual orphans are rare and ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site kits require almost constant supervision when still suckling they require milk at four hour intervals day and night once weaned they may become destructive to leather objects furniture and electric cables though generally friendly toward people when young captive red foxes become fearful of humans save for their handlers once they reach 10 weeks of age they maintain their wild counterpart s strong instinct of concealment and may pose a threat to domestic birds even when well fed although suspicious of strangers they can form bonds with cats and dogs even ones bred for fox hunting tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds a strain of truly domesticated red foxes was introduced by russian geneticist dmitry belyayev who over a 40 year period bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms selecting only those individuals that showed least fear of humans eventually belyayev s team selected only those that showed most positive response to humans thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed after about ten generations of controlled breeding these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection these behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations which included piebald coats floppy ears in pups and curled tails similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves urban foxes distribution red foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built up environments especially lower density suburbs although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from countryside throughout twentieth century they established themselves in many australian european japanese and north american cities species first colonised british cities during 1930s entering bristol and london during 1940s and later established themselves in cambridge and norwich in ireland they are now common in suburban dublin in australia red foxes were recorded in melbourne as early as 1930s while in zurich switzerland they only starting appearing in 1980s urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned low density housing they are rare in areas where industry commerce or council rented houses predominate in these latter areas distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources home range of these foxes average from whereas those in more residential areas average from in 2006 it was estimated that there were 10 000 foxes in london city dwelling foxes may have potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators in cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes behaviour urban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times it is uncommon to spot them during day but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on edges of a city visiting at night for sustenance while foxes will scavenge successfully in city and foxes tend to eat anything that humans eat some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for animals finding them endearing doing this regularly can attract foxes to one s home they can become accustomed to human presence warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with particularly young cubs urban fox control urban foxes can cause problems for local residents foxes have been known to steal chickens disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during breeding season in late january early february or from late april to august when new cubs are developing in uk hunting foxes in urban areas is banned and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable one alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them which appears to be a more viable method however killing foxes has little effect on population in an urban area those that are killed are very soon replaced either by new cubs during breeding season or by other foxes moving into territory of those that were killed a more effective method of fox control is to deter them from specific areas they inhabit deterrents such as creosote diesel oil or ammonia can be used cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox s return relationship between urban and rural foxes in january 2014 it was reported that fleet a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by university of brighton in partnership with bbc s had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in hove at western edge of east sussex across rural countryside as far as rye at eastern edge of county he was still continuing his journey when gps collar stopped transmitting due to suspected water damage along with setting a record for longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in united kingdom his travels have highlighted fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox
