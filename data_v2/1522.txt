show s success continued into 1980s in 1981 when federal government withdrew its funding ctw turned to and expanded other revenue sources including its magazine division book royalties product licensing and foreign broadcast income o dell pp 73 74 sesame streets curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships ethics and emotions many of show s storylines were taken from experiences of its writing staff cast and crew most notably 1982 death of will lee who played mr hooper and marriage of luis and maria in 1988 borgenicht p 80 by end of 1990s sesame street

of 21st century sesame street made major structural changes for example starting in 2002 its format became more narrative and included ongoing storylines after its thirtieth anniversary in 1999 due to

short films o dell p 70 when sesame street premiered most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans therefore new show s producers were concerned that an hour long show would not hold their audience s attention at first show s street scenes action taking place on its set consisted of character driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories instead they consisted of individual curriculum based segments which were interrupted by inserts consisting of puppet sketches short films and animations this structure allowed producers to use a mixture of styles and characters and to vary show s pace by season 20 research had shown that children were able to follow a story and street scenes while still interspersed with other segments became evolving storylines morrow p p 179 upon recommendations by child psychologists producers initially decided that show s human actors and muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children fisch bernstein p 39 when ctw tested appeal of new show they found that although children paid attention to shows during muppet segments their interest was lost during street segments gladwell p 105 producers requested that henson and his team create muppets such as big bird and oscar grouch to interact with human actors and street segments were re shot gladwell p bernstein pp 39 40 sesame streets format remained intact until 2000s when changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format in 1998 popular elmo s world a 15 minute long segment hosted by muppet elmo was created clash p 75 starting in 2014 during show s 45th season producers introduced a half hour version of program new version which originally complemented full hour series was both

broadcast platforms new version focused on fewer characters reduced pop culture references once included as winks for their parents and focused on a single backbone topic educational goals author malcolm gladwell said that sesame street was built around a single breakthrough insight that if you can hold attention of children you can educate them gladwell p 100 gerald s lesser ctw s first advisory board chair went even further saying that effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture focus and sustain children s attention lesser p 116 sesame street was first children s show to structure each episode and segments within them to capture children s attention and to make as gladwell put it small but critical adjustments to keep it gladwell p 91 according to ctw researchers rosemarie truglio and shalom fisch sesame street was one of few children s television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum garnered from formative and summative research creators of sesame street and their researchers formulated both cognitive and affective goals for show initially they focused on cognitive goals while addressing affective goals indirectly in belief that doing so would increase children s self esteem and feelings of competency morrow pp 76 106 one of their primary goals was preparing young children for school especially children from low income families lesser p 46 using modeling lesser pp 86 87 repetition lesser p 107 and humor to fulfill these goals they made changes in show s content to increase their viewers attention and to increase its appeal lesser p 87 and encouraged co viewing to encourage older children and parents to watch show by including more sophisticated humor cultural references and celebrity guest appearances after sesame streets first season its critics forced its producers and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence tolerance of diversity and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict these issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its street characters during 1980s show incorporated real life experiences of show s cast and crew including death of will lee mr hooper and pregnancy of sonia manzano maria to address affective concerns in later seasons sesame street addressed real life disasters such as september 11 terrorist attacks and hurricane katrina gikow p 165 show s goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion and then after first season on development of educational materials used in preschool settings innovative programs were developed because their target audience children and their families in low income inner city homes did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups gikow p 181 starting in 2006 workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of pbs specials and dvds focusing on how military deployment affects families of soldiers gikow pp 280 281 workshop s outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners health and wellness and safety gikow pp 286 293 in 2013 sw started sesame street in communities a branch of their outreach efforts to help families dealing with difficult issues funding as a result of cooney s initial proposal in 1968 carnegie institute awarded her an 1 million grant to create a new children s television program and establish ctw palmer fisch in fisch truglio p 3 renamed in june 2000 to sesame workshop sw cooney and morrisett procured additional multimillion dollar grants from u s federal government arthur vining davis foundations and ford foundation davis reported that cooney and morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from beginning they would drop idea of producing show davis p 105 as lesser reported funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks but created challenges in procuring future funding lesser p 17 after sesame streets initial success its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources from first season they understood that source of their funding which they considered seed money would need to be replaced davis p 203 1970s were marked by conflicts between ctw and federal government in 1978 u s department of education refused to deliver a 2 million check until last day of ctw s fiscal year as a result ctw decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers publishing and international sales for their funding in 1998 ctw accepted corporate sponsorship to raise funds for sesame street and other projects for first time they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer discovery zone their first corporate sponsor to air before and after each episode consumer advocate ralph nader who had previously appeared on sesame street called for a boycott of show saying that ctw was exploiting impressionable children in 2015 in response to funding challenges it was announced that premium television service hbo would air first run episodes of sesame street steve sw s chief operating officer called move one of toughest decisions we ever made according to new york times move drew an immediate backlash critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less advantaged children and their families original focus of show they also criticized choosing to air first run episodes on hbo a network with adult dramas and comedies production research producer joan ganz cooney has stated without research there would be no sesame street cooney in fisch truglio p xi in 1967 when cooney and her team began to plan show s development combining research with television production was as she put it positively heretical shortly after creating sesame street its producers began to develop what came to be called ctw model a system of planning production and evaluation that did not fully emerge until end of show s first season morrow p 68 according to morrow ctw model consisted of four parts interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts creation of a specific and age appropriate curriculum research to shape program directly and independent measurement of viewers learning cooney credited show s high standard in research procedures to harvard professors gerald s lesser who ctw hired to design show s educational objectives and edward l palmer who was responsible for conducting show s formative research and for bridging gap between show s producers and researchers cooney in fisch truglio p xii ctw conducted research in two ways in house formative research that informed and improved production mielke in fisch truglio pp 84 85 and independent summative evaluations conducted by educational testing service ets during show s first two seasons which measured its educational effectiveness cooney stated from beginning we planners of project designed show as an experimental research project with educational advisers researchers and television producers collaborating as equal partners borgenicht p 9 cooney also described collaboration as an arranged marriage writing sesame street has used many writers in its long history as peter hellman wrote in his 1987 article in new york magazine show of course depends upon its writers and it isn t easy to find adults who could identify interest level of a pre schooler fifteen writers a year worked on show s scripts but very few lasted longer than one season norman stiles head writer in 1987 reported that most writers would burn out after writing about a dozen scripts according to gikow sesame street went against convention of hiring teachers to write for show as most educational television programs did at time instead cooney and producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy gikow p 178 as stone stated writing for children is not so easy long time writer tony geiss agreed stating in 2009 it s not an easy show to write you have to know characters and format and how to teach and be funny at same time which is a big ambidextrous stunt gikow p 174 right 200px thumb alt facade of a large white building left having large pillars beneath a strip with dozens of windows and right three stories of large windows kaufman astoria studios where sesame street is taped show s research team developed an annotated document or writer s notebook which served as a bridge between show s curriculum goals and script development lesser p 101 notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points morrow p 82 provided extended definitions of curriculum goals and assisted writers and producers in translating goals into televised material palmer fisch in fisch truglio p 10 suggestions in notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible palmer fisch in fisch truglio p 11 research team in a series of meetings with writers also developed a curriculum sheet that described show s goals and priorities for each season after receiving curriculum focus and goals for season writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for characters and an assignment sheet was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic when a script was completed show s research team analyzed it to ensure that goals were met then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes lights and sets writers were present during show s taping which for first twenty four years of show took place in manhattan and after 1992 at kaufman astoria studios in queens to make last minute revisions when necessary media early in their history sesame street and ctw began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements they became as cooney put it a multiple media institution cherow o leary in fisch truglio p 197 in 1970 ctw created a non broadcast division responsible for creating and publishing books and sesame street magazine cherow o leary in fisch truglio pp 197 198 by 2019 sesame workshop

directed by jonathan would be produced jim henson creator of muppets owned trademarks to those characters and was reluctant to market them at first he agreed when ctw promised that profits from toys books computer games and other products were to be used exclusively to fund ctw and its outreach efforts gikow p 268 even though cooney and ctw had very little experience with marketing they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions any product line associated with show had to be educational and inexpensive and could not be advertised during show s airings davis p 204 as davis reported cooney stressed restraint prudence and caution in their marketing and licensing efforts director jon stone talking about music of sesame street said there was no other sound like it on television gikow p 220 for first time in children s television show s songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum gikow p 227 in order to attract best composers and lyricists ctw allowed songwriters like joe raposo sesame streets first musical director to retain rights to songs they wrote which earned them lucrative profits and helped show sustain public interest davis p 256 by 2019 there were 180 albums of sesame street music produced and its songwriters had received 11 grammys in late 2018 sw announced a multi year agreement with warner music group to re launch sesame street records in u s and canada for first time in 20 years an extensive catalog of sesame street recordings was made available to public in a variety of formats including cd and vinyl compilations

sesame street began when he and cooney met at one of curriculum planning seminars in boston author christopher finch reported that stone who had worked with henson previously felt that if they could not bring him on board they should make do without puppets henson was initially reluctant but he agreed to join sesame street to meet his own social goals he also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of sesame street muppets and to split any revenue they generated with ctw as morrow stated henson s puppets were a crucial part of show s popularity and it brought henson national attention morrow p 93 davis reported that henson was able to take arcane academic goals and translate them to effective and pleasurable viewing davis p 163 in early research muppet segments of show scored high and more muppets were added during first few seasons morrow reported that muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them they were stereotypical and predictable and they appealed to adults and older siblings morrow pp 94 95 although producers decided against depending upon a single host for sesame street instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors lesser p 99 they realized that a children s television program needed to have as lesser put it a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities lesser p 125 both human and muppet jon stone whose goal was to cast white actors in minority was responsible for hiring show s first cast he did not audition actors until spring 1969 a few weeks before five test shows were due to be filmed stone videotaped auditions and ed palmer took them out into field to test children s reactions actors who received most enthusiastic thumbs up were cast borgenicht p 15 for example loretta long was chosen to play susan when children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of i m a little teapot davis p 172 stone stated that casting was only aspect of show that was just completely haphazard davis p 195 most of cast and crew found jobs on sesame street through personal relationships with stone and other producers according to puppeteer marty robinson in 2019 longevity was common among show s cast and crew according to ctw s research children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults so they included children in many scenes lesser p 127 dave connell insisted that no child actors be used morrow p 84 so these children were non professionals unscripted and spontaneous many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control but adult cast learned to handle children s spontaneity flexibly even when it resulted in departures from planned script or lesson lesser pp 127 128 ctw research also revealed that children s hesitations and on air mistakes served as models for viewers gikow p 123 according to morrow this resulted in show having a fresh quality especially in its early years reception ratings when sesame street premiered in 1969 it aired on only 67 6 of american televisions but it earned a 3 3 nielsen rating which totaled 1 9 million households seligsohn leo february 9 1970 backstage at sesame street
