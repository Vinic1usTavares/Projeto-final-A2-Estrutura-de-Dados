fourteenth amendment amendment xiv to united states constitution was adopted on july 9 1868 as one of reconstruction amendments arguably one of most consequential amendments to this day amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following american civil war amendment was bitterly contested particularly by states of defeated confederacy which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in congress amendment particularly its first section is one of most litigated parts of constitution forming basis for landmark decisions such as brown v board of education 1954 regarding racial segregation roe v wade 1973 regarding abortion bush v gore 2000 regarding 2000 presidential election and obergefell v hodges 2015 regarding same sex marriage amendment limits actions of all state and local officials including those acting on behalf of such an official amendment s first section includes several clauses citizenship clause privileges or immunities clause due process clause and equal protection clause citizenship clause provides a broad definition of citizenship nullifying supreme court s decision in dred scott v sandford 1857 which had held that americans descended from african slaves could not be citizens of united states since slaughter house cases 1873 privileges or immunities clause has been interpreted to do very little due process clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life liberty or property without a fair procedure supreme court has ruled this clause makes most of bill of rights as applicable to states as it is to federal government as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy equal protection clause requires each state to provide equal protection under law to all people including all non citizens within its jurisdiction this clause has been basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups second third and fourth sections of amendment are seldom litigated however second section s reference to rebellion or other crime has been invoked as a constitutional ground for felony disenfranchisement fourth section was held in perry v united states 1935 to prohibit a current congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior congress fifth section gives congress power to enforce amendment s provisions by appropriate legislation however under city of boerne v flores 1997 this power may not be used to contradict a supreme court decision interpreting amendment text adoption proposal by congress in final years of american civil war and reconstruction era that followed congress repeatedly debated rights of black former slaves freed by 1863 emancipation proclamation and 1865 thirteenth amendment latter of which had formally abolished slavery following passage of thirteenth amendment by congress however republicans grew concerned over increase it would create in congressional representation of democratic dominated southern states because full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation rather than three fifths previously mandated by three fifths compromise southern states would dramatically increase their power in population based house of representatives regardless of whether former slaves were allowed to vote stromberg a plain folk perspective 2002 p 111 republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement stromberg a plain folk perspective 2002 p 112 in 1865 congress passed what would become civil rights act of 1866 guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race color or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to law a direct assault on black codes passed by many post war states black codes attempted to return ex slaves to something like their former condition by among other things restricting their movement forcing them to enter into year long labor contracts prohibiting them from owning firearms and preventing them from suing or testifying in court although strongly urged by moderates in congress to sign bill president andrew johnson vetoed it on march 27 1866 in his veto message he objected to measure because it conferred citizenship on freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in congress and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites three weeks later johnson s veto was overridden and measure became law despite this victory even some republicans who had supported goals of civil rights act began to doubt that congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws rosen jeffrey supreme court personalities and rivalries

prohibition of voluntary peonage 2012 p 1614 in late 1865 joint committee on reconstruction proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state this amendment passed house but was blocked in senate by a coalition of radical republicans led by charles sumner who believed proposal a compromise with wrong and democrats opposed to black rights consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by representative john a bingham of ohio which would enable congress to safeguard equal protection of life liberty and property of all citizens this proposal failed to pass house in april 1866 joint committee forwarded a third proposal to congress a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of first and second proposals as well as addressing issues of confederate debt and voting by ex confederates house of representatives passed house resolution 127 39th congress several weeks later and sent to senate for action resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed amendments to sections 2 3 and 4 were adopted on june 8 1866 and modified resolution

its ratification on june 16 1866 secretary of state william seward transmitted fourteenth amendment to governors of several states for its ratification state legislatures in every formerly confederate state with exception of tennessee refused to ratify it this refusal led to passage of reconstruction acts ignoring existing state governments military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and fourteenth amendment was ratified it also prompted congress to pass a law on march 2 1867 requiring that a former confederate state must ratify fourteenth amendment before said state shall be declared entitled to representation in congress an act to provide for more efficient government of rebel states enacted march 2 1867 429 first twenty eight states to ratify fourteenth amendment were connecticut june 30 1866 new hampshire july 6 1866 tennessee july 18 1866 new jersey september 11 1866 rescinded ratification february 20 1868 march 24 1868 re ratified april

after rejection december 20 1866 if rescission by ohio and new jersey were invalid south carolina would have been 28th state rescission by oregon did not occur until later these caused significant controversy however ratification by other states continued during course of debate alabama july 13 1868 on july 20 1868 secretary of state william h seward certified that if withdrawals of ratification by new jersey and ohio were ineffective then amendment had become part of constitution on july 9 1868 with ratification by south carolina following day congress adopted and transmitted to department of state a concurrent resolution declaring fourteenth amendment to be a part of constitution and directing secretary of state to promulgate it as such both new jersey and ohio were named in congressional resolution as having ratified amendment although alabama was also named making 29 states total on same day one more state ratified georgia july 21 1868 after rejection november 9 1866 on july 27 secretary seward received formal ratification from georgia following day july 28 secretary seward issued his official proclamation certifying adoption of fourteenth amendment secretary seward stated that his proclamation was in conformance to resolution by congress but his official list of states included both alabama and georgia as well as ohio and new jersey inclusion of ohio and new jersey has led some to question validity of rescission of a ratification inclusion of alabama and georgia has called that conclusion into question while there have been supreme court cases dealing with ratification issues this particular question has never been adjudicated fourteenth amendment was subsequently ratified virginia october 8 1869 after rejection january 9 1867 mississippi january

kentucky march 30 1976 after rejection january 8 1867 since ohio and new jersey re ratified fourteenth amendment in 2003 all u s states that existed during reconstruction have ratified amendment citizenship and civil rights background section 1 of amendment formally defines united states citizenship and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment supreme court held in civil rights cases 1883 that amendment was limited to state action and therefore did not authorize congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations though congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of constitution u s supreme court justice joseph p bradley commented in civil rights cases that individual invasion of individual rights is not subject matter of fourteenth amendment it has a deeper and broader scope it nullifies and makes void all state legislation and state action of every kind which impairs privileges and immunities of citizens of united states or which injures them in life liberty or property without due process of law or which denies to any of them equal protection of laws radical republicans who advanced thirteenth amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for newly freed people but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect graber subtraction by addition 2012 p 1523 framers of fourteenth amendment wanted these principles enshrined in constitution to

people were not citizens and could not become citizens nor enjoy benefits of citizenship mcdonald v chicago 130 s ct 3020 3060 2010 this clause unambiguously overruled this court s contrary holding in dred scott some members of congress voted for fourteenth amendment in order to eliminate doubts about constitutionality of civil rights act of 1866 jones v mayer 392 u s 409 1968 or to ensure that no subsequent congress could later repeal or alter main provisions of that act yen chin yung rights of citizens and persons under fourteenth amendment page 7 new era printing company 1905 civil rights act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all people born in united states if they were not subject to a foreign power and this clause of fourteenth amendment constitutionalized this rule there are varying interpretations of original intent of congress and of ratifying states based on statements made during congressional debate over amendment as well as customs and understandings prevalent at that time messner emily born in u s a part i debate washington post march 30 2006 some of major issues that have arisen about this clause are extent to which it included native americans its coverage of non citizens legally present in united states when they have a child whether clause allows revocation of citizenship and whether clause applies to illegal immigrants historian eric foner who has explored question of u s birthright citizenship to other countries argues that native americans during original congressional debate over amendment senator jacob m howard of michigan author of citizenship glenn march 20 2011 erosion of civil war consensus salon described clause as having same content despite different wording as earlier civil rights act of 1866 namely that it excludes native americans who maintain their tribal ties and persons born in united states who are foreigners aliens who belong to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 p 2893 senator reverdy johnson said in debate now all this amendment provides is that all persons born in united states and not subject to some foreign power for that no doubt is meaning of committee who have brought matter before us shall be considered as citizens of united states if there are to be citizens of united states entitled everywhere to character of citizens of united states there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is what has created character of citizen as between himself and united states and amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth and i know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than fact of birth within territory of united states born of parents who at time were subject to authority of united states according to historian glenn w of western kentucky university a good number of his fellow senators supported his view of citizenship clause others also agreed that children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 p 2897 congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 1 p 572 senator james rood doolittle of wisconsin asserted that all native americans were subject to united states jurisdiction so that phrase indians not taxed would be preferable congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 pp 2890 2892 4 2896 but senate judiciary committee chairman lyman trumbull and howard disputed this arguing that federal government did not have full jurisdiction over native american tribes which govern themselves and make treaties with united states congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 p 2893 trumbull during debate said what do we committee reporting clause mean by subject to jurisdiction of united states not owing allegiance to anybody else that is what it means he then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by complete jurisdiction can you sue a indian in court we make treaties with them and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction if we want to control or any other indians of which senator from wisconsin has spoken how do we do it do we pass a law to control them are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense would he sen doolittle think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations does government of united states pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one indian upon another it is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction who are subject to our laws that we think of making citizens congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 p howard additionally stated word jurisdiction meant same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of united states now and that u s possessed a full and complete jurisdiction over person described in amendment in elk v wilkins 1884 elk v wilkins clause s meaning was tested regarding whether birth in united states automatically extended national citizenship supreme court held that native americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not automatically gain national citizenship issue was resolved with passage of indian citizenship act of 1924 which granted full u s citizenship to indigenous peoples children born to foreign nationals fourteenth amendment provides that children born in united states and subject to its jurisdiction become american citizens at birth at time of amendment s passage president andrew johnson and three senators including trumbull author of civil rights act asserted that both civil rights globe 1st session 39th congress pt 1 p 2893 from debate on civil rights act p mr johnson who is a citizen of united states is an open question decision of courts and doctrine of commentators is that every man who is a citizen of state becomes ipso facto a citizen of united states but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in united states except through medium of a citizenship in a state congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 1 p 498 debate on civil rights act contained following exchange mr cowan i will ask whether it will not have effect of naturalizing children of chinese and gypsies born in this country mr trumbull undoubtedly mr trumbull i understand that under naturalization laws children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens this is law as i understand it at present time is not child born in this country of german parents a citizen i am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of counties of good old pennsylvania if children born of german parents are not citizens mr cowan honorable senator assumes that which is not fact children of german parents are citizens but germans are not chinese germans are not australians nor nor anything of kind that is fallacy of his argument mr trumbull if senator from pennsylvania will show me in law any distinction made between children of german parents and children of asiatic parents i may be able to appreciate point which he makes but law makes no such distinction and child of an asiatic is just as much of a citizen as child of a european and fourteenth amendment would confer citizenship to children born to foreign nationals in united states congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 4 pp 2891 2892 during debate on amendment senator john of california declared proposition before us i will say mr president relates simply in that respect to children begotten of chinese parents in california and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens we have declared that by law civil rights act now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in fundamental instrument of nation i am in favor of doing so i voted for proposition to declare that children of all parentage whatever born in california should be regarded and treated as citizens of united states entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens senator edgar cowan of pennsylvania had a decidedly different opinion congressional globe 1st session 39th congress pt 1 p 2891 from debate on civil rights act p mr cowan therefore i think before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in united states shall be taken to be citizen of united states we ought to exclude others besides indians not taxed because i look upon indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less to a society than i look upon gypsies i do not know how many my honorable friend from california looks upon chinese but i do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them i have no doubt that now they are useful and i have no doubt that within proper restraints allowing that state and other pacific states to manage them as they may see fit they may be useful but i would not tie their hands by constitution of united states so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit some scholars dispute whether citizenship clause should apply to children of unauthorized immigrants today as problem did not exist at time lee margaret birthright citizenship under 14th amendment of persons born in united states to alien parents congressional research service august 12 2010 over last decade or so concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to a re examination of a long established tenet of u s citizenship codified in citizenship clause of fourteenth amendment of u s constitution and a of immigration and nationality act ina 8 u s c a that a person who is born in united states subject to its jurisdiction is a citizen of united states regardless of race ethnicity or of parents some scholars argue that citizenship clause of fourteenth amendment should not apply to children of unauthorized aliens because problem of unauthorized aliens did not exist at time fourteenth amendment was considered in congress and ratified by states in 21st century congress has occasionally discussed passing a statute or a constitutional amendment to reduce practice of birth tourism in which a foreign national gives birth in united states to gain child s citizenship clause s meaning with regard to a child of immigrants was tested in united states v wong kim ark 1898 united states v wong kim ark supreme court held that under fourteenth amendment a man born within united states to chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in united states and are carrying out business in united states and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power was a citizen of united states subsequent decisions have applied principle to children of foreign nationals of non chinese descent according to foreign affairs manual which is published by state department despite widespread popular belief u s military installations abroad and u s diplomatic or consular facilities abroad are not part of united states within meaning of fourteenth amendment loss of citizenship loss of national citizenship is possible only under following circumstances fraud in naturalization process technically this is not a loss of citizenship but rather a voiding of purported naturalization and a declaration that immigrant never was a citizen of united states current policies are at affiliation with anti american organizations e g communist party terrorist organizations etc within 5 years of naturalization state department views such affiliations as sufficient evidence that an applicant must have lied or concealed evidence in naturalization process other than honorable discharge from u s armed forces before 5 years of honorable service if honorable service was basis for naturalization voluntary relinquishment of citizenship this may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by state department or through other actions that demonstrate desire to give up national citizenship for much of country s history voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship for example see perez v brownell overruled by afroyim v rusk this concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between united states and other countries bancroft treaties however supreme court repudiated this concept in afroyim v rusk 1967 afroyim v rusk as well as vance v terrazas 1980 vance v terrazas holding that citizenship clause of fourteenth amendment barred congress from revoking citizenship however congress can revoke citizenship that it has previously granted to a person not born in united states yoo john survey of law of expatriation memorandum opinion for solicitor general june 12 2002 privileges or immunities clause privileges or immunities clause which protects privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by states was patterned after privileges and immunities clause of article iv which protects privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states slaughter house cases in slaughter house cases 1873 supreme court concluded that constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship national citizenship and state citizenship and court held that privileges or immunities clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship court concluded that privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that owe their existence to federal government its national character its constitution or its laws court recognized few such rights including access to seaports and navigable waterways right to run for federal office protection of federal government while on high seas or in jurisdiction of a foreign country right to travel to seat of government right to peaceably assemble and petition government privilege of writ of habeas corpus and right to participate in government s administration this decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times e g united states v morrison largely as a result of narrowness of slaughter house opinion this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century shaman jeffrey constitutional interpretation illusion and reality p 248 greenwood publishing 2001 in saenz v roe 1999 saenz v roe court ruled that a component of right to travel is protected by privileges or immunities clause justice miller actually wrote in slaughter house cases that right to become a citizen of a state by residing in that state is conferred by very article under consideration emphasis added rather than by clause under consideration david privileges and immunities a reference guide to united states constitution p 104 greenwood 2003 in mcdonald v chicago 2010 justice clarence thomas while concurring with majority in incorporating second amendment against states declared that he reached this conclusion through privileges or immunities clause instead of due process clause randy barnett has referred to justice thomas s concurring opinion as a complete restoration of privileges or immunities clause barnett randy privileges or immunities clause alive again due process clause in 1884 case of hurtado v california u s supreme court said hurtado v california 110 u s 516 1884 due process clause of fourteenth amendment applies only against states but it is otherwise textually identical to due process clause of fifth amendment which applies against federal government both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process procedural due process is guarantee of a fair legal process when government tries to interfere with a person s protected interests in life liberty or property and substantive due process is guarantee that fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government due process clause of fourteenth amendment also incorporates most of provisions in bill of rights which were originally applied against only federal government and applies them against states substantive due process beginning with allgeyer v louisiana 1897 allgeyer v louisiana court interpreted due process clause as providing substantive protection to private contracts thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation this principle was referred to as freedom of contract thus court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in lochner v new york 1905 lochner v new york and struck down a minimum wage law in adkins v children s hospital 1923 adkins v children s hospital in meyer v nebraska 1923 meyer v nebraska court stated that liberty protected by due process clause however court did uphold some economic regulation such as state prohibition laws mugler v kansas 1887 mugler v kansas laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers holden v hardy 1898 holden v hardy laws declaring maximum hours for female workers muller v oregon 1908 muller v oregon and president woodrow wilson s intervention in a railroad strike wilson v new 1917 wilson v new as well as federal laws regulating narcotics united states v doremus 1919 united states v doremus court repudiated but did not explicitly overrule freedom of contract line of cases in west coast hotel v parrish 1937 west coast hotel v parrish in poe v ullman 1961 dissenting judge john marshall harlan ii adopted a broad view of liberty protected by fourteenth amendment due process clause this broad view of liberty was adopted by supreme court in griswold v parenthood of southeastern pa v casey 505 u s 833 at 849 for further information see below although freedom of contract described above has fallen into disfavor by 1960s court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in constitution but that according to court extend or derive from existing rights for example due process clause is also foundation of a constitutional right to privacy court first ruled that privacy was protected by constitution in griswold v connecticut 1965 which overturned a connecticut law criminalizing birth control griswold v connecticut while justice william o douglas wrote for majority that right to privacy was found in penumbras of various provisions in bill of rights justices arthur goldberg and john marshall harlan ii wrote in concurring opinions that liberty protected by due process clause included individual privacy right to privacy was basis for roe v wade 1973 roe v wade in which court invalidated a texas law forbidding abortion except to save mother s life like goldberg s and harlan s concurring opinions in griswold majority opinion authored by justice harry blackmun located right to privacy in due process clause s protection of liberty decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions and it became one of most controversial in court s history in planned parenthood v casey 1992 planned parenthood v casey court decided that essential holding of roe v wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed casey 505 u s at 845 846 in lawrence v texas 2003 lawrence v texas court found that a texas law against same sex sexual intercourse violated right to privacy in obergefell v hodges 2015 court ruled that fundamental right to marriage included same sex couples being able to marry procedural due process when government seeks to burden a person s protected liberty interest or property interest supreme court has held that procedural due process requires that at a minimum government provide person notice an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing and a decision by a neutral decision maker for example such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees expel a student from public school or cut off a welfare recipient s benefits see also mathews v eldridge 1976 court has also ruled that due process clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where judge has a conflict of interest for example in caperton v a t massey coal co 2009 caperton v a t massey coal co court ruled that a justice of supreme court of appeals of west virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court incorporation while many state constitutions are modeled after united states constitution and federal laws those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to bill of rights in barron v baltimore 1833 barron v baltimore supreme court unanimously ruled that bill of rights restrained only federal government not states however supreme court has subsequently held that most provisions of bill of rights apply to states through due process clause of fourteenth amendment under a doctrine called incorporation whether incorporation was intended by amendment s framers such as john bingham has been debated by legal historians according to legal scholar akhil reed amar framers and early supporters of fourteenth amendment believed that it would ensure that states would be required to recognize same individual rights as federal government all of these rights were likely understood as falling within privileges or immunities safeguarded by amendment by latter half of 20th century nearly all of rights in bill of rights had been applied to states supreme court has held that amendment s due process clause incorporates all of substantive protections of first second fourth fifth except for its grand jury clause and sixth amendments along with excessive fines clause and cruel and unusual punishment clause of eighth amendment while third amendment has not been applied to states by supreme court second circuit ruled that it did apply to states within that circuit s jurisdiction in v carey 677 f 2d 957 1982 seventh amendment right to jury trial in civil cases has been held not to be applicable to states but amendment s re examination clause does apply to a case tried before a jury in a state court and brought to supreme court on appeal on february 20 2019 supreme court ruled in timbs v indiana that excessive fines clause of eighth amendment applied to states equal protection clause thumb representative john bingham of ohio principal author of equal protection clause equal protection clause was created largely in response to lack of equal protection provided by law in states with black codes under black codes blacks could not sue give evidence or be witnesses they also were punished more harshly than whites in 1880 supreme court stated in strauder v west virginia that equal protection clause was clause mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by law although text of fourteenth amendment applies equal protection clause only against states supreme court since bolling v sharpe 1954 has applied clause against federal government through due process clause of fifth amendment under a doctrine called reverse incorporation bolling v sharpe 347 u s 497 1954 in yick wo v hopkins 1886 supreme court has clarified that meaning of person and within its jurisdiction in equal protection clause would not be limited to discrimination against african americans but would extend to other races colors and nationalities such as in this case legal aliens in united states who are chinese citizens yick wo v hopkins persons within its jurisdiction are entitled to equal protection from a state largely because privileges and immunities clause of article iv has from beginning guaranteed privileges and immunities of citizens in several states supreme court has rarely construed phrase within its jurisdiction in relation to natural persons in plyler v doe 1982 where court held that aliens illegally present in a state are within its jurisdiction and may thus raise equal protection v doe court explicated meaning of phrase within its jurisdiction as follows u se of phrase within its jurisdiction confirms understanding that fourteenth amendment s protection extends to anyone citizen or stranger who is subject to laws of a state and reaches into every corner of a state s territory court reached this understanding among other things from senator howard a member of joint committee of fifteen and floor manager of amendment in senate senator howard was explicit about broad objectives of fourteenth amendment and intention to make its provisions applicable to all who may happen to be within jurisdiction of a state relationship between fifth and fourteenth amendments was addressed by justice field in wong wing v united states 1896 wong wing v united states he observed with respect to phrase within its jurisdiction term person used in fifth amendment is broad enough to include any and every human being within jurisdiction of republic a resident alien born is entitled to same protection under laws that a citizen is entitled to he owes obedience to laws of country in which he is domiciled and as a consequence he is entitled to equal protection of those laws contention that persons within territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond protection of law was heard with pain on argument at bar in face of great constitutional amendment which declares that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of laws wong wing 163 u s at 242 243 justice field concurring in part and dissenting in part supreme court also decided whether foreign corporations are also within jurisdiction of a state ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in maintenance of suit when a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders that corporation is entitled to equal protection of laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations in santa clara county v southern pacific railroad 1886 court reporter included a statement by chief justice morrison waite in decision s headnote this dictum which established that corporations enjoyed personhood under equal protection clause was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts it remained predominant view throughout twentieth century though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as hugo black and william o douglas between 1890 and 1910 fourteenth amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving rights of blacks 288 to 19 in decades following adoption of fourteenth amendment supreme court overturned laws barring blacks from juries strauder v west virginia 1880 strauder v west virginia or discriminating against chinese americans in regulation of laundry businesses yick wo v hopkins 1886 as violations of equal protection clause however in plessy v ferguson 1896 plessy v ferguson supreme court held that states could impose racial segregation so long as they provided similar facilities formation of separate but equal doctrine court went even further in restricting equal protection clause in berea college v kentucky 1908 berea college v kentucky holding that states could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having both black and white students by early 20th century equal protection clause had been eclipsed to point that justice oliver wendell holmes jr dismissed it as usual last resort of constitutional arguments thumb left upright 0 9 thurgood marshall served as chief counsel in landmark fourteenth amendment decision brown v board of education 1954 court held to separate but equal doctrine for more than fifty years despite numerous cases in which court itself had found that segregated facilities provided by states were almost never equal until brown v board of education 1954 reached court brown v board of education in brown court ruled that even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers segregation was inherently harmful to black students and so was unconstitutional brown met with a campaign of resistance from white southerners and for decades federal courts attempted to enforce browns mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention this resulted in controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down by federal courts in various parts of nation in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no 1 2007 court ruled that race could not be determinative factor in determining to which public schools parents may transfer their children parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no 1 in plyler v doe 1982 supreme court struck down a texas statute denying free public education to illegal immigrants as a violation of equal protection clause of fourteenth amendment because discrimination on basis of illegal immigration status did not further a substantial state interest court reasoned that illegal aliens and their children though not citizens of united states or texas are people in any ordinary sense of term and therefore are afforded fourteenth amendment protections in hernandez v texas 1954 court held that fourteenth amendment protects those beyond racial classes of white or negro and extends to other racial and ethnic groups such as mexican americans in this case hernandez v texas in half century following brown court extended reach of equal protection clause to other historically disadvantaged groups such as women and illegitimate children although it has applied a somewhat less stringent standard than it has applied to governmental discrimination on basis of race united states v virginia 1996 united states v virginia levy v louisiana 1968 levy v louisiana supreme court ruled in regents of university of california v bakke 1978 regents of university of california v bakke that affirmative action in form of racial quotas in public university admissions was a violation of title vi of civil rights act of 1964 however race could be used as one of several factors without violating of equal protection clause or title vi in gratz v bollinger 2003 gratz v bollinger and grutter v bollinger 2003 grutter v bollinger court considered two race conscious admissions systems at university of michigan university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity in gratz court struck down a points based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status finding that its rigidity violated equal protection clause in grutter court upheld a race conscious admissions process for university s law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission in fisher v university of texas 2013 court ruled that before race can be used in a public university s admission policy there must be no workable race neutral alternative fisher v university of texas in schuette v coalition to defend affirmative action 2014 court upheld constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on state or local use of affirmative action schuette v coalition to defend affirmative action reed v reed 1971 reed v reed which struck down an idaho probate law favoring men was first decision in which court ruled that arbitrary gender discrimination violated equal protection clause in craig v boren 1976 craig v boren court ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications had to be subjected to an intermediate standard of judicial review reed and craig later served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws discriminating by gender since wesberry v sanders 1964 wesberry v sanders and reynolds v sims 1964 reynolds v sims supreme court has interpreted equal protection clause as requiring states to apportion their congressional districts and state legislative seats according to one man one vote court has also struck down redistricting plans in which race was a key consideration in shaw v reno 1993 shaw v reno court prohibited a north carolina plan aimed at creating majority black districts to balance historic in state s congressional delegations equal protection clause served as basis for decision in bush v gore 2000 bush v gore in which court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of florida s votes in 2000 presidential election could be held within needed deadline decision effectively secured bush s victory in disputed election in league of united latin american citizens v perry 2006 league of united latin american citizens v perry court ruled that house majority leader tom delay s texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted votes of latinos and thus violated equal protection clause state actor doctrine individual liberties guaranteed by united states constitution other than thirteenth amendment s ban on slavery protect not against actions by private persons or entities but only against actions by government officials regarding fourteenth amendment supreme court ruled in shelley v kraemer 1948 shelley v kraemer t he action inhibited by first section of fourteenth amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of states that amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct however discriminatory or wrongful court added in civil rights cases 1883 it is state action of a particular character that is prohibited individual invasion of individual rights is not subject matter of amendment it has a deeper and broader scope it nullifies and makes void all state legislation and state action of every kind which impairs privileges and immunities of citizens of united states or which injures them in life liberty or property without due process of law or which denies to any of them equal protection of laws vindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those situations where there is state action meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power in ex parte virginia 1880 ex parte virginia supreme court found that prohibitions of fourteenth amendment have reference to actions of political body denominated by a state by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken a state acts by its legislative its executive or its judicial authorities it can act in no other way constitutional provision therefore must mean that no agency of state or of officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of laws whoever by virtue of public position under a state government deprives another of property life or liberty without due process of law or denies or takes away equal protection of laws violates constitutional inhibition and as he acts in name and for state and is clothed with state s power his act is that of state jackson v metropolitan edison co there are however instances where people are victims of civil rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors in 1960s united states supreme court adopted an expansive view of state action opening door to wide ranging civil rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors i e acts done or otherwise sanctioned in some way by state court found that state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities due process and equal protection of laws critical factor in determining existence of state action is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations but inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between state and challenged action of regulated entity so that action of latter may be fairly treated as that of state itself only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can involvement of state in private conduct be attributed its true significance burton v wilmington parking authority supreme court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party acted under color of challenged statute but also that its actions are properly attributable to state flagg bros inc v brooks and actions are to be attributable to state apparently only if state compelled actions and not if state merely established process through statute or regulation under which private party acted rules developed by supreme court for business regulation are that 1 mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of state for purposes of fourteenth amendment and 2 a state normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement either overt or covert that choice must be deemed to be that of state apportionment of representation in house of representatives under article i section 2 clause 3 basis of representation of each state in house of representatives was determined by adding three fifths of each state s slave population to its free population because slavery except as punishment for crime had been abolished by thirteenth amendment freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment this situation was a concern to republican leadership of congress who worried that it would increase political power of former slave states even as they continued to deny freed slaves right to vote two solutions were considered reduce congressional representation of former slave states for example by basing representation on number of legal voters rather than number of inhabitants guarantee freed slaves right to vote on january 31 1866 house of representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state s representation in house in proportion to which that state used race or color as a basis to deny right to vote in that state amendment failed in senate partly because radical republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race neutral criteria such as educational and property qualifications to disenfranchise freed slaves without negative consequence so amendment was changed to penalize states in which vote was denied to male citizens over twenty one for any reason other than participation in crime later fifteenth amendment was adopted to guarantee right to vote could not be denied based on race or color effect of section 2 was twofold although three fifths clause was not formally repealed it was effectively removed from constitution in words of supreme court in elk v wilkins section 2 abrogated so much of corresponding clause of original constitution as counted only three fifths of such persons slaves it was intended to penalize by means of reduced congressional representation states that withheld franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime this it was hoped would induce former slave states to recognize political rights of former slaves without directly forcing them to do so something that it was thought states would not accept enforcement first reapportionment after enactment of fourteenth amendment occurred in 1873 based on 1870 census congress appears to have attempted to enforce provisions of section 2 but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state s representation in implementing statute congress added a provision stating that a nearly identical provision remains in federal law to this day despite this legislation in subsequent no change has ever been made to any state s congressional representation on basis of amendment writing in 1960 suggested that t he hot political nature of such proposals has doomed them to failure aided by this lack of enforcement southern states continued to use to prevent many blacks from voting until passage of voting rights act of 1965 in fourth circuit case of saunders v wilkins 1945 saunders claimed that virginia should have its congressional representation reduced because of its use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions plaintiff sued for right to run for congress at large in state rather than in one of its designated congressional districts lawsuit was dismissed as a political question influence on voting rights some have argued that section 2 was implicitly repealed by fifteenth amendment but supreme court acknowledged section 2 in later decisions in minor v happersett 1875 supreme court cited section 2 as supporting its conclusion that right to vote was not among privileges and immunities of citizenship protected by section 1 women would not achieve equal voting rights throughout united states until adoption of nineteenth amendment in 1920 in richardson v ramirez 1974 court cited section 2 as justifying states disenfranchising felons richardson v ramirez in hunter v underwood 1985 a case involving disenfranchising black supreme court concluded that tenth amendment cannot save legislation prohibited by subsequently enacted fourteenth amendment more specifically court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from operation of equal protection clause by other crime provision of section 2 court held that section 2 was not designed to permit purposeful racial discrimination which otherwise violates section 1 of fourteenth amendment hunter v underwood criticism abolitionist leaders criticized amendment s failure to specifically prohibit states from denying people right to vote on basis of race section 2 protects right to vote only of adult males not adult females making it only provision of constitution to explicitly discriminate on basis of sex section 2 was condemned by women s suffragists such as elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights separation of black civil rights from women s civil rights split two movements for decades participants in rebellion section 3 prohibits election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection rebellion or treason however a two thirds vote by each house of congress can override this limitation in 1898 congress enacted a general removal of section 3 s limitation in 1975 citizenship of confederate general robert e lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution retroactive to june 13 1865 in 1978 pursuant to section 3 congress posthumously removed service ban from confederate president jefferson davis section 3 was used to prevent socialist party of america member victor l berger convicted of violating espionage act for his anti militarist views from taking his seat in house of representatives in 1919 and 1920 validity of public debt section 4 confirmed legitimacy of all public debt appropriated by congress it also confirmed that neither united states nor any state would pay for loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by confederacy for example during civil war several british and french banks had lent large sums of money to confederacy to support its war against union in perry v united states 1935 supreme court ruled that under section 4 voiding a united states bond went beyond congressional power debt ceiling crises of 2011 and 2013 raised question of what is president s authority under section 4 some such as legal scholar garrett epps fiscal expert bruce bartlett and treasury secretary timothy geithner have argued that a debt ceiling may be unconstitutional and therefore void as long as it interferes with duty of government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make payments owed to pensioners that is social security and railroad retirement act recipients legal analyst jeffrey rosen has argued that section 4 gives president unilateral authority to raise or ignore national debt ceiling and that if challenged supreme court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss case altogether for lack of standing erwin chemerinsky professor and dean at university of california irvine school of law has argued that not even in a dire financial emergency could president raise debt ceiling as there is no reasonable way to interpret constitution that allows him to do so jack balkin knight professor of constitutional law at yale university opined that like congress president is bound by fourteenth amendment for otherwise he could violate any part of amendment at will because president must obey section 4 requirement not to put validity of public debt into question balkin argued that president obama is obliged to prioritize incoming revenues to pay public debt interest on government bonds and any other vested obligations what falls into latter category is not entirely clear but a large number of other government obligations and certainly payments for future services would not count and would have to be sacrificed this might include for example social security payments power of enforcement section 5 also known as enforcement clause of fourteenth amendment enables congress to pass laws enforcing amendment s other provisions in civil rights cases 1883 civil rights cases supreme court interpreted section 5 narrowly stating that legislation which congress is authorized to adopt in this behalf is not general legislation upon rights of citizen but corrective legislation in other words amendment authorizes congress to pass laws only to combat violations of rights protected in other sections in katzenbach v morgan 1966 katzenbach v morgan court upheld section 4 e of voting rights act of 1965 which prohibits certain forms of literacy requirements as a condition to vote as a valid exercise of congressional power under section 5 to enforce equal protection clause court ruled that section 5 enabled congress to act both and prophylactically to protect rights guaranteed by amendment however in city of boerne v flores 1997 city of boerne v flores court narrowed congress s enforcement power holding that congress may not enact legislation under section 5 that substantively defines or interprets fourteenth amendment rights court ruled that legislation is valid under section 5 only if there is a congruence and proportionality between injury to a person s fourteenth amendment right and means congress adopted to prevent or remedy that injury flores 521 u s at 507 selected supreme court cases citizenship 1884 elk v wilkins 1898 united states v wong kim ark 1967 afroyim v rusk 1980 vance v terrazas 1982 plyler v doe
