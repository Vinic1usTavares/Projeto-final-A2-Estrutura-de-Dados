worlebury camp also known as worlebury hillfort is site of an iron age hillfort on worlebury hill north of weston super mare in somerset england fort was designed for defence as is evidenced by number of walls and ditches around site several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around sides of fort lower down on hillside nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into bedrock and many of these had human remains coins and other artefacts in them during 19th and 20th centuries fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions site has been designated a scheduled monument it falls within weston woods local nature reserve which was declared to natural england by north somerset council in 2005 history thumb 300px left animated lidar data of worlebury camp in ancient entrenchments and camps of gloucestershire edward j burrow mentions that probably either goidel or brython people initially built worlebury camp people subsequently overthrew initial inhabitants and occupied camp for a time but they were finally destroyed at hands of romans worlebury camp has been explored at various times over a period of 150 years from 1851 to 1852 charles dymond edwin martin atkins and francis warre excavated and surveyed worlebury camp dymond returned in 1880 to continue excavation which lasted until 1881 another century passed before woodspring museum from weston super mare excavated more of worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988 finally in 1998 avon extensive urban study team performed latest as of 2008 assessment of site location thumb plan of camp fort is located on summit of worlebury hill above sea level it is in present day north somerset above seaside resort of weston super mare and close to village of worle its occupants would have had a view of countryside as well as any potential invaders they would have been able to see out over to sugar loaf mountain black mountains mendip hills dunkery beacon sand point and wales this view is no longer as unobstructed as it once was because there are so many trees spread over hill archaeological findings platforms there are a number of triangular platforms on slopes around fort apexes of these triangles are flush with hillside with base projecting in downhill direction however upper surface is approximately level front faces of these platforms are about above hillside and they have ditches in front of them to improve their defence in a letter to warre atkins theorised that structures were slingers platforms or archers stations several sling stones have been found around them offering some credence to theory that slingers stood upon these platforms dymond mentions stones in his book walls and ditches thumb an artist s rendition of worlebury camp from a book published in 1886 worlebury hill is bordered on its north and west sides by steep cliffs dropping down into bristol channel between weston bay and sand bay these would have rendered fort nearly invulnerable to attack from those directions nevertheless fort still has one wall on its north side and one on its west side both very near edge of cliffs on south side a single rampart and a ditch guarded fort level east side was protected by two stone ramparts and five ditches parts of these ramparts were over high measuring from bottom of ditch as of 1875 walls themselves are around thick however because they are dry laid stone removal of a few stones would be sufficient to bring entire wall collapsing down to prevent access to walls themselves inhabitants of fort raised large breastworks around base of walls by piling up rock rubble against bases these rubble barriers are over high and in places they are over thick attackers would have had to clear away rubble before being able to attack wall and all while they would be under direct fire from defenders on top of wall storage pits thumb right storage pits area inside outer wall has a series of hut circles and 93 storage pits cut directly into bedrock which is only around beneath surface of soil in most places eighteen of storage pits are in what dymond calls keep one is in transverse fosse a fosse is a ditch usually dug for protection and seventy four of pits are outside keep but still enclosed within exterior walls average size of pits is around long by 2 metres wide and deep largest pit is roughly triangular with sides measuring and long smallest pit is long by wide inhabitants used them to store grain as is evidenced by kernels of barley and wheat and shards of pots that were found in pits several of pits contained remnants of peas and remains of burned woven baskets in addition researchers also found sling stones and spindle whorls dated to 1st or 2nd century bc in them thumb 150px a skull found during dymond s second exploration which is gouged with many cuts from an edged weapon drawn in 1886 for dymond s book worlebury an ancient stronghold in county of somerset eighteen of these pits were found to contain remains of human skeletons which are now stored in weston super mare museum in weston super mare eighteen full skeletons were found of which ten show evidence of a violent death including sword cuts in skulls it is possible that romans or belgic raiders attacked fort and killed inhabitants artefacts a cast copper alloy penannular collar of special interest to archaeologists has been found at campsite it may indicate that this hilltop site was used even before iron age since related artefacts tend to be found with bronze age items and it was first of its type found in britain in 2006 a related copper penannular brooch dating to 5th or 6th century ad was found in a spring between brecon beacons and black mountains in wales a gold penannular bracelet was found in perry river pp 73 74 roman coins have been found at worlebury camp since romans had established a presence by end of 1st century ad many of roman coins bear image of western roman emperor honorius this was inside fort proper another coin was located by trinity path which leads towards fort other findings at site include animal remains including bones of pigs oxen horses deer goats and even small birds limpet shells have also been found near bones archaeologists found iron objects adding further credibility to idea that this fort is from iron age these objects include a chisel or borer several spearheads and javelin heads and an iron cone with charred wood inside and a rivet hole through cone dymond assumes that this cone was once a stone artefacts mainly and scrapers have been discovered at site just less than 36 flint chips have been found of which some may be arrowheads one good quality arrowhead has been found in addition to these dymond recorded finding a lead lump about size of a walnut that he decided was probably a sling bullet glastonbury type bead rim pottery was also found at this site a socketed bronze axe from late bronze age which was found at worlebury hill in 1883 is in ashmolean museum damage to site thumb 19th century quarry on south side of hill seen looking north from south road 19th century development of weston super mare since 19th century has resulted in three episodes of potentially irreversible damage to site a quarry started operation in southern side of worlebury hill in 1815 to mine for galena calamine and stone bristol and exeter railway arrived in weston super mare in 1841 making it profitable to expand village into a town in 1842 weston super mare became a town with granting of improvement and market act of may 1842 this act also proposed developing houses right over brow of hill this would have gone straight through worlebury camp however actual expansion never reached site by 1853 some development had occurred according to proposed expansion but it had skirted hillfort and continued to east 20th century in early 20th century worlebury fort itself was damaged by boys rolling stones including some from walls of fort down hill on which it stands axbridge district of somerset archaeological society was taking steps to prevent such damage from happening again some of trees planted in early 19th century had become very large and their roots were growing into archaeological structures in 2005 forestry commission gave permission for north somerset council to fell 300 trees to reduce subsequent risks a member of north somerset council christopher richards said if we had a storm up here and these trees came down then entire hillfort could be destroyed see also archeological site list of hill forts in england
