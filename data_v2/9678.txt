board an agency of government of canada after her first year at concordia university in montreal after working there as an assistant for some years she wrote and pitched a script to company which led to her career as a director and animator she first wrote script for danish poet some time ago though she says that she can t really remember when production was split between marcy page of national film board and lise fearnley of mikrofilm as in norway and took roughly three years although kove took a year off for maternity leave film was made using hand drawn traditional animation with pencil on paper and then scanned and digitally coloured with about half of animation by kove and rest divided between animators in montreal and norway kove s style is simplistic which she says is less a specific style choice than quite simply only one i know how to do backgrounds were painted by montreal artist anne ashton narrator liv ullmann was selected for film because kove liked her voice and thought that her delivery would be right for story she reaffirmed this after film s release stating that ullmann was just right she thanked ullmann in her academy award acceptance speech saying that it was really amazing of her to participate in this origins kove s first ideas for danish poet began when she went through a period of self assessment she wanted to write a story about what she described as when you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think how in heck did i get here and you realize that answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff like genetic make up upbringing coincidences choices you made along way missed opportunities and lucky breaks she felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people because relationships and especially romantic ones play a huge role in shaping our lives and also obviously in creating new ones kove originally wanted to make film biographical based on a story her father told her he had dreamed of being an artist and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough to make it in art world however he stood at top of stairs and decided not to go eventually deciding to go to architecture school as his parents wanted where he met his wife kove s inspiration was drawn from fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision because if artist had said oh you must paint you know then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother and you know that would have been it for my chances however kove felt story was too personal and rewrote it to be fictional themes film s main theme shows effect that coincidence and chance can have on course of life like bad weather angry dog hungry goats slippery planks and careless postman that change course of both kaspar s and ingeborg s lives and shows as film s website states that seemingly unrelated factors might play important roles in big scheme of things after all in an interview kove said that what i m trying to get across is just that i think life is really a kind of a meandering journey a lot is really up to chance however kove has also said that she d like people to be able to interpret film in different ways i d like them to walk away thinking it s a film that can be interpreted in more than one way i m happy when i hear from people who ve seen short that it makes them think about kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love and kind of of just being alive and having a life i m pleased when people get that out of it she also identifies several subplots of artistic inspiration as kaspar finds inspiration within himself and not within another writer and a subtext about nationalism and how much emphasis we in western world put on stereotypes and on which country we re from awards danish poet received academy award for animated short film at 79th academy awards in 2007 a second oscar nomination and first win for
