known after first professional street based dance crews formed in 1970s in united states most influential groups were rock steady crew lockers and electric boogaloos who are responsible for spread of breaking locking and popping respectively brooklyn based dance style uprock influenced breaking early in its development boogaloo gained more exposure because it is namesake of electric boogaloos crew uprock roboting and boogaloo are respected dance styles but none of them are as mainstream or popular as breaking locking and popping parallel with evolution of hip hop music hip hop social dancing emerged from breaking and funk styles into different forms dances from 1990s such as running man worm and cabbage patch entered mainstream and became fad dances after millennium newer social dances such as cha cha slide and dougie also caught on and became very popular hip hop dance is not a studio derived style street dancers developed it in urban neighborhoods without a formal process all of early substyles and social dances were brought about through a combination of events including inspiration from james brown dj kool herc s invention of break beat formation of dance crews and don cornelius creation of television show soul train birth of breaking according to hip hop activist afrika bambaataa and b boy richard crazy legs colon purest hip hop dance style breaking commonly called breakdancing began in early 1970s as elaborations on how james brown danced to his song get on good foot chang 2005 p 76 people mimicked these moves in their living rooms in hallways and at parties it was at these parties that breaking flourished and developed with help of a young clive campbell campbell better known as dj kool herc was a jamaican born dj who frequently spun records at neighborhood teenage parties in bronx jeff chang in his book can t stop won t stop 2005 describes dj kool herc s eureka moment in this way herc carefully studied dancers i was smoking cigarettes and i was waiting for records to finish and i noticed people was waiting for certain parts of record he says it was an insight as profound as ruddy redwood s dub discovery moment when dancers really got wild was in a song s short instrumental break when band would drop out and rhythm section would get elemental forget melody chorus songs it was all about groove building it keeping it going like a string theorist herc zeroed in on fundamental vibrating loop at heart of record break chang 2005 p 79 in response to this revelation herc developed merry go round technique to extend breaks percussion interludes or instrumental solos within a longer work of music when he played a break on one turntable he repeated same break on second turntable as soon as first was finished he then looped these records one after other in order to extend break as long as he wanted and once they heard that that was it wasn t no turning back herc told chang they always wanted to hear breaks after breaks after breaks after breaks it was during these times that dancers later known as break boys or b boys would perform what is known as breaking thumb right 270px a b boy performing in union square san francisco alt five young men

shuffles hitting motions and movements that mimic fighting when there was an issue over turf two warlords of feuding gangs would uprock and whoever won this preliminary dance battle decided where real fight would be because uprock s purpose was to moderate gang violence it never crossed over into mainstream breaking as seen today except for some specific moves adopted by breakers who use it as a variation for their toprock aside from james brown and uprock hip hop historian jorge pabon writes that toprock was also influenced by tap dance lindy hop salsa afro cuban and various african and native american dances chang 2006 p 20 from toprock breaking progressed to being more floor oriented involving freezes head spins and windmills chang 2005 pp 117 118 138 these additions occurred due to influences from 1970s martial arts films chang 2006 p 20 early influences on b boying and b girling also included martial arts films from 1970s influences from gymnastics and formation of dance

described by pabon as a form of self defense disguised as a dance its influence on breaking is disputed and debated one side believes that breaking came from capoeira while other side denies this capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and since both art forms are acrobatic some moves look similar to each other however capoeira is more rule oriented one rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista s back can never touch ground taylor 2007 p 170 in contrast a breaker s back is almost always on ground and only rule in breaking is that you do not touch your opponent during a battle guzman sanchez 2012 p 135 left thumb

loremil machado are considered by many to be responsible for incorporation of capoeira movements into breakdancing former village voice reporter sally banes and her colleague photographer martha cooper witnessed breaking in 1980 while covering henry chalfant s photography exhibit of subway graffiti she wrote of dance its spatial level called to mind capoeira spectacular brazilian dance cum martial art form that incorporates kicks and feints low to ground but two were dissimilar enough in shape and timing that capoeira seemed at most only a distant relative and certainly one weren t acquainted with at least on a conscious level in his book hip hop had a dream 2008 damien morgan states breakdancing can have its origins in capoeira because it does not focus on injuring opponent it rather emphasizes skill towards your opponent to express yourself away from violence in most cases it is blatantly obvious to see some of breakdancing s foundations in capoeira morgan 2008 p 29 several breaking practitioners and pioneers tend to side with camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira b boy crazy legs states we didn t know what f ck no capoeira was man we were in ghetto according to pabon unlike popularity of martial arts films capoeira was not seen in bronx jams until 1990s top rockin seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally leaving space for growth and new additions until it evolved into a codified form b boy crew rockers adds despite of sic many rumours and opinions breaking didn t originate from capoeira but during last few years many moves steps and freezes of this brazilian fight dance have inspired more and more b girls and b boys who integrated them into their dance b boy ken swift was breaking long before he saw capoeira in 78 i started breaking and i didn t see it capoeira til 92 i was around too i was in brooklyn bronx queens i went around and i didn t see it what we saw was kung fu we saw kung fu from 42nd street theaters so those were our inspirations when we did kung fu sh t we switched it up and we put this b boy flavor into it funk styles while breaking was developing in new york city new york other styles of dance were developing in california unlike breaking funk styles which originated in california were not originally hip hop dance styles they were danced to funk music rather than hip hop music and they were not associated with other cultural pillars of hip hop djing graffiti writing and chang 2006 pp 18 19 although dance forms associate with hip hop did develop in new york city half of them that is popping and locking were created on west coast as part of a different cultural movement much of media coverage in 1980s grouped these dance forms together with new york s native dance forms b boying b girling and uprocking labeling them all breakdancing as a result west coast funk culture and movement were overlooked funk styles are actually slightly older than breaking due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in late 1960s nelson 2009 pp 32 33 guzman sanchez 2012 pp 6 7 locking and roboting like breaking different moves within funk styles occurred due to formation of

chang 2006 p 23 sam solomon s creation popping also became known as unauthorized umbrella title to various forms within dance past and present some of these forms include boogaloo strut dime stop wave tick twisto flex and slides however there is disagreement as to whether he created dances himself or borrowed moves from other street dancers pagett 2008 p 19 guzman sanchez 2012 pp 110 113 122 what is not contested is how influential he and his crew were in exposing popping and boogaloo to mainstream audiences guzman sanchez 2012 p 122 boogaloo is both a style of dance and a style of music rubin 2007 p 120 it started out as a fad dance and several songs were released in 1960s celebrating it including boogaloo down broadway my baby likes to boogaloo hey you boo ga loo do boogaloo boogaloo 3 and sock boogaloo in response to this song and dance craze puerto rican artists in new york city created a style of music called or latin boogaloo that combined mambo soul and r b singer joe cuba was a pioneer of this style although boogaloo was already a fad dance and a music genre in 1960s it did not become a dance style until boogaloo sam learned it expanded it and started performing it in

head movements as if body has no bones electric boogaloo is signature dance style of electric boogaloos morgan 2008 p 38 it is a combination of boogaloo and popping popping is based on technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in dancer s body referred to as a pop or a hit popping is also an inadvertent umbrella term that includes several other illusory dance styles such as ticking liquid tutting waving gliding twisto flex and sliding most of these cannot be traced to a specific person or group and may have influences earlier than hip hop earl snake hips tucker was a professional dancer in 1920s who appeared in film symphony in black and performed at cotton club in harlem since hip hop did not exist in 1920s his style was considered jazz but his slithering writhing movement foreshadowed waving and sliding most recognizable popping move is moonwalk in 1983 michael jackson performed moonwalk called backslide in popping context on abc s motown 25 television special guzman sanchez 2012 p 121 this performance popularized moonwalk all over world however it was not first time backslide had been performed on television or on film cab calloway performed backslide in 1932 2008 p 72 and bill bailey performed it in movies cabin in sky 1943 and rhythm and blues revue 1955 guzman sanchez 2012 pp 16 17 furthermore in 1982 during a performance in london on top of pops street dancer jeffrey daniel performed backslide during song a night to remember in 1970s while los angeles was known for locking and fresno was known for popping several other cities in northern california had their own local funk styles sacramento was known for a style called sac ing san jose for dime stopping and oakland for snake hitting san francisco crew granny and robotroid incorporated stepping moves and jrotc rifle drill movements in their dancing to make a unique funk style called fillmore strutting this dance was named after fillmore district in san francisco where granny and robotroid were from guzman sanchez 2012 pp 104 107 granny and robotroid performed on gong show in 1976 guzman sanchez 2012 p 106 although strutting had exposure on national television it and rest of localized funk styles faded and never became mainstream terminology when movies breakin and breakin 2 electric boogaloo were released all styles of dance performed in those films were put under breakdance label in addition breakin was released outside united states as breakdance movie media followed suit by calling all represented styles breakdancing which caused a naming confusion among general public 2009 p 60 this was problematic for two reasons first reason is that breakdancing became an inadvertent umbrella term among general public for both breaking and funk styles funk styles were created in california independent from breaking which was created in new york they are called funk styles because they were originally danced to funk music this name gives them a separate identity from breaking which is traditionally danced to break beats second reason this was problematic is that breakdancing was originally called b boying or breaking by street dancers who created it a break is a musical interlude during a song section on a musical recording where singing stops and percussive rhythms are most aggressive when 1970s hip hop djs played break beats dancers reacted to those breaks with their most impressive dance moves kugelberg 2007 p 140 dj kool herc coined terms b boys and b girls which stands for break boys and break girls to describe movement suffix ing was added after word identifying dancer b boying or music beat breaking according to timothy pete solomon one of original members of electric boogaloos and raquel rivera author of book new york ricans from hip hop zone 2003 breakdancing is a media coined term and incorrect dance crews a dance crew is a team of street dancers who come together to develop new moves and battle other crews as hip hop culture spread throughout new york city more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other it was during this time that different dance moves within breaking developed organically all styles of hip hop are rooted in battling schloss 2009 p 10 battling is foundational to all forms of hip hop and articulation of its strategy battle tactics is backbone of its philosophy of aesthetics and being a part of a crew was only way to learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios they all started out as social dances forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced improved made friends and built relationships schloss 2009 p 54 in breaking in particular battling is how b boys b girls improved their skill
