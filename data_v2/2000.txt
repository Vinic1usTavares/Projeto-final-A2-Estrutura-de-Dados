in theoretical physics anti de sitter conformal field theory correspondence sometimes called maldacena duality or gauge gravity duality is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories on one side are anti de sitter spaces ads which are used in theories of quantum gravity formulated in terms of string theory or m theory on other side of correspondence are conformal field theories cft which are quantum field theories including theories similar to yang mills theories that describe elementary particles duality represents a major advance in understanding of string theory and quantum gravity de haro et al 2013 p 2 this is because it provides a non perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is most successful realization of holographic principle an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by gerard t hooft and promoted by leonard susskind it also provides a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories klebanov and maldacena 2009 much of usefulness of duality results from fact that it is a strong weak duality when fields of quantum field theory are strongly interacting ones in gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable this fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory ads cft correspondence was first proposed by juan maldacena in late 1997 important aspects of correspondence were elaborated in articles by steven gubser igor klebanov and alexander polyakov and by edward witten by 2015 maldacena s article had over 10 000 citations becoming most highly cited article in field of high energy physics background quantum gravity and strings current understanding of gravity is based on albert einstein s general theory of relativity a standard textbook on general relativity is wald 1984 formulated in 1915 general relativity explains gravity in terms of geometry of space and time or spacetime it is formulated in language of classical 2005 p 58 developed by physicists such as isaac newton and james clerk maxwell other nongravitational forces are explained in framework of quantum mechanics developed in first half of twentieth century by a number of different physicists quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability griffiths 2004 quantum gravity is branch of physics that seeks to describe gravity using principles of quantum mechanics currently a popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory maldacena 2005 p 62 which models elementary particles not as zero dimensional points but as one dimensional objects called strings in ads cft correspondence one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension m theory see subsection entitled examples of correspondence for examples which do not involve string theory or m theory see section entitled generalizations in everyday life there are three familiar dimensions of space up down left right and forward backward and there is one dimension of time thus in language of modern physics one says that spacetime is four dimensional wald 1984 p 4 one peculiar feature of string theory and m theory is that these theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency in string theory spacetime is ten dimensional while in m theory it is eleven dimensional zwiebach 2009 p 8 quantum gravity theories appearing in ads cft correspondence are typically obtained from string and m theory by a process known as compactification this produces a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions and extra dimensions are curled up into circles zwiebach 2009 pp 7 8 a standard analogy for compactification is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose if hose is viewed from a sufficient distance it appears to have only one dimension its length but as one approaches hose one discovers that it contains a second dimension its circumference thus an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions this analogy is used for example in greene 2000 p 186 quantum field theory application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as electromagnetic field which are extended in space and time is known as quantum field theory a standard text is peskin and schroeder 1995 in particle physics quantum field theories form basis for our understanding of elementary particles which are modeled as excitations in fundamental fields quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle like objects called quasiparticles for an introduction to applications of quantum field theory to condensed matter physics see zee 2010 in ads cft correspondence one considers in addition to a theory of quantum gravity a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory this is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory conformal field theories are characterized by their invariance under conformal transformations such theories are often studied in context of string theory where they are associated with surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime and in statistical mechanics where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point for an introduction to conformal field theory emphasizing its applications to perturbative string theory see volume ii of deligne et al 1999 overview of correspondence thumb right a tessellation of hyperbolic plane by triangles and squares geometry of anti de sitter space in ads cft correspondence one considers string theory or m theory on an anti de sitter background this means that geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain vacuum solution of einstein s equation called anti de sitter space klebanov and maldacena 2009 p 28 in very elementary terms anti de sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which notion of distance between points metric is different from notion of distance in ordinary euclidean geometry it is closely related to hyperbolic space which can be viewed as a disk as illustrated on right maldacena 2005 p 60 this image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares one can define distance between points of this disk in such a way that all triangles and squares are same size and circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in interior maldacena 2005 p 61 now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents state of universe at a given time resulting geometric object is three dimensional anti de sitter space it looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of hyperbolic disk time runs along vertical direction in this picture surface of this cylinder plays an important role in ads cft correspondence as with hyperbolic plane anti de sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface mathematical relationship between interior and boundary of anti de sitter space is related to ambient construction of charles fefferman and robin graham for details see fefferman and graham 1985 fefferman and graham 2011 thumb left 350px three dimensional anti de sitter space is like a stack of hyperbolic disks each one representing state of universe at a given time resulting spacetime looks like a solid cylinder this construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space and one time dimension but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions indeed hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can stack up copies of hyperbolic space to get higher dimensional models of anti de sitter space idea of ads cft an important feature of anti de sitter space is its boundary which looks like a cylinder in case of three dimensional anti de sitter space one property of this boundary is that locally around any point it looks just like minkowski space model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics zwiebach 2009 p 552 one can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which spacetime is given by boundary of anti de sitter space this observation is starting point for ads cft correspondence which states that boundary of anti de sitter space can be regarded as spacetime for a conformal field theory claim is that this conformal field theory is equivalent to gravitational theory on bulk anti de sitter space in sense that there is a dictionary for translating calculations in one theory into calculations in other every entity in one theory has a counterpart in other theory for example a single particle in gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in boundary theory in addition predictions in two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in gravitational theory then corresponding collections in boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding maldacena 2005 pp 61 62 thumb right a hologram is a two dimensional image which stores information about all three dimensions of object it represents two images here are photographs of a single hologram taken from different angles notice that boundary of anti de sitter space has fewer dimensions than anti de sitter space itself for instance in three dimensional example illustrated above boundary is a two dimensional surface ads cft correspondence is often described as a holographic duality because this relationship between two theories is similar to relationship between a three dimensional object and its image as a hologram maldacena 2005 p 57 although a hologram is two dimensional it encodes information about all three dimensions of object it represents in same way theories which are related by ads cft correspondence are conjectured to be exactly equivalent despite living in different numbers of dimensions conformal field theory is like a hologram which captures information about higher dimensional quantum gravity theory examples of correspondence following maldacena s insight in 1997 theorists have discovered many different realizations of ads cft correspondence these relate various conformal field theories to of string theory and m theory in various numbers of dimensions theories involved are generally not viable models of real world but they have certain features such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity known realizations of ads cft typically involve unphysical numbers of spacetime dimensions and unphysical most famous example of ads cft correspondence states that type iib string theory on product space is equivalent to n 4 supersymmetric yang mills theory on four dimensional boundary this example is main subject of three pioneering articles on ads cft maldacena 1998 gubser klebanov and polyakov 1998 and witten 1998 in this example spacetime on which gravitational theory lives is effectively five dimensional hence notation and there are five additional compact dimensions encoded by factor in real world spacetime is four dimensional at least macroscopically so this version of correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity likewise dual theory is not a viable model of any real world system as it assumes a large amount of supersymmetry nevertheless as explained below this boundary theory shares some features in common with quantum chromodynamics fundamental theory of strong force it describes particles similar to gluons of quantum chromodynamics together with certain fermions as a result it has found applications in nuclear physics particularly in study of quark gluon plasma merali 2011 p 303 kovtun son and starinets 2001 another realization of correspondence states that m theory on is equivalent to so called 2 0 theory in six dimensions maldacena 1998 in this example spacetime of gravitational theory is effectively seven dimensional existence of 2 0 theory that appears on one side of duality is predicted by classification of superconformal field theories it is still poorly understood because it is a quantum mechanical theory without a classical limit for a review of 2 0 theory see moore 2012 despite inherent difficulty in studying this theory it is considered to be an interesting object for a variety of reasons both physical and mathematical see moore 2012 and alday gaiotto and tachikawa 2010 yet another realization of correspondence states that m theory on is equivalent to abjm superconformal field theory in three dimensions aharony et al 2008 here gravitational theory has four dimensions so this version of correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity aharony et al 2008 sec 1 applications to quantum gravity a non perturbative formulation of string theory right thumb 300px interaction in quantum world world lines of point like particles or a world sheet swept up by closed strings in string theory in quantum field theory one typically computes probabilities of various physical events using techniques of perturbation theory developed by richard feynman and others in first half of twentieth century perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called feynman diagrams to organize computations one imagines that these diagrams depict paths of point like particles and their interactions a standard textbook introducing formalism of feynman diagrams is peskin and schroeder 1995 although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions these predictions are only possible when strength of interactions coupling constant is small enough to reliably describe theory as being close to a theory without interactions zee 2010 p 43 starting point for string theory is idea that point like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one dimensional objects called strings interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory at level of feynman diagrams this means replacing one dimensional diagram representing path of a point particle by a two dimensional surface representing motion of a string unlike in quantum field theory string theory does not yet have a full non perturbative definition so many of theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach zwiebach 2009 p 12 problem of developing a non perturbative formulation of string theory was one of original motivations for studying ads cft correspondence maldacena 1998 sec 6 as explained above correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti de sitter space one can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of string theory in special case where gravitational field is asymptotically anti de sitter that is when gravitational field resembles that of anti de sitter space at spatial infinity physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in dual quantum field theory black hole information paradox in 1975 stephen hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near event horizon hawking 1975 at first hawking s result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information more precisely hawking s calculation seemed to conflict with one of basic postulates of quantum mechanics which states that physical systems evolve in time according to schrodinger equation this property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution apparent contradiction between hawking s calculation and unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as black hole information paradox for an accessible introduction to black hole information paradox and related scientific dispute between hawking and leonard susskind see susskind 2008 ads cft correspondence resolves black hole information paradox at least to some extent because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts indeed one can consider black holes in context of ads cft correspondence and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on boundary of anti de sitter space zwiebach 2009 p 554 these particles obey usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion so black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion respecting principles of quantum mechanics maldacena 2005 p 63 in 2005 hawking announced that paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by ads cft correspondence and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information hawking 2005 applications to quantum field theory nuclear physics one physical system which has been studied using ads cft correspondence is quark gluon plasma an exotic state of matter produced in particle accelerators this state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy ions such as gold or lead nuclei are collided at high energies such collisions cause quarks that make up atomic nuclei to at temperatures of approximately two trillion kelvins conditions similar to those present at around seconds after big bang zwiebach 2009 p 559 physics of quark gluon plasma is governed by quantum chromodynamics but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving quark gluon plasma more precisely one cannot apply methods of perturbative quantum field theory in an article appearing in 2005 dam thanh son and his collaborators showed that ads cft correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of quark gluon plasma by describing it in language of string theory by applying ads cft correspondence son and his collaborators were able to describe quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five dimensional spacetime calculation showed that ratio of two quantities associated with quark gluon plasma shear viscosity and volume density of entropy should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant where denotes reduced planck s constant and is boltzmann s constant zwiebach 2009 p 561 kovtun son and starinets 2001 in addition authors conjectured that this universal constant provides a lower bound for in a large class of systems in 2008 predicted value of this ratio for quark gluon plasma was confirmed at relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory merali 2011 p 303 and 2008 another important property of quark gluon plasma is that very high energy quarks moving through plasma are stopped or quenched after traveling only a few this phenomenon is characterized by a number called jet quenching parameter which relates energy loss of such a quark to squared distance traveled through plasma calculations based on ads cft correspondence have allowed theorists to estimate and results agree roughly with measured value of this parameter suggesting that ads cft correspondence will be useful for developing a deeper understanding of this phenomenon zwiebach 2009 p 561 condensed matter physics thumb a magnet levitating above a high temperature superconductor today some physicists are working to understand high temperature superconductivity using ads cft correspondence merali 2011 over decades experimental condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter including superconductors and superfluids these states are described using formalism of quantum field theory but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques some condensed matter theorists including subir sachdev hope that ads cft correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in language of string theory and learn more about their behavior merali 2011 p 303 so far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe transition of a superfluid to an insulator a superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction such systems are often produced in laboratory using liquid helium but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss crossing lasers these atoms initially behave as a superfluid but as experimentalists increase intensity of lasers they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state during transition atoms behave in an unusual way for example atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on temperature and on planck s constant fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics which does not enter into description of other phases this behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole sachdev 2013 p 51 criticism with many physicists turning towards string based methods to attack problems in nuclear and condensed matter physics some theorists working in these areas have expressed doubts about whether ads cft correspondence can provide tools needed to realistically model real world systems in a talk at quark matter conference in 2006 mclerran 2007 an american physicist larry mclerran pointed out that n 4 super yang mills theory that appears in ads cft correspondence differs significantly from quantum chromodynamics making it difficult to apply these methods to nuclear physics according to mclerran in a letter to physics today nobel laureate philip w anderson voiced similar concerns about applications of ads cft to condensed matter physics stating history and development right thumb 150px gerard t hooft obtained results related to ads cft correspondence in 1970s by studying analogies between string theory and nuclear physics string theory and nuclear physics discovery of ads cft correspondence in late 1997 was culmination of a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics zwiebach 2009 p 525 in fact string theory was originally developed during late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons subatomic particles like proton and neutron that are held together by strong nuclear force idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string in late 1960s experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from physics of a rotating relativistic string aharony et al 2008 sec 1 1 on other hand attempts to model hadrons as strings faced serious problems one problem was that string theory includes a massless spin 2 particle whereas no such particle appears in physics of hadrons such a particle would mediate a force with properties of gravity in 1974 joel scherk and john schwarz suggested that string theory was therefore not a theory of nuclear physics as many theorists had thought but instead a theory of quantum gravity scherk and schwarz 1974 at same time it was realized that hadrons are actually made of quarks and string theory approach was abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics in quantum chromodynamics quarks have a kind of charge that comes in three varieties called colors in a paper from 1974 gerard t hooft studied relationship between string theory and nuclear physics from another point of view by considering theories similar to quantum chromodynamics where number of colors is some arbitrary number rather than three in this article t hooft considered a certain limit where tends to infinity and argued that in this limit certain calculations in quantum field theory resemble calculations in string theory t hooft 1974 left thumb 150px stephen hawking predicted in 1975 that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects black holes and holography in 1975 stephen hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near event horizon this work extended previous results of jacob bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy bekenstein 1973 at first hawking s result appeared to contradict one of main postulates of quantum mechanics namely unitarity of time evolution intuitively unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another for this reason apparent contradiction came to be known as black hole information paradox susskind 2008 right thumb 150px leonard susskind made early contributions to idea of holography in quantum gravity later in 1993 gerard t hooft wrote a speculative paper on quantum gravity in which he revisited hawking s work on black hole thermodynamics concluding that total number of degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to surface area of horizon t hooft 1993 this idea was promoted by leonard susskind and is now known as holographic principle susskind 1995 holographic principle and its realization in string theory through ads cft correspondence have helped elucidate mysteries of black holes suggested by hawking s work and are believed to provide a resolution of black hole information paradox in 2004 hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics susskind 2008 p 444 and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information maldacena s paper in late 1997 juan maldacena published a landmark paper that initiated study of ads cft according to alexander markovich polyakov maldacena s work opened flood gates polyakov 2008 p 6 conjecture immediately excited great interest in string theory community and was considered in articles by steven gubser igor klebanov and polyakov gubser klebanov and polyakov 1998 and by edward witten witten 1998 these papers made maldacena s conjecture more precise and showed that conformal field theory appearing in correspondence lives on boundary of anti de sitter space left thumb 175px juan maldacena first proposed ads cft correspondence in late 1997 one special case of maldacena s proposal says that n 4 super yang mills theory a gauge theory similar in some ways to quantum chromodynamics is equivalent to string theory in five dimensional anti de sitter space this result helped clarify earlier work of t hooft on relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics maldacena s results also provided a concrete realization of holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics by year 2015 maldacena s paper had become most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10 000 citations these subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that correspondence is correct although so far it has not been rigorously proved maldacena 2005 p 63 cowen 2013 generalizations three dimensional gravity in order to better understand quantum aspects of gravity in our four dimensional universe some physicists have considered a lower dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension for a review see 2003 in this setting mathematics describing gravitational field simplifies drastically and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory eliminating need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions according to results of witten 1988 three dimensional quantum gravity can be understood by relating it to chern simons theory beginning with work of j d brown and marc henneaux in 1986 brown and henneaux 1986 physicists have noticed that quantum gravity in a three dimensional spacetime is closely related to two dimensional conformal field theory in 1995 henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail suggesting that three dimensional gravity in anti de sitter space is equivalent to conformal field theory known as liouville field theory henneaux and van driel 1995 another conjecture formulated by edward witten states that three dimensional gravity in anti de sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry witten 2007 these conjectures provide examples of ads cft correspondence that do not require full apparatus of string or m theory guica et al 2009 p 1 ds cft correspondence unlike our universe which is now known to be expanding at an accelerating rate anti de sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting instead it looks same at all times in more technical language one says that anti de sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant whereas real universe has a small positive cosmological constant perlmutter 2003 although properties of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent of value of cosmological constant 2005 p 33 it is desirable to have a version of ads cft correspondence for positive cosmological constant in 2001 andrew strominger introduced a version of duality called ds cft correspondence strominger 2001 this duality involves a model of spacetime called de sitter space with a positive cosmological constant such a duality is interesting from point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that very early universe was close to being de sitter space our universe may also resemble de sitter space in distant future kerr cft correspondence although ads cft correspondence is often useful for studying properties of black holes see subsection entitled black hole information paradox most of black holes considered in context of ads cft are physically unrealistic indeed as explained above most versions of ads cft correspondence involve higher dimensional models of spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry in 2009 monica guica thomas hartman wei song and andrew strominger showed that ideas of ads cft could nevertheless be used to understand certain astrophysical black holes more precisely their results apply to black holes that are approximated by kerr black holes which have largest possible angular momentum compatible with a given mass guica et al 2009 they showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory kerr cft correspondence was later extended to black holes with lower angular momentum castro maloney and strominger 2010 higher spin gauge theories ads cft correspondence is closely related to another duality conjectured by igor klebanov and alexander markovich polyakov in 2002 klebanov and polyakov 2002 this duality states that certain higher spin gauge theories on anti de sitter space are equivalent to conformal field theories with o n symmetry here theory in bulk is a type of gauge theory describing particles of arbitrarily high spin it is similar to string theory where excited modes of vibrating strings correspond to particles with higher spin and it may help to better understand string theoretic versions of ads cft and possibly even prove correspondence see introduction in klebanov and polyakov 2002 in 2010 simone giombi and xi yin obtained further evidence for this duality by computing quantities called three point functions
