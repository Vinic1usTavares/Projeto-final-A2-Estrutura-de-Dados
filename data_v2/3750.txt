prague uprising of 1945 was a partially successful attempt by czech resistance to liberate city of prague from german occupation during world war ii preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti german sentiment and approach of soviet red army and us third army offered a chance of success on 5 may 1945 in last moments of war in europe czech citizens spontaneously attacked german occupiers and czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join uprising russian liberation army which had been fighting for germans defected and supported czechs german troops counter attacked but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by czech citizenry on 8 may czech and german leaders signed a ceasefire allowing german forces to withdraw from city but not all waffen ss units obeyed fighting continued until 9 may when red army entered nearly liberated city uprising was brutal with both sides committing war crimes violence against germans sanctioned by czechoslovak government continued after liberation and was justified as revenge for occupation or as a means to encourage germans to flee george patton s us third army was ordered by general dwight eisenhower not to come to aid of czech insurgents which undermined credibility of western powers in postwar czechoslovakia instead uprising was presented as a symbol of czech resistance to nazi rule and liberation by red army was used by czechoslovak communist party to increase popular support for communism background german occupation thumb right czech districts with a high ethnic german population annexed by germany in 1938 in 1938 german chancellor adolf hitler announced his intention to annex sudetenland a region of czechoslovakia with a high ethnic german population as previous appeasement of hitler had shown governments of both france and britain were intent on avoiding war british prime minister neville chamberlain and french prime minister edouard daladier negotiated with hitler and ultimately acquiesced to his demands at munich agreement in exchange for guarantees from nazi germany that no additional lands would be annexed no czechoslovak representatives were present at negotiations five months later when slovak diet declared independence of slovakia hitler summoned czechoslovak president emil hacha to berlin and forced him to accept german occupation of czech rump state and its re organisation into german dominated protectorate of bohemia and moravia germany promptly invaded and occupied remaining czech territories although france had a defensive alliance with czechoslovakia neither french nor british intervened militarily nazis considered many czechs to be ethnically aryan and therefore suitable for germanisation as a consequence german occupation was less harsh than in other slavic nations wartime living standards were actually higher in occupied region than in germany itself however freedom of speech was curtailed and 400 000 czechs were conscripted for forced labour in reich during six year occupation more than 20 000 czechs were executed and thousands more died in concentration camps in 1941 nazi reinhard heydrich was made deputy protector of bohemia and moravia and began enforcing occupation more harshly within five days of heydrich s arrival 142 people were executed his brutality led to allies ordering his assassination following year but germans killed more than a thousand czechs in reprisal including entire villages of and while general violence of occupation was much less severe than in eastern europe it nevertheless incited violent anti

slower speed waffen ss units retreating from red army s advance into moravia burned down entire villages as a reprisal despite losing much of their leadership to a march 1945 purge by gestapo communist groups in prague distributed propaganda leaflets calling for an insurrection german soldiers and civilians became increasingly worried and prepared to flee violent retaliation for occupation in an attempt to reassert german authority ss police general karl hermann frank broadcast a message over radio threatening to destroy prague and drown any opposition in blood in early 1945 former czechoslovak army officers set up commanded by general to oversee fighting inside prague and under general to direct insurgent units in suburbs meanwhile czech national council cs with representatives from various czech political parties formed to take over political leadership after overthrow of nazi and collaborationist authorities military leaders planning an uprising within prague counted on loyalty of ethnically czech members of police and government army of protectorate of bohemia and moravia as well as employees of key civil services such as transport workers and fire brigade russian liberation army roa composed of soviet pows that had agreed to fight for nazi germany was stationed outside of prague hoping that roa could be persuaded to switch sides in order to avoid accusations of collaboration czech military command sent an envoy to general sergei bunyachenko commander of 1st infantry division 600th german infantry division bunyachenko agreed to help czechs on 4 may us third army under general george s patton entered czechoslovakia british prime minister winston churchill was only political leader to advocate liberation of prague by western allies in a telegram to general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander in europe churchill said that liberation of prague by us troops might make whole difference to postwar situation of czechoslovakia and might well influence that in nearby countries joseph stalin leader of soviet union also wanted his forces to liberate city and asked that americans stop at plzen 50 miles to west red army was planning a major offensive into protectorate due to start 7 may eisenhower disinclined to accept american casualties or risk antagonising soviet union acquiesced to soviet demands that red army enter prague uprising 5

in windows and on jacket lapels tram operators refused to accept reichmarks or to give stops in german as was required by occupiers some german soldiers were surrounded and killed in response to growing popular agitation frank threatened to shoot czechs gathering in streets and increased armed german patrols some german soldiers began to fire into crowds around noon radio broadcast a series of appeals to police and gendarmerie requesting aid in fighting ss guards inside radio building a detachment of government army policemen responded to call and met stiff resistance as they retook building during entire time radio continued to broadcast although not directed at populace appeal ignited fighting all over city concentrated in downtown districts crowds of unarmed civilians mostly young men with no military training overwhelmed german garrisons and stores many casualties were inflicted by german soldiers and civilians sniping from strong points or rooftops in response czech forces began to intern germans and suspected collaborators czech noncombatants assisted by setting up makeshift hospitals for wounded and bringing food water and other necessities to barricades while german forces were often forced to looting to obtain essential supplies czech forces seized thousands of firearms hundreds of panzerfausts and five armoured vehicles but still suffered a shortage of weapons by end of day resistance had seized most of city east of vltava river insurgents held many important buildings including radio telephone exchange most railway stations and ten of twelve bridges three thousand prisoners were liberated from prison by controlling telephone exchange resistance fighters were able to sever communication between german units and commanders german forces held most of territory to west of river including an airfield at ruzyne northwest of city and various surrounded garrisons such as gestapo headquarters at orders of field marshal ferdinand schorner in command of axis forces in bohemia waffen ss units were pulled from fighting red army and sent into prague ss was relatively well equipped with tanks armoured carriers weaponry and motorised units information on this force movement reached insurgent headquarters late in day radio broadcast appeals in english and russian for an air attack on tanks hearing of events in prague patton asked for permission to advance to vltava in order to aid czech resistance but eisenhower refused red army was ordered to advance launch of its offensive to 6 may 6 may thumb right barricades along a street in prague erected to prevent passage of tanks and give czech insurgents cover from german fire late in evening on 5 may radio broadcast an appeal to people in streets of prague to build barricades in order to slow anticipated german attack despite poor weather tens of thousands of civilians worked overnight to construct over 1 600 barricades by morning a total of 2 049 were constructed by end of uprising ss general carl friedrich von ordered luftwaffe to firebomb prague but attack had to be scaled back due to lack of fuel first strike was made by two messerschmitt me 262a jet fighter bombers from elements of kg 51 at ruzyne one of their targets was radio building which was hit by a 250 kg bomb that disabled transmitter however radio continued to broadcast from alternate locations in successive attacks luftwaffe bombed barricades and hit apartment buildings with incendiary bombs causing many civilian casualties at midday first battalion of roa entered prague and attacked germans during its time in prague it disarmed around 10 000 german soldiers an american reconnaissance patrol met with an roa officer as well as czech leaders this was when czechs learnt of demarcation line agreement and that third army was not coming to liberate prague as a consequence czech national council which had not been involved in negotiations with bunyachenko denounced roa a soviet liberation meant that they could not politically afford to endorse roa whom stalin considered traitors despite rejection of roa their aid to prague became a point of friction between moscow and czechoslovakia after war 7 may under terms of provisional unconditional surrender signed in early hours of 7 may german forces had a forty eight hour grace period to cease offensive operations act of military surrender signed at rheims at 0241 on 7th day of may 1945 avalon project yale law school c 1996 2007 lillian goldman law library in memory of sol goldman eisenhower hoped that capitulation would put an end to fighting in prague and therefore obviate american intervention however german leadership was determined to use grace period to move as many soldiers as possible westward to surrender to americans schorner denounced rumours of a ceasefire in prague and said that truce did not apply to german forces fighting red army or czech insurgents thumb left upright 1 4 on 7 may us third army was much closer to prague than soviet forces in order to gain control of prague s transportation network germans launched their strongest attack of uprising waffen ss armoured and artillery units arriving in prague gradually punched through barricades with several tank attacks intense fighting was accompanied with ss use of czech civilians as human shields and damage to old town hall and other historic buildings when bartos command learnt of rheims surrender it ordered an immediate ceasefire for czech forces this caused some confusion among defenders who were also suffering from desertion due to worsening military situation roa played a decisive role in slowing progress of germans but withdrew from prague over afternoon and evening in order to surrender to us army only a few roa units stayed in city departing late on 8 may with bulk of roa gone poorly armed and untrained czech insurgents fared badly against reinforced german forces by end of day german forces had taken much of rebel held territory east of vltava with resistance only holding a salient in vinohrady area roa forces captured luftwaffe airfield at ruzyne destroying several aircraft 8 may in morning germans made an air and artillery bombardment followed by a renewed infantry attack fighting was almost as intense as previous day one particularly fierce battle took place at masaryk train station at 10 am ss troops captured station and murdered around 50 surrendered resistance fighters and noncombatants cs in one of last fights of uprising czech insurgents regained train station at 2 am on 9 may and photographed victims bodies faced with military collapse no arriving allied help and threats to destroy city czech national council agreed to negotiate with wehrmacht general rudolf toussaint toussaint running out of time to evacuate wehrmacht units westward was in an equally desperate position after several hours of negotiations it was agreed that on morning of 9 may czechs would allow german soldiers to pass westward through prague and in exchange german forces leaving city would surrender their arms a ceasefire was finally agreed to around midnight however some pockets of german forces were unaware of or disobeyed ceasefire and civilians feared a continuation of german atrocities which had intensified over previous two days late in evening reports reached prague of liberation of theresienstadt concentration camp northwest of city and advance of red army into other areas north of prague 9 may last of german forces to escape prague left in early hours of morning at 4 00 elements of 1st ukrainian front reached suburbs of prague fighting was mostly with isolated ss units that had been prevented from withdrawing by czech insurgents over next few hours red army quickly overcame remaining german forces because most of germans had already left 1st ukrainian front avoided house to house fighting that had occurred in capture of budapest and vienna red army lost only ten soldiers in what has been described as their easiest victory of war at 8 00 am tanks reached centre city and radio announced arrival of soviet forces czechs poured out into streets to welcome red army war crimes german thumb right between 5 and 8 may school at na prazacce was used to hold czech prisoners and hostages in sa tortured and murdered 44 people german forces committed war crimes against czech civilians throughout uprising many people were killed in summary executions and ss used czech civilians as human shields forced them to clear barricades at gunpoint and threatened to shoot hostages in revenge for german soldiers killed in action when tanks were halted by barricades they were known to fire into surrounding houses after violently evicting or murdering inhabitants german soldiers looted and burned czech houses and apartment buildings on several occasions more than twenty people were killed at once most of massacres occurred on 7 and 8 may among those killed were pregnant women and young children and some of dead were found mutilated after uprising a czech police report described war crimes committed by ss most of german war crimes were committed by waffen ss however luftwaffe soldiers along with sa participated in torture and murder of prisoners held at na prazacce school czech thumb left upright 0 8 president benes encouraged czechs to liquidate germans and collaborators czechoslovak government in exile planned to expel german minority of czechoslovakia in order to create an ethnically pure czech slovak nation state throughout occupation czech politicians had broadcast messages from london calling for violence against german civilians and suspected czech collaborators president edvard benes believed that vigilante justice would be less divisive than trials and that encouraging germans to flee would spare effort of deporting them later before he arrived in czechoslovakia he broadcast that everyone who deserves death should be totally liquidated in popular storm and urged resistance to avenge nazi crimes a thousand times over minister of justice asked resistance leaders to make liberation bloody for germans and to drive them out with violence communist leaders also supported violence military leaders not only overlooked anti german massacres and failed to punish perpetrators but actively encouraged them czech radio likely played a role in inciting violence by passing on anti german messages of these political leaders as well as broadcasting anti german messages on its own initiative almost no one was prosecuted for violence against germans and a bill was proposed in postwar parliament that would have retroactively legalised it in prague czech insurgents murdered surrendered german soldiers and german civilians both before and after arrival of red army historian argues that there was no clear cut distinction between end of uprising and beginning of expulsions some captured german soldiers were hung from lampposts and burned to death or otherwise tortured and mutilated czech rioters also assaulted raped and robbed german civilians not all those killed or affected by anti german violence were actually german or collaborators as perpetrators frequently acted on suspicion or exploited chaos to settle personal grudges in one massacre at on 10 may forty german civilians were murdered during and after uprising thousands of german civilians and surrendered soldiers were interned in makeshift camps where food and hygiene was poor survivors claimed that beatings and rape were commonplace violence against german civilians continued throughout summer culminating in expulsion of sudeten germans about three million czech citizens of german ethnicity were stripped of their citizenship and property and forcibly deported legacy as greatest military action of czechs for freedom and national independence fought on their own territory in words of journalist prague uprising became a national myth of new czechoslovak republic and subject of much literature western allies failure to liberate prague was seen as emblematic of their lack concern about czechoslovakia first demonstrated by munich agreement it also served as a blow to democratic forces within country who opposed czechoslovakia s drift towards communism in years after war it was not forgotten that stalin had opposed munich agreement and prague s liberation by red army turned public opinion in favour of communism few czechs were aware of demarcation line agreement between western allied and soviet forces allowing communists to accuse american forces of having remained a cowardly or cynical onlooker while prague was struggling for life in words of hungarian historian stephen kertesz according to british diplomat sir orme sargent prague uprising was moment that czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to west in 1948 democratic government of czechoslovakia was toppled by a communist coup d etat following coup czechoslovakia became a communist state aligned with soviet union until velvet revolution in 1989 communist government attempted to discredit czech resistance which was considered a threat to communist legitimacy by purging or arresting former resistance leaders and distorting history for instance overstating role of working class in uprising and inflating number of red army
