unprepared for attack during raid seneca in particular targeted non combatants and reports state that 30 such individuals were slain in addition to a number of armed defenders raiders were under overall command of walter butler who exercised little authority over indians on expedition historian barbara graymont describes butler s command of expedition as criminally incompetent seneca were angered by accusations that they had committed atrocities at battle of wyoming and colonists recent destruction of their forward bases of operation at unadilla onaquaga and tioga butler s authority with indians was undermined by his poor treatment of joseph brant leader of mohawks butler repeatedly maintained against accusations that he permitted atrocities to take place that he was powerless to restrain seneca during campaigns of 1778 brant achieved an undeserved reputation for brutality he was not present at wyoming although many thought he was and he actively sought to minimize atrocities that took place at cherry valley diaries belonging to british soldiers during campaign state regiment as being butchers and given that butler was overall commander of expedition there is controversy as to who actually ordered or failed to restrain killings massacre contributed to calls for reprisals leading to 1779 sullivan expedition which drove iroquois out of western new york background with failure of british general john burgoyne s campaign to hudson after battles of saratoga in october 1777 american revolutionary war in upstate new york became a frontier war graymont pp 155 156 mohawk

recruitment of loyalists butler was unhappy at brant s successes in this sphere and threatened to withhold provisions from brant s loyalist volunteers ninety of them ended up leaving expedition and brant himself was on verge of doing so when his indian supporters convinced him to stay kelsay pp 229 239 dispute did not sit well with indian forces and may have undermined butler s tenuous authority over them massacre thumb left map of cherry valley at time of massacre cherry valley had a fort constructed after brant s raid on cobleskill that surrounded village meeting house it was garrisoned by

impressions on its stockade walls fort was then guarded by loyalists while indians rampaged through rest of settlement not a single house was left standing and senecas seeking revenge were reported to have slaughtered anyone they encountered butler and brant attempted to restrain their actions but were unsuccessful brant in particular was dismayed to learn that a number of families who were well
