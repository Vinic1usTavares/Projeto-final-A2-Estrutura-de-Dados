from chronic myocardial ischemia and many reports questioned avangard omsk s medical staff and why they were unaware of his heart condition other reports claimed that cherepanov s autopsy showed evidence of myocarditis outside doctors particularly in north america were skeptical of this early explanation believing it unlikely that a young elite athlete would suffer from an undiagnosed form of ischemia particularly when considering medical testing he underwent prior to nhl draft further reports out of russia suggested a hypertrophic heart which would be more in line with other cases of sudden death in athletes in addition to issues with immediate cause of death for cherepanov russian officials immediately launched an investigation into emergency response by team facilities and paramedics on site initial concerns were raised as to why cherepanov had been allowed to play if he had a heart condition that should have been picked up by routine medical tests that he was believed to have undergone ambulance that is required to be on duty at all khl games had already left as there were only five minutes left in game and defibrillator in arena was non functional investigation into cherepanov s death continued for several months in december reports out of russia indicated that blood and urine samples collected from cherepanov showed that he had been engaged in blood doping this was later clarified as russian officials said that what initially appeared to be blood doping was actually an attempt by team officials and doctors to treat cherepanov s condition surreptitiously after this revelation in january 2009 khl suspended five avangard officials and doctors for attempting to treat a condition which should have only been managed by experienced cardiologists investigation into cherepanov s death was reopened in august 2009 after federal prosecutors ruled that previously suspended team physicians were unaware of his heart condition and had not prescribed medications he was taking cherepanov s agent jay grossman stated that tests conducted by nhl prior to 2007 entry draft had not shown any health problems legacy shortly after cherepanov s death
