banksia scabrella commonly known as burma road banksia is a species of woody shrub in genus banksia it is classified in series abietinae a group of several species of shrubs with small round or oval inflorescences it occurs in a number of isolated populations south of geraldton western australia with largest population being south and east of mount adams found on sandy soils in heathland or shrubland it grows to high and across with fine needle like leaves appearing in spring and summer inflorescences are round to oval in shape and tan to cream with purple styles banksia scabrella is killed by fire and regenerates by seed originally collected in 1966 b scabrella was one of several species previously considered to be forms of banksia sphaerocarpa before it was finally described by banksia expert alex george in his 1981 revision of genus like many members of abietinae it is rarely seen in cultivation however it has been described as having horticultural potential description banksia scabrella grows as a low shrub to 2 m 7 ft in height and 3 m 10 ft across with a spreading habit its lateral branches are low and often rest on ground small linear leaves measure 0 8 to 2 8 cm in length and 0 1 cm in width and are crowded along stems george recorded flowering as occurring in spring and summer september to january but banksia atlas recorded species in bloom in april flowers occur in flower spikes or inflorescences made up of hundreds of small flowers or florets densely packed around a woody axis quite conspicuous they are terminal occurring on ends of branches or on short side branchlets round or oval in shape cream or tan inflorescences are 3 to 6 cm 1 2 2 4 in high and 7 9 cm 2 8 3 6 in wide individual flowers are light yellow or cream with styles and upper floral parts purple perianths measure 2 7 to 3 5 cm 1 1 6 in while pistils 3 4 to 4 5 cm 1 6 1 8 in in length and are curved at apex inflorescences fade to grey as they age and old flowers do not fall off up to 80 follicles develop on one spike and remain closed until opened after a bushfire oval shaped they measure 1 8 2 8 cm 0 7 1 1 in in length by 0 5 0 9 cm 0 2 0 4 in high and 0 6 0 8 cm 0 2 0

wind farm alt an untidy looking shrub around 1 5 m high in collected on 4 september 1966 southeast of walkaway banksia scabrella was described by alex george in his 1981 revision of genus banksia he gave it epithet scabrella a diminutive of latin adjective scaber rough referring to leaves george placed b scabrella in subgenus banksia because of its flower spike section oncostylis because its styles are hooked and resurrected series abietinae which he constrained to contain only round fruited species he initially thought its closest relative to be banksia leptophylla which is found in same region and later felt it to be b lanata which has similarly coloured inflorescences but longer smooth leaves it was one of several new species previously regarded as a form of banksia sphaerocarpa in 1996 botanists kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics they retained george s subgenera and many of his series but discarded his sections banksia ser abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic and so retained it further resolved into four subclades so thiele and ladiges split it into four subseries banksia scabrella appeared in third of these initially called telmatiaea clade for its most basal member as with george s classification b lanata and two subspecies of b leptophylla emerged as close relatives of b scabrella but there was some question over relationships between all five forms in clade this clade became basis for a new subseries which thiele defined as containing species with and common bracts on infructescence axes and seedling stems which were densely covered in fine hair thiele and ladiges arrangement was not accepted by george and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement b ser abietinae was restored to george s 1981 circumscription and all of thiele and ladiges subseries were abandoned placement of b scabrella in george s 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows thumb right bud developing on stems on ground road verge burma road alt a pale green cylindrical bud in orange sand horizontal branches are nearby banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia 9

that molecular analysis mapped out scabrella as one of a clade containing b lanata both subspecies of b leptophylla and b telmatiaea with b grossa as a more distant relative early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement of banksia by merging dryandra into it and publishing b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b scabrella is placed in b subg spathulatae distribution and habitat thumb right distribution of banksia scabrella lower region is that near mount adams alt map of western australia with two small green patches midway along west coast banksia scabrella is found in two disjunct areas of scattered populations first discovered being southeast of small town of walkaway south of geraldton while a more populous cluster is found southeast of mount adams in western australia average annual rainfall over its range is around 450 mm 18 in it has been placed on declared rare and priority flora list where it is classified as a priority four rare taxon although it is rare it is not currently threatened by any identifiable factors these taxa require monitoring every 5 to 10 years many stands are populous and number over 100 plants however over half known population of b scabrella is found on road verges found in deep pale yellow or white sand in kwongan scrubland and heathland b scabrella grows on flat areas or gentle slopes and is found in association with b leptophylla and a dwarf form of b attenuata ecology most proteaceae and all banksia species including b scabrella have proteoid roots roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in soil just below leaf litter these roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient poor soils such as phosphorus deficient native soils of australia b scabrella is highly susceptible to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback killed by fire species regenerates from seed afterwards resultant seedlings have been recorded flowering two or three years after bushfires although records are few no pollinators were recorded during observations for banksia atlas although banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds mammals and insects region between geraldton and gingin is a rich one for abietinae banksias and nine species occur there despite this there is little overlap in range and habitat banksia scabrella is unusual in its co occurrence with b leptophylla it is also associated with endangered heath shrub marginatus burma road nature reserve is one of few protected conservation areas in its range there banksia scabrella is found most commonly in and forms a prominent part of a mallee which is dominated by cord rush as a ground cover and mallee eucalyptus as an emergent species it is found occasionally in acacia scrub heath and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland an assessment of potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas cultivation seeds do not require any treatment and take 14 to 16 days to germinate rarely cultivated banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed information is limited on its reliability but it has been grown successfully in south australia it is fast growing but ultimately untidy in habit and would benefit from regular pruning some forms in wild have a more compact habit and are more promising for horticulture notes external links scabrella category eudicots of western australia category plants described in 1981
