japanese cruiser was a heavy cruiser built for imperial japanese navy ijn during world war ii lead ship of her class of two ships she was ordered to be converted into a light aircraft carrier in 1943 before completion to help replace aircraft carriers sunk during battle of midway in mid 1942 conversion was delayed and finally stopped in march 1945 in order to concentrate on building small submarines ibuki was scrapped in sasebo naval arsenal beginning in 1946 background ibuki class cruisers were ordered in rapid naval armaments supplement programme of november 1941 and they were slightly improved versions of preceding after those ships had been upgraded during late 1930s after heavy losses suffered in battle of midway in early june 1942 ijn reorganized its current building programs to emphasize aircraft carrier construction ibuki which had only been laid down a few months earlier had all work suspended while ijn decided what to do with her navy ordered shipyard to resume and accelerate construction following month in order to launch her hull as soon as possible to free her slipway for new carriers after she was launched in may 1943 construction was suspended

were intended to be armed with four rotating quadruple type 92 torpedo tube mounts two on each broadside ship carried 24 type 93 torpedoes commonly referred to in post war literature as long lance 16 in tubes and eight in reserve quick reloading gear was installed for every mount that allowed reserve torpedoes to be loaded in three to five minutes in ideal conditions lacroix wells pp 248 545 early

aircraft on a platform between funnel and mainmast these would have consisted of a single three seat aichi e13a and a pair of two seat yokosuka floatplanes they would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults one on each side of aircraft platform lacroix wells pp 542 545 547 armor ship s waterline armored belt was thick over propulsion machinery spaces and thick on sides of magazines outer ends of fore and aft machinery compartments was protected by a transverse bulkhead magazines were protected by fore and aft transverse bulkheads thick thickness of armored deck ranged from and sides of conning tower were 100 millimeters thick main gun turrets were protected by 25 millimeters of armor and barbette armor ranged from 25 to 100 millimeters in thickness lacroix wells pp 449 452

exhaust uptakes for remaining boilers were trunked together into a downward curving funnel on starboard side of hull these changes left her with two turbines and four boilers producing reduced power meant that ibukis top speed was only space made available was used for aviation gasoline tanks additional fuel oil tanks as well as bomb and torpedo magazines ship now could carry enough oil for an estimated range of at a speed of lacroix wells p 544 as part of conversion existing superstructure was razed a new hangar deck was built above existing upper deck and a full length flight deck was added it had a maximum width of two aircraft elevators that serviced single hangar and a small starboard island structure ship was bulged to improve her stability which increased her beam to a maximum of ibukis trials displacement increased to and additional weight increased her draft to thumb ibuki in sasebo just before being scrapped 22 october 1946 initially ship was to have a very light armament of only 22 triple 2 5 centimeter gun mounts controlled by eight type 95 fire control directors but this was modified in 1944 to substitute four 60 caliber 8 cm 3 in type 98 dual purpose guns mounted in two twin gun turrets and four 28 tube launchers for anti aircraft rockets for six of triple 25 millimeter gun mounts and two directors now type 4s this gave ship a total of forty eight 25 mm guns in 16 triple mounts at top of island ibuki was planned to have a rangefinder and a type 21 radar in 1944 radar was moved to a retractable mount in flight deck near bow and a type 22 surface search and a type 13 early warning radar were going to be installed on island ship retained type 93 hydrophone system ship s air group was intended to consist of 27 aircraft 15 mitsubishi a7m reppu
