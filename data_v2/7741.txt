development of game started in june 1998 some features that were originally cut during development of banjo kazooie such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode were instead integrated into banjo tooie an additional world set in a castle was planned but due to time constraints it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing cauldron keep game features roughly 150 total characters including enemies and non playable characters originally rare planned to include an additional mode called bottles revenge where a second player could play as an undead version of bottles and take control of enemy characters to hinder banjo in his quest with players swapping roles if enemy character managed to defeat banjo idea was ultimately scrapped because developers ran out of time to debug it despite admitting that it did work rather well however it would later serve as inspiration behind counter operative multiplayer mode in perfect dark bosses were originally to be able to be controllable by second player as well but only boss that developers had working when they dropped mode was second world boss old king coal developers also planned to implement a feature called stop n swop that would have allowed data to be transferred from banjo kazooie to banjo tooie so that players could unlock additional bonuses in banjo tooie however due to hardware limitations of nintendo 64 system feature was ultimately dropped despite this rare decided to include at least some of additional bonuses within game stop n swop feature was later implemented in xbox live re release music was composed by grant kirkhope who previously worked as main composer for perfect dark donkey kong 64 and banjo kazooie as banjo tooie was a larger game than its predecessor kirkhope had twice memory space in game s cartridge for sound effects and music kirkhope initially had to pause his work on banjo tooie to work on other projects first but ultimately music score for game was completed on time like original themes heard in game were designed to be interactive which dynamically change to reflect player s location due to game having larger memory space kirkhope was able to combine two midi files to channel different fades of music when player moves to different locations developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release but game was

beautiful but it did not meet same level of awe as its predecessor game was also praised for its humour with edge commenting that its characters are impossible to dislike gameplay was highlighted for size of game s worlds jes bickham of gamesradar described banjo tooie as a game that requires a massive time investment on player s part saying that keeping track of what you can do next or where you

are supposed to do gamespot s shane satterfield praised game s level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect jiggies despite praise edge concluded that rare should have
