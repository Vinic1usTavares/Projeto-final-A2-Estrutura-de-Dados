elements of 2nd new zealand division which had been diverted there while en route to middle east his own brigade continuing to egypt as planned barrowclough rejoined 6th infantry brigade in october 1940 and disappointed with its quality put considerable emphasis on training this meant that it generally performed well during campaign in greece in april 1941 after conclusion of fighting in greece he refused to join in criticism directed by some senior officers of 2nd new zealand division at freyberg s leadership during battle he later fought in operation crusader campaign to lift siege of

response to a request from new zealand government barrowclough was nominated by freyberg for command of pacific section of 2nzef which was based in fiji with entry of imperial japan into war this was an important command as fiji was last line of defence for mainland new zealand barrowclough embarked for new zealand in early 1942 but during his transit commanding officer of pacific section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by major general owen mead on barrowclough s arrival in new zealand he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available he was eventually posted as commander of northern division with rank of major general he was responsible for defence of upper north island and for next few months oversaw reorganisation and training of his new command barrowclough s opportunity for a return to duty overseas came following death of mead in an aircraft crash in july 1942 at time of mead s death pacific section was being recalled to new zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in south pacific in august barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as 3rd new zealand division he immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty replacing them with personnel who had experience with 2nzef in greece crete or north africa he also implemented training programs for his new command most of its personnel had been engaged in construction of fortifications while in fiji which had left little opportunity for intensive tactical training and exercises in response to a request from vice admiral robert l ghormley american commander of south pacific area 3rd division moved to new caledonia on garrison duty while american forces previously stationed there fought in battle of guadalcanal conscious that his division was only sizable non american unit in a theatre of operations having an overall american command structure barrowclough requested and received a charter that allowed him to seek instructions from new zealand government if he felt division was to be involved in operations that could result in significant casualties although barrowclough arrived in new caledonia with his divisional headquarters in november 1942 main body of his command was not in place until january 1943 once on island his division began training in amphibious landings and jungle warfare to prepare it for forthcoming offensive operations while he set about dealing with administrative and logistical problems of integrating division into american command structure 3rd division was a division in name only consisting of two infantry brigades 8th and 14th instead of three of a conventional infantry division and he unsuccessfully agitated for expansion new zealand could not supply enough manpower to have two full infantry divisions in field and government s preference was to retain 2nd new zealand division still in north africa at full strength barrowclough was unhappy at this decision and his relationship with army headquarters in wellington and its chief of staff lieutenant general edward puttick became strained two brigade divisional structure also constrained how 3rd division could be employed in offensive operations as it could not be used as a replacement for an american division due to its reduced number of personnel being only unit in south pacific area outside of american supply chain also caused logistical problems as division used british equipment thumb right barrowclough right with major general oscar griswold commander of xiv corps vella lavella 1943 in august 1943 barrowclough was advised that his division was to participate in solomon islands campaign it would eventually participate in three major amphibious operations first of these was in september 1943 when 14th brigade conducted a series of landings around coast of vella lavella during battle of vella lavella it was a satisfactory performance by new zealanders and barrowclough was congratulated by american commanders for division s work this was followed in october 1943 by battle of treasury islands involving 8th brigade and which was first amphibious landing mounted under fire by new zealand forces since gallipoli landing in 1915 this like operations at vella lavella was a success with japanese opposition being quickly suppressed in early 1944 barrowclough commanded a force of nearly 16 500 men during battle of green islands only a third of which were elements of his own division remainder were american forces ever since formation of 3rd division barrowclough had been aware that new zealand s ability to keep it and 2nd new zealand division in field was limited however so long as japanese posed a threat to new zealand s security there was still political will for 3rd division to be maintained with japanese no longer a meaningful concern to country new zealand s increasing shortage of manpower resulted in disbandment of 3rd division as well as providing reinforcements for 2nd new zealand division at time engaged in fighting in italy it allowed men to return to vital industries in new zealand despite protests from barrowclough disbandment began in april 1944 with a contingent of nearly 1 900 men returning to new zealand with more following over next few months by june 1944 what was left of division was in new caledonia having been withdrawn there after battle of green islands in september disbandment was made official and was officially completed following month this left a demoralised barrowclough without a command he hoped for a suitable position with 2nd new zealand division possibly taking over from freyberg this did not eventuate and instead he was sent to british army s 21st army group as an observer in late 1945 he was discharged from military his service in pacific theatre of operations was rewarded with several decorations which included united states legion of report 2 november 1944 u s decorates new zealander new york times and appointment as a companion of order of bath later life after he left military barrowclough returned to his legal career
