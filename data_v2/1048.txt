multiple sclerosis ms is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects central nervous system cns several therapies for it exist although there is no known cure most common initial course of disease is relapsing remitting subtype which is characterized by unpredictable attacks relapses followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity after some years many of people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses when this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis other less common courses of disease are primary progressive decline from beginning without attacks and progressive relapsing steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks for patients who have relapsing remitting subtype for patients who have progressive subtypes for patients without a diagnosis of ms who have a demyelinating event and for managing various consequences of ms primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack preventing new attacks and preventing disability as with any medical treatment medications used in management of ms may have several adverse effects and many possible therapies are still under investigation at same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many people despite fact that there is little supporting comparable replicated scientific study stem cell therapy is being studied this article focuses on therapies for standard ms borderline forms of ms have particular treatments that are excluded acute attacks right thumb chemical structure of methylprednisolone corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone is routine therapy for acute relapses this is administered over a period of three to five days and has a well established efficacy in promoting a faster recovery from disability after an attack there is however insufficient evidence to indicate any significant impact on long term disability of corticosteroid treatments steroids administered orally have a similar effectiveness and safety profile at treating ms symptoms as intravenous treatment consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by disease modifying treatments thumb disease modifying treatments are expensive and most require frequent up to daily injections under skin or into muscle newer treatments feature intravenous iv infusions shown above at 1 to 3 month intervals as of 2017 several disease modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries including u s food and drug administration fda european medicines agency emea and pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency of japanese ministry of health labour and welfare medications approved by fda include currently eleven medications interferons beta

drug dimethyl fumarate or which is an improved version of fumaric acid an already existing drug was approved by fda dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily another oral drug was approved in russia and australia in 2010 its application was rejected by fda and emea in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of promising efficacy of drug this led pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications most of these drugs are approved only for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis rrms side effects right thumb injectable medications can produce irritation or bruises at injection site bruise depicted was produced by a subcutaneous injection right thumb irritation zone after injection of glatiramer acetate both interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms and both can cause skin reactions at injection site specially with subcutaneous administration skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising erythema pain pruritus irritation swelling and in most extreme cases cutaneous necrosis they usually appear within first month of treatment albeit their and importance diminish after six months of use mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas appear in around 5 of patients and lead to discontinuation of therapy also over time a visible dent at injection site due to local destruction of fat tissue known as may develop interferons a subclass of cytokines are produced in body during illnesses such as influenza in order to help fight infection they are responsible of many of symptoms of influenza infections including fever muscle aches fatigue and headaches many patients report influenza like symptoms hours after taking interferon beta that usually improve within 24 hours being such symptoms related to temporary increase of cytokines this reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over counter nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen that reduce fever and pain another common transient secondary effect with interferon beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of disease such deterioration is similar to one produced in ms patients due to heat fever or stress s phenomenon usually appears within 24 hours of treatment is more common in initial months of treatment and may last several days a symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity interferon beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells leukopenia lymphocytes and neutrophils neutropenia as well as affect liver function in most cases these effects are non dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment nevertheless recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses including liver function tests to ensure safe use of interferons glatiramer acetate is generally well tolerated most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin problem is a post injection reaction manifested by flushing chest tightness heart palpitations breathlessness and anxiety which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require additional treatment mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage however its most dangerous side effect is its dose related cardiac toxicity careful adherence to administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether therapy is suitable for patient or risks are too great it is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at first signs of heart damage infection or liver dysfunction during therapy heart problems mainly systolic dysfunction appear in over 10 of patients while leukemia prevalence is 0 8 soon after its approval natalizumab was withdrawn from market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml pml is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by replication of jc virus in glial cells of brain all 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta 1a after a safety review drug was returned to market in 2006 as a monotherapy for ms under a special prescription program as of may 2011 over 130 cases of pml had been reported all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year while none of them had taken drug in combination with other disease modifying treatments previous use of ms treatments increases risk of pml between 3 and 4 fold estimated prevalence of pml is 1 5 cases per thousand natalizumab users around 20 of ms patients with pml die while most of remaining are importantly disabled during clinical trials fingolimod gave rise to side effects such as hypertension and bradycardia macular edema elevated liver enzymes or reduction in levels teriflunomide is considered a very safe drug nevertheless there have been reports of liver failure and pml teriflunomide is also known to be dangerous for fetal development most common secondary effects of dimethyl fumarate during clinical trials were flushing and gastrointestinal problems these problems were generally mild and occurred more frequently during first month of treatment while dimethyl fumarate leads to a reduction in white blood cell count and levels should be monitored in patients there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during clinical trials moreover fumaric acid is also used to treat psoriasis another disorder and there is long term safety data from over 14 years of use without any indication of further dangerous secondary effects clinically isolated syndrome earliest clinical presentation of rrms is clinically isolated syndrome cis that is a single attack of a single symptom during a cis there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but patient does not fulfill criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases risk of developing clinical definite ms relapsing remitting ms medications are modestly effective at decreasing number of attacks in rrms and in reducing accumulation of brain lesions which is measured using gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging mri interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent reducing relapses by approximately 30 and their safe profile make them first line treatments nevertheless not all patients are responsive to these therapies it is known that 30 of ms patients are non responsive to beta interferon one of factors related to non is presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing antibodies interferon therapy and specially interferon beta 1b induces production of neutralizing antibodies usually in second 6 months of treatment in 5 to 30 of treated patients moreover a subset of rrms patients with specially active ms sometimes called rapidly worsening ms are normally non responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression however they are related to dangerous side effects that have led them to be considered second line treatments natalizumab halves risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons having an overall efficacy of over 70 moreover mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability but it is generally not considered as a long term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity there are no official guidelines yet on use of disease modifying oral treatments due to their recent development while some believe that they will probably reduce usage of first line treatments long term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend it has been recommended that at moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate they could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed jc virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of pml dimethyl fumarate is potentially one of most interesting oral drugs due to long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile while more studies of long term effects of drugs are needed specially for newest treatments existing data on effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early initiated long term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes oral contraceptive pills have contradictory results from different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate in women with multiple sclerosis multiple sclerosis society of great britain certain medications for ms symptoms such as carbamazepine used to treat spasms and pain and modafinil used to treat fatigue can make oral contraceptive pills less effective even with appropriate use of medication to varying degrees most people with relapsing remitting ms still have some attacks and many develop disability secondary progressive ms and progressive relapsing ms right thumb chemical structure of mitoxantrone treatment of advanced forms of ms is more difficult than relapsing remitting ms a wide range of medications have been used to try to slow progression of disease with results that have been at best fair mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in people with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses it is moderately effective in reducing progression of disease and frequency of relapses in people after two years in 2007 it was only medication approved in us for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis however it causes dose dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long term use it is also not approved in europe natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive ms with relapses studies on use of interferon beta 1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing ms do not support that it slows progression of disease although it is effective in reducing number of relapses primary progressive ms treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis ppms is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of disease there have been several trials investigating efficacy of different drugs for ppms without positive results drugs tested include interferon beta mitoxantrone glatiramer acetate or riluzole riluzole us national library of medicine medline 1 april 2003 retrieved on 2 september 2007 people with ppms have also been included in trials of azathioprine methotrexate intravenous immunoglobulin cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation managing effects of ms disease modifying treatments only reduce progression rate of disease but do not stop it as multiple sclerosis progresses symptoms tend to increase disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap management of these deficits is therefore very important rehabilitation physical therapy symptoms of ms that can be improved include fatigue spasticity depression bladder dysfunction and neurological symptoms these symptoms can be improved by physical therapy and medication physical therapists can show strengthening exercises and ways to stretch ultimately making daily tasks easier and reduces fatigue while muscle strength increases as flexibility increases m brooks d b g 18 march 2004 exercise therapy for multiple sclerosis medications can help fatigue muscle tightness spasticity depression bladder dysfunction and neurological symptoms all symptoms are common amongst ms patients both drug therapy and neurorehabilitation have shown to ease burden of some symptoms even though neither influence disease progression for other symptoms efficacy of treatments is still very limited neurorehabilitation right thumb supervised physical therapy may be helpful to overcome some symptoms although there are relatively few studies of rehabilitation in ms its general effectiveness when conducted by a team of specialists has been clearly demonstrated in other diseases such as stroke or head trauma as for any patient with neurologic deficits a multidisciplinary approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability however there are particular difficulties in specifying a core team because people with ms may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point neurologists are mainly involved in diagnosis and ongoing management of multiple sclerosis and any exacerbations comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by physiatrists allied treatments such as physiotherapy speech and language therapy or occupational therapy can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain quality of life treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression should involve mental health professionals such as therapists psychologists and psychiatrists while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits multidisciplinary approaches have been shown to be effective in increasing activity levels and participation in multiple sclerosis due to paucity of randomized controlled studies there is limited evidence of overall efficacy of individual therapy disciplines though there is good evidence that specific approaches such as exercise psychology therapies particularly cognitive behavioral approaches and energy conservation instruction are effective more specifically psychological interventions seem useful in treatment of depression while evidence on effectiveness for other uses such as treatment of cognitive impairments or vocational counseling is less strong it is difficult to be specific about what types of rehabilitation will be most beneficial because therapies are tailored to meet individual s specific needs in regards to well being physical therapy focused on gait training can be vital to maximizing ms patient participation via reduction of fatigue during walking and activities of daily living adls most gait training is performed over ground i e in a gym room or outside on uneven ground on treadmills or less commonly using robotic assisted devices robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training may be an effective therapeutic option in ms patients with severe walking impairments in contrast over ground gait training may be most effective in improving gait speed in ms patients with less severe impairments equine assisted therapies such as therapeutic horseback riding and are additional treatments that can positively influence gait balance and quality of life in people with ms historically individuals with ms were advised against participation in physical activity due to worsening symptoms however under direction of an expert participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with ms research has supported rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power mobility mood bowel health general conditioning and quality of life depending on person activities may include resistance training walking swimming yoga tai chi and others determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions an elevated core temperature leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout day and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures warm showers sun bathing etc care should be taken not to overheat a person with ms during course of exercise there is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise cold showers cold water limb immersion applying ice packs and drinking cold beverages these strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post exercise and as a method of pre cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure interaction between an elevated core temperature and pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function these effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of adls however there are viable prevention strategies behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler or installing an air conditioner medical treatments for symptoms multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation muscle weakness abnormal muscle spasms impaired movement difficulties with coordination and balance problems in speech known as dysarthria or swallowing dysphagia visual problems nystagmus optic neuritis or diplopia fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes bladder and bowel difficulties cognitive impairment or emotional symptoms mainly depression at same time for each symptom there are different treatment options treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on patient and physician bladder symptomatology of urinary tract is common in ms treatments for bladder problems vary depending on origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence and of urinary tract infections regarding bladder control some examples of medications used are desmopressin for and anticholinergic drugs such as and for urinary urgency non pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training stimulation pessaries bladder retraining changes to daily life habits such as clothing use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization regarding long term catheterization it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in ms but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder bowel bowel problems affect around 70 of patients with around 50 of patients suffering from constipation and up to 30 from fecal incontinence cause of bowel impairments in ms patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation former is commonly related to or secondary effects from drugs used in treatment of disease pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control problems cognitive and emotional

therapy however high quality studies on efficacy are lacking for example in specific case of antidepressants and depression only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of ms even after introduction of disease modifying treatments in last 20 years although disease is usually primary cause of cognitive problems other factors such as medications relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of deficits and factors exacerbating them is important regarding primary deficits data point towards administration of l amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful whereas and drugs such as us national library of medicine medline 1 april 2007 retrieved on 2 september 2007 commonly used in alzheimer disease are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more for those patients with ms who have affect pba characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and or laughing or other emotional displays can be considered as treatment as it is only fda approved drug for treatment for pba though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice dysphagia and dysarthria dysphagia is a difficulty with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into lungs while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor control over subsystems and muscles responsible for speech articulation a speech and language therapist may give advice on specific swallowing techniques on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity and on alternative communication approaches in case of advanced dysphagia food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube which is a tube that goes through nose directly to stomach or a percutaneous endoscopic peg which is a procedure for placing a tube into stomach and therefore administering food directly to it erectile dysfunction erectile dysfunction is common in male patients with ms there is some evidence indicating that citrate may be a useful treatment fatigue fatigue is very common and disabling in ms and at same time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology when depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used in a similar way other factors such as disturbed sleep chronic pain poor nutrition or even some medications can contribute to fatigue medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them a few medications have been studied to treat ms related fatigue such as us national library of medicine medline 1 april 2003 retrieved on 7 october 2007 pemoline which is a also used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy or modafinil as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation but effects of all of them are small fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended pain acute pain is mainly due to optic neuritis with corticosteroids being best treatment available as well as trigeminal neuralgia lhermitte s sign or dysesthesias subacute pain is usually secondary to disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in same position urinary retention and infected skin ulcers amongst others treatment will depend on cause chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as us national library of medicine medline 1 may 2007 retrieved on 2 september 2007 or phenytoin

fda to treat walking difficulties in ms it has been shown to increase walking speed although its high cost over 1000 dollars a month limits its usage unfortunately other symptoms such as ataxia tremor or sensory losses do not have proven treatments research thumb chemical structure of alemtuzumab research directions on ms treatments include investigations of ms pathogenesis and heterogeneity research of more effective convenient or tolerable new treatments for rrms creation of therapies for progressive subtypes neuroprotection strategies and search for effective symptomatic treatments advances during last decades has led to recent approval of several oral drugs these drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at expense of previously existing therapies further oral drugs are still under investigation most notable example being which was announced in august 2012 to be focus of a third phase iii trial after mixed results in previous ones similarly other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through use of novel preparations such is case pegylated version of interferon b 1a that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than existing product with completion of a robust two year study it is shown that pegylated interferon beta 1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for ms patients monoclonal antibodies which are drugs of same family as natalizumab have also raised high levels of interest and research alemtuzumab daclizumab and monoclonal antibodies such as ocrelizumab and have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for ms nevertheless their use has also been accompanied by appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects most importantly opportunistic infections related to these investigations is recent development of a test against jc virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab while monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in treatment of disease in future it is believed that it will be small due to risks associated to them another research strategy is to evaluate combined effectiveness of two or more drugs main rationale for in ms is that involved treatments target different mechanisms of disease and therefore their use is not necessarily exclusive moreover in which a drug potentiates effect of another are also possible nevertheless there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects while there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit consideration as a viable treatment for ms likewise there are not any effective treatments for progressive variants of disease many of newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for ppms or spms and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients there is growing developments in area of medical imaging and mri allowing for better reviews and understandings of ms in patients and how to treat each case in a more effective method stem cell transplant finally regarding neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments such as stem cell therapy while their research is considered of high importance at moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches a 2018 study found promising results in relapsing remitting ms but more research is needed ccsvi in 2008 vascular surgeon paolo zamboni suggested that ms involves a vascular process he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ccsvi in which veins from brain are constricted he found ccsvi in all 65 patients with ms in his study this theory received important attention in media and among people with ms specially in canada concern has been raised with zamboni s research as it was neither blinded nor controlled and additionally its assumptions about of disease may not be backed by known data also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one this has raised objections to hypothesis of ccsvi originating ms liberation procedure has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven currently it is recommended not to use proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies research on ccsvi has been fast tracked but researchers have been unable to confirm whether ccsvi has a role in causing ms alternative treatments over 50 of ms patients may use complementary and alternative medicine although numbers vary greatly depending on definition of alternative medicine used in united states it is estimated that 75 of ms patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control overview of cam for management of ms multiple sclerosis treatment and management overview healthline 28 july 2014 retrieved on 30 october 2014 evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin d calcium vitamin b12 and antioxidants rationale behind use of vitamin d supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin d deficiency and increasing progression of ms as well as anti inflammatory effects of vitamin d for antioxidant therapy studies have shown that reactive oxidative species lead to formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects probably most clear disease modifying factor for worse is smoking and therefore to quit smoking should be considered other alternative treatments
