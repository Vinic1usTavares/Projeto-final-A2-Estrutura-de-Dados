than her husband s stylized photographs she realized that photography was a chronicle of history documenting transformation of society she called camera a third eye which elicited truth of photographer s experience one of her early works from this period is titled la visitation and was taken on an excursion with manuel and french photographer henri cartier bresson trio had traveled to

additions in 2013 in 1953 when asked by a journalist from excelsior to identify mexico s most important painter mexican painter alfonso michel replied lola alvarez bravo because her compositions are those of a woman who knows how to see thing itself by ignoring icons like david alfaro siqueiros jose clemente orozco and diego rivera michel placed alvarez s skill with composition and imagery firmly in context of fine art raised her photography to same level as painting and praised her skill with no regard to her gender alvarez has images in permanent collections of several museums including museum of fine arts houston and museum of modern art in new york city selected works thumb alvarez s iconic 1946 work entierro de yalalag burial in yalalag was included in museum of modern art s family of man exhibition in new york city and subsequently toured 37 countries alvarez exclusively employed black and white film for her pictures rather than color photography as a means of allowing fuller development between monochrome contrasts color did not suit her documentary style of composition as a photojournalist alvarez focused on candid revelations seeking to impart social meaning without duplicating other photographers work for example in one assignment where she went to in veracruz to shoot danza de los she ignored dancers photographed by others instead taking pictures of pilgrims coming to attend ritual processional entrance of sacred pole and an animal sacrifice distance between herself and subject candidly captures them in a manner that intimately captures their experience without judgment her preference was to avoid news instead documenting her surroundings in their historical context in her advertising work alvarez used chiaroscuro techniques to highlight aspects of products as if they were still life paintings from 1936 she produced photomontages always using her own photographs to make composite rather than images from published work of others many of photomontages from her later career were posters many of alvarez s works were grouped into specific themes which she returned to time and again they included representations of indigenous and peasant women mothers children women of varying social classes as well as women involved as avant garde participants in mexican and intellectual renaissance movement of interwar period besides images of her friend frida kahlo for whom she was known internationally later in her career are portraits of artists such as lilia carrillo olga costa marion greenwood maria izquierdo alice and cordelia cultural preservationists including pita amor anita brenner and judith martinez ortega and writers such as rosario castellanos and elena poniatowska she also created a series of nude portraits which were unique in their depiction of women as de la femenina en el de la sociedad patriarchal mexicana allegories of female condition in context of mexican patriarchal society these included her nude image of dancer bass and heavily pregnant artist julia lopez her contemporary male photographers when depicting motherhood captured more traditionally domestic images her street photography focused on people s daily lives as she strove to expose beauty as well as misery and irony of human condition her work displayed an instant in time and did not have any symbolic or underlying meaning but instead was a way of preserving a moment in life alvarez s photography focused on documenting mexico and its people during her lifetime with a humanistic perspective her images document industrialization of country which occurred after mexican revolution as well as effects of 20th century technology she did not like stylized studio shots but wandered with her camera searching for poignant moments and arresting compositions which depicted landscape people and customs of mexico typical are her photographs of indigenous women like un e a rest weeping and indifference from 1940 which portrays exploitation and lonely suffering of its subject or el sueno de los pobres 2 dream of poor 2 in which a young boy lies sleeping amidst a collection of sandals alvarez noted that only wealthy could dream of sweets as young poor mexicans dreamed only of having shoes many of her works explore intersections of light and shade which she employed repeatedly as a metaphor in her works in y otros bajan some go up and others go down she used contrast to demonstrate mechanical patterns in her 1950 work en su in her own prison she used cross hatched shadows as an allegory for prison bars trapping young woman who leaned on a windowsill in both del of martyrdom 1949 a series of photographs of prostitutes and an untitled photograph of a masked gay rights activist 1982 alvarez used play of light and shadow to suggest erotic tension as well as a social critique by obscuring faces in darkness because of her enduring friendship with frida kahlo alvarez took some of most revealing photographs of artist alvarez enjoyed photographing kahlo and found kahlo aesthetic alvarez herself stated she always looked very natural i never saw frida too made up or ridiculous she believed kahlo was a special being and became very close to her personally and through her work during kahlo s final years when she was plagued by illness alvarez and her camera provided respite from kahlo s pain and two women collaborated on both still images and a surrealistic film film was not completed because of kahlo s death but a series of photographs evoke dual and dueling aspects of kahlo s exterior facade and interior turmoil frida looking at herself in mirror in patio of casa azul and frida leaning against a tree both taken in 1942 encapsulate kahlo s tentative hold on tranquillity in alvarez s 1944 image two kahlo approached a mirror and alvarez captured beautiful elegantly clad artist and her reflection riddled with interior pain from her accident as well as unhappiness from her troubled marriage alvarez stated about her pieces of kahlo i wanted to show something of her internal life frida kahlo following amputation of her right leg taken in 1953 and interaction kahlo and alvarez had before taking it displays relationship two female artists had with each other kahlo would called alvarez meaning little sister last photograph taken of kahlo frida kahlo on her deathbed was taken by alvarez in 1954 according to kahlo s wishes she was dressed in an outfit she had selected her nails were painted and hair braided and her favorite jewelry adorned her neck and fingers one of her most iconic images and a personal favorite of alvarez s was entierro de yalalag burial at yalalag created in 1946 photograph captures a funeral procession in which zapotec women in traditional dress accompany a coffin their faces are obscured their heads are covered with scarves and they humbly gaze toward their feet separated from queue of male mourners bordering group of women care with which composition was made contrasting white flowing garments against dark landscape and coffin establishes a rhythmic lyrical pattern creating an otherworldly effect demonstrating both her respect for indigenous culture and desire to document mexican rituals alvarez also captured a deeper social meaning in photograph lack of individual identity for women and their seeming anonymity represents societal constraints upon them and their perceived interchangeability publications exhibitions 1935 group revolucionarios de las del sector de la de artes department of fine arts guadalajara 1940 group
