al azhar mosque known simply in egypt as al azhar is an egyptian mosque in islamic cairo al mu izz li din allah of fatimid dynasty commissioned its construction for newly established capital city in 970 its name is usually thought to allude to islamic prophet muhammad s daughter fatimah a revered figure in islam who was given title az zahra shining or resplendent one it was first mosque established in cairo a city that has since gained nickname city of a thousand minarets after its dedication in 972 and with hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989 mosque slowly developed into what is today second oldest continuously run university in world after al in fes al azhar university has long been regarded as foremost institution in islamic world for study of sunni theology and sharia or islamic law university integrated within mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961 following egyptian revolution of 1952 over course of its over a millennium long history mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded because it was founded as a shiite ismaili institution saladin and sunni ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al azhar removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school these moves were reversed under mamluk sultanate under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place later rulers of egypt showed differing degrees of deference to mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance both to school and to upkeep of mosque today al azhar remains a deeply influential institution in egyptian society that is highly revered in sunni muslim world and a symbol of islamic egypt name city of cairo was established by fatimid general gawhar al siqilli a former greek slave from sicily on behalf of his then master caliph al mu izz following fatimid conquest of egypt in 969 it was originally named al mansuriyya after prior seat of fatimid caliphate al mansuriya in modern tunisia mosque first used in 972 may have initially been named jami al mansuriyya mosque of mansuriyya as was common practice at time it was al mu izz who renamed city al qahira cairo meaning victorious name of mosque thus became jami al qahira mosque of cairo first transcribed in arabic sources mosque acquired its current name al azhar sometime between caliphate of al mu izz and end of reign of second fatimid caliph in egypt al aziz billah azhar is masculine form for zahra meaning splendid or most resplendent zahra is an epithet applied to muhammad s daughter fatimah wife of caliph ali ibn abi talib she was claimed as of al mu izz and imams of fatimid dynasty one theory is that her epithet is source for name al azhar theory however is not confirmed in any arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later western sources an alternative theory is that mosque s name is derived from names given by fatimid caliphs to their palaces those near mosque were collectively named al az brilliant palaces by al aziz billah and royal gardens were named after another derivative of word zahra palaces had been completed and named prior to mosque changing its name from jami al qahira to al azhar word jami is derived from arabic root word jama a g m meaning to gather word is used for large congregational mosques while in classical arabic name for al azhar remains jami al azhar pronunciation of word jami changes to gama in egyptian arabic history thumb courtyard of

isma ili imam conquered egypt through his general gawhar wresting it from sunni ikhshidid dynasty by order of caliph gawhar then oversaw construction of royal enclosure of fatimid caliphate and its army and had al azhar built as a base to spread isma ili shi a islam located near densely populated sunni city of fustat cairo became center of isma ili sect of shi a islam and seat of fatimid empire gawhar ordered construction of a congregational mosque for new city and work commenced on april 4 970 mosque was completed in 972 and first friday prayers were held there on june 22 972 during ramadan al azhar soon became a center of learning in islamic world and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there under fatimid rule previously secretive teachings of isma ili madh hab school of law were made available to general public al nu man ibn muhammad was appointed qadi judge under al mu izz and placed in charge of teaching of isma ili madh hab classes were taught at palace of caliph as well as at al azhar with separate sessions available to women during eid ul fitr in 973 mosque was rededicated by caliph as official congregational mosque in cairo al mu izz and his son when he in turn became caliph would preach at least one friday khutbah sermon during ramadan at al azhar yaqub ibn killis a polymath jurist and first official vizier of fatimids made al azhar a key center for instruction in islamic law in 988 following year 45 scholars were hired to give lessons laying foundation for what would become leading university in muslim world mosque was expanded during rule of caliph al aziz 975 996 according to al mufaddal he ordered restoration of portions of mosque and had ceiling raised by one next fatimid caliph al hakim would continue to renovate mosque providing a new wooden door in 1010 however al hakim s reign saw completion of al hakim mosque and al azhar lost its status as cairo s primary congregational mosque in may 1009 al hakim mosque became sole location for caliph s sermons prior to this al hakim would rotate where friday sermon was held following al hakim s reign al azhar was restored by al mustansir additions and renovations were carried during reign of remaining fatimid caliphs al hafiz undertook a major refurbishment in 1138 which established keel shaped arches and carved stucco decoration seen in courtyard today as well as dome at central entrance of prayer hall initially lacking a library al azhar was endowed by fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed basis of its collection fatimid efforts to establish isma ili practice among population were however largely unsuccessful much of its manuscript collection was dispersed in chaos that ensued with fall of fatimid caliphate and al azhar became a sunni institution shortly thereafter ayyubid dynasty saladin who overthrew fatimids in 1171 was hostile to shi ite principles of learning propounded at al azhar during fatimid caliphate and under his ayyubid dynasty mosque suffered from neglect congregational prayers were banned by sadr al din ibn appointed qadi by saladin reason for this edict may have been shafi i teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque or mistrust of former shi a institution by new sunni ruler by this time much larger al hakim mosque was completed congregational prayers in cairo were held there in addition to stripping al azhar of its status as congregational mosque saladin also ordered removal from mihrab of mosque a silver band on which names of fatimid caliphs had been inscribed this and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5 000 saladin did not completely disregard upkeep of mosque and according to al mufaddal one of mosque s minarets was raised during saladin s rule teaching center at mosque also suffered once well stocked library at al azhar was neglected and manuscripts of fatimid teachings that were held at al azhar were destroyed ayyubid dynasty promoted teaching of sunni theology in subsidized madrasas schools built throughout cairo student funding was withdrawn organized classes were no longer held at mosque and professors that had prospered under fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living al azhar nevertheless remained seat of arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period while official classes were discontinued private lessons were still offered in mosque there are reports that a scholar possibly al baghdadi taught a number of subjects such as law and medicine at al azhar saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars which was increased to 100 dinars by saladin s heirs while mosque was neglected by saladin and his heirs policies of sunni ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al azhar educational institutions were established by sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as heretical teachings of shi a islam these colleges ranging in size focused on teaching sunni doctrine had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics such as rhetorics math and science no such colleges had been established in egypt by time of saladin s conquest saladin and later rulers of ayyubid dynasty would build twenty six colleges in egypt among them salihiyya madrasa al azhar eventually adopted saladin s educational reforms modeled on college system he instituted and its fortunes improved under mamluks who restored student stipends and salaries for shuyukh teaching staff

during mamluk sultanate by sultan baibars in 1266 while shafi i teachings which saladin and ayyubids followed stipulated that only one mosque should be used as a congregational mosque in a community hanafi madh hab to which mamluks adhered placed no such restriction al azhar had by now lost its association with fatimids and isma ili doctrines and with cairo s rapid expansion need for mosque space allowed baibars to disregard al azhar s history and restore mosque to its former prominence under baibars and mamluk sultanate al azhar saw return of stipends for students and teachers as well as onset of work to repair mosque which had been neglected for nearly 100 years according to al mufaddal emir izz al din al hilli built his house next to mosque and while doing so repaired mosque al maqrizi reports that emir repaired walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats first khutbah since reign of fatimid caliph al hakim took place on 16 january 1266 with sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier an earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al azhar and a number of other mosques throughout mamluk territory responsibility for reconstruction was split among amirs princes of sultanate and head of army amir salar who was tasked with repairing damage these repairs were first done since reign of baibars seven years later a dedicated school madrasa al aqbughawiyya was built along northwest wall of mosque portions of wall of mosque were removed to accommodate new building construction of another school madrasa al taybarsiyya began in 1332 1333 this building which was completed in 1339 1340 would also impact structure of mosque as it was built over site of mida a fountain for ablution both of madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al azhar with separate entrances and prayer halls though mosque had regained its standing in cairo repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan this changed under rule of al zahir barquq first sultan of burji dynasty both sultan barquq and then sultan al mu tried in 1397 and 1424 respectively to replace minaret of al azhar with a new one in stone but on both occasions construction was found to be defective and had to be pulled down resumption of direct patronage by those in highest positions of government continued through to end of mamluk rule improvements and additions were made by sultans qaytbay and qansuh al ghuri each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets that still stand today it was common practice among mamluk sultans to build minarets perceived as symbols of power and most effective way of cementing one s position in cairo cityscape sultans wished to have a noticeable association with prestigious al azhar al ghuri may also have rebuilt dome in front of original mihrab although mosque school was leading university in islamic world and had regained royal patronage it did not overtake madrasas as favored place of education among cairo s elite al azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning whereas madrasas that had first been constructed during saladin s rule were fully integrated into state educational system al azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in egypt and middle east far surpassing numbers attending madrasas al azhar s student body was organized in riwaqs fraternities along national lines and branches of islamic law were studied average degree required six years of study by 14th century al azhar had achieved a preeminent place as center for studies in law theology and arabic becoming a for students all around islamic world however only one third of ulema islamic scholars of egypt were reported to have either attended or taught

patronage ceased sultan selim i first ottoman ruler of egypt attended al azhar for congregational friday prayer during his last week in egypt but did not donate anything to upkeep of mosque later ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended friday prayers at al azhar but rarely provided subsidies for maintenance of mosque though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers in contrast to expansions and additions undertaken during mamluk sultanate only two ottoman walis governors restored al azhar in early ottoman period despite their defeat by selim i and ottomans in 1517 mamluks remained influential in egyptian society becoming beys chieftains nominally under control of ottoman governors instead of amirs at head of an empire first governor of egypt under selim i was khai r bey a mamluk amir who had defected to ottomans during battle of marj dabiq though mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their sultanate including two in 1523 ottomans refrained from completely destroying mamluk hold over power structure of egypt mamluks did suffer losses both economic and military in immediate aftermath of ottoman victory and this was reflected in lack of financial assistance provided to al azhar in first hundred years of ottoman rule by 18th century mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout cairo and at al azhar specifically al a powerful mamluk bey sponsored several additions and renovations in early 18th century under his direction a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735 he also sponsored rebuilding of turkish and syrian riwaqs both of which had originally been built by qaytbay this marked beginning of largest set of renovations to be undertaken since expansions conducted under mamluk sultanate abd al rahman katkhuda was appointed katkhuda head of janissaries in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout cairo and at al azhar under his direction three new gates were built bab al muzayinin gate of barbers so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of gate which eventually became main entrance to mosque bab al sa ayida gate of sa idis named for sa idi people of upper egypt and several years later bab al shurba soup gate from which food often rice soup would be served to students a prayer hall was added to south of original one doubling size of available prayer space katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of riwaqs that surrounded mosque katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in al azhar in 1776 he became first person and last to be interred within mosque since al a female mystic who had died around 1588 during ottoman period al azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in egypt overtaking madrasas that had been originally instituted by saladin and greatly expanded by mamluks by end of 18th century al azhar had become inextricably linked to ulema of egypt ulema also were able to influence government in an official capacity with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to pasha honorary governor who in turn was appointed for only one year this period also saw introduction of more secular courses taught at al azhar with science and logic joining philosophy in curriculum during this period al azhar saw its first non maliki rector abdullah al a follower of madhab was appointed rector no follower of maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when salim al was appointed to post al azhar also served as a focal point for protests against ottoman occupation of egypt both from within ulema and from among general public student protests at al azhar were common and shops in vicinity of mosque would often close out of solidarity with students ulema was also on occasion able to defy government in one instance in 1730 31 ottoman aghas harassed residents living near al azhar while pursuing three fugitives gates at al azhar were closed in protest and ottoman governor fearing a larger uprising ordered aghas to refrain from going near al azhar another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which wali harassed people near al hussein mosque who then went to al azhar to demonstrate wali was subsequently dismissed from his post french occupation napoleon invaded egypt in july 1798 arriving in alexandria on july 2 and moving on to

of a city first instituted in alexandria was put in place throughout french occupied egypt napoleon also unsuccessfully sought a fatwa from al azhar imams that would deem it permissible under islamic law to declare allegiance to napoleon napoleon s efforts to win over both egyptians and ottomans proved unsuccessful ottoman empire declared war on 9 september 1798 and a revolt against french troops was launched from al azhar on 21 october 1798 egyptians armed with stones spears and knives rioted and looted following morning diwan met with napoleon in an attempt to bring about a peaceful conclusion to hostilities napoleon initially incensed agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked sheikhs of diwan to organize talks with rebels rebels believing move indicated weakness among french refused napoleon then ordered that city be fired upon from cairo citadel aiming directly at al azhar during revolt two to three hundred french soldiers were killed with 3 000 egyptian casualties six of ulema of al azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them with several more condemned any egyptian caught by french troops was imprisoned or if caught bearing weapons beheaded french troops intentionally desecrated mosque walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed troops tied their horses to mihrab and ransacked student quarters and libraries throwing copies of quran on floor leaders of revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with napoleon but were rebuffed napoleon who had been well respected in egypt and had earned himself nickname sultan el kebir great sultan among people of cairo lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed in march 1800 french general jean baptiste kleber was assassinated by suleiman al halabi a student at al azhar following assassination napoleon ordered closing of mosque doors remained bolted until ottoman and british assistance arrived in august 1801 conservative tradition of mosque with its lack of attention to science was shaken by napoleon s invasion a seminal innovation occurred with introduction of printing presses to egypt finally enabling curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text though mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930 upon withdrawal of french muhammad ali pasha encouraged establishment of secular learning and history math and modern science were adopted into curriculum by 1872 under direction of jamal al din al afghani european philosophy was also added to study program muhammad ali dynasty

in front of him following french withdrawal ali wali governor and self declared khedive viceroy of egypt sought to consolidate his newfound control of country to achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit and eventually eliminate ability of al azhar ulema to influence government he imposed taxes on rizqa lands tax free property owned by mosques and madrasas from which al azhar drew a major portion of its income in june 1809 he ordered that deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to state in a move that provoked outrage among ulema as a result umar makram al ashraf a prestigious islamic post led a revolt in july 1809 revolt failed and makram an influential ally of ulema was exiled to damietta ali also sought to limit influence of al azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within government to those educated outside of al azhar he sent select students to france to be educated under a western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to and thus bypassed system of al azhar under rule of isma il pasha grandson of muhammad ali major public works projects were initiated with aim of transforming cairo into a european styled city these projects at first funded by a boom in cotton industry eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by british providing an excuse for british to occupy egypt in 1882 after having pushed out isma il pasha in 1879 reign of isma il pasha also saw return of royal patronage to al azhar as khedive isma il restored bab al sa ayida first built by katkhuda and madrasa al aqbughawiyya tewfik pasha isma il s son who became khedive when his father was deposed as a result of british pressure continued to restore mosque tewfik renovated prayer hall that was added by katkhuda aligned southeastern facade of hall with street behind it and remodeled facade of madrasa al along with several other areas of mosque abbas hilmi ii succeeded his father tewfik as khedive of egypt and sudan in 1892 and continued renovations started by his grandfather isma il he restructured main facade of mosque and built a new three story riwaq in neo mamluk style along mosque s southwestern corner known as riwaq al abbasi which was completed in 1901 under his rule committee for conservation of monuments of arab art also known as comite also restored original fatimid sahn these renovations were both needed and helped modernize al azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis thumb courtyard of al azhar mosque c 1900 major set of reforms that began under rule of isma il pasha continued under british occupation muhammad mahdi al abbasi sheikh al azhar had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to hiring practices of university as well as to standardize examinations taken by students further efforts to modernize educational system were made under hilmi s rule during british occupation mosque s manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library sanitation for students improved and a regular system of exams instituted from 1885 other colleges in egypt were placed directly under administration of al azhar mosque during sa ad s term as minister of education before he went on to lead egyptian revolution of 1919 further efforts were made to modify educational policy of al azhar while a bastion of conservatism in many regards mosque was opposed to islamic fundamentalism especially as espoused by muslim brotherhood founded in 1928 school attracted students from throughout world including students from southeast asia and particularly indonesia providing a counterbalance to influence of in saudi arabia under reign of king fuad i two laws were passed that reorganized educational structure at al azhar first of these in 1930 split school into three departments arabic language sharia and theology with each department located in buildings outside of mosque throughout cairo additionally formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one of these three fields of study six years later a second law was passed that moved main office for school to a newly constructed building across street from mosque additional structures were later added to supplement three departmental buildings ideas advocated by several influential reformers in early 1900s such as muhammad abduh and muhammad al ahmadi al zawahiri began to take hold at al azhar in 1928 with appointment of mustafa al maraghi as rector a follower of abduh majority of ulema opposed his appointment al maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of mosque and its school expanding programs outside of traditional subjects fuad disliked al maraghi and had him replaced after one year by al zawahiri but al maraghi would return to post of rector in 1935 serving until his death in 1945 under his leadership al azhar s curriculum was expanded to include non arabic languages and modern sciences al zawahiri who had also been opposed by ulema of early 1900s continued efforts to modernize and reform al azhar following al maraghi s second term as rector another student of abduh was appointed rector post 1952 revolution following egyptian revolution of 1952 led by free officers movement of muhammad naguib and gamal abdel nasser in which egyptian monarchy was overthrown university began to be separated from mosque a number of properties that surrounded mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955 mosque itself would no longer serve as a school and college was officially designated a university in 1961 1961 law separated dual roles of educational institution and religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout muslim world law also created secular departments within al azhar such as colleges of medicine engineering and economics furthering efforts at modernization first seen following french occupation reforms of curriculum have led to a massive growth in number of egyptian students attending al azhar run schools specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within al azhar system number of students reported to attend al azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90 000 in 1970 to 300 000 in early in 1980s up to nearly one million in early 1990s and exceeding 1 3 million students in 2001 thumb gamal abdel nasser who led egyptian revolution in 1952

piece gray suit and white shirt with an angularly striped tie and visible white pocket handkerchief behind him several faces are visible during his tenure as prime minister and later president nasser continued efforts to limit power of ulema of al azhar and to use its influence to his advantage in 1952 were nationalized and placed under authority of newly created ministry of religious endowments cutting off ability of mosque to control its financial affairs he abolished sharia courts merging religious courts with state judicial system in 1955 severely limiting independence of ulema 1961 reform law which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed independence of al azhar gave president of egypt authority to appoint sheikh al azhar a position first created during ottoman rule and chosen from and by ulema since its inception al azhar which remained a symbol of islamic character of both nation and state continued to influence population while being unable to exert its will over state al azhar became increasingly co opted into state bureaucracy after revolution independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased authority of ulema were further weakened by creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws while these reforms dramatically curtailed independence of ulema they also had effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into state apparatus 1961 reform law also provided ulema with resources of state though purse strings were outside of their control while nasser sought to subjugate ulema beneath state he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit influence of al azhar one such proposal was made by taha hussein in 1955 hussein sought to dismantle primary and secondary educational system and transform university into a faculty of theology which would be included within modern secular collegiate educational system ulema opposed this plan though nasser s choice of maintaining al azhar s status was due more to personal political considerations such as use of al azhar to grant legitimacy to regime than on opposition of ulema al azhar now fully integrated as an arm of government was then used to justify actions of government although ulema had in past issued rulings that socialism is irreconcilable with islam following revolution s land reforms new rulings were supplied giving nasser a religious justification for what he termed an islamic socialism ulema would also serve as a counterweight to muslim brotherhood and to saudi arabia s wahhabi influence an assassination attempt on nasser was blamed on brotherhood and organization was outlawed nasser needing support from ulema as he initiated mass arrests of brotherhood members relaxed some of restrictions placed on al azhar ulema of al azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle brotherhood and continued to do so in subsequent regimes despite efforts of nasser and al azhar to discredit brotherhood organization continued to function al azhar also provided legitimacy for war with israel in 1967 declaring conflict against israel a holy struggle following nasser s death in 1970 anwar sadat became president of egypt sadat wished to restore al azhar as a symbol of egyptian leadership throughout arab world saying that arab world cannot function without egypt and its azhar recognizing growing influence of muslim brotherhood sadat relaxed several restrictions on brotherhood and ulema as a whole however in an abrupt about face in september 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions as part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies sadat instituted sanctions against any of ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies ulema of al azhar continued to be used as a tool of government sparking criticism among several groups including islamist and other more moderate groups shukri mustafa an influential islamist figure accused ulema of providing religious judgments for sole purpose of government convenience when sadat needed support for making peace with israel which vast majority of egyptian population regarded as an enemy al azhar provided a decree stating that time had come to make peace hosni mubarak succeeded sadat as president of egypt following sadat s assassination in 1981 while al azhar would continue to oblige government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under mubarak s regime under jad al haq sheikh of al azhar from 1982 until his death in 1994 al azhar asserted its independence from state at times criticizing policies of state for instigating extremist islamist sects al haq argued that if government wished al azhar to effectively combat groups such as al gama a al then al azhar must be permitted greater independence from state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference under mubarak a number of powers of state were ceded to al azhar during 1990s modifications to existing censorship laws gave al azhar ability to censor both print and electronic media though law stipulates that al azhar may only become involved following a complaint in practice its role has been much more pervasive for example television scripts were routinely sent to al azhar for approval prior to airing al azhar continues to hold a status above other sunni religious authorities throughout world and as sunnis form a large majority of total muslim population al azhar exerts considerable influence on islamic world as a whole in addition to being default authority within egypt al azhar has been looked to outside of egypt for religious judgments prior to gulf war saudi arabia s king fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing stationing of foreign troops within kingdom and despite islam s two holiest sites being located within saudi arabia he asked head sheikh of al azhar instead of grand mufti of saudi arabia in 2003 nicolas sarkozy at time french minister of interior requested a judgment from al azhar allowing muslim girls to not wear hijab in french public schools despite existence of french council of islam sheikh of al azhar provided ruling saying that while wearing hijab is an islamic duty muslim women of france are obligated to respect and follow french laws ruling drew much criticism within egypt as compromising islamic principles to convenience french government and in turn egyptian government post 2011 revolution al azhar was not unaffected by 2011 egyptian revolution that saw removal of hosni mubarak as president of egypt student government elections in months following revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for once banned muslim brotherhood protests demanding that military junta ruling egypt restore mosque s independence from state broke out and mosque itself commissioned writing of a draft law that would grant al azhar greater independence from government within al azhar debate on its future and rightful role within state has replaced what had been a mollified single voice in support of policies of mubarak regime various views on al azhar s future role in egypt come from several parties including leading islamist organizations such as muslim brotherhood liberal voices that wish to see al azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra conservative islamists known as and those that hope to see al azhar become wholly independent from state and in complete control of its finances leadership and further that it be placed in charge of religious ministries of state architecture architecture of al azhar is closely tied to history of cairo materials taken from multiple periods of egyptian history from ancient egyptians through greek and roman rule to coptic christian era were used in early mosque structure which drew on other fatimid structures in ifriqiya later additions from different rulers of egypt likewise show influences from both within and outside of egypt sections of mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration such as domes from ottoman period and minarets built by mamluks initially built as a prayer hall with five aisles and a modest central courtyard mosque has since been expanded multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding original structure many of egypt s rulers have shaped art and architecture of al azhar from minarets added by mamluks and gates added during ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as installation of a new mihrab none of original minarets or domes have survived with some of current minarets having been rebuilt
