cotton top tamarin saguinus oedipus is a small new world monkey weighing less than this new world monkey can live up to 24 years old but most of them die at 13 years old one of smallest primates cotton top tamarin is easily recognized by long white sagittal crest extending from its forehead to its shoulders species is found in tropical forest edges and secondary forests in northwestern colombia where it is arboreal and diurnal its diet includes insects and plant exudates and it is an important seed disperser in tropical ecosystem cotton top tamarin displays a wide variety of social behaviors in particular groups form a clear dominance hierarchy where only dominant pairs breed female normally gives birth to twins and uses pheromones to prevent other females in group from breeding these tamarins have been extensively studied for their high level of cooperative care as well as altruistic and spiteful behaviors communication between cotton top tamarins is sophisticated and shows evidence of grammatical structure a language feature that must be acquired up to 40 000 cotton top tamarins are thought to have been caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976 when cites gave them highest level of protection and all international trade was banned now species is at risk due to large scale habitat destruction as lowland forest in northwestern colombia where cotton top tamarin is found has been reduced to 5 of its previous area it is currently classified as critically endangered and is one of rarest primates in world with only 6 000 individuals left in wild taxonomy and naming s oedipus has common names cotton top tamarin and cotton headed tamarin in english its name comes from white hair that spans its head and flows down past neck in spanish it is commonly called titi titi blanco titi cabeza blanca or titi in german speaking areas cotton top tamarin is commonly known as literally liszt monkey most likely due to resemblance of its crest to hairstyle of hungarian composer and piano virtuoso franz liszt german wikipedia article species was first described by linnaeus in 1758 as oedipus linnaeus chose species name oedipus which means swollen foot but as species does not have particularly large feet it is unknown why he chose this name linnaeus often selected names from mythology without any particular rationale and he may have used name of oedipus mythical greek king of thebes more or less arbitrarily in 1977 philip hershkovitz performed a taxonomic analysis of species based on fur coloration patterns cranial and mandibular morphology and ear size he classified geoffroy s tamarin s geoffroyi as a subspecies of s oedipus subsequent analyses by hernandez camacho and cooper 1976 mittermeier and coimbra filho 1981 and later grooves 2001 consider s oedipus and s geoffroyi types to be separate species some researchers such as thorington 1976 posit that s oedipus is more closely related to white footed tamarin s leucopus than to s geoffroyi this view is supported by and s analysis of toothcomb dental morphology 1987 and by skinner 1991 who found similarities between s oedipus and s leucopus in 16 of 17 morphological traits considered this species of white headed tamarin is thought to have diverged from other amazonian forms such as s leucopus this is supported by morphological considerations of transition from juvenile to adulthood during which fur coloration patterns change significantly and are similar between two species hershkovitz proposed that separation of two species happened in pleistocene at height of atrato river where it intersected cauca magdalena at that time area was covered by a sea which created a geographic barrier that caused species to diverge through process of allopatric speciation today two species are principally separated by atrato river physical characteristics cotton top tamarin is part of most diminutive family of monkeys callitrichidae marmosets and tamarins it weighs on average its head body length is while its tail which is not prehensile is slightly longer at around species is not sexually dimorphic male and female are of a similar size and weight members of subfamily including this species have sharp nails tegulae on all digits except big toes which have flat nails common to other primates tegulae resemble a squirrel s claws and help with movement through trees thumb left white hair on back of head and neck inspire its common name cotton top cotton top tamarin has a long sagittal crest consisting of white hairs from forehead to nape flowing over shoulders skin of face is black with gray or white bands located above eyes these bands continue along edge of face down to jaw tamarins are generally divided into three groups by their facial characteristics hairy faced mottled faced and bare faced cotton top tamarin has fine white hairs covering its face but they are so fine as to appear naked thus is considered a bare faced tamarin its lower canine teeth are longer than its incisors creating appearance of tusks like other cotton top tamarin has two molar teeth on each side of its jaw not three like other new world monkeys cotton top tamarin has fur covering all of body except palms of hands and feet eyelids borders of nostrils nipples anus and penis back is brown and underparts arms and legs are whitish yellow rump and inner thighs and upper tail are reddish orange fur is distributed with varying densities throughout body genital region scrotum and pubic zone axilla and base of tail have lower densities while forward region is much higher many individuals have stripes or whorls of fur of striking coloration on their throats cotton top also has whiskers on its forehead and around its mouth habitat and distribution thumb a sign in national natural park in northern colombia pointing out tamarin s endangered status in only part of world where it still exists cotton top tamarin is restricted to a small area of northwest colombia between cauca and magdalena rivers to south and east atlantic coast to north and atrato river to west they mostly live brazil two thirds of their habitat has been destroyed historically entire area was suitable for cotton top tamarin but due to habitat loss through deforestation it survives in fragmented parks and reserves one of most important areas for cotton top is national park which consists of of primary and secondary forests cotton top tamarin is found in both primary and secondary forests from humid tropical forests in south of its range to tropical dry forests in north it is seldom found at altitudes above but has been encountered up to it prefers lower levels of tropical forests but may also be found foraging on ground and between understory and canopy it can adapt to forest fragments and can survive in relatively disturbed habitats in dry forests are pronounced seasons between december and april it is dry while heavy rainfall occurs between august and november which can flood forest floor across its range annual rainfall varies between ecology cotton top tamarin has a diet of mainly fruit 40 and animal material 40 this includes insects plant exudates such as gum and sap nectar and occasionally reptiles and amphibians due to its small body size and high food passage rate its diet must be high quality and high energy is common in cotton top and species hunts for insects using a variety of methods stealth pouncing chasing exploring holes and turning over leaves tamarins act as seed dispersers in tropical ecosystems while larger primates eat larger seeds tamarins eat smaller ones expelled seeds have a higher germination rate than others and ingesting larger seeds may help to dislodge and expel intestinal parasites cotton top tamarin is diurnal and sleeps with its social group in trees with foliage cover group leaves sleeping tree together an hour after dawn and spends day foraging resting travelling and grooming species is thought to rise late and increases speed of its foraging and travelling before dusk to avoid crepuscular and nocturnal predators its main predators include raptors mustelids felids and snakes cotton top tamarin is extremely vigilant always looking for potential predators when group is resting one individual moves apart and acts as a lookout to alert group if it sees a threat cotton top tamarin can live as long as 24 years in captivity while its lifespan in wild averages 13 years behavior thumb two cotton top tamarins feed at ueno zoo in japan video social systems cotton top tamarin is a highly social primate that typically lives in groups of two to nine individuals but may reach up to 13 members these small familial groups tend to fluctuate in size and in composition of individuals and a clear dominance hierarchy is always present within a party at head of group is breeding pair male and female in this pair are typically in a monogamous reproductive relationship and together serve as group s dominant leaders dominant pairs are only breeding pair within their groups and female generally has authority over breeding male while nonbreeding group members can be leading pair s offspring immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups this social grouping in cotton top tamarins is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure cotton top tamarins exhibit prosocial behavior that benefits other members of group and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby group s subordinate adults help in rearing offspring of dominant pair dominant female is more likely to give birth to twins than a singleton so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise young to prevent younger subordinate females within group from breeding dominant female uses pheromones this suppresses sexual behavior and delays puberty unrelated males that join group can release females from this reproductive suppression this may result in more than one female of group becoming pregnant but only one of pregnancies will be successful cooperation thumb left a male grooming a female as part of species cooperative ritual in cooperative breeding effort put into caring for dominant breeders offspring is shared by group members parents siblings and immigrant adults share young rearing duties for breeding pair s young these duties include carrying protecting feeding comforting and even engaging in play behavior with group s young cotton top tamarins display high levels of parental investment during infant care males particularly those that are paternal show a greater involvement in caregiving than do females despite this both male and female infants prefer contact and proximity to their mothers over their fathers males may invest additional support in rearing offspring as a form of courtship to win favor of group s dominant female however evidence indicates that time spent carrying infants does not correlate with a male s overall copulation frequency since only one female in a group breeds heavy investment in infant care ensures that all offspring survive until independence accordingly cotton top tamarins bear excessive costs to care for group s young male carriers especially paternal carriers incur large energetic costs for sake of group s young this burden may cause some male cotton tops to lose up to 10 11 of their total body weight large weight loss may occur from reduced food intake as infant carrying inhibits foraging ability for a carrier trend of male carrier weight loss and decreased food intake is in contrast to dominant female s period when she gains weight after increasing her own food intake and relinquishing much of her infant carrying duties altruism while caregiving by males appears to be altruistic particularly in cotton top sires costs of infant care may in fact be tolerated for selfish reasons namely costs to male weight and foraging ability may in turn promote consecutive pregnancies in dominant females thereby providing more offspring bearing sire s genes additionally cooperative breeding structure of cotton tops can change with group size and parental experience first time sires spend a greater amount of time carrying infant than experienced ones and in smaller groups sires do a greater proportion of carrying and feeding infant than in larger groups where helpers take on more of work total care for infants remains constant with varying group size and infant outcome is not significantly different in groups that have differing levels of experience in raising offspring thumb once infants reach sufficient age they permanently leave backs of their carriers and begin contributing to group cooperative breeding hypothesis predicts that cotton top tamarins engage with this young rearing paradigm and in turn naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior these monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants vocalizing alarm calls and in sharing food though some studies indicate that cotton top tamarins have psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism it is unclear whether cotton top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history other studies involving cotton top tamarins have hinted that positive reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are irrelevant in of these primates some researchers believe these primates tend to cooperate for selfish reasons and in situations where they incur some benefit for themselves that is cooperation in cotton top tamarins can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism tamarins in captivity have shown ability to distinguish other individuals based on cooperative tendencies and past behavior cotton tops ultimately use this information to guide future cooperation brief periods of defection tend to cause swift irreparable breakups between these primates and their cooperators to avoid this cotton top tamarins may make economically driven decisions based on projected incentives of a potential spite and aggression despite an expansive array of altruistic behaviors cotton top tamarins engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment they have been observed to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys that deny them benefits further in captivity these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates that are committed fully to cooperation based on this researchers believe that repeated interactions in a cooperative society like that of cotton top tamarin can heighten chances that an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group this reaction has also been observed in other species however these reciprocal punishments or relative lack of altruistic actions may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases chances of a cotton top punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action thumb left upright dominant females may evict subordinate females from group out of spite another way to look at punishment in cotton top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups as well as between species cotton top tamarin like many marmosets other tamarins and specifically those in genus saguinus stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to same gender these intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group though aggression can occur within groups response towards intruders of another species is much more drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays females typically employ scent marking intruder response tactics whereas males are more prone to vocalizing threats physical aggression and scent marking in cotton top tamarins is done in two ways either using anogenital scent marking or scent marking ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings these variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter or serve as a reproductive signal intensity of female threats is generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders in contrast male cotton tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females communication cotton top tamarin vocalizes with bird like whistles soft chirping sounds high pitched trilling and staccato calls researchers describe its repertoire of 38 distinct sounds as unusually sophisticated conforming to grammatical rules jayne cleveland and charles snowdon performed an in depth feature analysis to classify cotton top s repertoire of vocalizations in 1982 they concluded that it uses a simple grammar consisting of eight phonetic variations of short frequency modulated chirps each representing varying messages and five longer constant frequency whistles they hypothesize that some of these calls demonstrate that cotton top tamarin uses phonetic syntax while other calls may be exemplars of lexical syntax usage each type of call is given a letter signifier for example c calls are associated with finding food and d calls are associated with eating further these calls can be modified to better deliver information relevant to auditory localization in call recipients using this range of vocalizations adults may be able to communicate with one another about intention thought processes and emotion including curiosity fear dismay playfulness warnings joy and calls to young language acquisition over first 20 weeks after a cotton top tamarin is born it is not fully capable of producing range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can despite this limitation on speech producibility researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first infants can at times produce adult like chirps but this is rarely done in correct context and remains inconsistent across first 20 weeks of life regardless infant cotton tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps this indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for offspring followed closely by auditory comprehension and later by proper vocal producibility thumb although limited in their own vocal ranges juvenile cotton tops respond appropriately to varying contexts provided by adult vocalizations castro and snowdon 2000 observed that aside from inconsistent adult like chirping cotton top infants most often produce a prototype chirp that differs in vocalization structure from anything seen in full adult range of vocalizations infants are thought to imitate adult speakers which use differing calls in various contexts but by using solely infant prototypical chirp for instance adult cotton tops are known to significantly reduce amount of general alarm calling in presence of infants this is likely adapted so that adults in close proximity to group s young do not attract attention of predators to infant dense areas additionally infants reduce their prototype chirping in presence of predators whether infants are shadowing calling behavior of adults or they are comprehending danger remains unclear however researchers argue that young cotton top tamarins are able to represent semantic information regardless of immature speech production to confirm notion that language acquisition occurs as a progression of comprehension before production castro and snowdon 2000 showed that infants respond behaviorally to vocalizing adults in a fashion that indicates they can comprehend auditory inputs when an adult produces a c call chirp used to indicate food preference and when navigating to a food source an infant approaches adult caller to be fed but do not use prototype calling as a proxy for c calls this finding argues for idea that infants are able to understand vocalizations first and later acquire ability to communicate with adult vocalizations general calling among typical cotton top tamarin communicative vocalizations combination long call clc and alarm call ac are most heavily represented in literature clcs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles this type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors it is issued in presence of kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen predators of cotton top tamarin include snakes and most notably hawks early observations by patricia even showed that cotton tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate presence of birds of prey versus ground based predators thumb left a mature cotton top tamarin producing vocalization for group mates clcs involve production of complex sequence multisyllabic vocalizations researchers have argued that long calls exhibit individual differences thus can carry information sufficient for recipients to determine caller identity using habituation discrimination paradigms in language experiments this theory has been confirmed multiple times in literature however individual syllables within a complete clc vocalization in isolation of each other do not transfer sufficient information to communicate messages between monkeys scientists thus consider whole intact string of vocalizations to be unit of perception for clcs in cotton top tamarin these examinations may confirm that cotton tops incorporate a lexical syntax in areas of their communication since tamarins can discriminate between predatory threats using varying vocalizations recipients of an ac are thought to extract various complex signals from this form of communication primarily cotton tops are able to glean identity of cooperating tamarin through differences in individuals alarm calls further adults are able to discriminate gender of callers from their acs and determine range of calls within a related tamarin s alarm calling repertoire alarm call based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in cotton top tamarin firstly an ac recipient is able to identify a cooperating tamarin and by recognizing which in their group it is be able to judge reliability of ac from past experience this may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically determine amount of risk present and how endangered an individual and its group are additionally being able to localize auditory signals may help determine predator location especially in presence of a second ac from a different tamarin in group this can help confirm predator presence type e g flying versus ground based and support recipient in a predator s location in context of cotton top s cooperative breeding groups this is postulated as being adaptive for determining variable risk to one s group members for example a call recipient is able to determine which of its kin are and are not at risk e g young offspring mates subordinates relatives carriers etc and plan subsequent actions accordingly food calls thumb species is thought to vocalize food preference using c calls and food retrieval and eating using d calls cotton top tamarin makes selective specialized vocalizations in presence of food these include c call produced when a cotton top approaches and sorts through food and d call which is associated with food retrieval and is exhibited while eating c call chirping is believed to be an honest signal for communicating food preference and a cotton top tamarin more often and more rapidly vocalizes with these chirps when approaching a highly favored food source functionally this behavior may inform other tamarins of actions caller will take in a feeding context and whether a preferable food source is available despite this research indicating that food calls may be informative to fellow group mates other observations of cotton tops show that quantity and distribution of food and audience do not significantly alter a caller s food centered vocalizations cotton top tamarin is seen to produce food calls both in presence and absence of group members additionally response to food calls are directed back to an original caller independent of visual confirmation of a food source while this may appear to be a result from a very primitive form of communication roush and snowdon 2005 maintain that food calling behavior confers some mentally information about food to recipient tamarins conservation status wild population is estimated at 6 000 individuals with 2 000 adults this species is critically endangered and was listed in world s 25 most endangered primates between 2008 and 2012 publication lists highly endangered primate species and is released every two years by international union for conservation of nature species survival commission primate specialist group cotton top tamarin was not selected for 2012 2014 publication thumb left species is critically endangered with a wild population of merely 6 000 individuals including about 2 000 free roaming adults habitat destruction through forest clearing is main cause of this collapse and cotton top has lost more than three quarters of its original habitat to deforestation while lowland forest in which it lives has been reduced to 5 of its historical range this land is then used for large scale agricultural production i e cattle and farming logging oil palm plantations and hydroelectric projects that fragment cotton top tamarin s natural range illegal pet trade and scientific research have also been cited as factors by iucn while biomedical studies have recently limited their use of this species illegal capture for pet trade still plays a major role in endangering cotton top before 1976 when cites listed species under appendix i banning all international trade cotton top tamarin was exported for use in biomedical research in captivity cotton top is highly prone to colitis which is linked to an increased risk of a certain type of colon cancer up to 40 000 individuals were caught and exported for research into those diseases as well as epstein barr virus for benefit of humans species is now protected by international law although enough individuals are in captivity to sustain species it is still critically endangered in wild proyecto titi project tamarin was started in 1985 to provide information and support in conservation of cotton top tamarin and its habitat in northern colombia proyecto titi s programs combine field research education and community programs to spread awareness about this endangered species and encourage public to participate in its protection it now has partner status with wildlife conservation network in january 2015 two captive cotton top tamarins at alexandria zoological park in alexandria louisiana died when a caretaker left them outside overnight in temperatures as low as 30 degf one other individual survived references cotton top tamarin category mammals
