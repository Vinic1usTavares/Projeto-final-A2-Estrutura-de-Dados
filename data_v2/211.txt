in 1724 johann sebastian bach composed church cantata meine seel erhebt den herren as part of his second cantata cycle taken from martin luther s german translation of magnificat canticle meine seele erhebt den herren title translates as my soul magnifies lord also known as bach s german magnificat work follows his chorale cantata format bach composed meine seel erhebt den herren for feast of visitation 2 july which commemorates mary s visit to elizabeth as narrated in gospel of luke 1st chapter verses 39 to 56 in that narrative words of magnificat luke 1 46 55 are spoken by mary traditionally luther s translation of biblical text is sung to a german variant of tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone concluding with a doxology translated from gloria on same tune bach based his bwv 10 cantata on luther s german magnificat and its traditional setting working text and melody into composition as he had done with lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas by early july 1724 bach was more than a month into his second year as thomaskantor in leipzig bwv 10 is fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year outer movements of cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet two oboes strings and continuo luther s translation of luke 1 46 48 is text of first movement canticle s doxology is text of last movement five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives with between fourth and sixth movement a duet for alto and tenor soprano and bass each have one aria and two recitatives are sung by tenor text of arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from luke 1 49 53 and 55 text of duet is luther s translation of luke 1 54 melody associated with luther s german magnificat appears in movements 1 5 and 7 music of two of cantata s movements was published in 18th century an organ transcription of duet was published around 1748 as one of schubler chorales and closing chorale was included in c p e bach s 1780s collection of his father s four part chorales entire cantata was published in first volume of 19th century first complete edition of bach s works in 20th and 21st century concert and recording practice cantata is often combined with other german language cantatas but also several times with settings of latin magnificat by bach and other composers background late may 1723 bach took office as thomaskantor kantor at st thomas and director musices music director in leipzig he remained in that office until his death in 1750 from first sunday after trinity in 1723 that year falling on 30 may to trinity sunday of next year he presented a series of church cantatas known as his first cantata cycle cantatas of that cycle were often based on music he had composed before his leipzig period from first sunday after trinity in 1724 that year falling on 11 june he started his second cantata cycle with forty chorale cantatas composed to new librettos each of these librettos was based on text of a known chorale usually a lutheran hymn tune of which was adopted by bach in his setting first weeks of post after trinity season included feast of john baptist 24 june and feast of visitation 2 july in bach s time protestant leipzig observed three marian feasts requiring in context of liturgical year visitation was third of such occasions after purification falling in period of sundays after epiphany and annunciation falling around easter several traditions regarding these marian feasts such as selection of readings for church services were continued from period before leipzig had adopted lutheranism cantatas with a text in native language had since early 18th century become dominant genre of figural music in reformed german regions practices rooted in older traditions included occasional performance of a latin magnificat on occasions such as marian feasts or christmas meine seel erhebt den herren bwv 10 for visitation is fifth chorale cantata bach presented in 1724 its text is based on luther s german translation of magnificat singing tune associated with that version of magnificat a german variant of tonus peregrinus appears in bach s composition readings text and tune prescribed readings for feast day were from book of isaiah prophecy of messiah and from gospel of luke narration of mary s visit to elizabeth which includes her song of praise magnificat this gospel reading is a biblical episode that is often represented in art especially in music where it has become a traditional part of vesper services in bach s time german magnificat was regularly sung in leipzig in vespers in a four part setting of ninth psalm tone tonus peregrinus by johann hermann schein different from other chorale cantatas of cycle base for text and music is not a chorale but german magnificat it is a canticle a biblical song in prose concluded by traditional doxology text is based on luther s translation of biblical song to german in luther bible and on doxology in format of chorale cantata cycle an unknown librettist retained some parts of luther s wording while he paraphrased other passages for recitatives and arias he used original verses 46 48 for first movement verse 54 for fifth movement and doxology for seventh movement he paraphrased verse 49 for second movement verses 50 51 for third verses 52 53 for fourth and verse 55 for sixth movement latter expanded by a reference to birth of jesus thumb center upright 3 alt music and text of beginning of magnificat text of first two verses with music of ninth psalm tone bach s music is based on traditional ninth psalm tone which was familiar to leipzig congregation magnificats and visitation cantatas in bach s leipzig one of bach s predecessors as director musices of in leipzig was melchior hoffmann around 1707 he composed a german magnificat based on luther s german translation of magnificat portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated until well into bach s time in leipzig work known as magnificat little magnificat was for some time attributed to bach but later listed as spurious in bwv catalogue bwv anh 21 anh iii 168 frederick hudson and alfred durr an investigation into

this magnificat paraphrase around a decade before libretto was reprinted in leipzig it had already been set by reinhard keiser and johann mattheson it is not known whether bach set libretto neither which setting of libretto was used for 1725 visitation feast in leipzig a year later bach performed der herr wird ein neues im lande jlb 13 a visitation cantata by his second cousin johann ludwig bach picander s libretto for visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of bach s fourth cantata cycle libretto surviving without music starts with a dictum quoted from luther s german translation of luke 1 46 47 picander christian friedrich henrici ernst und gedichte volume iii leipzig joh boetii 1732 2nd printing 1737 pp 153 155 around 1733 bach transposed his latin magnificat to

cantatas of first half of 18th century are combined in bach s german magnificat it uses text of luther s translation of magnificat like bwv anh 21 and picander s 1728 libretto and it uses text paraphrased from magnificat like bwv 189 and 1725 visitation cantata like meiningen libretto used for jlb 13 cantata not only starts with a dictum but also has a second dictum directly quoted from

2004 this characteristic sets bwv 10 apart from bach s other chorale cantatas which as a rule contained quotes from lutheran hymns not from biblical prose some musical similarities between bwv 10 and bach s latin magnificat have been described philipp spitta sees a similar musical treatment at end of respective movements based on luke 1 51 text which are central fecit movement of latin magnificat and third des gut und movement of bwv 10 philipp spitta johann sebastian bach his work and influence on music of germany 1685 1750 translated by clara bell and j a fuller maitland vol 2 novello co

israel movement of bwv 243a version of latin magnificat has that cantus firmus performed by a trumpet in later bwv 243 version of same movement trumpet has been replaced by two oboes in corresponding movement of bwv 10 er denket der barmherzigkeit cantus firmus is performed by trumpet and two oboes masaaki suzuki assumes that this should be interpreted as trumpet for original 1724 version replaced by two oboes in 1740s revival version same modification that occurred to related movement of latin magnificat place of bwv 10 in bach s chorale cantata cycle bach followed a specific structure for most of cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle especially 40 he presented consecutively from first sunday after trinity of 1724 to palm sunday of 1725 in this chorale cantata format he retained original text and melody of chorale on which cantata was based in outer stanzas typically treating first as a chorale fantasia and last as a four part chorale setting while inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as basis for recitatives and arias usually with music independent of chorale tune 19th century bach scholars were largely unaware of composition history of chorale cantatas and how bach conceived cycle of these cantatas when alfred dorffel listed bach s chorale cantatas as a cycle in 1878 he ranged meine seel erhebt den herren between cantata for sixt sunday after trinity bwv 9 and one for seventh sunday after trinity bwv 107 dorffel alfred 1878 bach gesellschaft ausgabe volume 27 verzeichniss der no 1 120 breitkopf hartel preface p vii spitta described bach s chorale cantatas rather as a group than as a cycle and thought that most of them including bwv 10 were not composed before mid 1730s philipp spitta johann sebastian bach his work and influence on music of

instance by christoph wolff first of these cantatas begins with a chorale fantasia in form of a french overture with soprano singing cantus firmus of chorale opening movement of cantata for next sunday is in motet style with cantus firmus sung by alto for next occasion st john s day bach wrote a cantata with an opening movement in style of an italian violin concerto in which cantus firmus was given to tenor next day followed a cantata opening with a movement in vocal and instrumental counterpoint with cantus firmus sung by bass conductor john eliot gardiner writes about these first four cantatas of chorale cantata cycle together they make a fascinating and contrasted portfolio of choral e fantasia openings libretto publications in bach s leipzig more than once grouped first four cantatas after trinity or started a new publication with cantata for fifth occasion after trinity tatiana recent discoveries in st petersburg and their meaning for understanding of bach s cantatas pp 77 99 in understanding bach 4 2009 pp 88 89 in 1724 that fifth occasion was visitation for which bach composed it is not a typical second cycle chorale cantata in sense that it was based on a prose text lacking metre of a hymn text and a gregorian chant melody lacking a musical metre further unmodified canticle text and chant melody not only appeared in outer movements but also in one of middle movements duet no 5 text of final movement was a generic doxology which could be appended to any religious chant while other chorale cantatas commonly ended with a text that only appeared in hymn from which it was quoted bwv 125 bach s chorale cantata for purification based on canticle of simeon luke 2 29 32 does not have these exceptions to second cycle format it is based on luther s versified paraphrase of canticle and its metrical hymn melody nonetheless durr writes about bwv 10 here rendered in richard d p jones translation if ever a work deserved description chorale cantata it is this for it is based on a genuine gregorian chorale melody in 1724 feast of visitation fell on fourth sunday after trinity thus next cantata bach composed was a chorale cantata for fifth sunday after trinity bach did apparently not compose a cantata for sixt sunday after trinity in 1724 while absent from leipzig bach s second year in leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for fourth sunday after trinity he composed one for this occasion in 1732 ich ruf zu dir herr jesu christ bwv 177 one of later additions to chorale cantata cycle also for trinity vi bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date bwv 9 music structure and scoring bach structured cantata in seven movements first and last are set for choir and are based on chant melody they frame recitatives arias

seel erhebt den herren bwv 10 no title text type vocal winds strings key time movements 1 opening chorale fantasia is marked vivace lively bach begins movement with an instrumental introduction that is unrelated to psalm tone it is a trio of violins and continuo with oboes doubling violin and viola filling harmony main motif stands for joy and is set in rhythmical propulsion chorus enters after 12 measures with my soul magnifies lord cantus firmus is in soprano doubled by a trumpet whereas lower voices add free polyphony on motifs from introduction bach treats second verse similarly but with third verse for he has looked at humble state of his handmaid cantus firmus appears in alto certain words such as rejoice and selig call me blessed are adorned with melismas movement is concluded by a vocal setting without cantus firmus embedded in music of introduction framing movement 2 soprano aria lord you who are strong and mighty is a concerto of voice and oboes accompanied by strings it is first soprano aria in chorale cantata cycle 3 recitative goodness and love of highest ends on an arioso spitta compares end of this movement with end of 7th movement of bach s latin magnificat textually both movements treat same part of magnificat end of luke 1 51 and although other movement is set for five part chorus and tutti orchestra he considers closure of this recitative of german magnificat cantata equally picturesque 4 following aria mighty god casts from their thrones is set for bass and continuo a descending bass line in continuo over two octaves illustrates fall which voice also suggests in descending phrases second aspect of text exaltation of humble is shown by rising figures and final emptiness bloss und leer bare and empty by pauses 5 in fifth movement he remembers his mercy text returns to original german magnificat and music to psalm tone it is played by oboes and trumpet as cantus firmus while alto and tenor sing in imitation klaus hofmann interprets bass line of emphatic downward semitone intervals as sighs of divine mercy 6 recitative for tenor what god in times past to our forefathers referring to god s promise begins secco 7 in final movement two verses of doxology are set on psalm tone for four parts with all instruments playing colla parte wind instruments and violin i join soprano part setting is mostly in homophony but
