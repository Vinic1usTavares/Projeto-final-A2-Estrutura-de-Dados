forest cobra naja melanoleuca also commonly called black cobra and black and white lipped cobra is a species of venomous snake in family elapidae species is native to africa mostly central and western parts of continent it is largest true cobra species with a total length including tail of up to 3 1 meters 10 feet although it prefers lowland forest and moist savanna habitats this cobra is highly adaptable and can be found in drier climates within its geographical range it is a very capable swimmer and is often considered to be semi aquatic forest cobra is a generalist in its feeding habits having a highly varied diet anything from large insects to small mammals and other reptiles this species is alert nervous and is considered to be a very dangerous snake when cornered or molested it will assume typical cobra warning posture by raising its fore body off ground spreading a narrow hood and hissing loudly bites to humans are less common than from other african cobras due to various factors though a bite from this species is a life threatening emergency taxonomy and evolution forest cobra is classified in genus naja of family elapidae naja melanoleuca was first described by american herpetologist edward hallowell in 1857 hallowell edward 1857 notice of a collection of reptiles from gaboon country west africa recently presented to academy of natural sciences of philadelphia by dr henry a ford proceedings of academy of natural sciences of philadelphia 9 48 72 naja haje var melanoleuca new variation pp 61 62 generic name naja is a latinisation of sanskrit word meaning cobra specific epithet melanoleuca is ancient greek and means of black and white word is greek for black while leuca comes from ancient greek word for white this species is also known as black cobra and black and white lipped cobra forest cobra is classified under genus naja of family elapidae genus was first described by josephus nicolaus laurenti in 1768 species naja melanoleuca was first described by edward hallowell in 1857 genus naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors including morphology diet and habitat naja melanoleuca is part of subgenus boulengerina along with three other species naja annulata naja and naja multifasciata subgenus is united by their restriction to central and west african forest and or forest edge type habitat they are also more aquatic and feed more on aquatic species species of subgenus boulengerina show great diversity in size however ranging from forest cobra naja melanoleuca which can attain lengths of to burrowing cobra naja multifasciata which doesn t grow larger than in length below cladogram illustrates taxonomy and relationships among species of naja population on sao tome was recently described as a new species n peroescobari and a recent study based on mitochondrial dna suggests that n melanoleuca may actually be made up of as many as five separate species naja melanoleuca hallowell 1857 central african

description forest cobra is africa s largest cobra of genus naja and possibly largest of all true cobra naja species in world length of an average adult is but they may attain lengths of and lengths up to are also possible in rare cases males and females grow to be similar in length as there is no sexual dimorphism within this species head of this snake is large broad flattened and is slightly distinct from neck it is a slightly depressed tapered and moderately thick bodied snake with a slender tail that is medium in length body is compressed dorsoventrally where dorsal upper scales and ventral lower scales meet at either side of body and sub cylindrical posteriorly tail end of body forest cobra has long cervical ribs capable of expansion to form a long wedge shaped hood when threatened angle between crown of head and side of head between eye also known as canthus is distinct while snout is rounded its eyes are large with round pupils scalation like other snake species forest cobra has skin covered in scales snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes known as snake skin as a whole scales protect body of snake aid it in locomotion allow moisture to be retained within and alter surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage dorsal scales of forest cobra are smooth glossy and strongly oblique colour of this species is variable with three main colour morphs those from forest or forest fringe from sierra leone east to western kenya and south to angola are glossy black chin throat and anterior region of belly are cream or white with broad black cross bars and blotches sides of head are strikingly marked with black and white giving impression of vertical black and white bars on lips second colour morph from west african savanna is banded black and yellow with a black tail head is brownish yellow on top lips chin and throat are yellow third colour morph from coastal plain of east africa south to kwazulu natal inland to zambia and southern democratic republic of congo is brownish or blackish brown above paler below belly is yellow or cream heavily speckled with brown or black and specimens from southern part of its range have black tails melanistic all black specimens have been documented from west africa head body and tail scalation of forest cobra dorsal rows at midbody 19 21 201 214

neurotoxin and bites result in severe neurotoxicity ernst and zug et al 1996 list a value of 0 225 mg kg sc according to brown and fry of australian venom and toxin database murine intraperitoneal value is 0 324 mg kg average venom yield per bite is 571 mg and maximum venom yield is 1102 mg this snake can be highly dangerous due to quantity of venom it can inject in a single bite and its aggressive nature when defending death can occur rapidly within 30 to 120 minutes in severe cases of envenomation signs and symptoms of envenomation include ptosis drowsiness limb paralysis hearing loss inability to speak dizziness ataxia shock hypotension abdominal pain fever pallor and other neurological and respiratory symptoms forest cobra is one of least frequent causes of snake bite among african cobras largely due its forest dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as 4th most venomous naja true cobra species is thought to be very similar to that of egyptian cobra naja haje clinical experience with this species has been very sparse and few recorded bites have been documented deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without use of specific antivenom have also been seen however neglecting use of antivenom places patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality if snake becomes cornered or is agitated it can quickly attack aggressor and because a large amount of venom is injected a rapidly fatal outcome is possible mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom this species is considered to be among most intelligent of african elapids by herpetologists two cases from liberia experienced severe neurological symptoms including ptosis nausea vomiting tachycardia and respiratory distress a child in ghana died within 20 minutes after being bitten by a snake suspected to be from this species

togo benin nigeria equatorial guinea cameroon and gabon in western africa to republic of congo democratic republic of congo central african republic and northern angola in central africa to western kenya uganda rwanda and burundi in eastern africa and to fragmented parts of southern africa including natal right thumb a snake of forest or woodland it is only one of africa s cobras that will live in high forest forest cobras are snakes that are well adapted to many environments and habitat of forest cobra is strongly dependent on what part of its african range snake originates from forest cobras originating in southern african regions are typically found in savanna and grassland but they can also be found in broken rock country they are mainly found in tropical and subtropical rainforest regions of west and central africa it also inhabits mangroves in western africa banded form of forest cobra in west africa lives in savanna and grassland but usually along streams and well vegetated areas especially riverine forest up to latitude 14 n species preferred habitat are lowland forest and moist savanna where it favours coastal thickets this snake seems to be highly adaptable and will readily move into drier areas if it can in western kenya forest cobra has been found in wide stretched grassland areas population of forest cobras in uganda are almost always found close to water brown colour phase occurs in coastal and high altitude forest woodland and thicket and grassland areas i e zimbabwe due to its secretive habits and fondness for living in holes it often persists in quite well inhabited areas common in and around many central african towns even long after most vegetation has gone they are also found on fruit plantations where they live in trees it occurs through a wide altitude range from sea level to forested mountains at above sea level behavior thumb left 150px forest cobra is an agile diurnal species that climbs well and is one of most aquatic of true cobras of genus naja it is terrestrial but it is a fast graceful climber known to ascend trees to a height of or more it is quick moving and alert it swims well and readily takes to water in some areas its main diet is fish and could be regarded as semi aquatic although it is active mostly during day diurnal in uninhabited areas it can also be active by night nocturnal where it goes into urban areas when not active it takes cover in holes brush piles hollow logs among root clusters or in rock crevices or in abandoned termite mounds at forest fringe or clearings in certain areas it hides along river banks in overhanging root systems or bird holes and in urban areas will hide in junk piles or unused buildings when agitated it rears up to a considerable height and spreads a long narrow hood it can strike quickly to quite a long distance and if molested and cornered it will rush forward and make a determined effort to bite it is an alert and agile species of cobra some authorities believe it is one of most dangerous african snakes to be kept as many captive forest cobras are described to be particularly aggressive when handled this species is not able to spit its venom diet forest cobras will feed on a wide variety of prey including amphibians fish other snakes monitor lizards and other lizards bird eggs rodents and other small mammals it has been recorded as taking and in west africa one specimen had eaten a gifford s giant shrew an insectivore with a smell so noxious most other snakes would not touch it reproduction thumb 150px right a young forest cobra this is an oviparous species in summer females will lay between 11 and 26 smooth white eggs each roughly eggs stick together in a bunch eggs are laid in hollow trees termite mounds holes in ground or females will make their own nests before mating a pair of will dance raising their heads a foot or more off ground and moving to and fro this may continue for an hour before mating takes place when male presses his cloaca chamber into which reproductive urinary and intestinal canals empty against that of female female forest cobras may stand guard and are irritable and aggressive during breeding period a female is liable to attack without provocation with potentially fatal consequences for passers by if her nest is near a footpath hatchlings are born completely independent and are usually in length although some sources claim that hatchlings may measure up to incubation period is anywhere from 55 to 70 days or over 80 days in one captive study at temperatures of 27 30 degc 81 86 degf these snakes are known to have a long lifespan one captive specimen lived for 28 years which is record for longest lived venomous snake in captivity another specimen held at melbourne zoo in australia
