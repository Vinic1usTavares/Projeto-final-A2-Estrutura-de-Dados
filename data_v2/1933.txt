unlike comparable museums in continental europe national gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection it came into being when british government bought 38 paintings from heirs of john julius angerstein in 1824 after that initial purchase gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors notably sir charles lock eastlake and by private donations which

purchases from english private collections acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from blenheim palace raphael s ansidei madonna and van dyck s equestrian portrait of charles i with a record setting grant of ps87 500 from treasury brought gallery s golden age of collecting to an end as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter when gallery purchased holbein s

its history as tate gallery allowed some british works to be moved off site following precedent set by vernon collection and turner bequest works by artists born after 1790 were moved to new gallery

world war shortly before outbreak of world war ii paintings were evacuated to various locations in wales including penrhyn castle university colleges of bangor and aberystwyth in 1940 during battle of france a more secure home was sought and there were discussions about moving paintings to canada this idea was firmly rejected by winston churchill who wrote in a telegram to director kenneth clark bury them in caves or in cellars but not a picture shall leave these islands instead a slate quarry at manod near blaenau ffestiniog in north wales was requisitioned for gallery s use in seclusion afforded by paintings new location keeper and future director martin davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on collection helped by fact that gallery s library was also stored in quarry move to manod confirmed importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity something gallery s conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove this eventually resulted in first air conditioned gallery opening in 1949 for course of war myra hess and other musicians such as moura lympany gave daily lunch time recitals in empty building to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in london was closed a number of art exhibitions were held at gallery as a complement to recitals first of these was british painting since whistler in 1940 organised

a bombed and shattered metropolis paintings returned to trafalgar square in 1945 post war developments in post war years acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for national gallery as prices for old masters and even more so for impressionists and post impressionists have risen beyond its means some of gallery s most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without major public appeals backing them including virgin and child with st anne and st john baptist by leonardo da vinci bought in 1962 and titian s death of actaeon 1972 gallery s purchase grant from government was frozen in 1985 but later that year it received an endowment of ps50 million from sir paul getty enabling many major purchases to be made in april 1985 lord sainsbury of preston and his brothers hon simon sainsbury and sir timothy sainsbury had made a donation that would enable construction of sainsbury wing directorship of neil macgregor saw a major at gallery dispensing with classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by eastlake new chronological hang sought to emphasise interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics reflecting change in art historical values since 19th century in other respects however victorian tastes were rehabilitated building s interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored and in 1999 gallery accepted a bequest of 26 italian baroque paintings from sir denis mahon earlier in 20th century many considered baroque to be beyond pale in 1945 gallery s trustees

clearly defined in 1996 1900 was established as cut off point for paintings in national gallery and in 1997 more than 60 post 1900 paintings from collection were given to tate on a long term loan in return for works by gauguin and others however future expansion of national gallery may yet see return of 20th century paintings to its walls in 21st century there have been three large fundraising campaigns at gallery in 2004 to buy raphael s madonna of pinks in 2008 for titian s diana and actaeon and in 2012 titian s diana and callisto both titians were bought in tandem with national gallery of scotland for ps95 m both of these major works were sold from famous collection of duke of sutherland national gallery is now largely priced out of market for old master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with backing of major public appeals departing director charles saumarez smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007 in 2014 national gallery was subject of a documentary film by frederick wiseman film shows gallery administration and staff at work conservation laboratory docent tours and mounting of leonardo da vinci j m w turner and titian exhibitions in 2011 2012 architecture william wilkins s building first suggestion for a national gallery on trafalgar square came from john nash who envisaged it on site of king s mews while a parthenon like building for royal academy would occupy centre of square economic recession prevented this scheme from being built but a competition for mews site was eventually held in 1831 for which nash submitted a design with c r cockerell as his co architect nash s popularity was waning by this time however and commission was awarded to william wilkins who was involved in selection of site and submitted some drawings at last moment summerson s mantelpiece comparison inspired title of conlin s 2006 history of gallery nation s mantelpiece op cit wilkins had hoped to build a temple of arts nurturing contemporary art through historical example grove dictionary of art vol 33 p 192 but commission was blighted by parsimony and compromise and resulting building was deemed a failure on almost all counts site only allowed for building to be one room deep as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind to exacerbate matters there was a public right of way through site to these buildings which accounts for access porticoes on eastern and western sides of facade these had to incorporate columns from demolished carlton house and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low and a far cry from commanding focal point that was desired for northern end of square also recycled are sculptures on facade originally intended for nash s marble arch but abandoned due to his financial problems eastern half of building housed royal academy until 1868 which further diminished space afforded to gallery building was object of public ridicule before it had even been completed as a version of design had been leaked to literary gazette in 1833 two years before completion its infamous pepperpot elevation appeared on frontispiece of contrasts 1836 an influential tract by a w n pugin as an example of degeneracy of classical style even william iv in his last recorded utterance thought building a nasty little pokey hole while william makepeace thackeray called it a little gin shop of a building twentieth century architectural historian sir john summerson echoed these early criticisms when he compared arrangement of a dome and two diminutive turrets on roofline to clock and vases on a mantelpiece only less useful sir charles barry s landscaping of trafalgar square from 1840 included a north terrace so that building would appear to be raised thus addressing one of points of complaint opinion on building had mellowed considerably by 1984 when prince charles called wilkins facade a much loved and elegant friend in contrast to a proposed extension see below alteration and expansion pennethorne barry and taylor first significant alteration made to building was single long gallery added by sir james pennethorne in 1860 1 ornately decorated in comparison with rooms by wilkins it nonetheless worsened cramped conditions inside building as it was built over original entrance hall unsurprisingly several attempts were made either to completely remodel national gallery as suggested by sir charles barry in 1853 or to move it to more capacious premises in kensington where air was also cleaner in 1867 barry s son edward middleton barry proposed to replace wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced exterior as a strong plagiarism upon st paul s cathedral with demolition of workhouse however barry was able to build gallery s first sequence of grand architectural spaces from 1872 to 1876 built to a polychrome neo renaissance design barry rooms were arranged on a greek cross plan around a huge central octagon though it compensated for underwhelming architecture of wilkins building barry s new wing was disliked by gallery staff who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space also decorative programme of rooms did not take their intended contents into account ceiling of 15th and 16th century italian gallery for instance was inscribed with names of british artists of 19th century but despite these failures barry rooms provided gallery with a strong axial this was to be followed by all subsequent additions to gallery for a century resulting in a building of clear symmetry pennethorne s gallery was demolished for next phase of building a scheme by sir john taylor extending northwards of main entrance its glass domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by crace family firm who had also worked on barry rooms a fresco intended for south wall was never realised and that space is now taken up by frederic lord leighton s painting of cimabue s celebrated madonna carried in procession through streets of florence 1853 55 lent by royal collection in

by mirroring barry s cross axis plan to east use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued giving extensions a degree of internal consistency with older rooms classical style was still in use at national gallery in 1929 when a beaux arts style gallery was built funded by art dealer and trustee lord duveen however it was not long before 20th century reaction against victorian attitudes became manifest at gallery from 1928 to 1952 landing floors of taylor s entrance hall were relaid with a new series of mosaics by boris anrep who was friendly with bloomsbury group these mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th century conventions for decoration of public buildings as typified by albert memorial s frieze of parnassus central mosaic depicting awakening of muses includes portraits of virginia woolf and greta garbo subverting high moral tone of its victorian forebears in place of christianity s seven virtues anrep offered his own set of modern virtues including humour and open mind allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries including winston churchill bertrand russell and t s eliot in 20th century gallery s late victorian interiors fell out of fashion see for example national gallery corporate author 1974 working of national gallery london national gallery publishing p 8 national gallery has suffered from visual pretentiousness of its 19th century buildings modernist north galleries opened following year crace ceiling decorations in entrance hall were not to taste of director charles holmes and were obliterated by white paint they were restored only in 2005 north galleries which opened to public in 1975 marked arrival of modernist architecture at national gallery in older rooms original classical details were effaced by partitions and suspended ceilings aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of paintings but gallery s commitment to modernism was short lived by 1980s victorian style was no longer considered anathema and a restoration programme began to restore 19th and early 20th century interiors to their purported original appearance this began with refurbishment of barry rooms in 1985 6 from 1996 to 1999 even north galleries by then considered to lack a positive architectural character were remodelled in a classical style albeit a simplified one sainsbury wing and later additions most important addition to building in recent years has been sainsbury wing designed by postmodernist architects robert venturi and denise scott brown to house collection of renaissance paintings and built in 1991 building occupies hampton s site to west of main building where a department store of same name had stood until its destruction in blitz gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect shortlist included a radical high tech proposal by richard rogers among others design that won most votes was by firm burton and who then modified their proposal to include a tower similar to that of rogers scheme proposal was dropped after prince of wales compared design to a monstrous carbuncle on face of a much loved and elegant friend term monstrous carbuncle for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings has since become commonplace one of conditions of 1982 competition was that new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space however in 1985 it became possible to devote extension entirely to gallery s uses due to a donation of almost ps50 million from lord sainsbury and his brothers simon and sir tim sainsbury a closed competition was held and schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in earlier competition thumb left main enfilade of sainsbury wing in contrast with rich ornamentation of main building galleries in sainsbury wing are pared down and intimate to suit smaller scale of many of paintings main inspirations for these rooms are sir john soane s galleries for dulwich picture gallery and church interiors of filippo brunelleschi stone dressing is in pietra serena grey stone local to florence northernmost galleries align with barry s central axis so that there is a single vista down whole length of gallery this axis is exaggerated by use of false perspective as columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until visitor reaches focal point as of 2009 an altarpiece by cima of incredulity of st thomas venturi s postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at sainsbury wing with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as clubhouses on pall mall scala regia in vatican victorian warehouses and ancient egyptian temples following pedestrianisation of trafalgar square gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert vacated office space on ground floor into public space plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from adjoining national portrait gallery in st martin s place which it gave to national gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension first phase east wing project designed by jeremy dixon and edward jones opened to public in 2004 this provided a new ground level entrance from trafalgar square named in honour of sir paul getty main entrance was also refurbished and reopened in september 2005 possible future projects include a west wing project roughly symmetrical with east wing project which would provide a future ground level entrance and public opening of some small rooms at far eastern end of building acquired as part of swap with national portrait gallery this might include a new public staircase in bow on eastern facade no timetable has been announced for these additional projects controversies thumb left restoration of titian s bacchus and ariadne from 1967 to 1968 was a controversial restoration at national gallery due to concern that painting s tonality had been thrown out of balance one of most persistent criticisms of national gallery apart from those who criticise inadequacies of building has been of its conservation policy gallery s detractors accused it of having had an over zealous approach to restoration first cleaning operation at national gallery began in 1844 after eastlake s appointment as keeper and was subject of attacks in press after first three paintings to receive treatment a rubens a and a velazquez were unveiled to public in 1846 gallery s most virulent critic was j morris moore who wrote a series of letters to times under pseudonym savaging institution s cleanings while an 1853 parliamentary select committee set up to investigate matter cleared gallery of any wrongdoing criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in art establishment thumb right upright 1 15 an 1847 punch cartoon by john leech depicting restoration controversy then ongoing last major outcry against use of radical conservation techniques at national gallery was seventy one years ago in immediate post war years following a restoration campaign by chief restorer helmut ruhemann while paintings were in manod quarry when cleaned pictures were exhibited to public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier principal criticism was that extensive removal of varnish which was used in 19th century to protect surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured them with time may have resulted in loss of harmonising glazes added to paintings by artists themselves opposition to ruhemann s techniques was led by ernst gombrich a professor at warburg institute who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with offensive by national gallery a 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in recent cleanings thumb upright 1 15 left george bellows men of docks 1912 national gallery has also been criticised for paintings kenneth clark s
