a significant object of interest among modern scholars architects artists and draftsmen for its uniqueness its beauty and insights it provides into medieval culture motivations behind plan there are two main theories concerning motivations behind drawing of plan dispute between scholars centres around assertion put forward by horn and born in their 1979 work plan of saint gall that plan in stiftsbibliothek sankt gallen was a copy of an original drawing issued by court of louis pious after synods held at aachen in 816 and 817 purpose of synods was to establish benedictine monasteries throughout carolingian empire as a bulwark against encroaching christian monastic missionaries from britain and ireland who were bringing celtic lifestyle influences to continent see celtic art horn and born argued that plan was a paradigmatic drawing of how a benedictine monastery should look if benedictine rule was to be strictly followed a guide for construction of future monastic ensembles other scholars particularly werner jacobsen norbert and lawrence nees have on contrary argued that plan is an original drawing made at monastery of reichenau for abbot of saint gall gozbert who decided to build a new abbey church in 820s this argument is based on jacobsen s observations of marks left by pairs of compasses in parchment as well as alterations and changes undertaken during its drawing lawrence nees has also argued that fact that manuscript was drawn and written by two scribes a younger one and an elder who acted as a supervisor filling in and completing where knowledge of main scribe ended citing w horn can only be explained if drawing is an original alt plan of saint gall verso life of saint martin thumb plan of saint gall verso life of saint martin 12th century st

inches 113 cm by 78 cm it is drawn with red ink lines for buildings and brown ink for lettered inscriptions sequence in which parchment was joined is following first parchment consisted of drawing of abbey church and cloister second and third parchments were added to bottom and right side of original vellum and here abbey church was enlarged buildings were added around cloister and abbot s house outer school guest house and pilgrim s house were drawn a fourth parchment was then added to top where infirmary novitiate cemetery orchard garden were drawn and finally a fifth parchment was added to bottom to accommodate designs for livestock quarters about 333 inscriptions forty of them in meter in of two different scribes describe functions of buildings it has been possible to attribute handwriting of these scribes to monastery of reichenau and one of them has been identified as monk reginbert scale to which plan was drawn has also been a subject of dispute horn and born for example argue that a single scale was used while others such as and jacobsen argue that multiple scales were applied for different elements reverse of plan was inscribed in 12th century after it had been folded into book form with life of saint martin by sulpicius severus dedication it is widely held that plan was dedicated to abbot of st gall from 816 36 however recently alfons zettler has put forward possibility of it being dedicated to another monk gozbert known as young gozbert also an inhabitant of monastery of saint gall during same period text reads as translated by horn into english latin reads architectural design and structures alt plan of saint gall thumb plan of saint gall simplified view showing different structures as mentioned above plan represents a benedictine monastery and it is possible to see benedictine rule being applied in architectural design one of main aspects of rule was ascetic life of monks who had to dedicate themselves to prayer meditation and study and not worry about worldly matters for this purpose benedictine rule required a monastery which was self sufficient and which provided for monks all necessary facilities food and water plan thus depicts 40 ground plans which include not only properly monastic buildings basilica cloister abbot s house and cemetery but also secular buildings for use of lay workers and visitors lynda coon has identified five distinct spatial units sacred basilica round towers hostel for visiting monks abbot s house cemetery and cloister complex lay elite guest houses servant quarters hospice for pilgrims and poor educational novitiate and outer school for elite medicinal infirmary physician s house bloodletting house herb garden agricultural and artisanal workshops animal pens houses for agrarian workers and gardens she has also identified a status differentiation in structures which follow cardinal points accordingly she argues that northwest is reserved for secular elite while southwest is for secular lower classes regarding sacred spaces northeast and southeast is reserved for monastic elite and far east and far south for what she calls liminal that is to say in between lay and monastic alfons zettler has recently identified another criterion that authors of plan may have followed for layout of structures which does not follow cardinal points but is determined by a clockwise direction starting and ending at abbot s house he argues that basis of organisation would have been a division of public private and lay monastic which is represented in plan by an increasing lay presence in each sector of monastery when moving around cloister clockwise from infirmary monk s cloister alt monk s cloister plan of saint gall thumb monk s cloister plan of saint gall buildings surrounding cloister clockwise from top warming room and dormitory refectory vestiary and kitchen cellar and larder bottom of picture basilica can be seen to left of picture monastic cloister occupies centre of plan it is placed in southeast aligning itself both with sacred east and with poor accommodation for pilgrims and poor is placed in east just beneath cloister far from worldly commodities and pleasures of secular elite structure of cloister is highly symbolic firstly it is a closed space looking inwards to its own centre where a savin tree is placed illustrating ideal of a monk s experience removed from world secondly it is foursquare and four paths lead from its covered galleries to centre symbolising jerusalem and its four rivers cloister is surrounded by two storied buildings consisting of warming room and dormitory to east and refectory vestiary and kitchen to south and and cellar and larder to west and monks as well as abbot had a private entrance to basilica either through their dormitory or through portico of cloister abbot s house alt abbot s house plan of sain gall thumb abbot s house plan of sain gall see private passageway to basilica right of image abbot s intermediary position between clerical and lay worlds is seen in position of his accommodation on plan abbot s quarters are located at other side of abbey church from monk s cloister to north east aligning itself with secular elite guest houses where royalty emperor and emperor s court would lodge abbot s house also looks over infirmary and novitiate to east outer school and house for elite guests to west abbot s house faces outwards its porticoes opening to outside world in opposition with monk s cloister porticoes which open to an enclosed green space however in order to comply with an ascetic way of life and to benedictine rule abbot shares his bedroom and privy with seven other monks and his servant quarters are set apart finally abbot s residence has a privileged entry to east end of basilica through a private passageway signalling his spiritual status as head of monastery alt basilica plan of saint gall thumb basilica plan of saint gall basilica monastery church or
