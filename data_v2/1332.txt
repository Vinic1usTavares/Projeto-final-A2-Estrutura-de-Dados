tuber oregonense commonly known as oregon white truffle is a species of edible truffle in genus tuber described as new to science in 2010 north american species is found on western coast of united states from northern california to southern british columbia west of cascade range a mycorrhizal fungus it grows in a symbiotic association with douglas fir it overlaps in distribution with closely related t gibbosum but they have different growing seasons t oregonense typically appears from october through march while t gibbosum grows from january to june fruit bodies of fungus are roughly spherical to irregular in shape and resemble small potatoes up to in diameter inside truffle is gleba which is initially white before it becomes a marbled tan color large often thick walled and strongly ornamented spores are produced in large spherical asci truffle is highly prized for its taste and aroma some individuals have claimed success in cultivating truffles in christmas tree farms taxonomy and phylogeny species was first officially described and named in a 2010 mycologia article although tuber oregonense had been previously used provisionally as tuber oregonense trappe bonito in american field guides and other popular publications for several years hall et al 2007 p 78 type specimen was collected from benton county oregon on 3 february 2007 along u s route 20 in oregon specific epithet oregonense derives from name oregon and latin suffix ense relating to in reference to western oregon being its central region of abundance trappe et al 2007 p 123 fungus is commonly known as oregon white truffle truffle authority james trappe initially intended to name species as a variety of tuber gibbosum i e as tuber gibbosum var oregonense before molecular analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at species level tuber oregonense is part of gibbosum clade of genus tuber which contains species that have peculiar wall on hyphal tips emerging from peridial surface at maturity description fruit bodies of t oregonense are growing in ground typically broad although specimens up to have been recorded smaller specimens are spherical or nearly so and have random furrows larger specimens are more irregular in shape lobed and deeply furrowed young fruit bodies have a white peridium as truffle matures it develops red to reddish brown or orangish brown patches with age it becomes orange brown to reddish brown overall and often develops cracks on surface peridium is 0 2 0 4 mm thick and surface texture ranges from relatively smooth to covered with tiny hairs that are more dense in furrows and more scattered on exposed lobes gleba is solid in youth fertile tissue is whitish and marbled with mostly narrow white hypha stuffed veins that emerge throughout peridium to its surface in maturity fertile tissue is light brown to brown from color of spores but veins remain white odor and flavor of flesh are mild in youth but soon become strong pungent and complex or truffly thumb left a two spored ascus ellipsoid spores have a honeycomb like surface network ornamented with numerous spikes spores are ellipsoid to somewhat spindle shaped with narrowed ends and light brownish in color size of spores varies depending upon type of asci in which they develop in one spored asci they measure 42 5 62 5 by 17 5 30 um in two spored asci they are 32 5 50 by 15 25 um in three spored asci they are 27 5 45 by 15 25 um in four spored asci they are 25 38 5 by 13 28 um in five spored asci 28 34 by 22 25 um all sizes excluding surface ornamentation spore walls are 2 3 um thick and are covered with a honeycomb like network cavities of honeycomb typically have five or six sides and corners form spines that are 5 7 um tall by 0 5 um thick a appears in some spores when light microscope objective is focused on optical cross section but not on spore wall surface or on scanning electron microscopy micrographs of surface young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid egg shaped or pear shaped sometimes base of ascus is narrowed like a stipe and measures up to 15 by 7 um mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from pressure of crowded spores within they are hyaline translucent thin walled 60 85 by 65 75 um 1 4 occasionally 5 spored and without a stipe at maturity cuticle of peridium is 200 300 um thick plus or minus 80 um of tightly interwoven hyphae that are 3 5 sometimes up to 10 um broad cells are short and have nearly hyaline walls that measure 0 5 1 um thick interior veins emerge through peridium cells and often form a localized tissue of rounded cells up to 12 um broad degree to which surface is covered with fine hairs is variable these hairs are made of tangled hyphae and emergent thin walled hyphal tips 2 5 um in diameter some even and smooth some with granulated surfaces and some with moniliform walls resembling a string of beads that are irregularly thickened by hyaline bands that are 0 5 2 um wide subpellis tissue layer immediately under pellis is abruptly differentiated from pellis 150 220 um thick and comprises interwoven nearly hyaline thin walled hyphae 2 10 um wide with scattered cells up to 15 um wide gleba is made of hyaline thin walled interwoven hyphae that are 2 7 um broad with scattered cells that are inflated up to 15 um similar species thumb right 200px tuber gibbosum is very similar in appearance but is harvested in a different season tuber oregonense closely resembles tuber gibbosum which grows in same habitats but may be distinguished by structure of its peridium and differences in spores size and shape further tuber gibbosum grows from january to june trappe et al 1997 pp 102 103 edibility tuber oregonense is a choice edible species its odor has been described as truffly a complex of garlic spices cheese and indefinable other essences fungus is prized after by commercial truffle harvesters and consumers for its intense fragrance trappe et al 1997 pp 106 107 because they grow in topsoil and needles they are considered to have a more floral and herbal flavor profile than related european truffles some individuals have claimed to have had success in growing truffles in christmas tree farms in oregon techniques reportedly involve inoculating ground under young douglas fir trees with a slurry comprising ground up truffles mixed in water or feces of animals fed truffles there is however no concrete evidence that these methods can be used to establish new truffle patches or to improve productivity of existing patches ecology habitat and distribution like all tuber species t oregonense is mycorrhizal fungus grows west of cascade mountains from southern puget sound region of washington south to southwestern oregon at elevations from near sea level up to in pure stands of pseudotsuga menziesii forests up to 100 years old or pseudotsuga mixed with tsuga heterophylla picea sitchensis or alnus species species has been commercially harvested in pacific northwest since 1980s and is often found in christmas tree plantations as young as five years oregon truffle festival held in eugene yearly since 2006 to coincide with maturing of truffle in late january features activities such as cultivation seminars and truffle hunting excursions fruit bodies are produced from september through middle of march fungus is an important component of diet of northern flying squirrels and comprises majority of their diet at certain times of year see also list of tuber species
