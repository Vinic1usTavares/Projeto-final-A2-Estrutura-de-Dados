slavery whigs called conscience whigs when free soil party dissolved in mid 1850s wilson joined republican party which he helped found and which was organized largely in line with anti slavery coalition he had nurtured in 1840s and 1850s while a senator during civil war wilson was considered a radical republican and his experience as a militia general organizer and commander of a union army regiment and chairman of senate military committees enabled him to assist abraham lincoln administration in organization and oversight of union army and union navy wilson successfully authored bills that outlawed slavery in washington d c and incorporated african americans in union civil war effort in 1862 after civil war he supported radical republican program for reconstruction in 1872 wilson

decline until he was victim of a fatal stroke while working in united states capitol in late 1875 throughout his career wilson was known for championing causes that were at times unpopular including workers rights for both blacks and whites and abolition of slavery massachusetts politician george f hoar who served in united states house of representatives while wilson was a senator and later served in senate himself believed wilson to be most skilled political organizer in country however wilson s reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his senate career by his involvement in credit mobilier scandal early life and education henry wilson was born in farmington new hampshire on february 16 1812 one of several children born to winthrop and abigail witham colbath his father named him jeremiah jones colbath after a wealthy neighbor who was a childless bachelor vainly hoping that this gesture might result in an inheritance winthrop colbath was a militia veteran of war of 1812 who worked as a day laborer and hired himself out to local farms and businesses in addition to occasionally running a sawmill colbath family was impoverished and after a brief elementary education at age of 10 wilson was indentured to a neighboring farmer where he worked as a laborer for next 10 years during this time two neighbors gave him books and wilson enhanced his meager education by reading extensively on english and american history and biography at end of his service he was given six sheep and a yoke of oxen wilson immediately sold his animals for 85 about 2 100 in 2018 which was first money he had earned during his indenture wilson apparently did not like his birth name though reasons given vary some sources indicate that he was not close to his family or disliked his name because of his father s supposed intemperance and modest financial circumstances others indicate that he was called jed and jerry and disliked nicknames so much that he resolved to change his name whatever reason when he turned 21 he successfully petitioned new hampshire general court to legally change it he chose name henry wilson inspired either by a biography of a philadelphia teacher or a portrait from a book on english clergymen ideas that his name change resulted from disrespect of his father or lack of closeness with his family seem to be belied by fact that some of his relatives followed him after he relocated to natick massachusetts including brother george a colbath in addition winthrop and abigail colbath moved to natick in 1848 winthrop died in natick in 1860 and abigail died there in 1866 career 250px thumb left henry wilson s in natick massachusetts thumb right henry wilson s natick home after trying and failing to find work in new

to study law wilson had success as a shoemaker and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time this success gave rise to legends about wilson s skill according to one story that grew with retelling he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping and fell asleep with one hundredth pair in his hand wilson s experience led to creation of political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots natick cobbler and natick shoemaker during this time wilson read extensively and joined natick debating society where he developed into an accomplished speaker wilson s health suffered as result of long hours he worked making shoes and he traveled to virginia to recuperate during a stop in washington d c he heard

with whigs as party attempted to compromise on slavery issue and as a conscience whig he took steps including organization of a convention in concord opposed to annexation of texas because it would expand slavery as a result of this effort in late 1845 wilson and abolitionist john greenleaf whittier were chosen to submit in person a petition to congress containing signatures of 65 000 massachusetts residents opposed to texas annexation wilson was a delegate to 1848 whig national convention but left party after it nominated slave owner zachary taylor for president and took no

including free soilers anti slavery democrats barnburners from new york s democratic party liberty party anti slavery elements of whig party and anti slavery members of know nothing or native american

his vice presidential term on march 4 in his first senate speech in 1855 wilson continued to align himself with abolitionists who wanted to immediately end slavery in united states and its territories in his speech wilson said he wanted to abolish slavery wherever we are morally and legally responsible for its existence including washington d c wilson also demanded repeal of fugitive slave act of

that brooks might attack wilson in senate as he had attacked sumner wilson told press i have sought no controversy and i seek none but i shall go where duty requires by threats of any kind rumors proved unfounded and wilson continued his senate duties without incident attack on sumner took place just one day after pro slavery missourians killed one person in burning and sacking of lawrence kansas attack on sumner and sacking of lawrence were later viewed as two of incidents which symbolized breakdown of reasoned discourse this phrase came to describe period when activists and politicians moved past debate of anti slavery and pro slavery speeches and non violent actions and into realm of physical violence which in part hastened onset of american civil war thumb right upright in 1858 wilson was challenged to a duel by california democratic senator william m gwin in june 1858 wilson made a senate speech in which he suggested corruption in government of california

southern coalition of pro slavery democrats called who had a monopoly on federal patronage in california gwin accused wilson of demagoguery and wilson responded by saying he d rather be thought a demagogue than a thief gwin then challenged wilson to a duel wilson declined in same terms he used to decline a duel with preston brooks in fact neither gwin nor wilson wanted to follow through and commentary about dispute broke down along partisan lines one pro gwin editorial called insinuation that gwin was corrupt a most malignant falsehood while a pro wilson editorial called his reluctance to take part in a duel evidence that he was honest and conscientious and had more respect for laws of this country than his adversary after several attempts to find a face saving compromise gwin and wilson agreed to refer their dispute to three senators who would serve as mediators william h seward john j crittenden and jefferson davis were chosen and produced an acceptable solution at their instigation wilson stated to senate that he had not meant to impugn gwin s honor and gwin replied by saying that he had not meant to question wilson s motives in addition mediators caused to be

lincoln s assassination in april 1865 senators sumner and wilson both hoped johnson would support policies of republican party since johnson a democrat had been elected with lincoln on a pro union ticket after civil war ended with a union victory in may 1865 defeated former confederacy was ruined it had been devastated economically politically and much of its infrastructure had been destroyed during war opportunity was ripe for congress and johnson to work together on terms for southern restoration and reconstruction instead johnson launched his own reconstruction policy which was seen as more lenient to former confederates and excluded african american citizenship when congress opened session which began in december 1865 johnson s policy included a demand for admission of southern senators and representatives nearly all democrats including many former confederates congress still in republican hands responded by refusing to allow southern senators and representatives to take their seats beginning a rift between republicans in congress and president wilson favored allowing only persons who had been loyal to united states to serve in positions of political power in former confederacy and believed that congress not president had power to reconstruct southern states as a result wilson joined forces with congressmen and senators known as radical republicans those most strongly opposed to johnson thumb upright 150px henry wilson far left defended hiram revels first african american u s senator on december 21 1865 two days after announcement that states had ratified

reconstruction policies johnson vetoed bill to establish freedmen s bureau as well as other radical measures to protect african american civil rights measures which wilson supported wilson supported effort to impeach johnson saying that johnson was unworthy if not criminal in his conduct by resisting congressional reconstruction measures many of which were passed over his vetoes at 1868 senate trial wilson voted for johnson s conviction but republicans fell one vote short of two thirds majority needed to remove johnson from office with 36 guilty votes needed for removal senate results were

and said that wilson steered senate away from legal hair splitting within a month senate had acted and arkansas was readmitted on june 22 1868 president ulysses s grant who succeeded johnson in 1869 was more supportive of congressional reconstruction and remaining former confederate states that had not rejoined union were readmitted during his first term federal troops continued to be based in former confederate states allowing republicans to control state governments and african americans to vote and hold federal office in 1870 hiram revels was elected to u s senate by reconstructed mississippi legislature revels was first african american elected to senate and senate democrats attempted to prevent him from being seated wilson defended revels s election and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from clerks of mississippi house of representatives and mississippi state senate as well as that of adelbert ames military governor of mississippi wilson argued that revels s skin color was not a bar to senate service and connected role of senate to christianity s golden rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself senate voted to seat revels and after he took oath of office wilson personally escorted him to his desk as journalists recorded historic event vice presidential campaign 1868 prior to presidential election of 1868 wilson toured south giving political speeches many in press believed wilson was promoting himself to be republican presidential candidate wilson however supported civil war hero general ulysses s grant during reconstruction

confederacy radicals including benjamin wade were stunned by wilson s remarks believing blacks should not be subject to their former white owners at republican convention wilson wade and others competed for vice presidential nomination and wilson had support among southern delegates but he failed to win after five ballots wade was also unable to win convention vote and wilson s delegates eventually switched their votes to speaker of house schuyler colfax who won nomination and went on to win general election with grant at head of ticket after grant and colfax won 1868 election wilson declined to serve as secretary of war in grant s cabinet due to his desire to spend more time with mrs wilson during her lengthy final illness vice presidential campaign 1872 thumb right grant wilson

crowd wilson was popular among republicans for vice presidential nomination with an appealing rags to riches story that included his rise from indentured servant to owner and operator of a successful shoe making business on first ballot he defeated colfax who by then had become an active candidate by renouncing his 1870 pledge and informing his supporters that he would accept renomination if it was offered republicans believed wilson s nomination as a politician of integrity coming from anti slavery movement would outflank anti corruption argument of liberal republicans who counted sumner among their members both grant and his new running mate wilson were idealized by republican posters which depicted grant galena tanner and wilson natick shoemaker carrying tools and wearing workmen s aprons grant s father operated a tanning and leather goods manufacturing business and before civil war grant had clerked in his father s galena illinois store in july in an unprecedented political party fusion influenced by schurz democrats adopted liberal republican platform and endorsed that party s candidates grant s personal popularity proved insurmountable in general election and grant and wilson went on to overwhelmingly defeat greeley and brown in both popular and electoral college votes wilson s nomination for vice president had been intended to strengthen republican ticket and was seen as a success credit mobilier scandal during 1872 campaign wilson s reputation for honesty was marred by a september new york sun article which indicated that he was involved in credit mobilier scandal wilson was one of several representatives and senators mostly republicans including colfax who were offered and possibly took bribes of cash and discounted shares in union pacific railroad s credit mobilier subsidiary from congressman oakes ames during late 1860s in exchange for votes favorable to union pacific during building of first transcontinental railroad after denying to a reporter just a month before election that he had a credit mobilier connection wilson admitted involvement when he gave testimony before a senate committee on february 13 1873 wilson told members of investigating committee that in december 1867 he had agreed to purchase 2 000 in credit mobilier stock 20 shares using mrs wilson s money and in her name according to wilson his wife and he later had concerns about propriety of transaction and had never taken possession of actual stock certificates so wilson asked ames to cancel transaction and ames refunded 2 000 purchase price to wilson wilson said he then returned 814 to ames 748 in dividends and 66 in interest that mrs wilson had supposedly earned as profits even though she had not taken physical possession of her shares wilson further claimed that because mrs wilson had refused to take these proceeds from ames wilson took it upon himself to pay her 814 from his own funds to compensate her for profit she would have made if she had kept stock which he said he felt obligated to do because his wife had originally agreed to purchase stock on his recommendation and had lost money by following his later recommendation to cancel transaction mrs wilson had died in 1870 so senators had to rely on wilson s word and that of ames who corroborated wilson senate accepted wilson s explanation and took no action against him but his reputation for integrity was somewhat damaged because of his initial denial and later admission though not sufficiently enough to prevent him from becoming vice president following month vice
