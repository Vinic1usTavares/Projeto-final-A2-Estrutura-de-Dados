decision to leave was not hers label ended their contract because singles from previous record ms kelly did not sell sufficiently well after release of when love takes over she would go on to fire mathew knowles it has since been suggested rowland had fallen out with former fellow destiny s child singer beyonce knowles media reported that knowles decision to release one more video why don t you love me from her album i am sasha fierce just before rowland released commander was unfair on rowland these claims would be denied by singer who said that despite clip for why don t you love me airing several days before commander media was making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn t exist she also said we all came out at same time and it really doesn t matter i think there s room for everybody there s bey once there s ciara putting something out and lady gaga putting something out but because we started out together people are going to say things like that but i really don t care i love her til our dying days and that s all that counts composition music and lyrics commander is an electro house r b song set in a common time signature of 125 beats per minute it was written by kelly rowland rico love david guetta and sandy vee with deliberate grammar errors such as there s no other who do it like i do it and you won t find no lady who does it like i does it lyrics have themes around hair fashion and competing with other women guetta also produced synthesized dance beats which is similar to his other production sexy bitch end portions of song were compared to some of works by hip hop producer timbaland rowland explained that hook of song commander should be associated with dance instead of military when i command you to dance i want you moving you know it felt good to have a song that i could express that in themes daily star quoted rowland on theme of song she said i hope to see women singing song like they re in charge it s important to know that we are commanders who have power to shape our own destiny love explained to rap up magazine his view of song it s just such an aggressive record it s a club record it s a worldwide international record she s stretching her legs out and she s showing her true vocal ability she s like queen of night on this record then during video shoot of song rowland said i feel like i ve finally come into my own a reference to exploration of a new musical sound with sound of dance music getting embraced more i m very excited seeing how fans have been responding to music dance music is more of a european thing but i ve been looking on twitter and seeing fans in different parts of country talking about playing commander she said working with guetta was amazing because it is effortless and she feels a great sense of chemistry when working with him rowland felt she was trying something different in this generation and this day and time no one is putting soul in dance music no pop artist i thought maybe that was something i could try and then it works in an interview for msn xin rowland admitted song was darker than her previous material but still fun i just thought it d be so much fun to be a commander of course it s just a statement for me definitely coming out on my own filling my space i m happy being a commander release commander was selected as album s first single rowland said there were initially two songs in running for lead single but without a doubt we had to go with commander i just fell in love with it it s definitely a club banger you know first time i heard it i went bananas at pat field s disco party in new york she told universal music group executives i know in my gut that it felt good nobody could take my thoughts away from that i doesn t need anyone else to tell me it s good song was released on may 17 and may 18 2010 to itunes stores in france and united states respectively official extended dance remix was released alongside main single on may 18 2010 in united kingdom commander was planned for a june 28 2010 release love and rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of song with a slower smoother sound american rapper nelly heard new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on remix it was released as part of uk remixes ep as well as second u s remixes ep official press from universal motown records on may 19 2010 confirmed that commander would serve only as international lead single leading to speculation another song would be released domestically this speculation was confirmed when ne yo penned shake them haters off was set to impact on radio stations in united states however those plans were changed and on june 29 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in united states grown woman was sent to urban contemporary rhythmic contemporary radio stations and rose colored glasses for pop radio critical reception song was well received by critics who praised collaboration between rowland and guetta robert copsey of digital spy said it looks as though they re going to be ruling airwaves all over again after she lulls us into a false sense of security i feel like dj is bodyguard you see way he keeps me safe with treble and bass track plunges into a pounding electro house chorus that quite literally orders us to dance floor result isn t quite as fresh and inventive as some of guetta s recent output kelis acapella for example but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer s magic site s other reviewer nick levine agreed saying that song thumps as persuasively as muhammad ali circa 1967 robert daw of idolator said if you think ms kelly is taking go go boots off anytime soon then you d best go lean against wall flower rowland s guetta produced new single commander is pure strobe light adrenaline rush it will appear on kelly s as yet untitled third solo album we re predicting a full on rowland renaissance with alex of paper saying she belts out soaring vocals is further proof that she s no longer cute teenage girl sharing a chorus rebecca nicholson of guardian said that before guetta s collaborations with kelis acapella and rowland she felt david guetta was ruining r b by turning all of my favorite ladies into euro cheesemongers however acapella changed nicholson s mind and she said commander is further evidence of this whilst fraser mcalpine awarded song four stars his review was neither positive nor negative he said singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing and bossy they are even if words have a double meaning which hints that they are merely mouthing self regard of a rampant egomaniac who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing they don t mind why would they song mentions hair and being better than other ladies that s what singers live for i awarded it one extra star for grammar switcheroo because of chorus which rules gavin martin of mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing song instead saying it will put her firmly in control of dance floor entertainment weekly named it number one summer jam of year whilst music station kiss 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of week for week beginning may 24 2010 a reviewer from network said commander is another smash where kelly s taking command with glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power commander is proof that kelly means business in fitness magazine s 100 best workout songs commander was named one of ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125 beats per minute composition commercial performance commander made its united states chart debut on may 18 2010 day of release at number thirty six on hot dance

has janet s singular and straight pony tail e online s natalie finn also had praise for video she said it takes themes of song taking charge owning floor and staying sexy and feminine throughout and dresses em in tight little outfits and turns em loose to break hearts and dominate opposite sex at will music video is great and it might be a must spin according to martin from above beyond magazine who praised rowland s beauty by saying i didn t know kelly was that well equipped from back but i always found kelly more attractive than beyonce i m just saying video was criticized for absence of story line by critics such as laura brooks of who described video as an opportunity to show off her lovely hair and her thighs that also features david guetta who appears to have remembered at several points throughout video that he s left his iron on dashes off to remedy situation alyssa rosenberg of atlantic agreed calling clip dopey with guys who forgot to wash home dye out of their hair sic and dancing was on par with sci fi film matrix reloaded however she did say that it s a high concept understanding of dance floor even if it s not my preferred interpretation of that space if love and shaking it are war kelly seems like she d be a pretty decent person to have boss you around in both meanwhile sound savvy said there s some nice moves and kelly sports some sexy looks for clip
