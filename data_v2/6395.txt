nike zeus was an anti ballistic missile abm system developed by us army during late 1950s and early 1960s that was designed to destroy incoming soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit their targets it was designed by bell labs nike team and was initially based on earlier nike hercules anti aircraft missile original zeus a was designed to intercept warheads in upper atmosphere mounting a 25 kiloton w31 nuclear warhead during development concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept warheads at higher altitudes this required missile to be greatly enlarged into totally new design zeus b given tri service identifier 49 mounting a 400 kiloton w50 warhead in several successful tests b model proved itself able to intercept warheads and even satellites nature of strategic threat changed dramatically during period that zeus was being developed originally expected to face only a few dozen icbms a nationwide defense was feasible although expensive in 1957 growing fears of a soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned as a way to protect strategic air command s bomber bases ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive but when soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles us faced problem of building enough zeus missiles to match them air force argued they close this missile gap by building more icbms of their own instead adding to debate a number of technical problems emerged that suggested zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack system was topic of intense inter service rivalry throughout its lifetime when abm role was given to army in 1958 united states air force began a long series of critiques on zeus both within defense circles and in press army returned these attacks in kind taking out full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote zeus as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner maximum political support as deployment neared in early 1960s debate became a major political issue question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all decision whether to proceed with zeus eventually fell to president john f kennedy who became fascinated by arguing about system in 1963 united states secretary of defense robert mcnamara convinced kennedy to cancel zeus mcnamara directed its funding towards studies of new abm concepts being considered by arpa selecting nike x concept which addressed zeus various problems by using an extremely high speed missile sprint along with greatly improved radars and computer systems zeus test site built at kwajalein was briefly used as an anti satellite weapon history early abm studies first known serious study on attacking ballistic missiles with interceptor missiles was carried out by army air force in 1946 when two contracts were sent out as project wizard and project thumper to consider problem of shooting down missiles of v 2 type these projects identified main problem being one of detection target could approach from anywhere within hundreds of miles and reach their targets in only five minutes existing radar systems would have difficulty seeing missile launch at those ranges and even assuming one had detected missile existing command and control arrangements would have serious problems forwarding that information to battery in time for them to attack task appeared impossible at that time however these results also noted that system might be able to work against longer ranged missiles although these traveled at very high speeds their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler and longer flight times provided more time to prepare both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts and were transferred to us air force when that force separated from army in 1947 air force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their gapa surface to air missile sam efforts next year wizard s funding was also rolled into gapa to develop a new long range sam design which would emerge a decade later as cim 10 bomarc abm research at air force practically although not officially ended nike ii thumb right nike missile family with zeus b in front of hercules and ajax by early 1950s army was firmly established in surface to air missile field with their nike and nike b missile projects these projects had been led by bell labs working with douglas army contacted johns hopkins university operations research office oro to consider task of shooting down ballistic missiles using a nike like system oro report took three years to complete and resulting defense of united states against aircraft and missiles was comprehensive while this study was still progressing in february 1955 army began initial talks with bell and in march they contracted bell s nike team to begin a detailed 18 month study of problem under name nike ii first section of bell study was returned to army ordnance department at redstone arsenal on 2 december 1955 it considered full range of threats including existing jet aircraft future ramjet powered aircraft flying at up to short range ballistic missiles of v 2 type flying at about same speed and an icbm reentry vehicle rv traveling at they suggested that a missile with a common rocket booster could serve all of these roles by changing between two upper stages one with fins for use in atmosphere against aircraft and another with vestigial fins and thrust vectoring for use above atmosphere against missiles considering icbm problem study went on to suggest that system would have to be effective between 95 and 100 of time in order to be worthwhile they considered attacks against rv while missile was in just as it reached highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed practical limitations eliminated this possibility as it required abm to be launched at about same time as icbm in order to meet in middle and they could not imagine a way to arrange this working at much shorter ranges during terminal phase seemed only possible solution bell returned a further study delivered on 4 january 1956 that demonstrated need to intercept incoming warheads at altitude and suggested that this was within abilities of an upgraded version of nike b missile given a terminal speed up to 5 miles per second combined with time it would take an interceptor missile to climb to rv s altitude system required that rv be initially detected at about range due to rv s relatively small size and limited radar signature this would demand extremely powerful radars to ensure destruction of rv or at least render warhead within it unusable w31 would have to be fired when it was within a few hundred feet of rv given angular resolution of existing radars this limited range significantly bell considered an active radar seeker which improved in accuracy as it flew toward rv but these proved too large to be practical a command guidance system like early nikes seemed to be only solution interceptor would lose maneuverability as it climbed out of atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective so it would have to be directed onto target as rapidly as possible leaving only minor fine tuning later in engagement this required that accurate tracks be developed for both warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like nike b where guidance could be updated throughout engagement this demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than systems used on earlier nikes bell suggested that their transistor offered solution to data processing problem after running 50 000 simulated intercepts on analog computers bell returned a final report on concept in october 1956 indicating that system was within state of art a 13 november 1956 memo gave new names to entire nike series original nike became nike ajax nike b became nike hercules and nike ii became nike zeus army vs air force army and air force had been involved in interservice fighting over missile systems since they split in 1947 army considered surface to surface missiles ssm an extension of conventional artillery and surface to air designs as modern replacement for their anti aircraft artillery air force considered nuclear ssm to be an extension of their strategic bombing role and any sort of long range anti aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet both forces were developing missiles for both roles leading to considerable duplication of effort which was widely seen as wasteful by mid 1950s some of these projects were simply tit for tat efforts when army s hercules began deployment air force complained that it was inferior to their bomarc and that army was unfit to guard nation when army started its jupiter missile efforts air force worried it would trump their atlas icbm effort and responded by starting its own thor and when army announced nike ii air force reactivated wizard this time as a long range anti icbm system of much greater performance than zeus in a 26 november 1956 memorandum us secretary of defense charles erwin wilson attempted to end fighting and prevent duplication his solution was to limit army to weapons with range and those involved in surface to air defense to only memo also placed limits on army air operations severely limiting weight of aircraft it was allowed to operate to some degree this simply formalized what had largely already been case in practice but jupiter fell outside range limits and army was forced to hand them to air force result was another round of fighting between two forces jupiter had been designed to be a highly accurate weapon able to attack soviet military bases in europe as compared to thor which was intended to attack soviet cities and had accuracy on order of several miles losing jupiter army was eliminated from any offensive strategic role in return air force complained that zeus was too long ranged and abm effort should center on wizard but jupiter handover meant that zeus was now only strategic program being carried out by army and its cancellation would mean virtually surrender of defense of america to u s a f at some future date gaither report missile gap thumb upright 1 5 projected numbers of soviet icbms as predicted in june 1960 program a cia b usaf c army navy actual number in 1960 was four in may 1957 eisenhower tasked president s science advisory committee psac to provide a report on potential effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting us population in event of a nuclear war chaired by horace rowan gaither psac team completed their study in september publishing it officially on 7 november as deterrence survival in nuclear age but today known as gaither report after ascribing an expansionist policy to ussr along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than us report suggested that there would be a significant gap in capability in late 1950s due to spending levels while report was being prepared in august 1957 soviets launched their r 7 ss 6 icbm and followed this up with successful launch of sputnik 1 in october over next few months a series of intelligence reviews resulted in ever increasing estimates of soviet missile force national intelligence estimate nie 11 10 57 issued in december 1957 stated that soviets would have perhaps 10 prototype missiles in service by mid 1958 but after nikita khrushchev claimed to be producing them like sausages numbers began to rapidly inflate nie 11 5 58 released in august 1958 suggested there would be 100 icbms in service by 1960 and 500 by 1961 or 1962 at latest with nie reports suggesting existence of gap gaither predicted near panic broke out in military circles in response us began to rush its own icbm efforts centered on sm 65 atlas these missiles would be less susceptible to attack by soviet icbms than their existing bomber fleet especially in future versions which would be launched from underground silos but even as atlas was rushed it appeared there would be a missile gap nie estimates made during late 1950s suggested soviets would have significantly more icbms than us between 1959 and 1963 at which point us production would finally catch up with even a few hundred missiles soviets could afford to target every us bomber base with no warning system in place a sneak attack could destroy a significant amount of us bomber fleet on ground us would still have airborne alert force and its own small icbm fleet but ussr would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch leaving them with a massive strategic advantage to ensure this could not happen report called for installation of active defenses at sac bases hercules in short term and an abm for 1959 period along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before missiles hit even zeus would come too late to cover this period and some consideration was given to an adapted hercules or a land based version of navy s rim 8 talos as an interim abm zeus b thumb project office at redstone arsenal was also home to earlier nike efforts thumb office adopted this emblem showing zeus as a roman soldier protecting us eagle douglas aircraft had been selected to build missiles for zeus known under company designation dm 15 this was essentially a scaled up hercules with an improved more powerful single piece booster replacing hercules cluster of four smaller boosters intercepts could take place at limits of wilson requirements at ranges and altitudes of about prototype launches were planned for 1959 for more rapid service entry there had been some consideration given to an interim system based on original hercules missile but these efforts were dropped likewise early requirements for a secondary anti aircraft role were also eventually dropped wilson signaled his intention to retire in early 1957 and eisenhower began looking for a replacement during his exit interview only four days after sputnik wilson told eisenhower that trouble is rising between army and air force over anti missile missile new secretary of defense neil mcelroy took office on 9 october 1957 mcelroy was previously president of procter gamble and was best known for invention of concept of brand management and product differentiation he had little federal experience and launch of sputnik left him little time to ease into position shortly after taking office mcelroy formed a panel to investigate abm issues panel examined army and air force projects and found zeus program considerably more advanced than wizard mcelroy told air force to stop work on abm missiles and use wizard funding for development of long range radars for early warning and raid identification these were already under development as bmews network army was handed job of actually shooting down warheads and mcelroy gave them free hand to develop an abm system as they saw fit free of any range limitations team designed a much larger missile with a greatly enlarged upper fuselage and three stages more than doubling launch weight this version extended range with interceptions taking place as far as downrange and over in altitude an even larger booster took missile to hypersonic speeds while still in lower atmosphere so missile fuselage had to be covered over completely with a phenolic ablative heat shield to protect airframe from melting another change was to combine aerodynamic controls used for control in lower atmosphere with thrust vectoring engines using a single set of movable jet vanes for both roles new dm 15b nike zeus b earlier model retroactively becoming a received a go ahead for development on 16 january 1958 same date air force was officially told to stop all work on a wizard missile on 22 january 1958 national security council gave zeus s priority highest national priority additional funds were requested to zeus program to ensure an initial service date in fourth quarter of 1962 but these were denied delaying service entry until some time in 1963 exchange ratio and other problems with their change of fortunes after mcelroy s 1958 decision army general james m gavin publicly stated that zeus would soon replace strategic bombers as nation s main deterrent in response to this turn of events air force stepped up their policy by press release efforts against army as well as agitating behind scenes within defense department as part of their wizard research air force had developed a formula that compared cost of an icbm to abm needed to shoot it down formula later known as cost exchange ratio could be expressed as a dollar figure if cost of icbm was less than that figure economic advantage was in favor of offense they could build more icbms for less money than abms needed to shoot them down a variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always case that offense had advantage air force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on wizard but as soon as army was handed sole control of abm efforts they immediately submitted it to mcelroy mcelroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting but was concerned that formula might be correct for an answer mcelroy turned to re entry body identification group rbig a sub group of gaither committee led by william e bradley jr that had been studying issue of penetrating a soviet abm system rbig had delivered an extensive report on topic on 2 april 1958 which suggested that defeating a soviet abm system would not be difficult their primary suggestion was to arm us missiles with more than one warhead a concept known as multiple re entry vehicles mrv each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening ensuring only a near miss could damage it this would mean that soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each us warhead while us could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile if soviets added more interceptors to counter increased number of us warheads us could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own cost balance was always in favor of offense this basic concept would remain primary argument against abms for next two decades turning this argument about rbig delivered a report to mcelroy that agreed with air force s original claims on ineffectiveness of abms based on cost but then they went on to consider zeus system itself and noted that its use of mechanically steered radars with one radar per missile meant that zeus could only launch a small number of missiles at once if soviets also deployed mrv even a single icbm would cause several warheads to arrive at same time and zeus would simply not have time to shoot at them all they calculated that only four warheads arriving within one minute would result in one of them hitting zeus base 90 of time thus one or two soviet missiles would destroy 100 zeus s rbig noted that an abm system demands such a high rate of fire from an active defense system in order to intercept numerous reentry bodies which arrive nearly simultaneously that expense of required equipment may be prohibitive they went on to question ultimate impossibility of an abm system project defender thumb herbert york led studies of abm concept and would from then on be a vocal opponent of any deployment mcelroy responded to rbig report in two ways first he turned to newly created arpa group to examine rbig report arpa directed by chief scientist herbert york returned another report broadly agreeing with everything they said considering both need to penetrate a soviet abm and a potential us abm system york noted that when this report was received mcelroy then charged arpa to begin studying long term solutions to icbm defense looking for systems that would avoid apparently insurmountable problem presented by exchange ratio arpa responded by forming project defender initially considering a wide variety of far out concepts like particle beam weapons lasers and huge fleets of space borne interceptor missiles latter known as project bambi in may 1958 york also began working with lincoln labs mit s radar research lab to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means this project emerged as pacific range electromagnetic signature studies or project press more problems thumb hans bethe s work with psac led to a famous 1968 article in scientific american outlining major problems facing any abm defensive system in midst of growing debate over zeus abilities us conducted its first high yield high altitude tests hardtack teak on 1 august 1958 and hardtack orange on 12 august these demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of air in or immediately below fireball to become opaque to radar signals an effect that became known as nuclear blackout this was extremely worrying for any system like zeus which would not be able to track warheads in or behind such a fireball including those of zeus own warheads if this were not enough there was a growing awareness that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with warhead that would be indistinguishable to zeus radars this problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned zeus inability to discriminate targets if decoys spread apart further than lethal radius of zeus warhead several interceptors will be required to guarantee that warhead hiding among decoys will be destroyed decoys are lightweight and would slow down when they began to reenter upper atmosphere allowing them to be picked out or but by that time it would be so close to zeus base that there might not be time for zeus to climb to altitude in 1959 defense department ordered one more study on basic zeus system this time by psac they put together a heavyweight group with some of most famous and influential scientists forming its core including hans bethe who had worked on manhattan project and later on hydrogen bomb wolfgang panofsky director of high energy physics lab at stanford university and harold brown director of lawrence livermore weapons lab among similar luminaries psac report was almost a repeat of rbig they recommended that zeus should not be built at least without significant changes to allow it to better deal with emerging problems throughout zeus was focus of fierce controversy in both press and military circles even as testing started it was unclear if development would continue president eisenhower s defense secretaries mcelroy 1957 59 and thomas s gates jr 1959 61 were unconvinced that system was worth cost eisenhower was highly skeptical questioning whether an effective abm system could be developed in 1960s another harsh critic on cost grounds was edward teller who simply stated that exchange ratio meant solution was to build more icbms kennedy and zeus thumb president john f kennedy was fascinated by debate over zeus and became an expert on all aspects of system john f kennedy campaigned on platform that eisenhower was weak on defense and that he was not doing enough to solve looming missile gap after his win in 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that zeus be continued this was a concentrated effort on part of army who fought back against similar air force tactics they also deliberately spread zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible while taking out advertisements in major mass market magazines like life and saturday evening post promoting system kennedy appointed army general maxwell d taylor as his chairman of joint chiefs of staff taylor like most army brass was a major supporter of zeus program kennedy and taylor initially agreed to build a huge zeus deployment with seventy batteries and 7 000 missiles mcnamara was also initially in favor of system but suggested a much smaller deployment of twelve batteries with 1 200 missiles a contrary note was put forth by jerome wiesner recently appointed as kennedy s scientific advisor and chair of 1959 psac report he began to educate kennedy on technical problems inherent to system he also had lengthy discussions with david bell budget director who came to realize enormous cost of any sort of reasonable zeus system kennedy was fascinated by zeus debate especially way that scientists were lined up on diametrically opposed positions for or against system he commented to wiesner i don t understand scientists are supposed to be rational people how can there be such differences on a technical issue his fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on topic in one meeting with edward teller kennedy demonstrated that he knew more about zeus and abms than teller teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to same level of knowledge wiesner would later note that pressure to make a decision built up until kennedy came to feel that only thing anybody in country was concerned about was nike zeus to add to debate it was becoming clear that missile gap was fictional first corona spy satellite mission in august 1960 put limits on their program that appeared to be well below lower bound of any of estimates and a follow up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated us had a massive strategic lead a new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that soviets had no more than 25 icbms and would not be able to add more for some time nevertheless zeus continued slowly moving towards deployment on 22 september 1961 mcnamara approved funding for continued development and approved initial deployment of a zeus system protecting twelve selected metropolitan areas these included washington baltimore new york los angeles chicago philadelphia detroit ottawa montreal boston san francisco pittsburgh st louis and toronto buffalo however deployment was later overturned and in january 1962 only development funds were released nike x in 1961 mcnamara agreed to continue development funding through but declined to provide funds for production he summed up both positives and concerns this way looking for a near term solution mcnamara once again turned to arpa asking it to consider zeus system in depth agency returned a new report in april 1962 that contained four basic concepts first was zeus system in its current form outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios zeus could for instance be used to protect sac bases thereby requiring soviets to expend more of their icbms to attack bases this would presumably mean less damage to other targets another considered addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to zeus which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area finally in its last concept arpa replaced zeus with a new very high speed short range missile designed to intercept warhead at altitudes as low as by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone this last concept became nike x an ad hoc name suggested by jack ruina while describing arpa report to psac perfect or nothing thumb robert mcnamara ultimately decided zeus simply didn t offer enough protection given its cost thumb dan flood countered that even a flawed system was better than none at all as work on nike x began high ranking military and civilian officials began to press for zeus deployment as an interim system in spite of known problems they argued system could be upgraded in place as new technologies became available mcnamara was opposed to early deployment while congressman daniel j flood would be a prime force for immediate deployment mcnamara s argument against deployment rested on two primary issues one was apparent ineffectiveness of system and especially its benefit cost ratio compared to other options for instance fallout shelters would save more americans for far less money and in an excellent demonstration of his approach to almost any defense issue he noted second issue ironically came about due to concerns about a soviet abm system us s existing sm 65 atlas and sm 68 titan both used re entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed warheads as they entered lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack new lgm 30 minuteman missile used sharp nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for soviet abms this would guarantee us s deterrent if there was a budget choice to be made mcnamara supported minuteman although he tried not to say this in one particularly telling exchange between mcnamara and flood mcnamara initially refuses to choose one option over other but later flood managed to get a more accurate statement out of him cancellation and abm gap by 1963 mcnamara had convinced kennedy that zeus was simply not worth deploying earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness as well as new difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems led mcnamara to cancel zeus project on 5 january 1963 in its place they decided to continue work on nike x nike x development was based in existing nike zeus project office until their name was changed to nike x on 1 february 1964 while reporting to senate armed services committee in february mcnamara noted that they expected soviets to have an initial abm system deployed in 1966 and then later stated that nike x would not be ready for use until 1970 noting a defensive gap strom thurmond began an effort to deploy existing zeus as an interim system once again matter spilled over into press on 11 april 1963 thurmond led congress in an effort to fund deployment of zeus in first closed session of senate in twenty years zeus was debated and decision was made to continue with planned development of nike x with no zeus deployment army continued testing program until december 1964 at white sands missile range and may 1966 at kwajalein missile range testing thumb a nike zeus a missile being test launched

sands missile range first attempt on 26 august 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer but booster broke up shortly before booster sustainer separation a similar test on 14 october was a success followed by first two stage attempt on 16 december first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 february 1960 data collected from these tests led to changes to design to improve speed during ascent first test of zeus b took place in may 1961 a number of zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of control surfaces and numerous changes were worked into system to address this additional tracking tests were carried out by target tracking radars ttrs at bell s whippany nj labs and an installation on ascension island latter was first used in an attempt to track a sm 68 titan on 29 march 1961 but data download from cape canaveral simulating zeus acquisition radar zar information failed a second test on 28 may was successful later in year ascension site tracked a series of four test launches two atlas two titan generating tracking information for as long as 100 seconds a zar at white sands reached initial operation in june 1961 and was tested against balloons aircraft parachutes deployed from sounding rockets and hercules missiles a ttr was completed at white sands in november and testing with complete system of zar ttr and mtr all up tests began that month on 14 december a zeus passed within of a nike hercules being used as a test target a success that was repeated in march 1962 on 5 june 1963 president kennedy and vice president lyndon johnson visited white sands to view missile launches including a zeus launch need to test zeus against targets flying realistic icbm profiles presented a problem while white sands was fine for testing basic missile and guidance systems it was too small to test zeus at its maximum range such testing began at point mugu in california where zeus missiles could fly out over pacific consideration was given to using point mugu to launch against icbms flying from cape canaveral but range safety requirements placed limits on potential tests likewise atlantic test range to northeast of canaveral had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations ascension being only suitable location eventually kwajalein island was selected as it was 4 800 miles from california perfect for icbms and already had a us navy base with considerable housing stocks and an airstrip zeus site known as kwajalein test site was officially established on 1 october 1960 as it grew in size it eventually led to entire island complex being handed over to army from navy on 1 july 1964 site took up a considerable amount of empty land to north side of airfield launchers were located on far southwestern corner of island with target tracking radars missile tracking radars mtrs and various control sites and generators running along northern side of airfield zar transmitter and receiver were some distance away off northeastern edge of airfield a minor army air force fight then broke out about what targets would be used for kwajalein tests army favored using its jupiter design fired from johnston atoll in pacific while air force recommended using atlas fired from vandenberg afb in california army had already begun converting former thor launchers to jupiter when an ad hoc panel formed by department of defense considered issue on 26 may 1960 they decided in favor of atlas and this was made official on 29 june when secretary of defense ended pad conversion and additional jupiter production earmarked for zeus testing a key development of testing program was a miss distance indicator system which independently measured distance between zeus and target at instant computers initiated detonation of warhead there were concerns that if zeus own radars were used for this ranging measure any systematic error in ranging would also be present in test data and thus would be hidden solution was use of a separate uhf frequency transmitter in warhead reentry vehicle and a receiver in zeus received signal was retransmitted to ground where its doppler shift was examined to extract range information these instruments eventually demonstrated that zeus own tracking information was accurate for visual tracking a small conventional warhead was used which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of interceptions on 24 january 1962 zeus acquisition radar at kwajalein achieved its first returns from an icbm target and on 18 april was used to track kosmos 2 on 19 january it reacquired kosmos 2 and successfully transferred track to one of ttrs on 26 june first all up test against an atlas target was attempted zar began successfully tracking target at and properly handed off to a ttr ttr switched tracks from missile fuselage to warhead at when fuselage began to break up computer switched to clutter mode which watched ttr data for any derivation from originally calculated trajectory which would indicate that it had begun tracking debris it also continued to predict location of warhead and if system decided it was tracking debris it would wait for debris and warhead to separate enough to begin tracking them again however system failed to properly record when warhead was lost and tracking was never regained a second test on 19 july was a partial success with zeus passing within of target control system ran out of hydraulic fluid during last 10 seconds of approach causing large miss distance but test was otherwise successful guidance program was updated to stop rapid control cycling that led to fluid running out a third attempt on 12 december successfully brought missile to very close distances but second missile of planned two missile salvo failed to launch due to an instrument problem a similar test on 22 december also suffered a failure in second missile but first passed only from its target mission date target notes k1 26 june tracking k2 19 july 1962 atlas success large miss distance k6 12

success of tests carried out over two year test cycle ten of them were successful in bringing zeus within its lethal range anti satellite use in april 1962 mcnamara asked nike team to consider using zeus site on kwajalein as an operational anti satellite base after main zeus testing had completed nike team responded that a system could be readied for testing by may 1963 concept was given name project mudflap development was a straightforward conversion of dm 15b into dm 15s changes were mainly concerned with providing more upper stage maneuverability through use of a new two stage hydraulic pump batteries providing 5 minutes of power instead of 2 and an improved fuel in booster to provide higher peak altitudes a test of new booster with a dm 15b upper was carried out at white sands on 17 december 1962 reaching an altitude of highest of any launch from white sands to that point a second test with a complete dm 15s on 15 february 1963 reached testing then moved to kwajalein first test on 21 march 1963 failed when mtr failed to lock onto missile a second on 19 april also failed when missile s tracking beacon failed 30 seconds before intercept third test this time using an actual target consisting of an agena d upper stage equipped with a zeus miss distance transmitter was carried out on 24 may 1963 and was a complete success from that point until 1964 one dm 15s was kept in a state of instant readiness and teams continually trained on missile after 1964 kwajalein site was no longer required to be on alert and returned primarily to zeus testing system was kept active in a non alert role between 1964 and 1967 known as program 505 in 1967 it was replaced by a thor based system program 437 a total of 12 launches including those at white sands were carried out as part of 505 program between 1962 and 1966 description thumb basic zeus system included long range and short range radars and missiles spread over some distance nike zeus was originally intended to be a straightforward development of earlier hercules system giving it ability to hit icbm warheads at about same range and altitude as maximum performance of hercules in theory hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of target to compensate for target s much higher speed in practice difficulty is detecting target early enough that intercept point is still within range of missile this demands much larger and more powerful radar systems and faster computers early detection thumb zeus acquisition radar s triangular transmitter is in foreground with dome covered receiver in background when zeus was still in early stages of design bell labs suggested using two similar radars to provide extended range tracking and improve reaction times located at zeus bases would be local acquisition radar lar a uhf radar able to track between 50 and 100 targets forward acquisition radar far would be positioned ahead of zeus bases to provide early warning of up to 200 to 300 seconds of tracking data on up to 200 targets far would broadcast 10 mw pulses at uhf between 405 495 mhz allowing it to detect a 1 square metre radar reflection at or a more typical 0 1 m2 target at each track would be stored as a 200 bit file including location velocity time of measure and a measure of quality of data clouds of objects would be tracked as a single object with additional data indicating width and length of cloud tracks could be updated every five seconds while target was in view but antenna rotated at a relatively slow 4 rpm so targets moved significantly between rotations each far could feed data to up to three zeus sites by time zeus plans were being finalized in 1957 plans for far were deemphasized and lar had been upgraded to become zeus acquisition radar zar which provided wide area early warning and initial tracking information this enormously powerful radar was driven by multiple 1 8 mw klystrons and broadcast through three wide antennas arranged as outside edges of a rotating equilateral triangle zar spun at 10 rpm but with three antennas it simulated a single antenna rotating three times as fast each target was scanned every two seconds providing much more data than earlier far lar concept signal was received on a separate set of three antennas situated at centre of an diameter luneburg lens which rotated synchronously with broadcaster under a diameter dome multiple feed horns were used in receiver to allow reception from many vertical angles at once around receiver dome was a large field of wire mesh forming a flat ground plane reflector zar operated in uhf on various frequencies between 495 605 mhz giving it frequency agility zar had detection range on order of on a 0 1 m2 target entire transmitter was surrounded by a high clutter fence located away from antenna which reflected signal away from local objects on ground that would otherwise create false returns zar was so powerful that microwave energy at close range was far beyond mandated safety limits and potentially lethal within in order to allow for maintenance while radar was operating equipment areas were shielded in a partial faraday cage of metal foil and a metal tunnel was run from outside of clutter fence which blocked signal outside fence line other radars completing system featured similar protection battery layout thumb two ttr s are closest to camera at bottom and zdr is centered mtrs are located on building in distant background thumb mtrs were very small as they homed in on strong signals from a transmitter in missile they used a simple fabric cover to protect them from elements thumb photo of mount olympus nike zeus launcher complex on kwajalein island built up hill allowed full sized zeus silos to be built into land only feet above sea level data from were passed to appropriate zeus firing battery to attack with each zar being able to send its data to up to ten batteries each battery was self contained after handoff including all of radars computers and missiles needed to perform an intercept in a typical deployment a single zeus defense center would be connected to three to six batteries spread out by as much as targets picked out by zar were then illuminated by zeus discrimination radar zdr also known as decoy discrimination radar ddr or dr zdr imaged entire cloud using a signal that allowed receiver to accurately determine range within cloud by passing each frequency in chirp to a separate range gate range resolution was 0 25 microseconds about as signal was spread out over entire cloud it had to be very powerful zdr produced 40 mw 2 us pulses in l band between 1270 1400 mhz to ensure no signal was lost by scanning areas that were empty zdr used a cassegrain reflector that could be moved to focus beam as cloud approached to keep area under observation constant data from zdr was passed to all target processor atp which ran initial processing on as many as 625 objects in a cloud as many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in discrimination and control computer dcc which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being warhead or decoy dcc was able to run 100 different tests for exoatmospheric signals tests included measure of radar return pulse to pulse to look for tumbling objects as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency within atmosphere primary method was examining velocities of objects to determine their mass any target with a high probability was then passed to battery control data processor bcdp which selected missiles and radars for an attack this started with assignment of a target tracking radar ttr to a target passed to it from dcc ttrs operated in c band from mhz at 10 mw allowing tracking of a 0 1 m2 target at a range they expected to be able to double with a new maser based receiver design once targets were being successfully tracked and a firing order was received bcdp selected available zeus missiles for launch and assigned a missile tracking radar mtr to follow them these were much smaller radars operating in x band between 8500 9600 mhz and assisted by a transponder on missile using only 300 kw to provide missile tracking to wide variety of available frequencies allowed up to 450 mtrs to be operating in a single defense center information from zdr ttr and mrts was all fed to target intercept computer tic which handled interceptions this used memory for rom and core memory for ram guidance commands were sent to missiles in flight via modulation of mtr signal nominal battery consisted of a single dr three ttrs two tics driving six mrts and 24 missiles this basic battery layout could attack three warheads at once normally using two missiles per salvo in case one failed in flight more typically two targets would be attacked while third system stood by as a hot backup that could take over in flight a maximally expanded battery included three drs ten ttrs six tics driving eighteen mtrs and 72 missiles sites requiring higher traffic handling would not build larger systems but instead deploy additional batteries fed from same zar and defense center it was expected that zar would take 20 seconds to develop a track and hand off a target to one of ttrs and 25 seconds for missile to reach target with these sorts of salvo rates a fully expanded zeus installation was expected to be able to successfully attack 14 bare warheads per minute its salvo rate against warheads with decoys is not recorded but would depend on zdr s processing rate more than any physical limit actual engagement would normally take place at about due to accuracy limitations beyond that missiles could not be guided accurately enough to bring them within their lethal range against a shielded warhead zeus missiles thumb west point cadets pose in front of a zeus b at white sands three stages of missile are clearly evident as well as details of movable upper stage thrusters original zeus a was similar to original hercules but featured a revised control layout and gas puffers for maneuvering at high altitudes where atmosphere was too thin for aerodynamic surfaces to be effective zeus b interceptor was longer at wide and in diameter this was so much larger than earlier hercules that no attempt was made to have them fit into existing hercules ajax launchers instead b models were launched from silos thus change of numbering from mim mobile surface launched to lim silo launched since missile was designed to intercept its targets in space it did not need large maneuvering fins of a model rather it featured a third rocket stage with small control jets to allow it to maneuver in space zeus b had a maximum range of and altitude of zeus a was designed to attack warheads through shock effects like hercules and was to be armed with a relatively small nuclear warhead as range and altitude requirements grew along with a better understanding of weapons effects at high altitude zeus b was intended to attack its targets through action of neutron heating this relied on interceptor s warhead releasing a huge number of high energy neutrons similar to neutron bomb some of which would hit enemy warhead these would cause fission to occur in some of warhead s own nuclear fuel rapidly heating primary hopefully enough to cause it to melt for this to work zeus mounted w50 a 400 kt enhanced radiation warhead and had to maneuver within 1 km of target warhead against shielded targets warhead would be effective to as little as specifications there are at least five zeus models mentioned in various sources a b c s and x2 last of which
