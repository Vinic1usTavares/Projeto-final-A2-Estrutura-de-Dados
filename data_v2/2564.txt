who wrote star spangled banner and its approaches were finished in 1977 completing route around baltimore approaches to bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under river in subsequent years they were upgraded to a four lane configuration compliant with interstate highway standards allowing for this portion of route to be signed as i 695

quarantine rd west of francis scott key bridge crossing of patapsco river history baltimore county planning commission first conceived baltimore beltway as a county level roadway project in 1949 by 1953 project was taken over by state due to slow progress at county level project was included as part of interstate highway system by 1956 increasing speed of construction due to federal funds available first part of baltimore beltway to be completed was in december 1955 between md 25 falls road and harrisburg expressway present day i 83 in 1956 next portion of road between harrisburg expressway and md 45 york road opened several more segments of baltimore beltway would be built in following years with section from md 168 nursery road to glen burnie bypass present day i 97 opening in 1957 portions from md 45 to md 542 loch raven boulevard md 7 old philadelphia road to us 40 pulaski highway and from md 168 to us 40 baltimore national pike opening in 1958 segment from md 2 ritchie highway to glen burnie bypass completed in 1960 portion from us 1 belair road to md 7 finished in 1961 and portions from md 542 to us 1 and from us 40 to md 25 finished in 1962 at this time original length of baltimore beltway from md 2 in south clockwise to us 40 in northeast was fully completed and opened to traffic providing first interstate grade bypass of baltimore and first beltway in united states built under interstate highway system a segment of road completed in 1973 ran from md 10 to md 2 heading toward outer harbor crossing at northeastern terminus baltimore beltway was planned to extend southeast along back river neck peninsula and turn south to cross river near essex skypark airport heading towards an outer crossing of patapsco river part of this alignment was completed south of us 40 in 1972 with a further extension to md 150 opening as southeast freeway designated md 702 by 1975 however baltimore beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned to be part of it first was windlass freeway md 149 a route planned to run from i 95 at moravia road northeast to chase paralleling us 40 to south other freeway that was incorporated into baltimore beltway was patapsco freeway a short connector from windlass freeway southeast to originally planned baltimore beltway only segment of windlass freeway between md 702 planned intersection with patapsco freeway south to md 151 north point boulevard were constructed opening to traffic in 1973 ramp stubs for planned windlass freeway are present at proposed west end at i 95 and moravia road google maps satellite view of i 95 moravia road interchange and at present west end at southeast freeway google maps satellite view of i 695 md 702 automobile association baltimore insert 1976 shows proposed extensions at each end junction of windlass and patapsco freeways was originally built with provisions for extensions of each but this has since been reconstructed google maps satellite view of transition between windlass freeway and patapsco freeway outer harbor crossing is name given to segment of baltimore beltway that is maintained by maryland transportation authority it consists of segment of i 695 between exit 40 md 151 and exit 2 md 10 which includes francis scott key bridge route was originally planned as a two lane freeway on a four lane right of way with a two lane outer harbor tunnel across patapsco river when tunnel was advertised for construction in 1970 bids were so high that decision was made to construct a four lane bridge instead bridge was to feature two lane approach roads on both sides construction on outer harbor crossing including bridge started in 1972 and was completed on march 23 1977 completing full baltimore beltway bridge was named francis scott key bridge in honor of francis scott key who wrote star spangled banner national anthem of united states by early 1980s southern approach to key bridge was with a second roadway constructed along with a second drawbridge over curtis creek northern approach was left as a two lane viaduct in sparrows point area until a four lane surface freeway was constructed along this portion with interchanges reconfigured following an 89 5 million project completed in january 2000 outer harbor crossing as well as entire baltimore beltway east of i 95 was first signposted as md 695 because portions of it were a two lane expressway not up to interstate highway standards improvements to road have allowed entire baltimore beltway to be signed as i 695 even though all of i 695 between junction of i 95 northeast of baltimore and i 97 is officially considered md 695 by mdsha on june 8 1999 a tractor trailer carrying a backhoe that exceeded maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over baltimore beltway just northwest of i 95 junction near arbutus footbridge collapsed onto inner loop of beltway one driver was killed when his suv struck collapsed bridge six others were injured three critically incident occurred during afternoon rush hour footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since november 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime beltway was dedicated in honor of former governor theodore r mckeldin in may 2005 mckeldin was responsible for construction of beltway and other state highways during his term most marylanders still refer to highway as baltimore beltway 695 or mostly among baltimore metro area residents simply beltway like its washington counterpart in march 2009 construction began on reconstruction of bridge that carries md 139 charles street over i 695 bridge will be decorative featuring ornamental street lights as part of md 139 project interchange will be reconstructed and traffic circle at md 139 i 695 ramps will be removed and replaced with a traffic signal this project was expected to cost 50 million and be completed in 2012 thumb right air photo of exit 33 on august 16 2010 showing completed flyover ramps facing southwest at exit 33 i 95 john f kennedy memorial highway both highways had crossed over themselves so that all through traffic was on left side of road with left hand entrance exit ramps connecting crossover sections this interchange was replaced in 2014 by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange as part of i 95 expansion project under construction since 2007 eliminating left turn ramps and i 95 s double crossovers ramp from northbound i 95 to eastbound i 695 was completed in september 2008 ramp from westbound i 695 to northbound i 95 was completed in october 2008 ramp from northbound i 95 to westbound i 695 was completed in november 2008 eliminating left hand exit and ramp from eastbound i 695 to southbound i 95 was completed in may 2009 ramps from southbound i 95 to both westbound and eastbound i 695 were completed in june 2009 and ramp from westbound i 695 to southbound i 695 was completed in july 2009 and ramp from eastbound i 695 to northbound i 95 opened in august 2009 in addition to rebuilding these ramps project also add four ramps to service high occupancy toll lanes being added to i 95 future there are long term plans to add new lanes to i 695 to ease traffic congestion along northern and western parts of route between two interchanges with i 95 these plans would widen sections between i 95 and i 70 on west side and between jones falls expressway and i 95 on north side in addition there are also plans to add a fourth lane between ramps to i 795 ending disappearing fourth lanes in this section a multi year project to replace stack interchange at i 70 would allow at least eight lanes to pass under this interchange upon its estimated completion by 2024 all these projects will enable up to ten lanes to be constructed at a future date also ramp meters will be installed at selected entrances within next five years exit list exits are numbered sequentially unlike other interstates in maryland which use a milepost based system and in a clockwise inner loop direction in accordance with aashto guidelines auxiliary routes md 695a runs along broening highway a two lane undivided road that begins at i 695 exit 44 and heads northwest through residential and industrial areas in dundalk baltimore county to baltimore city line route provides access to dundalk marine terminal from i 695 md 695a is long md runs along road from md 695a north to dundalk
