he married elizabeth phelip she was daughter and heiress of sir william phelip a knight of garter who was recognised as sixth lord on his death in 1441 his large east anglian estates went to his

oxford 2013 75 and was in france with henry following year griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 279 dr john watts has suggested that as a royal ward he may have been brought up in king s household as a young man and that his later generous treatment was a consequence of this watts noted that a council act of 1425 brought wards of his status permanently about king royal service thumb left all that remains of beaumont s birthplace folkingham castle today his first major activity on king s behalf was in france with king s uncle duke of gloucester in june july 1436 which had goal of relieving calais in a short sharp campaign albeit using largest english army seen on french soil since henry v s campaign he briefly reinforced duke of york in normandy but all returned to england in late july 1437 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 204 5 for this service he was granted county of boulogne in reward he was not however to ever return even though earl of warwick had named him as one of preferred nobles to accompany him back to france that year to relieve york griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 455 on 5 january following year by now a prominent household servant according to ralph griffiths griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 238 he was made steward of duchy of lancaster and steward of leicester castle donington and higham

1445 he was appointed constable of england an envoy to france that same year beginning those negotiations and five years later to scots griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 762 n 69 in june 1457 he was personally responsible for intervening in activities of bishop a virulent anti lollard however his virulence led to suspicions of heresy which resulted in beaumont s instigation of a formal examination into bishop s sermons and writings agreed to recant and abjured his heresy in november 1457 resigning his bishopric a year later griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 796 7 royal favour by 1440 he was firmly in king s favour being made in succession first ever english viscount as viscount beaumont 1440 goodwin page 65 possibly because by then boulogne was effectively lost to r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 356 and then granted royal lands in east anglia further official positions in royal castles lord great chamberlain appointed a knight of garter and feudal viscountcy of beaumont in france in 1445 he was made premier viscount and granted precedence over any other as yet unmade viscounts hicks m a english political culture in fifteenth century london 2002 p 55 these consistent promotions and favouritism have been subject of some speculation by historians john watts has questioned why he attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and from crown in these years he suggests that as a major noble in east anglia with all territorial and regional significance that meant was enough to make him worthy of promotion beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry and an adaption of vegetius for presentation to king harriss g l shaping nation england 1360 1461 oxford 2005 p 118 and was also a major benefactor of queens college cambridge which king had granted by charter to his wife margaret in 1448 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 271 n 135 second marriage his wife having died by october 1441 within two years he married katherine strangways nee neville who was dowager duchess of norfolk and noble in her own right being sister of richard neville earl of salisbury and thus what would have been considered a great marital prize she brought him further territorial and financial augmentation political career beaumont was fully involved in political crises that punctuated reign of henry vi griffiths has labelled him one of a small group of like minded men led by suffolk who could work for king whether in council or on royal progress griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 282 although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 292 n 30 as steward of england harriss g l shaping nation england 1360 1461 oxford 2005 p 613 he personally although accompanied by for example other lords such as buckingham and earl of e f fifteenth century oxford 1993 483 arrested humphrey duke of gloucester for treason in bury st edmunds 18 february 1447 throughout subsequent period of foreign catastrophe which to contemporaries came to symbolise failure of suffolk s government in late 1440s beaumont not only supported duke s policy but backed him during his impeachment harriss g l shaping nation england 1360 1461 oxford 2005 p 611 with suffolk s fall in 1450 it has been described as rather surprising that beaumont did not fall with him having been involved in some of regime s most unpopular activities for instance he was a close associate and a protector jacob e f fifteenth century oxford 1993 494 of headstrong sir william tailboys whom griffiths also called knave in chief griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 580 when tailboys attempted to assassinate lord cromwell in broad daylight in november 1449 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 286 he had also suffered a minor assault on his boston manor previous year but it is likely that he was seen as more impartial at time than he has seen since indeed far from suffering from his patron s fall he was appointed to suffolk s old position of lord chamberlain of england although only for three weeks griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 288 at outbreak of jack cade s rebellion he was commissioned on 10 june 1450 to reinforce london griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 611 and accompanied henry vi back to capital in july griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 623 later with duke of buckingham negotiated with rebels at blackheath offering them royal pardons harriss g l shaping nation england 1360 1461 oxford 2005 p 620 at time of duke of suffolk s murder beaumont had been an associate of by now recalcitrant richard duke of york having been one of duke s feoffees in may 1436 and march 1441 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 701 n 15 and possibly even acting as duke s councillor on occasion he had also joined york on king s council during york s first protectorate march 1453 january 1454 harriss g l shaping nation england 1360 1461 oxford 2005 p 629 but as york drew further from court so beaumont appears to have moved towards it although he appears to have not been present at first battle of st albans in 1455 he had already stood with king against york at latter s stand off with king at dartford in 1452 griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 709 n 134 and then sat in judgment on some of his men he eventually joined anti neville faction at court although his wife was a neville her family had by now aligned themselves with duke of york he was amongst party of lords that reported to parliament that king was sick and they not rouse him in march 1454 goodwin pages 51 52 he was also an arbitrator between york and king s party headed by duke of somerset after king s recovery in 1454 although griffiths says not a strictly impartial one griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 739 indeed griffiths suggests that his appointment to council on 15 april 1454 after king s recovery and york s dismissal was part of a concerted attempt to re balance council after protectorate griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 727 762 n 70 he was even reported although wrongly to have been recruiting an army to march against london in 1454 jacob e f fifteenth century oxford 1993 508 he was one of few lords temporal to remain in henry vi s council in closing years of decade by which time he was queen s chief steward jacob e f fifteenth century oxford 1993 481 he was also part of royal commission set up by parliament in july 1455 to examine royal household expenditure griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 750 769 n 192 trust queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 january 1457 when he was appointed to council of young prince of wales griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 781 which had responsibility for his estate management expenditure personnel and administration griffiths r a reign of henry vi berkeley 1981 p 781 2 his loyalty crown was such that in 1460 yorkists proclaimed him one of their most mortal enemies among king s supporters goodwin page 105 they also claimed that beaumont along with earls of wiltshire and shrewsbury orchestrated yorkists attainder at 1459 coventry parliament in order to seize yorkists lands lander j r government and community 1450 1509 london 1980 p 205 it is likely that
