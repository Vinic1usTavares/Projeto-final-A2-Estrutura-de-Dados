game s announcement ignited widespread anticipation within gaming industry development team found that nintendo ds was best suited to game s development team planned to bring game to playstation 3 from beginning of development but opted to work on ds version of game beforehand due to larger number of ds users in japan at time art design level 5 collaborated with studio ghibli to produce game s animated sequences and game features graphics and visuals replicating traditional animation style of studio ghibli films collaboration began when musician naoya fujimaki who had previously worked with both companies introduced level 5 president akihiro hino to studio ghibli president toshio suzuki at time studio ghibli had completed work on ponyo 2008 and animation team had no ongoing projects which influenced suzuki s decision to collaborate with level 5 another influencing factor of collaboration was witnessing hino s passion for project studio ghibli approached production process in same way that they would create an animated film work on animation began in july 2008 and took much longer than predicted three months studio ghibli s yoshiyuki momose served as game s director of animation staging scenes and directing actors during motion capture sessions he was also assigned to drawing character designs and storyboards incorporating a ghibli like style hino wished to incorporate heartwarming touch of studio ghibli productions into game artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by studio ghibli s work particularly due to their attention to detail as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control development team constantly watched studio ghibli s films during development game director ken motomura regularly worked with studio ghibli swapping and reviewing assets while hino worked with studio in regards to game s dialogue and animated sequences when designing familiars team accounted for characteristics of their surrounding area which inspired later design some of initial familiar designs were deemed either creepy or overly cute and adapted accordingly to match style of studio ghibli s artwork story and setting team wanted theme of game to resonate with children they initially considered idea of expressing adventure and dreams they later explored concept of a child s greatest influence their mother and possibility of losing them although framework of story was completed prior to studio ghibli s involvement with game they still took part in many discussions regarding some ideas including game s final scenes majority of game takes place in a magical world referred to as other world to avoid making world map feel outdated team modernized design by arranging terrain in fun and fascinating ways game s open world was designed to remind players of a miniature diorama intending to invoke reminiscence to an older time as well as feeling of freshness other segments of game are set in oliver s fictional hometown of hotroit town is modelled after an american town in peak of automotive industry during 1950s and 1960s this decision was made due to oliver s interest in cars and machines characters game s characters were particularly inspired by level 5 s previous work on professor layton series 2007 present during development momose suggested that team design clothes in a modern fashion in order for players to gain a stronger sense that you have stepped out of familiar and into a different world game s main playable character oliver is a 13 year old boy team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story they wanted children to empathize with oliver s development and adults to relive excitement of their adolescence a major part of story is oliver s personal development which hino describes as process of how a child grows into an adult in regards to oliver s physical appearance momose made his outfit represent a young boy in 1950s
