technologically advanced civilization sought to harness power of four elemental crystals of light they did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature this power of light would have consumed world itself had light crystals not had their natural counterparts four dark elemental crystals disturbed by sudden interruption of careful balance between light and dark four warriors were granted power of dark crystals to recapture power of light crystals these so called dark warriors succeeded in their quest and restored harmony to world but their victory came too late

tells him that he has been chosen as a warrior of light destined to restore balance to world and there are three others like him but before luneth can ask it to elaborate he is teleported to surface

wonderswan color remake bandai unveiled their wonderswan color handheld system in 2000 and had immediately headed up a deal with square to release enhanced remakes of their first three final fantasy titles on new console although final fantasy and final fantasy ii were both released within a year of announcement final fantasy iii was ultimately delayed from its late 2001 release date even after bandai picked up game s publishing rights while a port of final fantasy iv was eventually released for wonderswan color square remained silent regarding final fantasy iii although game was never formally cancelled official website was taken offline once production of wonderswan color consoles ceased in 2002 in 2007 hiromichi tanaka explained in an interview that wonderswan color remake had been abandoned because size and structure of coding of original famicom game was too difficult to recreate on wonderswan color 3d remake following failure to remake game for wonderswan color and square s merger with former competitor enix to form square enix in 2003 company posted assurance that game s promised remake would not be completely forgotten and there was speculation that it might find its way to sony s playstation or nintendo s game boy advance as its predecessors had square enix considered porting game to playstation 2 but was eventually convinced by nintendo to develop title for their new handheld system nintendo ds a decision that would later be positively reinforced by commercial success of nintendo ds final fantasy iii remake was first announced on october 24 2004 but detailed information did not emerge for a year hiromichi tanaka headed project as both executive producer and director his guidance and supervision were needed because remake was not a mere graphical update as final fantasy and final fantasy iis remakes were but a total overhaul using nintendo ds s 3d capabilities along with 3d graphics a full motion video opening scene was produced for game similar to those found in ports of 2d final fantasy games for playstation programming was handled by developer matrix software thumb left hiromichi tanaka and tomoya asano remake was produced by tomoya asano and co developed by square enix and matrix software ryosuke aiba final fantasy xi served as art director and akihiko yoshida final fantasy xii redesigned original characters for use in 3d

scenes were added to develop their individuality however main storyline was not altered significantly along with these four additional characters called sub characters also join party temporarily like in original unlike original however these characters may randomly participate in battle remake features a redesigned job system which rebalances classes adds new abilities and adds a new freelancer class which replaces onion knight as default job at beginning of game onion knight is retained as a secret class it also includes new events a new crystal and dungeon and removal of capacity points unlike original famicom version most of jobs remain useful for entire game ultimate jobs ninja and sage and some of lesser used jobs like geomancer were redesigned to have same level of abilities as warrior another addition are special job specific items available only if a character has fully mastered a certain job in place of capacity points each character incurs a small temporary penalty for switching jobs this penalty decreases character s statistics for next zero to ten battles this period is called a job transition phase and its length is based on how similar new job is to old job and how proficient character already is at new job remake takes advantage of wi fi feature of nintendo ds in form of a mail mognet system similar to final fantasy ix various moogles in game allow player to send email to others players are also able to send mail to various characters in game as well as to other players side quests can also be unlocked using this system such as quest to unlock onion knight an interruption save option is also available that lets player turn off ds and continue when turning it back on like in original there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon

dragon quest iii and zelda ii adventure of link in famicom 1990 game of year awards final fantasy iii was voted runner up for grand prize with 37 101 points behind dragon quest iv in 2006 readers of japanese gaming magazine famitsu voted original final fantasy iii eighth best video game of all time above dragon quest iv as of march 31 2003 original famicom game had shipped 1 4 million copies in japan ds remake met with high sales ign notes that interest in should come as no surprise given popularity of ds game sold 500 000 units within first week in japan beating square enix s original prediction that they would only sell 350 000 according to enterbrain by end of 2006 remake sold over 935 000 copies in japan as of august 6 2007 game has sold 990 000 units in japan and 460 000 units in north america as of august 8 2008 it has sold 480 000 units in europe this adds up to total worldwide sales of 1 93 million units for ds version and 3 33 million units for famicom and ds versions combined as of august 9 2008 psp port sold over 80 000 copies in japan by end of 2012 reviews of ds remake of final fantasy iii have been mostly positive with game holding an aggregate score of 77 on gamerankings 1up com described gameplay as an rpg for dedicated rpg enthusiasts and noted that while job system had been heavily improved over original title it still felt at times very limiting review however stated that it was important to remember final fantasy iii as a slice of history and a missing piece of a blockbuster series citing that hardcore rpg players may enjoy title more than other final fantasy games and calling it one of best portable rpgs to date gamespy argued that one s enjoyment hinged entirely on your desire to play a game with decidedly archaic game mechanics that may seem primitive and uninviting compared to other recent square enix titles noting game was quite challenging and adding that some people live for this stuff but others may be annoyed at game s often unfriendly nature gametrailers noted that while plot was simple and party members generic game s scenarios were top notch it additionally noted that while players should expect to have to do some grinding game offers lots of little areas to explore ign described game as one that may be amazingly frustrating for now mainstream final fantasy fan and noted that while unique concept of job system was one that simply blew gamers minds at time in contemporary environment comparing it to final fantasy xiis license board system was literally no contest review additionally argued that remake hampered game citing that battles that would take mere seconds to scroll through were now lengthened to nearly a minute another complaint was in game s presentation on nintendo ds noting that handheld s top screen was inactive for 75 of game and that even displaying only artwork on screen during those periods would have been a preferable outcome however ign described game as graphically phenomenal and set to a simply beautiful musical score they also stated that transition from 2d to 3d was a good call legacy from 1991 to 1992 kadokawa shoten s famicom gaming magazine published a manga serialization of final fantasy iii illustrated by yu based on original story by kenji terada manga chronicles events that take place throughout course of game it was subsequently collected into three tankobon under kadokawa shoten s dragon comics imprint legend of eternal wind 1 2 and 3 onion knight and cloud of darkness are respective hero and villainess representing final fantasy iii in dissidia
