explained that he was held responsible for collapse of smile only when accounts of anderle and other hipsters were used as sources in writings about beach boys love said that their role as wilson s drug suppliers was understated so that they would avoid accountability for wilson s subsequent mental decline and struggles with substance addiction thus shifting blame onto himself in revised 1985
