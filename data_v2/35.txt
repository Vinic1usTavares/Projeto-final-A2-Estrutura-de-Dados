diamond is a solid form of element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic at room temperature and pressure another solid form of carbon known as graphite is chemically stable form but diamond almost never converts to it diamond has highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools they are also reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in earth because arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid few types of impurity can contaminate it two exceptions being boron and nitrogen small numbers of defects or impurities about one per million of lattice atoms color diamond blue boron yellow nitrogen brown defects green radiation exposure purple pink orange or red diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ability to disperse light of different colors most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3 5 billion years most were formed at depths between in earth s mantle although a few have come from as deep as under high pressure and temperature carbon containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds much more recently tens to hundreds of million years ago they were carried to surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites synthetic diamonds can be grown from high purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition cvd imitation diamonds can also be made out of materials such as cubic zirconia and silicon carbide natural synthetic and imitation diamonds are most commonly distinguished using optical techniques or thermal conductivity measurements material properties diamond is a solid form of pure carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal solid carbon comes in different forms known as allotropes depending on type of chemical bond two most common allotropes of pure carbon are diamond and graphite in graphite bonds are sp2 orbital hybrids and atoms form in planes with each bound to three nearest neighbors 120 degrees apart in diamond they are sp3 and atoms form tetrahedra with each bound to four nearest neighbors tetrahedra are rigid bonds are strong and of all known substances diamond has greatest number of atoms per unit volume which is why it is both hardest and least compressible it also has a high density ranging from 3150 to 3530 kilograms per cubic metre over three times density of water in natural diamonds and kg m3 in pure diamond in graphite bonds between nearest neighbors are even stronger but bonds between planes are weak so planes can easily slip past each other thus graphite is much softer than diamond however stronger bonds make graphite less flammable diamonds have been adapted for many uses because of material s exceptional physical characteristics of all known substances it is hardest and least compressible it has highest thermal conductivity and highest sound velocity it has low adhesion and friction and its coefficient of thermal expansion is extremely low its optical transparency extends from far infrared to deep ultraviolet and it has high optical dispersion it also has high electrical resistance it is chemically inert not reacting with most corrosive substances and has excellent biological compatibility thermodynamics thumb theoretically predicted phase diagram of carbon equilibrium pressure and temperature conditions for a transition between graphite and diamond is well established theoretically and experimentally pressure changes linearly between at and at diamond graphite liquid triple point however phases have a wide region about this line where they can coexist at normal temperature and pressure and stable phase of carbon is graphite but diamond is metastable and its rate of conversion to graphite is negligible however at temperatures above about diamond rapidly converts to graphite rapid conversion of graphite to diamond requires pressures well above equilibrium line at a pressure of is needed above triple point melting point of diamond increases slowly with increasing pressure but at pressures of hundreds of gpa it decreases at high pressures silicon and germanium have a bc8 body centered cubic crystal structure and a similar structure is predicted for carbon at high pressures at transition is predicted to occur at crystal structure thumb diamond unit cell showing tetrahedral structure most common crystal structure of diamond is called diamond cubic it is formed of unit cells see figure stacked together although there are 18 atoms in figure each corner atom is shared by eight unit cells and each atom in center of a face is shared by two so there are a total of eight atoms per unit cell each side of unit cell is 3 57 angstroms in length a diamond cubic lattice can be thought of as two face centered cubic lattices with one displaced by 1 4 of diagonal along a cubic cell or as one lattice with two atoms associated with each lattice point looked at from a crystallographic direction it is formed of layers stacked in a repeating pattern diamonds can also form an abab structure which is known as hexagonal diamond or but this is far less common and is formed under different conditions from cubic carbon crystal habit thumb alt a triangular facet of a crystal having triangular etch pits with largest having a base length of about one face of an uncut octahedral diamond showing of positive and negative relief formed by natural chemical etching diamonds occur most often as or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles as diamond s crystal structure has a cubic arrangement of atoms they have many facets that belong to a cube octahedron tetrakis hexahedron or dodecahedron crystals can have rounded off and edges and can be elongated diamonds especially those with rounded crystal faces are commonly found coated in an opaque gum like skin some diamonds have opaque fibers they are referred to as opaque if fibers grow from a clear substrate or fibrous if they occupy entire crystal their colors range from yellow to green or gray sometimes with cloud like white to gray impurities their most common shape is cuboidal but they can also form octahedra dodecahedra macles or combined shapes structure is result of numerous impurities with sizes between 1 and 5 microns these diamonds probably formed in kimberlite magma and sampled volatiles diamonds can also form polycrystalline aggregates there have been attempts to classify them into groups with names such as and but there is no widely accepted set of criteria carbonado a type in which diamond grains were sintered fused without melting by application of heat and pressure is black in color and tougher than single crystal diamond it has never been observed in a volcanic rock there are many theories for its origin including formation in a star but no consensus mechanical properties hardness thumb extreme hardness of diamond in certain orientations makes it useful in materials science as in this pyramidal diamond embedded in working surface of a vickers hardness tester diamond is hardest known natural material on both vickers scale and mohs scale diamond s great hardness relative to other materials has been known since antiquity and is source of its name diamond hardness depends on its purity crystalline perfection and orientation hardness is higher for flawless pure crystals oriented to 111 direction along longest diagonal of cubic diamond lattice therefore whereas it might be possible to scratch some diamonds with other materials such as boron nitride hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates hardness of diamond contributes to its suitability as a gemstone because it can only be scratched by other diamonds it maintains its polish extremely well unlike many other gems it is well suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching perhaps contributing to its popularity as preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings which are often worn every day hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from and fields located in new england area in new south wales australia these diamonds are generally small perfect to octahedra and are used to polish other diamonds their hardness is associated with crystal growth form which is single stage crystal growth most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages which produce inclusions flaws and defect planes in crystal lattice all of which affect their hardness it is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than diamonds used in hardness gauges toughness somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property toughness which is a material s ability to resist breakage from forceful impact toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 7 5 10 mpa m1 2 this value is good compared to other ceramic materials but poor compared to most engineering materials such as engineering alloys which typically exhibit over 100 mpa m1 2 as with any material macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones prior to faceting impact toughness is one of main indexes to measure quality of synthetic industrial diamonds yield strength diamond has compressive yield strength of 130 this exceptionally high value along with hardness and transparency of diamond are reasons that diamond anvil cells are main tool for high pressure experiments these anvils have reached pressures of improved diamond anvil cell allows higher pressures physics world november 2012 much higher pressures may be possible with nanocrystalline diamonds elasticity and tensile strength usually attempting to deform bulk diamond crystal by tension or bending results in brittle fracture however when single crystalline diamond is in form of nanometer sized wires or needles 100 300 nanometers in diameter they can be elastically stretched by as much as 9 percent tensile strain without failure with a maximum local tensile stress of 89 to 98 gpa very close to theoretical limit for this material electrical conductivity other specialized applications also exist or are being developed including use as semiconductors some blue diamonds are natural semiconductors in contrast to most diamonds which are excellent electrical insulators conductivity and blue color originate from boron impurity boron substitutes for carbon atoms in diamond lattice donating a hole into valence band substantial conductivity is commonly observed in nominally diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition this conductivity is associated with hydrogen related species adsorbed at surface and it can be removed by annealing or other surface treatments surface property diamonds are naturally lipophilic and hydrophobic which means diamonds surface cannot be wet by water but can be easily wet and stuck by oil this property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds however when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions they are expected to become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature surface of diamonds is partially oxidized oxidized surface can be reduced by heat treatment under hydrogen flow that is to say this heat treatment partially removes oxygen containing functional groups but diamonds are unstable against high temperature above about under atmospheric pressure structure gradually changes into above this temperature thus diamonds should be reduced under this temperature chemical stability at room temperature diamonds do not react with any chemical reagents including strong acids and bases in an atmosphere of pure oxygen diamond has an ignition point that ranges from to smaller crystals tend to burn more easily it increases in temperature from red to white heat and burns with a pale blue flame and continues to burn after source of heat is removed by contrast in air combustion will cease as soon as heat is removed because oxygen is diluted with nitrogen a clear flawless transparent diamond is completely converted to carbon dioxide any impurities will be left as ash heat generated from cutting a diamond will not start a fire and neither will a cigarette lighter but house fires and blow torches are hot enough jewelers must be careful when molding metal in a diamond ring diamond powder of an appropriate grain size around 50 microns burns with a shower of sparks after ignition from a flame consequently pyrotechnic compositions based on synthetic diamond powder can be prepared resulting sparks are of usual red orange color comparable to charcoal but show a very linear trajectory which is explained by their high density diamond also reacts with fluorine gas above about color alt a museum display of jewelry items three brooches each consist of a large brown central gem surrounded by many clear small stones a necklace has a large brown gem at

washington d c thumb right upright 1 35 alt picture of a diamond most famous colored diamond hope diamond diamond has a wide bandgap of corresponding to deep ultraviolet wavelength of 225 nanometers this means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong and only atoms of nitrogen boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during growth at significant concentrations up to atomic transition metals nickel and cobalt which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high pressure high temperature techniques have been detected in diamond as individual atoms maximum concentration is 0 01 for nickel and even less for cobalt virtually any element can be introduced to diamond by ion implantation nitrogen is by far most common impurity found in gem diamonds and is responsible for yellow and brown color in diamonds boron is responsible for blue color color in diamond has two additional sources irradiation usually by alpha particles that causes color in green diamonds and plastic deformation of diamond crystal lattice plastic deformation is cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds in order of increasing rarity yellow diamond is followed by brown colorless then by blue green black pink orange purple and red black or carbonado diamonds are not truly black but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give gems their dark appearance colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause coloration while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in crystal lattice known as a carbon flaw most common impurity nitrogen causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon type and concentration of nitrogen present gemological institute of america gia classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in normal color range and applies a grading scale from d colorless to z light yellow diamonds of a different color such as blue are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under a different grading scale in 2008 wittelsbach diamond a blue diamond once belonging to king of spain fetched over us 24 million at a christie s auction in may 2009 a blue diamond fetched highest price per carat ever paid for a diamond when it was sold at auction for 10 5 million swiss francs 6 97 million euros or us 9 5 million at time that record was however beaten same year a vivid pink diamond was sold for 10 8 million in hong kong on december 1 2009 identification diamonds can be identified by their high thermal conductivity 900 their high refractive index is also indicative but other materials have similar diamonds cut glass but this does not positively identify a diamond because other materials such as quartz also lie above glass on mohs scale and can also cut it diamonds can scratch other diamonds but this can result in damage to one or both stones hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is case with most other gemstones these tend to result in extremely flat highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion taken together these factors affect overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a magnifying glass to identify diamonds by eye geology diamonds are extremely rare with concentrations of at most parts per billion in source rock before 20th century most diamonds were found in alluvial deposits loose diamonds are also found along existing and ancient shorelines where they tend to accumulate because of their size and density rarely they have been found in glacial till notably in wisconsin and indiana but these deposits are not of commercial quality these types of deposit were derived from localized igneous intrusions through weathering and transport by wind or water most diamonds come from earth s mantle and most of this section discusses those diamonds however there are other sources some blocks of crust or terranes have been buried deep enough as crust thickened so they experienced ultra high pressure metamorphism these have evenly distributed microdiamonds that show no sign of transport by magma in addition when meteorites strike ground shock wave can produce high enough temperatures and pressures for microdiamonds and nanodiamonds to form impact type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters crater in russia may have world s largest diamond deposit estimated at trillions of carats and formed by an asteroid impact a common misconception is that diamonds are formed from highly compressed coal coal is formed from buried prehistoric plants and most diamonds that have been dated are far older than first land plants it is possible that diamonds can form from coal in subduction zones but diamonds formed in this way are rare and carbon source is more likely carbonate rocks and organic carbon in sediments rather than coal surface distribution thumb geologic provinces of world pink and orange areas are shields and platforms which together constitute cratons diamonds are far from evenly distributed over earth a rule of thumb known as clifford s rule states that they are almost always found in kimberlites on oldest part of cratons stable cores of continents with typical ages of 2 5 billion years or more however there are exceptions argyle diamond mine in australia largest producer of diamonds by weight in world is located in a mobile belt also known as an orogenic belt a weaker zone surrounding central craton that has undergone compressional tectonics instead of kimberlite host rock is lamproite lamproites with diamonds that are not economically viable are also found in united states india and australia in addition diamonds in wawa belt of superior province in canada and microdiamonds in island arc of japan are found in a type of rock called lamprophyre kimberlites can be found in narrow 1 to 4 meters dikes and sills and in pipes with diameters that range from about 75 m to 1 5 km fresh rock is dark bluish green to greenish gray but after exposure rapidly turns brown and crumbles it is hybrid rock with a chaotic mixture of small minerals and rock fragments clasts up to size of watermelons they are a mixture of xenocrysts and xenoliths minerals and rocks carried up from lower crust and mantle pieces of surface rock altered minerals such as serpentine and new minerals that crystallized during eruption texture varies with depth composition forms a continuum with carbonatites but latter have too much oxygen for carbon to exist in a pure form instead it is locked up in mineral calcite caco3 all three of diamond bearing rocks kimberlite lamproite and lamprophyre lack certain minerals and that are incompatible with diamond formation in kimberlite olivine is large and conspicuous while lamproite has ti phlogopite and lamprophyre has biotite and amphibole they are all derived from magma types that erupt rapidly from small amounts of melt are rich in volatiles and magnesium oxide and are less oxidizing than more common mantle melts such as basalt these characteristics allow melts to carry diamonds to surface before they dissolve exploration thumb upright diavik mine on an island in lac de gras in northern canada kimberlite pipes can be difficult to find they weather quickly within a few years after exposure and tend to have lower topographic relief than surrounding rock if they are visible in outcrops diamonds are never visible because they are so rare in any case kimberlites are often covered with vegetation sediments soils or lakes in modern searches geophysical methods such as aeromagnetic surveys electrical resistivity and help identify promising regions to explore this is aided by isotopic dating and modeling of geological history then surveyors must go to area and collect samples looking for kimberlite fragments or indicator minerals latter have compositions that reflect conditions where diamonds form such as extreme melt depletion or high pressures in however indicator minerals can be misleading a better approach is where compositions of minerals are analyzed as if they were in equilibrium with mantle minerals finding kimberlites requires persistence and only a small fraction contain diamonds that are commercially viable only major discoveries since about 1980 have been in canada since existing mines have lifetimes of as little as 25 years there could be a shortage of new diamonds in future ages diamonds are dated by analyzing inclusions using decay of radioactive isotopes depending on elemental abundances one can look at decay of rubidium to strontium samarium to neodymium uranium to lead argon 40 to argon 39 or rhenium to osmium those found in kimberlites have ages ranging from 1 to 3 5 billion years and there can be multiple ages in same kimberlite indicating multiple episodes of diamond formation kimberlites themselves are much younger most of them have ages between tens of millions and 300 million years old although there are some older exceptions argyle premier and wawa thus kimberlites formed independently of diamonds and served only to transport them to surface kimberlites are also much younger than cratons they have erupted through reason for lack of older kimberlites is unknown but it suggests there was some change in mantle chemistry or tectonics no kimberlite has erupted in human history origin in mantle thumb eclogite with centimeter size garnet crystals most gem quality diamonds come from depths of 150 250 km in lithosphere such depths occur below cratons in mantle keels thickest part of lithosphere these regions have high enough pressure and temperature to allow diamonds to form and they are not so diamonds can be stored for billions of years until a kimberlite eruption samples them host rocks in a mantle keel include harzburgite and lherzolite two type of peridotite most dominant rock type in upper mantle peridotite is an igneous rock consisting mostly of minerals olivine and pyroxene it is low in silica and high in magnesium however diamonds in peridotite rarely survive trip to surface another common source that does keep diamonds intact is eclogite a metamorphic rock that typically forms from basalt as an oceanic plate plunges into mantle at a subduction zone a smaller fraction of diamonds about 150 have been studied come from depths of 330 660 km a region that includes transition zone they formed in eclogite but are distinguished from diamonds of shallower origin by inclusions of a form of garnet with excess silicon a similar proportion of diamonds comes from lower mantle at depths between 660 and 800 km diamond is thermodynamically stable at high pressures and temperatures with phase transition from graphite occurring at greater temperatures as pressure increases thus underneath continents it becomes stable at temperatures of 950 degrees celsius and pressures of 4 5 gigapascals corresponding to depths of 150 kilometers or greater in subduction zones which are colder it becomes stable at temperatures of 800 degrees c and pressures of 3 5 gigapascals at depths greater than 240 km iron nickel metal phases are present and carbon is likely to be either dissolved in them or in form of carbides thus deeper origin of some diamonds may reflect unusual growth environments in 2018 first known natural samples of a phase of ice called ice vii were found as inclusions in diamond samples inclusions formed at depths between 400 and 800 km straddling upper and lower mantle and provide evidence for water rich fluid at these depths carbon sources amount of carbon in mantle is not well constrained but its concentration is estimated at 0 5 to 1 parts per thousand it has two stable isotopes 12c and 13c in a ratio of approximately 99 1 by mass this ratio has a wide range in meteorites which implies that it was probably also broad in early earth it can also be altered by surface processes like photosynthesis fraction is generally compared to a standard sample using a ratio d13c expressed in parts per thousand common rocks from mantle such as basalts carbonatites and kimberlites have ratios between 8 and 2 on surface organic sediments have an average of 25 while carbonates have an average of 0 populations of diamonds from different sources have distributions of d13c that vary markedly diamonds are mostly within typical mantle range diamonds have values from 40 to 3 although peak of distribution is in mantle range this variability implies that they are not formed from carbon that is primordial having resided in mantle since earth formed instead they are result of tectonic processes although given ages of diamonds not necessarily same tectonic processes that act in present formation and growth diamonds in mantle form through a process where a c o h n s fluid or melt dissolves minerals in a rock and replaces them with new minerals vague term c o h n s is commonly used because exact composition is not known diamonds form from this fluid either by reduction of oxidized carbon e g co2 or co3 or oxidation of a reduced phase such as methane using probes such as polarized light and a series of growth zones can be identified in diamonds characteristic pattern in diamonds from lithosphere involves a nearly concentric series of zones with very thin oscillations in luminescence and alternating episodes where carbon is resorbed by fluid and then grown again diamonds from below lithosphere have a more irregular almost polycrystalline texture reflecting higher temperatures and pressures as well as transport of diamonds by convection transport to surface thumb upright 1 2 diagram of a volcanic pipe geological evidence supports a model in which kimberlite magma rose at 4 20 meters per second creating an upward path by hydraulic fracturing of rock as pressure decreases a vapor phase exsolves from magma and this helps to keep magma fluid at surface initial eruption explodes out through fissures at high speeds over then at lower pressures rock is eroded forming a pipe and producing fragmented rock breccia as eruption wanes there is pyroclastic phase and then metamorphism and hydration produces in space although diamonds on earth are rare they are very common in space in meteorites about three percent of carbon is in form of nanodiamonds having diameters of a few nanometers sufficiently small diamonds can form in cold of space because their lower surface energy makes them more stable than graphite isotopic signatures of some nanodiamonds indicate they were formed outside solar system in stars high pressure experiments predict that large quantities of diamonds condense from methane into a diamond rain on ice giant planets uranus and neptune some extrasolar planets may be almost entirely composed of diamond diamonds may exist in carbon rich stars particularly white dwarfs one theory for origin of carbonado toughest form of diamond is that it originated in a white dwarf or supernova diamonds formed in stars may have been first

other important centers of diamond cutting and trading are antwerp diamond district in belgium where international gemological institute is based london diamond district in new york city diamond exchange district in tel aviv and amsterdam one contributory factor is geological nature of diamond deposits several large primary kimberlite pipe mines each account for significant portions of market share such as mine in botswana which is a single large pit mine that can produce between of diamonds per year secondary alluvial diamond deposits on other hand tend to be fragmented amongst many

comprises a three pointed crown faced by two unidentifiable animals darya i nur diamond an example of unusual diamond cut and jewelry arrangement mined rough diamonds are converted into gems through a multi step process called cutting diamonds are extremely hard but also brittle and can be split up by a single blow therefore diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills scientific knowledge tools and experience its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where specific angles between facets would optimize diamond luster that is dispersion of white light whereas number and area of facets would determine weight of final product weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of order of 50 several possible shapes are considered but final decision is often determined not only by scientific but also practical considerations for example diamond might be intended for display or for wear in a ring or a necklace singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape some of them may be considered as classical such as round pear marquise oval hearts and arrows diamonds etc some of them are special produced by certain companies for example phoenix cushion sole mio diamonds etc most time consuming part of cutting is preliminary analysis of rough stone it needs to address a large number of issues bears much responsibility and therefore can last years in case of unique diamonds following issues are considered hardness of diamond and its ability to cleave strongly depend on crystal orientation therefore crystallographic structure of diamond to be cut is analyzed using x ray diffraction to choose optimal cutting directions most diamonds contain visible non diamond inclusions and crystal flaws cutter has to decide which flaws are to be removed by cutting and which could be kept diamond can be split by a single well calculated blow of a hammer to a pointed tool which is quick but risky alternatively it can be cut with a diamond saw which is a more reliable but tedious procedure after initial cutting diamond is shaped in numerous stages of polishing unlike cutting which is a responsible but quick operation polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming associated technique is well developed it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians after polishing diamond is reexamined for possible flaws either remaining or induced by process those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques such as crack filling or clever arrangement of stone in jewelry remaining non diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of voids produced marketing thumb diamond balance scale 0 01 25 carats jewelers measuring tool

which is produced in china approximately 90 of diamond grinding grit is currently of synthetic origin boundary between gem quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions for example if demand for polished diamonds is high some lower grade stones will be polished into low quality or small gemstones rather than being sold for industrial use within category of industrial diamonds there is a sub category comprising lowest quality mostly opaque stones which are known as bort industrial use of diamonds has historically been associated with their hardness which makes diamond ideal material for cutting and grinding tools as hardest known naturally occurring material diamond can be used to polish cut or wear away any material including other diamonds common industrial applications of this property include diamond tipped drill bits and saws and use of diamond powder as an abrasive less expensive industrial grade diamonds known as bort with more flaws and poorer color than gems are used for such purposes diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds as carbon is soluble in iron at high temperatures created by high speed machining leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments see diamond anvil cell high performance bearings and limited use in specialized windows with continuing advances being made in production of synthetic diamonds future applications are becoming feasible

billion and about are synthesized annually roughly 49 of diamonds originate from central and southern africa although significant sources of mineral have been discovered in canada india russia brazil and australia they are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes which can bring diamond crystals originating from deep within earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form to surface mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by african paramilitary groups diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around world only a very small fraction of diamond ore consists of actual diamonds ore is crushed during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds and then sorted by density today diamonds are located in diamond rich density fraction with help of x ray fluorescence after which final sorting steps are done by hand before use of x rays became commonplace separation was done with grease belts diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than other minerals in ore thumb siberia s udachnaya diamond mine historically diamonds were found only in alluvial deposits in guntur and krishna district of krishna river delta in southern india india led world in diamond production from time of their discovery in approximately 9th century bc ball was a geologist in british service to mid 18th century ad but commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by late 18th century and at that time india was eclipsed by brazil where first non indian diamonds were found in 1725 currently one of most prominent indian mines is located at panna diamond extraction from primary deposits kimberlites and lamproites started in 1870s after discovery of diamond fields in south africa production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of have been mined since that date twenty percent of that amount has been mined in last five years and during last 10 years nine new mines have started production four more are waiting to be opened soon most of these mines are located in canada zimbabwe angola and one in russia in u s diamonds have been found in arkansas colorado new mexico wyoming and montana in 2004 discovery of a microscopic diamond in u s led to january 2008 bulk sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of montana crater of diamonds state park in arkansas is open to public and is only mine in world where members of public can dig for diamonds today most commercially viable diamond deposits are in russia mostly in sakha republic for example mir pipe and udachnaya pipe botswana australia northern and western australia and democratic republic of congo in 2005 russia produced almost one fifth of global diamond output according to british geological survey australia boasts richest pipe with production from argyle diamond mine reaching peak levels of 42 metric tons per year in 1990s there are also commercial deposits being actively mined in northwest territories of canada and brazil diamond prospectors continue to search globe for diamond bearing kimberlite and lamproite pipes political issues thumb unsustainable diamond mining in sierra leone in some of more politically unstable central african and west african countries revolutionary groups have taken control of diamond mines using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations diamonds sold through this process are known as conflict diamonds or blood diamonds in response to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing to war and human rights abuses in central and western africa united nations diamond industry and diamond trading nations introduced kimberley process in 2002 kimberley process aims to ensure that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups this is done by requiring diamond producing countries to provide proof that money they make from selling diamonds is not used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities although kimberley process has been moderately successful in limiting number of conflict diamonds entering market some still find their way in according to international diamond manufacturers association conflict diamonds constitute 2 3 of all diamonds traded two major flaws still hinder effectiveness of kimberley process 1 relative ease of smuggling diamonds across african borders and 2 violent nature of diamond mining in nations that are not in a technical state of war and whose diamonds are therefore considered clean canadian government has set up a body known as canadian diamond code of conduct to help authenticate canadian diamonds this is a stringent tracking system of diamonds and helps protect conflict free label of canadian diamonds synthetics simulants and enhancements synthetics thumb alt six crystals of octahedral shapes each about 2 millimeters in diameter two are pale blue one is pale yellow one is green blue one is dark blue and one green yellow synthetic diamonds of various colors grown by high pressure high temperature technique synthetic diamonds are diamonds manufactured in a laboratory as opposed to diamonds mined from earth gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones this demand has been satisfied in large part by synthetic diamonds which have been manufactured by various processes for more than half a century however in recent years it has become possible to produce gem quality synthetic diamonds of significant size it is possible to make colorless synthetic gemstones that on a molecular level are identical to natural stones and so visually similar that only a with special equipment can tell difference majority of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and are produced by so called high pressure high temperature processes yellow color is caused by nitrogen impurities other colors may also be reproduced such as blue green or pink which are a result of addition of boron or from irradiation after synthesis thumb right alt a round clear gemstone with many facets main face being hexagonal surrounded by many smaller facets colorless gem cut from diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition another popular method of growing synthetic diamond is chemical vapor deposition cvd growth occurs under low pressure below atmospheric pressure it involves feeding a mixture of gases typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves hot filament arc discharge welding torch or laser this method is mostly used for coatings but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size see picture as of 2010 nearly all 5 000 million carats 1 000 tonnes of synthetic diamonds produced per year are for industrial use around 50 of 133 million carats of natural diamonds mined per year end up in industrial use mining companies expenses average 40 to 60 us dollars per carat for natural colorless diamonds while synthetic manufacturers expenses average 2 500 per carat for synthetic gem quality colorless diamonds however a purchaser is more likely to encounter a synthetic when looking for a fancy colored diamond because nearly all synthetic diamonds are fancy colored while only 0 01 of natural diamonds are simulants thumb alt a round sparkling clear gemstone with many facets gem cut synthetic silicon carbide set in a ring a diamond simulant is a non diamond material that is used to simulate appearance of a diamond and may be referred to as diamante cubic zirconia is most common gemstone moissanite silicon carbide can be treated as a diamond simulant though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia both are produced synthetically enhancements diamond enhancements are specific treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds usually those already cut and polished into a gem which are designed to better gemological characteristics of stone in one or more ways these include laser drilling to remove inclusions application of sealants to fill cracks treatments to improve a white diamond s color grade and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond coatings are increasingly used to give a diamond simulant such as cubic zirconia a more diamond like appearance one such substance is diamond like carbon an amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties similar to those of diamond advertising suggests that such a coating would transfer some of these diamond like properties to coated stone hence enhancing diamond simulant techniques such as raman spectroscopy should easily identify such a treatment identification early diamond identification tests included a scratch test relying on superior hardness of diamond this test is destructive as a diamond can scratch another diamond and is rarely used nowadays instead diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity electronic thermal probes are widely used in gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations these probes consist of a pair of battery powered mounted in a fine copper tip one thermistor functions as a heating device while other measures temperature of copper tip if stone being tested is a diamond it will conduct tip s thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop this test takes about two to three seconds whereas thermal probe can separate diamonds from most of their simulants distinguishing between various types of diamond for example synthetic or natural irradiated or non irradiated etc requires more advanced optical techniques those techniques are also used for some diamonds simulants such as silicon carbide which pass thermal conductivity test optical techniques can distinguish between natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds they can also identify vast majority of treated natural diamonds perfect crystals at atomic lattice level have never been found so both natural and synthetic diamonds always possess characteristic imperfections arising from circumstances of their crystal growth that allow them to be distinguished from each other laboratories use techniques such as spectroscopy microscopy and luminescence under shortwave ultraviolet light to determine a diamond s origin they also use specially made instruments to aid them in identification process two screening instruments are diamondsure and both produced by dtc and marketed by gia several methods for identifying synthetic diamonds can be performed depending on method of production and color of diamond cvd diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence d j colored diamonds can be screened through swiss institute s diamond spotter stones in d z color range can be examined through diamondsure uv visible spectrometer a tool developed by de beers similarly natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws such as inclusions of foreign material that are not seen in synthetic diamonds screening devices based on diamond type detection can be used to make a distinction between diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially synthetic those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab examples of commercial screening devices are d screen hrd antwerp alpha diamond analyzer hrd antwerp and d secure drc techno stolen diamonds occasionally large thefts of diamonds take place in february 2013 armed robbers carried out a raid at brussels airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth us 50m ps32m gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided cargo hold of a swiss bound plane gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered identification of stolen diamonds presents a set of difficult problems rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than those that have been mined determining provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex kimberley process was developed to monitor trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence before exporting rough diamonds are certificated by government of country of origin some countries such as venezuela are not party to agreement kimberley process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country diamonds may be etched by laser with marks invisible to naked eye lazare kaplan a us based company developed this method however whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed history name diamond is derived from ancient greek adamas adamas proper unalterable unbreakable untamed from a a un damao damao i overpower i tame diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in india where significant alluvial deposits of stone could be found many centuries ago along rivers penner krishna and godavari diamonds have been known in india for at least 3 000 years but most likely 6 000 years diamonds have been treasured as gemstones since their use as religious icons in ancient india their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history popularity of diamonds has risen since 19th century because of increased supply improved cutting and polishing techniques growth in world economy and innovative and successful advertising campaigns in 1772 french scientist antoine lavoisier used a lens to concentrate rays of sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of oxygen and showed that only product of combustion was carbon dioxide proving that diamond is composed of carbon see lavoisier 1772 premier memoire sur la destruction du diamant par le feu first memoir on destruction of
