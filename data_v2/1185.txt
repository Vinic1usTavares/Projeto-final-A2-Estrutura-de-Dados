secr k class was a type of 2 6 4 tank locomotive designed in 1914 by richard maunsell for express passenger duties on south eastern and chatham railway secr which operated between london and south east england southern railway sr k1 class was a three cylinder variant of k class designed in 1925 to suit a narrower loading gauge they were among first non great western railway gwr types to use and improve upon basic design principles of power and standardisation established by gwr chief mechanical engineer cme george jackson churchward locomotives were based on gwr 4300 class improved by midland railway s ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance scott morgan 2002 p 18 k class was designed to be mechanically similar to secr n class 2 6 0 mixed traffic locomotives class was one of earliest to use 2 6 4 wheel arrangement in britain casserley 1966 p 436 production began towards end of first world war and prototype rolled out of ashford works three years after design work was completed due to wartime production constraints class replaced obsolete 4 4 0 passenger locomotives in an secr fleet standardisation programme twenty one locomotives were built twenty k class two cylinders and one k1 class three cylinders first in 1917 and remainder between 1925 and 1926 they operated over eastern section of southern railway network and were given names of rivers being referred as river class from 1925 crews referred to k and k1 classes as rolling rivers because of their instability when travelling at speed they were rebuilt as 2 cylinder sr u class and 3 cylinder sr u1 class 2 6 0s respectively following a railway accident at sevenoaks kent in 1927 they continued in service with british railways br until last was withdrawn in 1966 one k class rebuild no 31806 is preserved on swanage railway in dorset and still operational today background three factors dictated type of locomotive that could operate on south eastern and chatham railway secr heavy passenger train loadings poor track quality and weak lightly built bridges on lines of former london chatham and dover railway lcdr inherited by secr in 1899 beach pebbles had been used for ballast instead of conventional ballast which has irregular shapes that lock together to keep track in place these economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could operate safely over track secr was therefore unable to follow a coherent strategy to reduce number of locomotive types inherited from two constituent railways despite increased passenger and freight traffic between and kentish coast during first decades of 20th century operating department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4 4 0 and 0 6 0 locomotives which could operate within restrictions imposed by infrastructure whitehouse thomas 2002 p 50 this resulted in frequent double heading adding to operational costs whitehouse thomas 2002 p 51 richard maunsell was appointed cme of secr in 1913 following enforced retirement of harry wainwright who had left a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled to cope with increased train lengths and loadings whitehouse thomas 2002 p 49 maunsell reviewed situation and planned to introduce six standard classes using only two boiler designs which would work entire traffic of railway bradley 1980 pp 66 67 first of these was n class 2 6 0 which gave secr a capable mixed traffic locomotive for express passenger design that could cope with heavy boat trains maunsell wanted to enlarge existing l class 4 4 0 with walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater but this design would have resulted in a too heavy axle loading maunsell s newly recruited assistants g h pearson and harold holcroft from great western railway at swindon and james clayton from midland railway at derby had recently been involved in design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use 2 6 4 wheel arrangement which would allow class to operate at high speeds on poor quality track in north kent design and construction 2 6 4 wheel arrangement was not in common use in great britain at this time as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives 2 6 4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in britain on great central railway s 1b class freight locomotives of 1914 bradley 1961 p 52 however configuration was ideal for secr because of its shorter mainlines and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves tightness of curves on former lcdr mainlines had constrained size of locomotives operating on secr as they had been hastily erected during nineteenth century to compete with those of south eastern railway ser longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4 4 0 giving sufficient power to avoid double heading of locomotives on heavier trains k class design used a bissel bogie leading axle and a plain trailing bogie trailing bogie permitted use of a large coal bunker that was capable of sustaining locomotive over run between london charing cross and and side water tanks of capacity were used negating need for a tender coupled wheelbase between rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on mechanically identical n class to to accommodate bogie bradley 1961 p 53 cab was fully enclosed although set of four small front spectacle plates windows on front face of cab for forward visibility were same as those used on n class k class was designed by maunsell s team in 1914 as part of his proposed standardisation programme following n class but designs were not shown to railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once design incorporated principles of power and reliability established by george churchward using a belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards cab instead of a round topped version a regulator located in smokebox long travel valves for free running at high speeds a sharply tapered and boiler and a right hand driving position middlemass 1990 pp 148 154 inclusion of these features is attributed to holcroft maunsell s personal assistant who had worked on gwr 4300 class and n class haresnape 1983 pp 34 36 james clayton maunsell s chief locomotive draughtsman brought simpler and more functional midland railway influences to design such as shape of cab and drumhead type smokebox which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than fully lagged and clad boiler rowledge 1976 p 8 latter was fitted with ross pop safety valves and pressed to other innovations by maunsell s team included greater superheating surface area locating boiler water top feed inside a dome like cover with external and water feed pipes mounted on either side outside walschaerts valve gear and parts that could be shared with similar locomotive classes to reduce maintenance costs clarke february 2008 p 38 firebox was narrower towards rear and featured a continuously sloping grate whilst was fitted with front and rear damper doors latter adjusted to clear rear driving axle lower part of coal bunker incorporated a water tank of capacity this was connected to two side tanks by two rectangular pipes on either side of locomotive that also formed supports for cab footplate rowledge 1976 p 10 k class in january 1915 maunsell received authority to build six examples but as with n class production was delayed due to use of ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture assembly began in 1917 and first no 790 emerged in july of that year it was based at bricklayers arms depot bradley 1980 p 69 preceding earlier n class design into service by one month railway engineer 1923 pp 140 143 further construction was deferred until after ashford had caught up with maintenance backlog caused by war ten more locomotives were ordered by secr from ashford works in june 1920 and to speed delivery construction of frames cylinders and side tanks was subcontracted to royal arsenal at woolwich however further severe delays at ashford caused by backlog of repair work meant that boilers had to be supplied by north british locomotive company bradley 1980 p 70 construction of these locomotives had not begun by 1 january 1923 when railways act 1921 merged secr with other railways in southern england to form southern railway maunsell was appointed cme of newly formed southern railway in 1923 and inherited 1920 secr order for ten k class locomotives order was still outstanding in 1924 although most of component parts had been made on 14 january 1925 maunsell ordered no 790 to be overhauled and trialled on central section holcroft 1965 pp 145 147 as locomotive proved suitable for operating conditions of this section southern railway s locomotive committee proceeded with assembly of k class parts using outside contractors bradley 1980 p 116 nine sets of parts nos a791 a799 were conveyed to armstrong whitworth for assembly and finished locomotives delivered in may and june 1925 these were dual fitted with vacuum and westinghouse air brakes for use with former london brighton and south coast railway lbscr rolling stock on central section other differences from prototype included relocation of regulator to dome and an increase in superheater area tenth set of parts was retained by ashford and used for first member of k1 class later that year in may 1925 maunsell ordered a further ten locomotives from brighton works nos a800 a809 which only had vacuum brakes for secr stock on eastern section they were delivered between july and december 1926 this group had modified suspension on bogie and leading axle in an attempt to address complaints from crews of rough riding experienced with earlier members of class a further 20 members of class were ordered in march 1926 ten each from ashford and brighton works despite strong reservations expressed by operating department concerning wisdom or desirability of placing so many large passenger tanks in service bradley 1980 p 71 these were allocated numbers and work had begun on building frames and cylinders when order was cancelled following an accident at sevenoaks in 1927 involving locomotive no a800 these numbers were later allocated to first production batch of u class locomotives k1 class thumb left alt side and front view of 3 cylinder version of locomotive distinguishing feature is a

right hand cylinder is holcroft valve gear linkage to inside cylinder in august 1919 a proposal was put to secr s locomotive carriage and wagon committee for 2 and 3 cylinder tank engines of 2 8 0 wheel arrangement for heavy shunting of freight wagons rowledge 1976 p 7 they were to use same boiler as k and n classes and general layout was similar to designs used by gwr in south wales nothing came of this proposal because of other commitments and absorption of secr into southern railway in 1922 holcroft suggested that 3 cylinder 2 6 0 tender locomotives with driving wheels should be built instead of tank locomotives despite benefit of a greater operational range holcroft s immediate superior clayton refused to pass this suggestion on to maunsell 3 cylinder principle was therefore applied to k class at southern railway s january 1925 locomotive committee meeting when it was decided to use outside contractors to build k class maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at ashford works to construct a prototype 3 cylinder 2 6 4 tank modification was based upon that used on n class no 822 to produce a 3 cylinder locomotive in 1922 although it retained driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of k class modification was inclusion of an additional inside cylinder between frames and a crank axle was fitted to middle driving wheels axle was connected to inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear front driving axle rowledge 1976 p 11 this arrangement was supplemented by two smaller diameter outside cylinders with bore compared to cylinders of k class and a greater chimney diameter resulting prototype 3 cylinder k1 was narrower than k class and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge as with no 822 this locomotive used holcroft s derivative of gresley conjugated valve gear to drive inside cylinder to accommodate this boiler had to be raised by above inside gear raising centre of gravity on locomotive main visual difference between k and k1 classes was at front end k1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above front buffer beam to protect third cylinder and associated holcroft valve gear assembly from elements clarke february 2008 p 40 it also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates and a pair of substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to running plate lack of a middle cylinder on k class locomotives had allowed provision of a footplate that curved from buffers to water tanks k1 prototype emerged from ashford works as no a890 and underwent trials from 1 december 1925 before entering regular service reynolds 1943 pp 155 156 only one locomotive of k1 class was built plans to build a further ten nos alongside a batch of five n1 class 2 6 0s were cancelled after sevenoaks accident in august 1927 rowledge 1976 p 22 following rebuilding as a 2 6 0 tender locomotive in 1928 no a890 was reclassified

southern railway s operating area and class became known collectively as river class burridge 1975 p 48 first completed southern railway k class no a791 was named river adur whilst former secr

rectangular brass nameplate fitted to water tank sides operational details k class was intended to haul secr s kent expresses and was trialled between charing cross and a trial non stop run between and by no 790 pulling a train of had proved water capacity of side tanks to be insufficient for such runs holcroft 1965 p 147 no 790 was also tested on fast cannon street and tonbridge trains during spring of 1922 although rough riding between latter two stations meant slower speeds over that part of route on subsequent runs rowledge 1976 p 25 southern railway s motive power re organisation

haul early evening express from cannon street to dover marine performance of tank locomotives k class proved successful on well maintained track it was capable of high speeds on express passenger duties although their use was limited by lower storage capacity of tank locomotives which meant k and k1 classes were prone to water shortages on long kent coast routes and precluded them from working many of former london and south western railway lswr routes west of london need to save weight meant that compromises were made in some aspects of design boiler size was constrained by secr s axle loading restrictions with result that design s full steaming potential was not realised failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler would also affect maunsell s subsequent 2 6 0 classes as they were given same boiler despite their lower axle loadings on southern railway s central and eastern sections crews complained that locomotives rolled heavily and unpredictably on cheaply laid track of former secr and lbscr networks leading to their nickname rolling rivers rolling was in part caused by type of coil suspension and steadying springs used on bissel truck and bogie axles which caused adverse springing on poor track rowledge 1976 p 48 these were modified in later batches with limited success rowledge 1976 p 49 rough riding was also attributed to frames which were of insubstantial construction to save weight bracing proved incapable of counteracting stresses applied to frames when travelling at speed and caused excessive vibration on footplate at higher outputs k1 prototype was slightly faster and more powerful than k class and gave a smoother ride at low speeds boocock 2010 p 87 it was also found to have a wider route availability due to smaller outside cylinders however holcroft valve gear proved to be difficult to maintain in everyday service this locomotive was also noted for particularly poor riding characteristics at high speed derailing twice in 1927 clarke march 2008 p 55 first derailment occurred at near maidstone on 31 march when flanges of lead coupled wheel mounted rails at second derailment was at on 20 august when lead driving wheel mounted and completely dropped off rails at derailing train and causing serious damage to track these derailments were attributed to slightly higher centre of gravity of boiler on k1 bradley 1961 p 54 although official reports of these accidents blamed poor quality of track a group of directors sought to have both classes banned from use on passenger services but were overruled by southern railway s chairman of board of directors everard baring on grounds of cost bradley 1980 p 117 accidents and incidents in march 1927 locomotive no 890 river frome was hauling a train which derailed at wrotham kent on 2 august 1927 locomotive no 800 river cray was derailed at maidstone kent on 20 august 1927 locomotive no 890 river frome was hauling a passenger train which was derailed at bearsted kent cause was attributed to track defects locomotive was repaired and re entered service on 23 august it was involved in a serious accident next day sevenoaks disaster thumb derailed locomotive on its side following sevenoaks disaster k and k1 classes suffered from stability problems when travelling at speed over points and curves locomotive would initially roll briefly lean heavily to one side followed by several further rolls of gradually reducing amplitude combined with a side slipping movement that caused driving wheels to mount rails several minor derailments of members of class were followed by serious derailment of no a800 river cray at sevenoaks kent in august 1927 caused by a combination of a surge in water tanks and flanges of locomotive s lead driving wheels mounting rail at speed due to poor quality track work railways archive 2004 ministry of transport railway accidents pdf copy of original inquiry report for sevenoaks railway accident retrieved 6 january 2010 locomotive was hauling a cannon street to express with a pullman carriage when leading driving wheels derailed at over catch points in a cutting several carriages were flung against a road bridge injuring 40 and killing 13 passengers in days following accident two k and k1 class engines were trialled on london and north eastern railway s lner great northern mainline under supervision of that company s cme nigel gresley bradley 1980 p 72 to gain an unbiased review of their riding qualities locomotives no a803 k and no a890 k1 and king arthur class no were tested on well maintained lner

with no problems in riding holcroft 1965 p 145 when these engines returned from lner southern railway s general manager sir herbert walker ordered further trials to be led by sir john aspinall on western section main line near these were terminated by southern railway s operating department as riding of locomotives at speeds near rendered locomotives unsafe instability of no a890 at speed was attributed to helical springs on bissel truck and bogie pringle 1928 p 28 1928 accident inquiry did not attach blame to southern railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues and noted that prototype had run for eight years over same stretch of line without complaint pringle 1928 p 17 however it identified brighton batch and no a890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints although entire class operated without incident on former lbscr network pringle 1928 p 19 management of southern railway realised that to have any success in operating k class tanks on other parts of network vast stretches of track would require upgrading with prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst necessary upgrading took place management recommended class be fully withdrawn from service to recoup expense of constructing engines maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to new sr u class 2 6 0 tender engine design in 1928 this decision also reduced adverse publicity generated by accident however many of components discarded during rebuilding process would later be re used on another 2 6 4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on

morgan 2002 p 46 straight sided variant of maunsell tender was attached allowing a greater operational range for locomotives rear bogies were later used on sr w class 2 6 4 tank locomotives only subsequent use of this wheel arrangement by southern railway and their use was restricted to freight operations around london solitary k1 class locomotive was rebuilt in june 1928 and so became three cylinder prototype of sr u1 class rowledge 1976 p 39 holcroft valve gear was later replaced with a third set of walschaerts valve gear in february 1932 thus reducing maintenance clarke march 2008 p 56 none of rebuilds retained their names performance of rebuilt locomotives and withdrawal as members of u and u1 classes rebuilds were used mainly on mixed traffic as well as secondary passenger duties on lines between main routes they were used all over southern railway network but were little used over steep track gradients west of exeter herring section u class pp 120 121 smaller wheeled n class was preferred amongst crews for same duties as high speed running was rare away from main lines in west country heavier passenger work was allocated to bulleid s unrebuilt light pacifics which were within weight restrictions in this area 21 rebuilt locomotives entered british railways service in 1948 from 1955 a few were given replacement frames at overhaul these had a shallower curve between front buffer beam and smokebox haresnape 1983 p 92 withdrawals took place between 1962 and 1966 by which time many of rebuilds were based at guildford shed work was taken over by oliver bulleid s

plain white lining and primrose yellow markings when rebuilt into u and u1 classes locomotives were repainted in olive green livery with southern added to tender tank haresnape 1983 p 88 this was carried into second world war when labour shortages meant that many u class locomotives were painted in plain black with result that by 1945 all class were running in black class prototype was initially numbered 790 with rest following consecutively with a prefix a to denote a locomotive designed for former secr system of prefixes had been adopted by sr to distinguish between locomotives with identical numbers acquired from different companies and k1 class became no a890 when built in 1925 this system was replaced from 1928 by a renumbering of all locomotives into one sequence in which k class rebuilds became nos 1790 1809 and k1 class rebuild became no 1890 haresnape 1983 p 93 rebuilds in british railways service k and k1 classes were absorbed by british railways as part of u

locomotive see list of k and k1 class locomotives thumb 31806 near on swanage railway sir nigel gresley s independent report on k and k1 classes during mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well maintained track which meant that they could have been useful additions to southern railway s suburban commuter fleet pringle 1928 p 26 however they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability and not only on poorest quality tracks restricted water capacity also limited their use outside southern railway s central section impending electrification of brighton main line scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in 1930s lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when decision was made to rebuild them as u u1 tender engines following sevenoaks disaster in rebuilt form they continued to operate until 1960s and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70 mph 110 km h with a greater degree of stability one k class rebuild has survived no river converted to u class no 1806 was rescued from
