silver reef is a ghost town in washington county utah united states about northeast of st george and west of leeds silver reef was established after john kemple a prospector from nevada discovered a vein of silver in a sandstone formation in 1866 at first geologists were uncertain about kemple s find because silver is not usually found in sandstone in 1875 two bankers from salt lake city sent william barbee to site to stake mining claims he staked 21 claims and an influx of miners came to work barbee s claims and to stake their own to accommodate miners barbee established a town called bonanza city property values there were high so several miners settled on a ridge to north of it and named their settlement rockpile town was renamed silver reef after silver mines in nearby pioche closed and businessmen arrived by 1879 about 2 000 people were living in silver reef town had a mile long main street with many businesses among them a wells fargo office rice building and cosmopolitan restaurant although adjacent to many settlements with a majority of mormon residents town never had a meeting house for latter day saints only a catholic church in 1879 a fire destroyed several businesses but residents rebuilt them mines were gradually closed most of them by 1884 as worldwide price of silver dropped by 1901 most of buildings in town had either been demolished or moved to leeds in 1916 mining operations in silver reef resumed under direction of alex colbath who organized area s mines into silver reef consolidated mining company these mines were purchased by american smelting and refining company in 1928 but company did minimal work as a result of great depression western gold uranium corporation purchased silver reef s mines in 1948 and in 1951 they began mining uranium in area these operations did not last long either and western gold uranium corporation sold their mines to 5m corporation in 1979 today wells fargo office cosmopolitan restaurant rice building and numerous foundations and walls remain in town site and a few dozen homes have been constructed in area silver reef has been absorbed by neighboring community of leeds geology and geography thumb left pine valley mountains as seen from red mountain wilderness study area sandstone formations from which silver reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long longitudinally aligned sections of navajo sandstone to buckle and stand on their sides giving them appearance of ocean reefs over long periods of time silver ore sediments and vegetation were carried in water runoff from chinle formation to white buckeye and east reefs ore settled as deposits and vegetation became petrified silver reef mining district s geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits with smaller deposits of copper gold lead and uranium oxide iron oxide deposits in soil rocks cause a red coloration and dinosaur tracks from early jurassic period have been found in area silver reef is close to western border of colorado plateau and about northeast of st george and west of leeds dixie national forest leeds creek white reef and pine valley mountain wilderness lie directly west of silver reef pine valley mountain wilderness has sage steppe mountain brush pinyon pine coniferous trees and ponderosa pine interstate 15 and are and east of silver reef respectively pintura is north of silver reef and quail creek state park ghost town of harrisburg buckeye reef and red cliffs recreation area are south of silver reef elevation of red cliffs recreation area is between and climate silver reef is located in one of driest and hottest parts of state of utah summer temperatures often rise above temperatures of or above can occur during winter but nighttime winter temperatures occasionally drop below silver reef receives about of precipitation annually it is not unusual to see an inch or more of snow in winter july has warmest average temperature and december is coldest with an average temperature of highest recorded temperature was in july 2001 and lowest recorded temperature was in january 1963 demographics silver reef was first settled in 1875 by 1880 census 1 046 people were living there and a local census taken in 1884 gave a population of 1 500 by 1890 after most of mines had closed population had dropped to 177 and by 1900 only lessees of mines were living there in 1916 alex colbath organized silver reef consolidated mining company several miners moved in to work for colbath who lived in town with his wife mayme until 1950s after departure silver reef was completely abandoned subdivision of land planned in 1960s was finalized by 1980 during census of 1990 50 people lived in silver reef and today silver reef is considered a part of leeds history silver reef area was first inhabited by anasazi native americans between about 200 ad and 1300 ad anasazi were nomads who followed migration of animals they hunted typically deer mountain sheep elk and jackrabbits they were also farmers and gardeners growing corn wheat rye and barley many were potters and pottery can be found in abandoned villages anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves often using bark for roofs occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks usually along side of a mountain often large enough to accommodate several families storage pits were often placed behind rock dwellings settlements were typically small as food was scarce a group of virgin anasazi lived in what is now red cliffs anasazi site in red cliffs recreation area thumb home of orson b adams where john kemple stayed in 1866 silver was discovered in area in 1860s one commonly accepted story is that a prospector named john kemple came to area in 1866 from montana while staying at home of orson b adams in settlement of harrisburg kemple decided to do some prospecting and soon located a vein of silver a few hundred yards southwest of home he did not find enough ore to interest him so he left for nevada five years later kemple returned to silver reef area staked a few mining claims and organized them under union mining district union mining district was abandoned but in 1874 kemple returned with a group of miners reorganized claims under harrisburg mining district and began developing a mine kemple later became discouraged with his claims and sold them according to a less accepted story a man known as metalliferous murphy an assayer from pioche nevada was brought a piece of a grindstone made of sandstone from silver reef area by miners in pioche after performing tests on sample murphy stated that it contained over 200 of silver per ton after some investigation murphy discovered that samples had come from area that was to become silver reef there is no record of murphy ever staking a claim but he did allegedly attract attention of miners thumb left cosmopolitan restaurant center and harrison house hotel upper right geologists and other miners refused at first to believe news that silver had been found in sandstone when brought an actual sample from area smithsonian institution called it an interesting fake in 1875 news of silver discovery reached walker brothers well known bankers from salt lake city they hired william t barbee who had previously staked mining claims in ophir to stake claims on their behalf he staked 21 claims and published an article on claims in salt lake tribune in article barbee mentioned that area had an abundance of rich silver mines this set off a silver rush and by late 1875 barbee had established a town called bonanza city several businessmen then came into area inflating property values many miners and businessmen looking for inexpensive land set up a tent city north of bonanza city and called it rockpile when mines in nearby pioche were closed in november 1875 many of miners and business owners who had worked there came into area of rockpile in what is known as pioche silver stampede and name of settlement was changed to silver reef as construction of st george lds temple ended in mid 1877 labor opportunities for workers became available in silver reef pine valley mills and mount trumbull in arizona strip supplied most of lumber used to construct buildings during its first year silver reef did not have a smelter as a result silver ore mined in silver reef was taken to pioche and salt lake city for smelting thumb upright an ore bin in silver reef immediately following initial silver rush a town site was platted and town was built first permanent business building established in silver reef was a store at intersection of roads from buckeye white and east reefs by 1878 town s business district consisted of a hotel boarding houses nine stores six saloons five restaurants a bank two dance halls a newspaper called silver echo which later became silver reef miner and eight dry goods stores two cemeteries one catholic and one protestant were located south of silver reef s business district most of businesses in silver reef were situated along a mile long main street mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills christy stormont leeds buckeye and barbee walker mills although it was surrounded by settlements with large mormon populations town never had a mormon meeting house a catholic church was only church located within town after first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 many of chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work some returned to china but others remained in utah a group of 250 of these workers set up a chinatown in a level area just south of silver reef silver reef s chinatown had a chinese mayor and several businesses by 1879 silver reef s population had reached 2 000 and town also had a horse race track a brewery and a brass band shooting matches among members of silver reef rifle club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on horse race track although most of residents of silver reef were not mormon they had good relations with residents of nearby mormon settlements a lot of cotton and other agricultural items produced in area were transported by wagon to silver reef many of town s buildings were constructed by mormon labor workers reverend lawrence scanlan was invited to say mass in st george tabernacle of church of jesus christ of latter day saints before catholic in silver reef was constructed to assist scanlan mormon choir learned latin chants when politics were involved however these good relations were forgotten most mormons were members of people s party and most people in silver reef were members of liberal party as silver reef grew townspeople wanted to change county seat of washington county from st george to silver reef this alarmed members of people s party main figures in territorial legislature legislature moved county line eastward in 1882 this maintained people s party majority in washington county by transferring such mormon farming communities as grafton rockville and springdale from kane county to washington county thumb left grave of henry clark in catholic cemetery although it had good relations with other towns silver reef had usual labor disputes between mining camp wage laborers and mine owners after a major dispute with stormont mining company silver reef miners union was formed to support wages gambling prostitution and shootouts were also commonplace one shootout involved town marshal johnny diamond and mine guard jack truby tensions between diamond and truby temporarily shut down kinner mine truby was hired by colonel enos wall foreman and owner of kinner to guard mine until told otherwise diamond went to kinner mine to serve closure warrant but truby refused to allow diamond into mine and forced diamond to leave property immediately gunfight started during court proceedings in back room of a saloon diamond and truby argued about truby wearing his hat inside and continued argument outside when diamond asked for truby s gun truby shot at diamond diamond returned fire and both men died an inquest on both men held in saloon found that bodies each contained bullet wounds from 41 caliber revolvers that were used and powder burns caused by proximity of shootout truby also had 45 caliber bullet wounds in his back indicating that somebody else had shot him during shootout another shootout occurred between henry clark and sykes griffen on december 1 1878 at cassidy s silver reef saloon although it is not known exactly what happened it is believed that griffen a faro dealer at saloon and clark a regular patron had previously argued over gambling matters shooting began when griffen argued with clark about a bet they had made after arguing for several minutes griffen pulled a pistol on clark and shot him several witnesses said that clark pulled a pistol on griffen and shot him while other witnesses said that after clark was shot other patrons in saloon including clark s father beat and shot griffen another instance of murder occurred on october 3 1880 when thomas forrest stabbed michael carbis carbis foreman of california mine had fired forrest day before on account of his violent nature murder occurred near buckeye boarding house forrest initially had a pistol but he put it away and drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of carbis carbis died soon after stab wound was inflicted silver reef s residents were angered by murder and soon lynch threats were delivered forrest who had been arrested soon after murder had been committed was transferred to jail in st george for his own safety prior to moving of forrest a lynch mob gathered and followed sheriff s escort to st george jail once there they overpowered sheriff took forrest out of his cell and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole when pole broke they took him to a cottonwood tree and hanged him there residents of st george were shocked at sight of forrest s hanging and one man was reputed to have said i have observed that tree growing there for last 25 years this is first time i have ever seen it bearing fruit decline on may 30 1879 fire was discovered under a restaurant hundreds of silver reef s residents threw buckets of water from nearby leeds creek on fire and put wet blankets on adjacent business buildings but fire spread to harrison house hotel one of town s most prominent buildings fire destroyed several other businesses along main street before it was finally extinguished salt lake tribune reported that silver reef had been and that a state of panic was felt even after fire had been extinguished silver reef s residents rebuilt businesses that had been destroyed but town soon began to decline in 1881 stormont mining company and barbee walker mining company had to decrease wages from 4 per day to 3 50 per day in all of their mines except savage mine a stormont property in response to decrease in wages silver reef miners union was formed in february 1881 union members began talking about striking mines and as word of this potential strike spread stormont mining company discharged those of its miners who were part of miners union in response discharged union members escorted company s superintendent washington allen out of silver reef allen immediately went to second district court in beaver and filed a lawsuit against union members before they went to court union members held a meeting and decided to shut down savage mine led by matthew o loughlin president of silver reef miners union they walked through silver reef in rows of two and upon arriving at savage mine o loughlin and nine other men went into hoisting works and ordered engineer on duty to shut down pumps that kept water from water table out of mine after pumps were shut down group of ten went into savage mine and ordered everyone out a few days later sheriff of st george accompanied by a posse of 30 men arrested 25 members of miners union including matthew o loughlin as silver reef s jail was too small to hold all 25 prisoners most of them were jailed in rice building rice building could not hold all of prisoners so a line was drawn around building and anyone who crossed line was threatened with shooting miners union members were transferred to beaver where they were tried for riot conspiracy and false imprisonment thirteen of members were sentenced to imprisonment three were bailed out while ten were sent to utah territorial penitentiary matthew o loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a 75 fine a few years after strike world s silver market dropped causing foreclosure of many of mines to compensate for drop in prices mines stockholders reduced wages of miners instead of striking again miners accepted this in addition miners inadvertently dug below water table and mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out by 1884 most of mines were idle or closed last was officially closed in 1891 although lessees of mines continued to operate them past that year many merchants went bankrupt and left town silver reef mines produced about 8 million worth of silver ore between 1891 and 1901 another 250 000 worth was mined several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898 1909 1916 and 1950 but none of these attempts were successful after silver reef s mines were closed many of buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone one buyer dismantled building he bought and discovered 10 000 in gold coins news of find spread quickly and most of buildings in silver reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold but none was found silver reef consolidated mining company was organized in 1916 by alex colbath who owned most of area s mines in 1928 american smelting and refining company purchased its mines and in 1929 they sank a three compartment shaft on white reef this new mine was connected with flooded savage mine and water was pumped out minimal work was done after that however as there was not enough ore to keep operation profitable during great depression ownership of mines was then passed back to alex colbath but in 1948 western gold and uranium corporation purchased claims from colbath and in 1951 they mined sandstone for uranium oxide deposits first shipment of uranium oxide came from ann s pride mine and in total of uranium oxide was shipped out of region claims were bought in 1979 by 5m corporation but company did not operate in silver reef for long tourism and popular culture thumb wells fargo office in 1968 following closure of district s mines wells fargo office was used as a residence by alex and mayme colbath until 1950s it was placed on national register of historic places on march 11 1971 and currently serves as an art gallery and a museum rice building burned down and was rebuilt in 1991 cosmopolitan restaurant was reconstructed to appear as it did in 19th century and it served european cuisine until it was closed in 2010 there are many remnants of houses and other buildings and there are also markers indicating where some buildings once stood such as elk horn saloon some of area has been preserved for its history thumb left mining machinery at silver reef museum behind wells fargo office is a powder house which as of
