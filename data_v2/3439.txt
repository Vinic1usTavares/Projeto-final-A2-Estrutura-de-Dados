life of samuel johnson or life of samuel johnson ll d was written by john hawkins in 1787 it was first full biography of samuel johnson with thomas tyers s a biographical sketch of dr samuel johnson being first short postmortem biography hawkins was a friend of johnson but many in johnson s circle did not like him after johnson s death hawkins was approached to produce a biography on johnson and an edition of his works his biography described johnson s life including previously unknown details about his writing career but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics hawkins s life of samuel johnson came under swift attack from critics from friends of johnson and from his literary rival james boswell immediately after its publication many of critics attacked hawkins for his lack of strict focus on johnson s life or for his unfavourable depiction of johnson in various circumstances background thumb left sir john hawkins according to bertram davis for every person who remembers sir john hawkins as author of first full length biography of samuel johnson many remember him as man johnson once described as unclubable davis 1961 p vii although unclubable reflects hawkins s relationship with others of johnson s circle johnson and hawkins had a close friendship as miss reynolds describes as we were returning from meadows that day i remember we met sir john hawkins whom dr johnson seemed much rejoiced to see and no wonder for i have often heard him speak of sir john in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship reynolds 1897 p 297 298 their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with gentleman s magazine in 1749 hawkins was a member of johnson s first club ivy lane club davis 1961 p ix after joining ivy lane club he married sidney storer heir to a 20 000 pound fortune with hawkins receiving an addition 10 000 pound dowry in 1753 and his career started to quickly pick up he bought a home on thames at twickenham near horace walpole he published izaak walton s compleat angler in 1760 he was appointed as a magistrate in 1761 in 1765 became chairman of quarter sessions for county of middlesex and wrote a a general history of science and practice of music in 1776 he was knighted in 1772 and served as chairman of quarter session davis 1961 pp x xi thumb right samuel johnson even with all success or because of it he was resented among some of johnson s circle hawkins member of johnson s second club literary club established 1764 resigned over a dispute with others of johnson s circle relationship between hawkins and rest of johnson s friends became so tense that many criticised johnson for choosing hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will however within hours of johnson s death thomas cadell and william strahan asked hawkins to write a biography and an edition of johnson s literary works davis 1961 pp x xii on 16 december 1784 st james s chronicle stated hawkins and boswell were both writing biographies davis 1961 p xii however thomas tyers published before them when his a biographical sketch of dr samuel johnson first postmortem biographical work on johnson but not a full length biography ran in december 1784 issue of gentleman s magazine hill 1897 p 366 this did not deter hawkins and by 21 december 1784 he began advertising his authentick life of johnson this provoked an anonymous articles in st james s chronicle started attacking hawkins it is evident from conduct of late dr johnson that he designed mr boswell for sole writer of his life why else did he furnish him with such materials for it as were withheld from every other friend little indeed did he suppose that a person whom he had made one of his executors would have instantly claimed office of his biographer still less could he have imagined that this self appointment would have been confirmed by booksellers source of attack was george steevens who worked with johnson on an edition of shakespeare s plays and was a constant critic of hawkins he along with others began to spread rumours about hawkins some claimed that he stole johnson s belongings after his death and others claimed that hawkins wanted to slander johnson in his biography davis 1961 p xiii hawkins house burned down on 23 february 1785 and he was barely able to preserve his notes and johnson s diaries which were foundations for his life work was published in march 1787 davis 1961 p xiv st james s chronicle and london chronicle published excerpts for several weeks with universal magazine and political magazine following later a second edition was published mid april 1787 biography biography is a standard biography describing incidents of johnson s life one of unique features that made hawkins s life special was its ability to provide information on johnson s contributions to gentleman s magazine biography revealed details about events surrounding early years of magazine and events that happened between employees which provided insights into literary magazine not published before boswell was unable to publish his life until 1791 but when he did he introduced his work with a summary of what he felt hawkins s biography contained since my work was announced several lives and memoirs of dr johnson have been published most voluminous of which is one compiled for booksellers of london by sir john hawkins knight a man whom during my long intimacy with dr johnson i never saw in his company i think but once and i am sure not above twice johnson might have esteemed him for his decent religious demeanour and his knowledge of books and literary history but from rigid formalities of his manners it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity nor had sir john hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark finer and less obvious parts of johnson s character his being appointed one of his executors gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left of which before delivering them up to residuary legatee whose property they were he endeavoured to extract substance in this he has not been very successful as i have found upon a perusal of those papers which have been since transferred to me sir john hawkins s ponderous labours i must acknowledge exhibit a farrago of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to lovers of literary but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works even one of several leaves from osborne s harleian catalogue and those not compiled by johnson but by oldys a very small part of it relates to person who is subject of book and in that there is such an inaccuracy in statement of facts as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory but what is still worse there is throughout whole of it a dark uncharitable cast by which most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in character and conduct of my illustrious friend who i trust will be a true and fair delineation be vindicated both from injurious misrepresentation of this authour and from slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him boswell i pp 26 28 hawkins and hester thrale in boswell s mind were rivals to what he considered his domain davis 1961 p xviii that is not to say that he was wrong about hawkins s life because it does contain many digressions such as a discussion of sixteenth century breakfast habits written in latin and a discussion on history of taverns among others hawkins also included long extracts from johnson s works critical response right thumb arthur murphy fellow johnson biographer and reviewer of hawkins s life monthly review critical review english review and european magazine contained reviews that in words of bertram davis characterised biography as a malevolent and spiteful account of johnson s life grossly inaccurate and rendered utterly ridiculous by its pompous and its digressions on every conceivable subject book if they were to be believed was less a biography than a polemic less a work of art than a collection of senile gossip in particular critical review said we often lose dr johnson knight sinks under weight of his subject and is glad to escape to scenes more congenial to his disposition and more suitable to his talents of a literary old man critical review june 1787 p 417 arthur murphy anonymously wrote in monthly review sir john most probably acquired his notions of language at his master s desk he admired phraseology of deeds and parchments whereof to speak in his own manner he read so much that in consequence thereof he has been chiefly conversant therein and by help of parchments aforesaid missed elegance above mentioned and uses works that in them we sometimes meet with and being bred and attorney he caught language of said trade whereof he retains so much that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby and in consequence thereof monthly review july 1787 p 68 steevens under name philo johnson claimed in european magazine great solid principle that secures its condemnation is spirit of malevolence to dead which breathes all through it sir john hawkins with all humanity and very little of dexterity of a clare market butcher has raised his blunt axe to deface image of his friend european magazine may 1787 p 313 a later review in st jame s chronicle joked it was false that mrs hobart had an intention of reading sir john hawkins book late hours at which people of rank go to bed renders it wholly unnecessary to force a sleep in public places davis 1961 p vi this followed with a joke in a later journal a gentleman lately arrived in town has been for several days past afflicted with a lethargy owing to perusal of three chapters in hawkins s life of johnson a third stated branches of willow trees planted in lichfield should be lopped off and tied in bundles and properly applied to naked backs of his various biographers taking care that largest bundle be appropriated unto use and of sir john hawkins
