chesma also transliterated was second ship of s built for imperial russian navy in 1880s when ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged mclaughlin p 25 russian companies could not produce most advanced armour and machinery desired by naval general staff so they were imported from united kingdom and belgium chesma spent her career as part of black sea fleet when crew of battleship mutinied in june 1905 ship s crew was considered unreliable and she did not participate in pursuit of potemkin chesma did however escort potemkin as towed her back to sevastopol from constanta romania where potemkin had sought asylum chesma was turned over to sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 august 1907 before she was fully dismantled naval ministry decided to use her hull for full scale armour trials she was re designated as stricken vessel nr 4 on 22 april 1912 before being used as a gunnery target afterwards ship served as a torpedo target for destroyers of black sea fleet during these attacks chesma settled to bottom of bay of tendra and was eventually scrapped during mid 1920s design and description thumb left right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1896 chesma was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of and a draft of more than than designed she displaced at load over more than her designed displacement of mclaughlin p 21 chesma had two 3 cylinder vertical compound steam engines imported from belgian cockerill company fourteen cylindrical boilers also imported from cockerill provided steam to engines engines had a total designed output of but they produced on trials and gave a top speed of almost at full load she carried of coal that provided her a range of at a speed of and at mclaughlin pp 21 29 30 she differed from her sister ships mainly in her main armament she had six model 1886 35 caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts two forward side by side and one aft each of forward mounts could traverse 30deg across bow and 35deg abaft beam or a total of 155deg rear mount could traverse 202deg they had a range of elevation from 2deg to 15deg chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when guns were trained to one side traversing all guns as far as they could go to one side produced a list of 7 6deg and made it very difficult for turntable machinery to rotate guns back to fore and aft position mclaughlin pp 26 27 this problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract list but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill problem was partially cured in 1892 when equipment was rearranged on turntable to improve their balance but more thorough solutions to problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes including training time sixty rounds per gun were carried main guns were mounted very low only above main deck and caused extensive damage to deck when fired over bow or stern they fired a light shell that weighed or a heavy shell that weighed light shell had a muzzle velocity of while heavy shell could only be propelled at a velocity of light shell had a maximum range of when fired at an elevation of 15deg seven 35 caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures except for one gun mounted in stern in hull eight five barreled revolving hotchkiss guns were mounted in small embrasures in hull to defend ship against torpedo boats four five barreled revolving hotchkiss guns were mounted in fighting top she carried seven above water torpedo tubes one tube forward on each side able to bear on forward targets two other tubes were mounted on each broadside forward and aft of central citadel seventh tube was in stern mclaughlin pp 26 28 history thumb left chesma being used as a target ship in 1912 chesma was named after russian victory at battle of chesma in 1770 she was built by russian steam navigation company at sevastopol she was laid down in late june 1883 launched on 18 may 1886 and completed on 29 may 1889 mclaughlin pp 21 30 she served with black sea fleet until 1907 she was inactive in 1895 probably for mechanical problems chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re boilered following year mclaughlin p 30 plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin gun turrets equipped with 12 inch 40 caliber guns and ten 6 inch 45 caliber guns between turrets in an armoured citadel that used krupp armor this proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled but not before armor and turrets had been ordered her turrets were used to equip pre dreadnought then under construction mclaughlin pp 150 157 when crew of battleship mutinied in june 1905 chesmas crew was considered unreliable and she did not participate in pursuit of potemkin she escorted potemkin as towed her back to sevastopol from constanta romania where potemkin had sought asylum ship was turned over to sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 august 1907 before she was fully dismantled naval ministry decided to use her hull for full scale armour trials she was re designated as stricken vessel nr 4 on 22 april 1912 chesma was fitted with a replica of armour system used in s to test its effectiveness she was towed into position and given a 7deg list to simulate descent angle of shells fired at long range ironically her own guns were used against her as ioann zlatoust anchored away and fired 12 inch and 6 inch shells with reduced charges to simulate shells fired from approximately away these revealed significant weaknesses in support structure for armour plates and in deck protection but class ships were too far along in construction to incorporate fixes mclaughlin pp 247 48 afterwards she served as a torpedo target for destroyers of black sea fleet during these attacks she settled to bottom of
