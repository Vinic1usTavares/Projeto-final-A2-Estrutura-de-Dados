media wainwright started listening to carnegie hall album in weeks and months after september 11 craving some cheap showbiz cheer but wound up discovering something deeper subsequent war on terrorism and invasion of iraq caused wainwright to become traumatized and disillusioned with anything american claiming he was reminded of how great us used to be wainwright said following of his appreciation for album during that turbulent time in american history wainwright observed while driving in his car that it would be funny to redo this as a song cycle soon afterwards he took idea to new york based theatrical producer jared geller who would later co produce tribute concert with david foster hoping to turn a dream into a reality geller initially thought idea was insane but he and wainwright continued discussing options eventually geller agreed to assist with production and two found space in wainwright s schedule to book carnegie hall a year in advance once venue was booked staging elements such as lighting microphone location and amplification were discussed stephen oremus signed on as conductor of 36 piece orchestra and phil ramone took charge of recording rehearsals began in april 2006 and while it would have been easier to practice in rehearsal rooms large theaters such as lynch at john jay college of criminal justice and museum of jewish heritage were utilized because rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage as a result of financial restrictions full orchestra rehearsals took place only two days before show and day of each performance practice

arlen irving berlin noel coward and more wainwright performed songs nearly identically to garland even ing lyrics purposely on you go to my head to mimic mistake made by garland years before orchestrations stephen oremus musical director for tribute concerts faced task of resurrecting mort lindsey s original arrangements written for a 36 piece orchestra although it is no longer common to have orchestras so large oremus acknowledged that even wicked on broadway only had 22 pieces wainwright and oremus insisted full 36 piece ensemble should be utilized to create as exact a replica as they could muster some of arrangements had to be reconstructed since music was not available and most of songs had to be transposed since wainwright was performing them in a different key gay elements garland was a gay icon even before wainwright was born gay identification with garland was being discussed in mainstream as early as 1967 time magazine in reviewing garland s 1967 palace theatre engagement disparagingly noted that a disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual it goes on to say that t he boys in tight trousers would roll their eyes tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats during garland s performances time then attempted to explain garland s appeal to homosexual consulting psychiatrists who opined that attraction to garland might be made considerably stronger by fact that she has survived so many problems homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria and that judy was beaten up by life embattled and ultimately had to become more masculine she has power that homosexuals would like to have and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her garland always had a large base of fans in gay community which includes wainwright who identifies as gay and came out to his parents at age of 14 a connection is frequently drawn between timing of garland s death and funeral in june 1969 and stonewall riots flashpoint of modern gay liberation movement coincidental or not proximity of garland s death to stonewall has become a part of lgbt history and lore wainwright having been called first post liberation era gay pop star was obsessed with wizard of oz 1939 as a child and would dress in his mother s gown pretend ing to be either wicked witch melting for hours on end or good witch depending on his mood wainwright also claims his mother canadian folk musician kate mcgarrigle forced him to perform over rainbow for guests while growing up a song he often included in his concert repertoire as an adult thumb wainwright mimicking judy garland s appearance in summer stock in 2007 wainwright never intended to impersonate garland or create a drag act but rather to inhabit songs and expose them to a new generation however there was a certain camp style present of which wainwright stated following i think that any gay person in world would be seduced at one point by a certain kind of camp for certain people it s kind of a saving grace regarding tribute concerts and homosexuality wainwright admitted while wainwright did not dress in drag at any of tribute shows in new york or europe he did return to stage in judy drag for an encore at hollywood bowl performance bedecked in a double breasted tuxedo jacket sans pants black stockings high heels earrings lipstick and a tilted fedora he also took get happy from set and performed tune summer stock style during part of his release stars tour to mimic look of garland during her performance pictured on right critical reception overall reception of album was positive stephen holden of blender called wainwright s tribute a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled spirit of ultimate gay icon and declared album was as good an introduction to great american songbook as any pitchfork media s stephen trousse wrote that wainwright elegantly outdoes garland on a couple of ballads and also compliments guest performer martha wainwright who turns in a stunning showstopping stormy weather in an appropriately brazen bid to steal show in his review for rolling stone robert christgau stated it was a relief to hear him essay show tunes and tin pan alley chestnuts of this tribute album furthermore he wrote that songs expand wainwright s melodic compass allowing him to bring something new to them too namely sexuality in sensuality as opposed to gender preference sense dave hughes of slant magazine had positive comments about album that wainwright has temerity to cover such a bona fide classic and chops to pull it off without breaking a limb or his brain speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities album did receive some criticism after noting garland s lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation christgau claimed wainwright s habit of slid ing past notes and draw ing out final syllables of lines are signatures indistinguishable from tics entertainment weeklys chris willman wrote that wainwright s delicate upper range is nicely attuned to some of ballads but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss mark edwards of times called wainwright s performance an acquired taste stating his trademark delivery is lazy and somewhat slurred dave hughes review pointed out wainwright s problem with brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on that s entertainment but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since garland s live performance was not perfect either hughes appropriately notes ain t nobody perfect chart performance and recognition despite popularity of wainwright s tribute concerts an abundance of press regarding album and generally favorable critical reception album sales were limited however rufus does judy at carnegie hall reached a peak position of number 84 in belgium number 88 in netherlands and number 171 on united states billboard 200 album was nominated for a 2009 grammy award for best traditional pop vocal album but lost to natalie cole s still
