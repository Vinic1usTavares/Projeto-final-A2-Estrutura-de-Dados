october commenting on boycott s more amiable personality since his recovery from cancer we have a much more rounded and nuanced book full of self awareness and a willingness even eagerness to acknowledge errors failings and regrets this a complex driven man whom we all recognise and admire for his achievements revealing aspects of his life and survival that have hitherto been kept close to his chest playing style boycott s playing style revolved around intense concentration solid defence and attention to detail while avoiding heavy hitting or slogging mckinstry p 24 he was described in complete encyclopaedia of cricket as one of greatest opening batsmen that game has known he dedicated his life to art of batting practising assiduously and eschewing any shot that might even hint at threatening loss of his wicket through his test career he scored 15 4 of england s runs and england won 32 41 of tests in which boycott played this compares with england s 34 76 victory rate over all test cricket history richard hutton yorkshire and england batsman and son of len hutton described boycott as a one pace player suggesting that he was unable to alter his playing pace as match circumstances dictated mckinstry p 114 nevertheless boycott maintained an impeccable defensive technique and possessed a temperament ideally suited for five day test matches mckinstry p 51 arlott wrote that his technique is based on a defence organised as near as may be arlott p 127 boycott himself remarked in 1981 that given choice between raquel welch and a hundred at lord s i d take hundred every time his careful batting is reflected in his 22 centuries for england of which only two had a strike rate of over 51 00 former england bowler frank tyson wrote in 1987 in test within that greatness of boycott batsman and gaffes of boycott man had common roots in an unceasing quest after perfection boycott also kept a black book which he used to record bowlers tendencies while this style facilitated his solid defensive play it inhibited him as a stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries especially his left shoulder elbow and forearm due to his high elbow to control bat on defensive strokes such injuries would be common throughout his career mckinstry p 98 one such injury almost required tip of a broken finger to be amputated he was occasionally vulnerable to left arm bowlers either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left hand bowlers for him to practise against in nets mckinstry p 143 another reason is because he did not like to move around stumps much unlike bert sutcliffe that helped him fare better against pace bowlers and boycott later adjusted to move back and across to fast bowlers while staying still against spinners and medium pacers boycott himself disputes this in spite of that he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler pace bowler dennis lillee was most successful against him in test matches with seven dismissals gary sobers also dismissed him seven times but lillee did so in fewer matches mckinstry p 338 peter lever a test colleague discussed with boycott his vulnerability when playing hook stroke which was to get him out on more than one occasion mckinstry p 101 arlott p 128 overall in test cricket 54 of boycott s dismissals were by being caught with lbw and bowled taking 14 and 16 respectively boycott was an occasional medium pace bowler he was never a genuine all rounder but took seven wickets at test level at an average of 54 57 often bowling wearing his cap turned back to front to assist his vision at start of his career boycott was a below average fielder having received no coaching on this from yorkshire and with little inclination to rectify it when concentrating on his batting a fellow yorkshire batsman ken taylor worked with boycott who was limited in fielding ability but had tremendous determination with further help from his two brothers boycott s fielding improved he became a safe pair of hands generally at cover point arlott p 126 though he continued to lack power and pace in field mckinstry pp 58 59 never taking more than two catches in a test innings and averaging 0 170 dismissals per innings with 33 career catches in all he would remark in his autobiography that his usual fielding positions depended not on tactical situation but on whether captain was one of boycott s critics who would therefore banish him to a remote part of field written works boycott has written a number of works on cricket
