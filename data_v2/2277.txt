come together however episode was flawed in dialogue and in picard s changes in tone i m not sure if that was a deliberate choice so he would appear as a conflicted man or if it was patrick stewart s

earlier episodes he had reservations about use of wesley crusher he called thoughts made flesh concept a cliche but was gratified to see series actually trying for something a little beyond their reach this early in game as for wesley handlen thought that it was imposing a chosen one narrative that brought an unlikable character even further to forefront of action simply because some writer
