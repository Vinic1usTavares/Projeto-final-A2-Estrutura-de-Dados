vincent van gogh painted at least 15 paintings of olive trees mostly in saint remy de provence in 1889 at his own request he lived at an asylum there from may 1889 through may 1890 painting gardens of asylum and when he had permission to venture outside its walls nearby olive trees cypresses and wheat fields one painting olive trees in a mountainous landscape was a complement to starry night olive tree paintings had special significance for van gogh a group in may 1889 represented life divine and cycle of life while those from november 1889 arose out of his attempt to symbolize his feelings about christ in gethsemane his paintings of olive pickers demonstrate relationship between man and nature by depicting one of cycles of life harvesting or death it is also an example of how individuals through interaction with nature can connect with divine van gogh found respite and relief in interaction with nature when series of olive tree paintings was made in 1889 he was subject to illness and emotional turmoil yet paintings are considered to be among his finest works saint remy thumb left view of asylum and chapel at saint remy of elizabeth taylor in may 1889 van gogh voluntarily entered asylum of st paul near saint remy in provence there he had access to an adjacent cell he used as his studio he was initially confined to immediate asylum grounds and painted without window bars world he saw from his room such as ivy covered trees lilacs and irises in garden as he ventured outside of asylum walls he painted wheat fields olive groves and cypress trees in surrounding countryside which he saw as characteristic of provence over course of year he painted about 150 canvases imposed regimen of asylum life gave van gogh a hard won stability i feel happier here with my work than i could be outside by staying here a good long time i shall have learned regular habits and in long run result will be more order in my life while his time at saint remy forced him to manage his vices such as coffee alcohol poor eating habits and periodic attempts to consume turpentine and paint his stay was not ideal he needed to obtain permission to leave asylum grounds food was poor he generally ate only bread and soup his only apparent form of treatment were two hour baths twice a week during his year there van gogh had periodic attacks possibly due to a form of epilepsy by early 1890 when attacks worsened he concluded that his stay at asylum was not helping him to recover which led him to move to auvers sur oise just north of paris in may 1890 olive trees as a subject painting countryside surrounding fields cypress trees and olive trees restored van gogh s connection to nature through art he completed at least 15 paintings in 1889 of venerable gnarled olive trees pervasive throughout southern france of which he wrote thumb olive trees in provence france effect of daylight and sky means there are endless subjects to be found in olive trees for myself i look for contrasting effects in foliage which changes with tones of sky at times when tree bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies emerald fruit beetles and cicadas in great numbers fly about everything is immersed in pure blue then as bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange and then again further into autumn leaves take on violet tones something of color of a ripe fig and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with contrast of large whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon sometimes too after a shower i ve seen whole sky pink and orange which gave an exquisite value and coloring to silvery gray greens and among all this were women also pink who were gathering fruit he found olive trees representative of provence both demanding and compelling he wrote to his brother theo that he was struggling to catch olive trees they are old silver sometimes with more blue in them sometimes greenish bronzed fading white above a soil which is yellow pink violet tinted orange very difficult he found that rustle of olive grove has something very secret in it and immensely old it is too beautiful for us to dare to paint it or to be able to imagine it spiritual significance as a young man van gogh considered pursuing ministry to serve working people he studied for a time in netherlands but his zeal and self imposed asceticism cost him a short term position in lay ministry he became somewhat embittered and rejected church establishment yet found a personal spirituality that was comforting and important to him by 1879 he made a shift in direction of his life and found he could express his love of god and man through painting van gogh painted nature major subject for his works in last 29 months of his life to bring relief from his illnesses and emotional distress prior to this period he had rejected what he perceived as narrow religion of his parents and took an almost nihilistic stance not unlike nietzsche s toward religion and god it was among blossoming trees olive orchards and fields that van gogh most often found profound meaning because he saw in their cycles an analogy to human life he wrote to theo that death happiness and unhappiness are necessary and useful and relative declaring even faced with an illness that breaks me up and frightens me that belief is unshaken thumb right

somewhat in reaction to recent compositions of christ in garden of olives by his friends paul gauguin and emile bernard frustrated by their work which he qualified with words nothing was observed van gogh painted in groves morning and evening during these clear cold days but in beautiful bright sunshine resulting in five canvases above three he completed earlier in year he wrote to his brother theo what i have done is a rather hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions but it will have a rustic quality and will smell of earth rather than attempting to recreate what scene might have been like he explained one can express anguish without making reference to actual gethsemane and there is no need to portray figures from sermon on mount in order to express a gentle and comforting feeling he also commented i shall not paint a christ in garden of olives but shall paint olive harvest as one might see it today and by giving human figure its proper place in it one might perhaps be reminded of it silverman debora van gogh and gauguin search for sacred art p 311 retrieved may 9 2011 analysis artistic style van gogh s early works were made with dull gray colors in paris he met leading french artists edgar degas georges seurat and others who provided illuminating influences on use of color and technique his work previously somber and dark now blazed with color indeed van gogh s use of color became so dramatic that he was sometimes called an expressionist but it was southern france that provided an opportunity for him to express his surging emotions enlightened by effects of its sun drenched countryside van gogh reported that above all his work promises color this is where he began development of his masterpieces van gogh captured colors and moods of trees which varied dramatically by daylight and season he began to use color blue to represent divine in both starry night and his olive tree paintings van gogh used intense blue of sky to symbolize divine and infinite presence of jesus seeking a modern artistic language to represent divine he sought a numinous quality in many of his olive tree paintings such as by bathing olive trees an emblem for jesus in radiant gold light thumb georges pierre seurat bathers at asnieres 1884 national gallery london detail of water and grass an example of use of seurat s use of broken lines of color to bring light and form to paintings van gogh used impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work innovatively drawing in color giving painting light and form as he also did in his paintings of plowed fields mountains rocks and heads and figures series is unified by a more refined approach without thick application of paint to which he was more accustomed meaning national gallery of art summarizes this series in olive trees in expressive power of their ancient and gnarled forms van gogh found a manifestation of spiritual force he believed resided in all of nature his brushstrokes make soil and even sky seem alive with same rustling motion as leaves stirred to a shimmer by mediterranean wind these strong individual dashes do not seem painted so much as drawn onto canvas with a heavily loaded brush energy in their continuous rhythm communicates to us in an almost physical way living force that van gogh found within trees themselves very spiritual force that he believed had shaped them skye jethani author of divine commodity discovering a faith beyond consumer christianity asserts that in many of his paintings olive tree series in particular van gogh conveys redemptive quality of sorrow and that even in sorrow there can be rejoicing to quote van gogh s sermon of 1876 sorrow is better than joy for by sadness of countenance heart is made better our nature is sorrowful but for those who have learnt and are learning to look at jesus christ there will always be reason to rejoice it is a good word that of st paul as being sorrowful yet also rejoicing paintings in his letters van gogh specified two groupings three paintings made in june 1889 and five completed by late november 1889 there was also a painting in september three olive picker paintings in december and a few others van gogh made several drawings of olive trees when as a precautionary safety measure he did not have access to his paints complement to starry night of olive trees in a mountainous landscape in collection of museum of modern art moma vincent wrote his brother theo i did a landscape with olive trees and also a new study of a starry sky calling this painting daylight complement to nocturnal starry night his intention was to go beyond photographic and silly perfection of some painters to an intensity born of color and linear rhythms within painting twisted green olive trees stand before foothills of alps and underneath sky with an cloud later when pictures had dried he sent both of them to theo in paris noting olive trees with white cloud and mountains behind as well as rise of moon and night effect are exaggerations from point of view of general arrangement outlines are accentuated as in some old woodcuts olive pickers van gogh painted three versions of women picking olives first he described as an on spot study in deeper tones from nature second painting is most resolved and stylized of three intended for his sister and mother is located at metropolitan museum of art in new york city third in chester dale collection at national gallery of art washington dc he painted in his studio in december in a very discreet color scheme although subject of painting is immediately clear first tree like a stepping stone leads spectator into scene here van gogh was more concerned about emotional and spiritual reality than literal interpretation women harvest olives for sustenance way in which trees seem to wrap around women and trees and landscape are almost one indicates an emotional bond and interdependence between nature and people another painting was made of olive pickers this time a couple kroller muller museum s olive grove with two olive pickers was painted december 1889 painted in may and june 1889 van gogh made four paintings in

presented painting to his friend and doctor dr gachet with whom he would be under care and supervision in auvers sur oise following year kroller muller museum olive orchard was painted in june 1889 painted in september november and december 1889 paintings made during this period were much artistic result of van gogh s reaction to gauguin and bernard gethsemane painting as mentioned in spiritual significance section intense nature of national gallery of scotland s olive trees likely expresses van gogh s agitated state of mind when he completed this work dramatic impact evidenced both through his brushstrokes and color use contrasting with his june olives with their blue green color and coolness of tone vibrant oranges and yellows in olive trees with yellow sky and sun evoke fall season novelist warren keith wright visited this painting at minneapolis institute of art over a 15 year period transfixed by painting but unsure why he came to realize that fascination was that painting represented two periods of time late afternoon sun lies due west above mountains shadows though slant from left or southwest where they would fall in autumn not only is painting out of sync with time
