mogilev conference was a september 1941 wehrmacht training event aimed at improving security in rear of army group centre during operation barbarossa german invasion of soviet union event was organised by general max von schenckendorff commander of army group centre rear area in cooperation with officials of security and intelligence services of nazi germany ss and sicherheitsdienst security service sd operating in same area ostensibly an anti partisan training conference event marked an escalation of violence against jews and other civilians in area of schenckendorff s command background thumb wehrmacht propaganda photograph of jewish women in mogilev july 1941 six thousand mogilev jews were murdered by ss forces and units of police regiment centre in october 1941 in june 1941 axis powers launched operation barbarossa invasion of soviet union and by 26 july 1941 mogilev belarus had been occupied by wehrmacht army group centre rear area commanded by general max von schenckendorff established its headquarters there on 7 september but members of einsatzgruppe b had entered city in august and already begun murdering jews a ghetto was later established in september in october 1941 most of inmates had been murdered as part of two operations wehrmacht s aggressive security doctrine and use of security threat to disguise genocidal policies resulted in close cooperation between army and security apparatus behind front lines einsatzgruppe b was key killing unit that operated in territory of army group centre rear area killing thousands of jews communists and soviet pows handed over by army for execution as well as other undesirables such as roma gypsies asiatics and mentally disabled in july einsatzgruppe b commander arthur nebe reported that a solution to jewish problem was impractical in his region of operation due to overwhelming number of jews that is there were too many jews to be killed by too few men by august 1941 nebe came to realize that his resources were insufficient to meet expanded mandate of killing operations due to inclusion of jewish women and children since that month ss cavalry brigade made up of 1st and 2nd ss cavalry regiments also participated in mass murder activities targeting jews in belarus in july and august 1941 unit carried out pripyat swamps punitive operation resulting in murder of over 11 000 jewish civilians operation has since been considered a turning point in transition from selective mass murder to wholesale extermination of jewish population in occupied areas units of police regiment centre had by that time also conducted mass murder of jews in that environment schenckendorff in cooperation with erich von dem bach zelewski higher ss and police leader for army group centre organised a three day conference for security troops held in mogilev meeting aimed to create an exchange of experiences for wehrmacht rear unit commanders police colonel commander of police regiment centre was in charge of planning and logistics conference conference began on 24 september and focused on combatting partisans von partisanen later bandenbekampfung and reflected schenckendorff s views on need for total eradication of resistance to german forces as only way to secure occupied territories minutes of conference if they had been taken did not survive what is known of conference is based on agenda list of attendees after action reports and summary distributed by schenckendorff after event attendees and speakers invited officers were selected on basis of their previous participation in security operations and included representatives of army high command and army group centre audience also included battalion commanders and higher level officers from both ss police and wehrmacht including its security divisions 221st 286th and 403rd in total 61 officers participated with 82 percent of attendees coming from wehrmacht units of attendees 38 percent were battalion and company level commanders many had already participated in mass atrocities for example attendees included commander of 3rd battalion in 354th infantry regiment 286th security division a week prior to conference battalion assisted einsatzkommando 8 and directly participated in murder of 1 000 jews in town of speakers included arthur nebe commander of einsatzgruppe b erich von dem bach zelewski as representative of heinrich himmler max montua commander of police regiment centre hermann fegelein commander of ss cavalry brigade and gustav lombard commander of 1st ss cavalry regiment commander of 2nd ss cavalry regiment was not invited perhaps because he was not viewed as extreme enough on jewish question as he only massacred jewish males and not women and children lectures and sand table sessions presentations covered evaluation of soviet bandit organisations and tactics why it was necessary to kill political commissars immediately upon capture and gaining intelligence from local collaborators bach zelewski s session was entitled capture of and partisans in scouring actions referring to activities of ss cavalry brigade in pripyat swamps punitive operation nebe s talk focused on role of sd in fight against partisans and plunderers he also covered jewish question with particular consideration to anti partisan movement company grade officers gave short classes or led sand table exercises on a variety of tactical situations that could be encountered in field such as securing a village field exercises conference included three field exercises on first day participants observed an operation by police regiment centre that involved surrounding a village and distribution of leaflets on second day participants travelled to village of german in vicinity of mogilev there men of police battalion 322 of police regiment centre conducted a demonstration of how to surround and screen a village according to after action report suspicious strangers ortsfremde or partisans could not be found screening of population revealed 51 jewish civilians 32 of whom were shot by police and sd troops at dawn on last day of conference participants observed another operation conducted by police troops goal was to practically experience combing of town for suspects who were identified as partisans commissars and communists after roundup participants observed interrogations then rejoined their respective units conference summary and aftermath a 16 page executive summary of conference under schenckendorff s signature was distributed to wehrmacht troops and police units in rear area document focused on tactics of security warfare while also prescribing harsh measures such as streets should be kept clear of wanderers who should be handed over to secret field police or sent to filtration camps for further screening many sent to these camps were killed by ss and sd troops summary warned that enemy was employing women children and elderly as agents summary proclaimed that enemy must be completely annihilated while specifying that distinction between a partisan and a suspicious person was not always possible thus giving a carte blanch to troops for most brutal approach possible document was sent to all company level units in army group s area of operations including to units that did not send representatives to conference conference marked a dramatic increase in atrocities by wehrmacht units against jews and other civilians in final three months of 1941 summary had an impact beyond territory under control of army group centre rear area commander of german army field marshal walther von brauchitsch issued guidelines for fighting of partisans in october 1941 one month after conference underlining importance of event closing text of schenckendorff s summary was reproduced verbatim constant decision between life and death for partisans and suspicious persons is difficult even for hardest soldier it must be done he acts correctly who fights ruthlessly and mercilessly with complete disregard for any personal surge of emotion assessment in opinion of historian waitman wade beorn mogilev conference was a key event that in army group center rear area helped incorporate wehrmacht into nazi genocide as part of anti partisan war and jew bolshevik partisan construct since conference wehrmacht rear units were instructed to cooperate fully with sd detachments beyond simply providing logistical support wehrmacht units also assumed direct responsibility for murder of jews in territory under schenckendorff s command jewish civilians were added to an approved list of enemies that army s rear units would then destroy on their own initiative and without participation of ss police or sd although conference summary did not mention jews field exercises demonstrated that wehrmacht was to target jews in its anti partisan actions beorn concludes that verbal instructions to this effect were most likely communicated during sessions given speaker lineup which included experienced mass murderers such as bach zalewski nebe lombard and fegelein anti jewish policy had changed radically month before with addition of women and children to list of targets this strained limited resources of sd and ss organisations in addition german forces had to make room for jews newly deported from elsewhere in occupied europe which was achieved by killing soviet jews already concentrated in ghettos size of territories under german control increased as well which limited activities of these units even further to major population centres conference led to a further conflation of more legitimate anti partisan warfare against irregular fighters with genocide by identifying civilians as enemy combatants euphemistic language helped couch actions wehrmacht reports frequently referred to targets as stranger to village wanderer suspect civilian partisan helper civilian without identification and women soldiers exercises during conference put punitive operations into military context by breaking down actions into something that soldiers could relate to such as surrounding a village guarding and escorting suspects interrogations etc in explaining wehrmacht s willingness to participate in genocide beorn opines that wehrmacht s long history of harsh treatment of civilians paranoia about a not yet existent partisan threat institutional and individual racism and its own criminal actions against red army commissars all predisposed army towards accepting mass murder this was done under guise of anti partisan warfare where jews were targeted as bolsheviks and thus partisan supporters consequently division between holocaust and anti partisan war still prevalent in historiography is a false one beorn concludes that mogilev conference shows that these two were never separate but intentionally connected in an effort to include combat power of wehrmacht more efficiently in hitler s genocidal projects in east references
