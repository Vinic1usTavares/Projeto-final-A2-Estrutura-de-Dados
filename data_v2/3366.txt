it was most likely lloyd lonergan he was an experienced newspaperman employed by new york evening world while writing scripts for thanhouser productions plot was likened by walton of moving picture

later to find his wife has remarried and they have a new child for sake of his wife s happiness he never lets her know that he is alive plot differs because husband willingly fakes his death and returns on day of wedding rather than announce himself he attempts to leave and dies in process his body is removed by prospective husband before marrying her similarity with poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt wedding by revealing fact that he is alive is ensured by john s true death at climax new york dramatic mirror noted that journalists arrived to photograph and cover apparent suicide too quickly making it illogical that fake suicide would not have been revealed film director is unknown but it may have been barry o neil film historian q david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but at least two possible candidates exist blair smith was first cameraman of thanhouser company but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer role of cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions cast credits are unknown but many 1910 thanhouser productions are fragmentary a surviving film still gives possibility of identifying three leading actors release and reception single reel drama approximately 1000 feet long was released on september 13 1910 film had a wide release with theater advertisements known in kansas maryland pennsylvania and indiana some later advertisements for film may have been referring to kalem company s tangled lives released in may 1911 kalem film is extant rare typographical errors also resulted in reliance film company having a film of this name in some advertisements but this is an error on tangled lines film was released in britain on december 22 1910 reviews for film were mostly positive with walton of moving picture news stating it is another variant of enoch arden with a newspaperman interjected resurrected undesirable husband is cleverly eliminated coincidences are too miraculous to suit a plain newspaperman new york dramatic mirror agreed in premise that plot of film had been done before but stated thanhouser people have done it fairly well and added a few details which while not quite logical give it some new interest moving picture world offered a neutral summary of plot but concluded that film is a graphic illustration of conditions which might arise almost any time and develops an interestingly dramatic story as it proceeds one local review of film called it splendid but either by typographical error or for reasons unknown gives a different story of plot and even stating that wife fell to her death by accident when attempting to see her see also list of american films of 1910 notes references category 1910 films
