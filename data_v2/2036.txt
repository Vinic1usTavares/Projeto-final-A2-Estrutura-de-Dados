hand wrote all numbers on mural lowry p 108 co writer howard gordon said of episode alex gansa and i made an effort to play to our own strength which is character we thought this was an interesting place to reiterate mulder s quest for his sister we set out to tell a simple abduction story which was played out behind shadows we wanted to create an air of tension with everything that happened we wanted to explain what it could be at every point everything can be explained was she taken or killed by her boyfriend who she was seeing against her mother s wishes is it twin peaks or an alien abduction that was theme of show edwards p 42 gordon and gansa were afraid that series creator chris carter would not like script but carter liked script and approved episode they wrote hurwitz knowles pp 39 40 gordon praised episode s ending saying i think we re most proud of ending mulder s quest is re established and daniel sackheim directed it beautifully with mulder sitting alone in a church with only his faith story again was fueled by mulder s belief and emotional connection with this case another girl taken from her family and in a way little boy who is conduit who is also perhaps touched by aliens is essentially mulder these little touches fans seem to respond to it was difficult for us but in end satisfying it came out of frustration on our parts and creative uncertainty producer glen morgan felt that episode s writers alex gansa and howard gordon have a better character dramatic sense adding that he believed episode really helped define mulder chris carter felt episode s highlights were ending and realization by scully that mulder may not be a crackpot feeling it was very important to show in establishing its point of view edwards p 43 he also felt that episode proved effective at highlighting that series was told from scully s point of view citing instances of character pulling mulder back from his fringe theories and emotional attachment

phipps writing for a v club reviewed episode positively rating it a b feeling that episode worked well to expand on motivations of two lead characters noting that work done here will pay off well later episode has been seen as laying foundation for recurrence of fox mulder s obsession with finding his missing sister which would come to be one of main plot threads of series bush p 43 duchovny s portrayal of fox mulder in this episode has been cited as an example of character s reversal of traditional gender roles his openness and vulnerability when dealing with similarities between morris
