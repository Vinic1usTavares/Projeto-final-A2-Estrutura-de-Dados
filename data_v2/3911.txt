model was created by richard controversy liberty property trust hoped to get one pennsylvania plaza site designated a keystone opportunity improvement zone koz koz designation was intended to encourage development in poor blighted areas by exempting tenants of building from all state and local taxes designating one pennsylvania plaza a koz was supported by then pennsylvania governor ed rendell who said it was important to keep corporations within city at time many of philadelphia s big employers leases including comcast s were due to expire and employers were considering possibility of moving out of city and state rendell also said allowing comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into one pennsylvania plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to city however other center city building owners including comcast s landlord at centre square hrpt properties trust were opposed to plan they said giving tower koz designation would give it an unfair advantage because liberty property trust could charge above market rents since tax breaks would offset cost for tenants group believed tenants attracted to one pennsylvania plaza because of tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other center city skyscrapers rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under law in early 2004 center city had a vacancy rate of 12 8 both sides of issue hired
