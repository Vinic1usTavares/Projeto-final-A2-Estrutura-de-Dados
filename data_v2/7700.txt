thumb upright preserved dogfish specimen similar to that which would have been used by agassiz and his students parable of sunfish is an anecdote with which ezra pound opens abc of reading a 1934 work of literary criticism pound uses this anecdote to emphasize an empirical approach for learning about art in contrast to relying on commentary rooted in abstraction while parable is based on students recollections of louis agassiz s teaching style pound s retelling diverges from these sources in several respects parable has been used to illustrate benefits of scientific thinking but more recent literary criticism has split on whether parable accurately reflects scientific process and calls into question pound s empirical approach to literature parable thumb upright 50 ezra pound in 1920 text of parable below is excerpted from pound s abc of reading a post graduate student equipped with honors and diplomas went to agassiz to receive final and finishing touches great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it post graduate student that s only a sunfish agassiz i know that write a description of it after a few minutes student returned with description of or whatever term is used to conceal common sunfish from vulgar knowledge family of etc as found in textbooks of subject agassiz again told student to describe fish student produced a four page essay agassiz then told him to look at fish at end of three weeks fish was in an advanced state of decomposition but student knew something about it context abc of reading pound opens abc of reading with following pronouncement proper method for studying poetry and good letters is method of contemporary biologists that is careful first hand examination of matter and continual comparison of one slide or specimen with another no man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood anecdote of agassiz and sunfish thumb upright louis agassiz in parable a graduate student is sent to noted biologist louis agassiz to complete his education and agassiz asks student three times to describe a sunfish specimen student replies with in turn common name of fish a brief summary of species and a four page essay on species agassiz finally tells student to look at fish and a t end of three weeks fish was in an advanced state of decomposition but student knew something about it text of parable itself spans 131 words over sixteen lines and is often reproduced in full when cited pound contrasts this empiricism against knowledge gained through increasingly abstract definitions as an example pound relates what might happen if a european is asked to define red after initial response that red is a color pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration with vibration then defined in terms of energy and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power returning to empiricism pound reminds reader that progress of science increased rapidly once bacon had suggested direct examination of phenomena and after galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much and had begun really to look at them pound provides several other examples of same contrasting ideas throughout first chapter ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry chinese writing and stravinsky at end of chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge literary essays pound subsequently refers to parable in two essays teacher s mission and mr housman at little bethel both were republished in literary essays of ezra pound and reference agassiz without including details of parable teacher s mission in particular provides a straightforward explanation of how pound wished parable to be interpreted mr housman at little bethel in january 1934 pound published a critique of a e housman s name and nature of poetry in criterion as part of critique pound offers an emendation to housman s claim that intelligence of eighteenth century involved some repressing and silencing of poetry pound replies that root cause was tendency towards abstract statements which came about in part because eighteenth century authors hadn t heard about professor agassiz s fish teacher s mission also in 1934 pound published an essay critiquing existing methods for teaching literature in general and university level instruction methods in particular he identifies root of problem as abstraction and uses word liberty as an example of a term where a specific concrete meaning has been lost pound finds this situation inexcusable after era of agassiz and fish and demands an approach to general education that parallels biological study based on examination and comparison of particular specimens sources louis agassiz was a swiss born scientist at harvard university who by 1896 had established a reputation for lock ing a student up in a room full of turtle shells or lobster shells or oyster shells without a book or a word to help him and not let ting him out till he had discovered all truths which objects contained several students of agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage including henry blake david starr jordan addison emery verrill and burt green wilder american literary critic robert scholes traces parable s source to two narratives in particular those of former students nathaniel southgate shaler and samuel hubbard scudder their anecdotes were reprinted in lane cooper s louis agassiz as a teacher illustrative extracts on his method of instruction their separate accounts differ markedly from pound s both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources shaler s autobiography thumb right upright nathaniel southgate shaler nathaniel shaler left his humanist studies and joined agassiz s lab at harvard university having already read agassiz s introductory essay on classification his autobiography details his initial interactions with agassiz with regard to his first assignment shaler recorded that agassiz brought him a small fish to study with stipulation that shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on topic until agassiz had given him permission when shaler asked agassiz for more explicit instructions agassiz replied that he could not be more explicit than saying f ind out what you can without damaging specimen after first hours shaler thought he had compassed that fish but despite agassiz always being within call he was not asked to present his conclusions during course of following week shaler recorded details of how scales went in series their shape form and placement of teeth etc at length on seventh day came question well and my disgorge of learning to him as he sat on edge of my table puffing his cigar at end of hour s telling he swung off and away saying that is not right shaler concluded agassiz was testing him to see if he was capable of doing hard continuous work without support of a teacher and redoubled his efforts starting from scratch and over course of seven ten hour days managed to describe specimen to agassiz s satisfaction scudder s look at your fish thumb right upright samuel hubbard scudder samuel hubbard scudder recorded a similar experience first published in 1874 as look at your fish in every saturday magazine agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs student to look at it and promises by and by i will ask what you have seen as opposed to pound s decomposing sunfish scudder s account emphasizes care taken to keep specimen in good condition i was to keep fish before me in a tin tray and occasionally moisten surface with alcohol from jar in ten minutes i had seen all that could be seen in that fish and started in search of professor who had however left museum and when i returned after lingering over some of odd animals stored in upper apartment my specimen was dry all over i dashed fluid over fish as if to resuscitate beast from a fainting fit and looked with anxiety for a return of normal sloppy appearance this little excitement over nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion scudder provides additional detail that instruments of all kinds were interdicted including any magnifying glass after several hours agassiz asks for a report and scudder describes fringed gill arches and moveable operculum pores of head fleshy lips and lidless eyes lateral line spinous fins and forked tail compressed and arched body disappointed agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe most conspicuous features of animal and commands him to look again look again mortified scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen and is able to report to agassiz following morning that fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs which was observation agassiz was looking for however when scudder then asked what he should do next agassiz replied oh look at your fish which scudder did for another two full days cooper s louis agassiz as a teacher in 1917 english professor lane cooper from cornell university published a collection of reminiscences of agassiz book included notes from several notable contributors including scudder and cooper william james professor addison emery verrill agassiz s plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books and professor edward s morse who wrote that agassiz s method was simply to let student study intimately one object at a time cooper prefigures pound s interest by remarking on close though not obvious relation between investigation in biology or zoology and observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art concluding that we study a poem work of man s art in same way that agassiz made shaler study a fish critic robert scholes concludes that pound had access to this book and used material within it as source for parable that opens abc of reading interpretation and criticism agassiz science historian mary p winsor provides extensive commentary on agassiz s initial assignments for his students solution to riddle as she calls it lies in a similar anecdote given by agassiz in his essay on classification suppose that innumerable articulated animals which are counted by tens of thousands nay perhaps by hundreds of thousands had never made their appearance upon surface of globe with one single exception that for instance our lobster homarus americanus were only representative of that extraordinarily diversified type how should we introduce that species of animals in our systems agassiz provides several potential solutions species of lobster could have a single genus by side of all other classes with their orders families etc or a family with one genus and one species or a class with one order and one genus etc agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive entirety of hierarchy at time this would have been a distinct genus a distinct family a distinct class a distinct branch point of sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals species and genus but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up taxonomic hierarchy scudder s observation that finally satisfies agassiz is that sunfish has bilateral paired organs a characteristic that winsor notes is common to all vertebrates pound pound echoing cooper opens abc of reading by stating that correct method for study of poetry is method of contemporary biologists and that no man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood anecdote of agassiz and fish commentators have summarized pound s position with term empiricism but have divided over whether parable endorses or indicts idea simplest interpretations in scientific writing history of science and literary criticism take parable at face value accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques for example when writing about stellar atmospheres dimitri states that it is specimens not facts that are ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory before beginning a discussion of pound s sunfish moving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations christopher tilley emphasizes in his comments on scientific archeology that pound s student was not simply learning about reality sunfish but a way of approaching that reality a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition empiricism robert scholes reaches a similar conclusion noting that student seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse controlled by a particular scientific paradigm author bob perelman takes suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 trouble with genius reading pound joyce stein and zukofsky perelman discusses parable as one of two anecdotes in abc of reading that frame pound s discussion of chinese ideograms former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts one of debussy and another of ravel pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about composers than someone who has only read all of criticisms that have ever been written of both perelman considers contradiction between everyone and knowledge to be key to pound s thinking only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend truth whether by attending concert or observing specimen rest can only make do with a fog of cliches received ideas second hand and second rate opinions written darkness with regard to parable perelman observes lack of scientific institutions pedagogic procedures or communicable terminologies where any mediating written descriptions sunfish only serve to obscure knowledge knowledge ultimately resides within agassiz rather than world and w hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism two critics have also commented on parable s implications in describing nature of knowledge in terms of decay of pound s fish celeste goodridge notes that marianne moore s 1934 review of pound s cantos uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe conversations therein in goodridge s opinion moore s microscopic examination both undercuts work as well as pays homage in its precision to pound s reverence for applicability of scientific method to literary criticism goodridge then reproduces parable in full and comments agassiz teaches pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole knowledge of fish cannot begin until decay has commenced reducing specimen to its constituent parts peter nicholas baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion he begins discussion of parable by first quoting pound on topic of genius genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold it is not necessary that he bring up his knowledge into mint of consciousness stamp it either into coin of conscientiously analyzed form detail knowledge or into paper money of words before he transmit it baker finds most striking feature of parable to be absence of description of fish baker asks do readers of this anecdote learn about fish or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice baker claims that pound s images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and scientific method reader following pound s student reaches knowledge through intuition alone decomposing fish so far as epistemology is concerned has become transparent notes references category works by ezra pound category literary theory category philosophy of
