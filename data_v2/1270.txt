broadcast reviews den of geek viewed episode positively observing that in contrast to previous installment ability progresses main plot arc in a substantial way i m now really interested to see what happens next whereas last week i wasn t that bothered ign s ramsey isler was a little more critical and rated episode 7 8 10 he noted that though ending with walter was as good as you could ask for and enjoyed david robert jones as a villain episode had a number of rough patches as middle was paced slowly and lacking in suspense peter s was again reduced to that guy with connections and audience was once again subjected to torture that is sanford harris after describing olivia peter scene near end as tense and cleverly written isler concluded his review by noting references to x files and hoping jones would appear again soon noel murray from a v club graded episode an a explaining he thought it must have been satisfying for those viewers tired of monster of week storylines murray also enjoyed two twists that olivia had to shut off lights for real and that walter discovers he wrote zft manual at end jane boursaw of aol tv previously tv squad opined that it was a really great episode that s probably worth another viewing to pick up more clues while los angeles times andrew hanson thought it managed to have a couple good twists to it annalee newitz of io9 praised ability remarking that overall this was a terrific episode and a great way to go into a show hiatus we got a lot of payoff when we discovered why olivia was being stalked by zft weirdos and we learned more about pattern than we had in a really long time references works cited external links ability at fox category 2009 american television episodes category fringe season 1 episodes
