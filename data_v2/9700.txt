commote date of construction of church is uncertain but it is a medieval building probably from 15th century 19th century clergyman and antiquarian harry longueville jones thought that church was

sacked by normans in 1157 st mary s was formerly one of chapels of ease to st nidan s llanidan along with st deiniol s llanddaniel fab and st edwen s llanedwen st nidan s and its chapels were owned by augustinian priory at beddgelert gwynedd date of transfer is uncertain since not all records have survived but st nidan s is mentioned as belonging to priory in a charter of 1360 carr has written that we shall never know how distant community in beddgelert came to possess four anglesey churches but thought that it might be significant that priory also controlled two churches on mainland on other
