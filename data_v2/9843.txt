thumb upright 2 cumuliform cloudscape over swifts creek australia alt in meteorology a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets frozen crystals or other particles suspended in atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space water or various other chemicals may compose droplets and crystals on earth clouds are formed as a result of saturation of air when it is cooled to its dew point or when it gains sufficient moisture usually in form of water vapor from an adjacent source to raise dew point to ambient temperature they are seen in earth s homosphere which includes troposphere stratosphere and mesosphere is science of clouds which is undertaken in cloud physics branch of meteorology two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of atmosphere are latin and common cloud types in troposphere atmospheric layer closest to earth s surface have latin names due to universal adoption of luke howard s nomenclature formally proposed in 1802 it became basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms that appear in any or all of three altitude levels formerly known as etages these physical types in approximate ascending order of convective activity include stratiform sheets cirriform wisps and patches stratocumuliform layers mainly structured as rolls ripples and patches cumuliform heaps and very large cumulonimbiform heaps that often show complex structures physical forms are divided by altitude level into 10 basic genus types latin names for applicable high level genera in troposphere carry a cirro prefix and an alto prefix is added to names of mid level genus types clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as low or mid level according to altitude range at which each initially forms however they are also more informally classified as multi level or vertical which along with low level clouds do not carry any altitude related prefixes most of genera can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties very low stratiform clouds that extend down to earth s surface are given common names fog and mist but have no latin names several clouds that form higher up in stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types they are seen infrequently mostly in polar regions of earth clouds have been observed in atmospheres of other planets and moons in solar system and beyond however due to their different temperature characteristics they are often composed of other substances such as methane ammonia and sulfuric acid as well as water tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope it draws from several methods of cloud classification both formal and informal used in different levels of earth s homosphere by a number of cited authorities a cross of form and level is used to derive 10 tropospheric genera fog and mist that forms at surface level and several additional major types above troposphere cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure this table should therefore not be seen as a strict or singular classification but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from earth s surface to edge of space forms and levels stratiform non

etymology and history of cloud science and nomenclature etymology origin of term cloud can be found in old english words or clod meaning a hill or a mass of rock around beginning of 13th century word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds because of similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud over time metaphoric usage of word supplanted old english which had been literal term for clouds in general aristotle ancient cloud studies were not made in isolation but were observed in combination with other weather elements and even other natural sciences around 340 bc greek philosopher aristotle wrote meteorologica a work which represented sum of knowledge of time about natural science including weather and climate for first time precipitation and clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors which originate from greek word meaning high in sky from that word came modern term meteorology study of clouds and weather meteorologica was based on intuition and simple observation but not on what is now considered scientific method nevertheless it was first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way first comprehensive classification thumb cirrus fibratus clouds in march after centuries of speculative theories about formation and behavior of clouds first truly scientific studies were undertaken by luke howard in england and jean baptiste lamarck in france howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in latin language and used his background to classify various tropospheric cloud types during 1802 he believed that changing cloud forms in sky could unlock key to weather forecasting lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of france because it used unusual french names for cloud types his system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds with such names as translated from french hazy clouds dappled clouds and broom like clouds by contrast howard used universally accepted latin which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803 as a sign of popularity of naming scheme german dramatist and poet johann wolfgang von goethe composed four poems about clouds dedicating them to howard an elaboration of howard s system was eventually formally adopted by international meteorological conference in 1891 this system covered only tropospheric cloud types but discovery of clouds above troposphere during late 19th century eventually led to creation of separate classification schemes for these very high clouds formation in homosphere how air becomes saturated thumb cumulus clouds in may terrestrial clouds can be found throughout most of homosphere which includes troposphere stratosphere and mesosphere within these layers of atmosphere air can become saturated as a result of being cooled to its dew point or by having moisture added from an adjacent source in latter case saturation occurs when dew point is raised to ambient air temperature thumb low stratus fractus partly obscuring deep multi level nimbostratus over deccan plateau india adiabatic cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents cyclonic frontal convective or orographic cause a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point temperature at which air becomes saturated main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling as air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops this condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of air frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless approaching warm airmass is unstable in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds are usually embedded in main precipitating cloud layer cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform cumuliform or cumulonimbiform depending on stability of warm airmass just ahead of front thumb 300px animation of cloud evolution from cumulus humilis to cumulonimbus capillatus incus another agent is convective upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface level airmass instability allows for formation of cumuliform clouds that can produce showers if air is sufficiently moist on moderately rare occasions convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate tropopause and push cloud top into stratosphere a third source of lift is wind circulation forcing air over a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift if air is generally stable nothing more than lenticular cap clouds form however if air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable orographic showers or thunderstorms may appear m 2006 cloud formation processes chapter 8 in fundamentals of physical geography 2nd ed thumb windy evening twilight enhanced by sun s angle can visually mimic a tornado resulting from orographic lift non adiabatic cooling along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent three major mechanisms exist for lowering temperature of air to its dew point conductive radiational and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in formation of fog ackerman p 109 adding moisture to air several main sources of water vapor can be added to air as a way of achieving saturation without any cooling process water or moist ground precipitation or virga and transpiration from plants classification how clouds are identified in troposphere tropospheric classification is based on a hierarchy of categories with physical forms and altitude levels at top these are cross classified into a total of ten genus types most of which can be divided into species and further subdivided into varieties which are at bottom of hierarchy physical forms clouds in troposphere assume five physical forms based on structure and process of formation these forms are commonly used for purpose of satellite analysis they are given below in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity stratiform nonconvective stratiform clouds appear in stable airmass conditions and in general have flat sheet like structures that can form at any altitude in troposphere stratiform group is divided by altitude range into genera cirrostratus high level altostratus mid level stratus low level and nimbostratus multi level fog is commonly considered a surface based cloud layer fog may form at surface level in clear air or it may be result of a very low stratus cloud subsiding to ground or sea level conversely low stratiform clouds result when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions cirriform cirriform clouds in troposphere are of genus cirrus and have appearance of detached or filaments they form at high tropospheric altitudes in air that is mostly stable with little or no convective activity although denser patches may occasionally show buildups caused by limited high level convection where air is partly unstable clouds resembling cirrus can be found above troposphere but are classified separately using common names stratocumuliform clouds of this structure have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics in form of rolls ripples or elements they generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer if inversion layer is absent or higher in troposphere increased airmass instability may cause cloud layers to develop tops in form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus high level altocumulus mid level and stratocumulus low level cumuliform thumb clouds reflecting in a puddle sutton on trent england thumb cumulus cloud at west bengal cumuliform clouds generally appear in isolated heaps or tufts they are product of localized but generally free convective lift where no inversion layers are in troposphere to limit vertical growth in general small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability larger cumuliform types are a sign of greater atmospheric instability and convective activity depending on their vertical size clouds of cumulus genus type may be low level or multi level with moderate to towering vertical extent cumulonimbiform largest free convective clouds comprise genus cumulonimbus which have towering vertical extent they occur in highly unstable air and often have fuzzy outlines at upper parts of clouds that sometimes include anvil tops these clouds are product of very strong convection that can penetrate lower stratosphere levels and genera thumb 300px tropospheric cloud classification by altitude of occurrence multi level and vertical genus types not limited to a single altitude level include nimbostratus cumulonimbus and some of larger cumulus species alt g tropospheric clouds form in any of three levels formerly called etages based on altitude range above earth s surface grouping of clouds into levels is commonly done for purposes of cloud atlases surface weather observations and weather maps jetstream 2008 how to read weather maps national weather service retrieved on 16 may 2007 base height range for each level varies depending on latitudinal geographical zone each altitude level comprises two or three genus types differentiated mainly by physical form standard levels and genus types are summarised below in approximate descending order of altitude at which each is normally based multi level clouds with significant vertical extent are separately listed and summarized in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity high level thumb high cirrus uncinus and cirrus fibratus see also species and varieties section upper left merging into cirrostratus fibratus with some higher cirrocumulus floccus upper right high clouds form at altitudes of in polar regions in temperate regions and in tropics all cirriform clouds are classified as high thus constitute a single genus cirrus ci stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in high altitude range carry prefix cirro yielding respective genus names cirrocumulus cc and cirrostratus cs when limited resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations distinguishing between individual forms or genus types becomes impossible and they are then collectively identified as high type or informally as cirrus type though not all high clouds are of cirrus form or genus genus cirrus ci these are mostly fibrous wisps of delicate white cirriform ice crystal clouds that show up clearly against blue sky cirrus are generally non convective except castellanus and floccus subtypes which show limited convection they often form along a high altitude jetstream and at very leading edge of a frontal or low pressure disturbance where they may merge into cirrostratus this high level cloud genus does not produce precipitation genus cirrocumulus cc thumb right alt a a large field of cirrocumulus clouds in a blue sky beginning to merge near upper left a large field of cirrocumulus stratiformis this is a pure white high stratocumuliform layer of limited convection it is composed of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets appearing as small unshaded round masses or flakes in groups or lines with ripples like sand on a beach cirrocumulus occasionally forms alongside cirrus and may be accompanied or replaced by cirrostratus clouds near leading edge of an active weather system this genus type occasionally produces virga precipitation that evaporates below base of cloud genus cirrostratus cs cirrostratus is a thin nonconvective stratiform ice crystal veil that typically gives rise to halos caused by refraction of sun s rays sun and moon are visible in clear outline cirrostratus does not produce but often thickens into altostratus ahead of a warm front or low pressure area which sometimes does mid level thumb sunrise scene giving a shine to an altocumulus stratiformis perlucidus cloud see also species and varieties clouds in middle level are prefixed by alto yielding genus names altocumulus ac for stratocumuliform types and altostratus as for stratiform types these clouds can form as low as above surface at any latitude but may be based as high as near poles at and in tropics as with high clouds main genus types are easily identified by human eye but distinguishing between them using satellite photography is not possible without support of human observations these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle type on satellite images genus altocumulus ac this is a midlevel cloud layer of limited convection that is usually appears in form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranged in groups lines or waves altocumulus may occasionally resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of a mix of water droplets and ice crystals so bases show at least some light grey shading altocumulus can produce virga very light precipitation that evaporates before reaching ground genus altostratus as thumb altostratus translucidus near top of photo merging into altostratus opacus near bottom altostratus is a midlevel opaque or translucent nonconvective veil of grey blue grey cloud that often forms along warm fronts and around low pressure areas altostratus is usually composed of water droplets but may be mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation low level low clouds are found from near surface up to genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one that refers to a characteristic other than altitude clouds that form in low level of troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in middle and high levels so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using satellite photography alone thumb stratocumulus stratiformis perlucidus over galapagos tortuga bay see also species and varieties genus stratocumulus sc this genus type is a stratocumuliform cloud layer of limited convection usually in form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets similar to altocumulus but having larger elements with deeper gray shading stratocumulus is often present during wet weather originating from other rain clouds but can only produce very light precipitation on its own genus cumulus cu species humilis little vertical extent these are small detached fair weather cumuliform clouds that have nearly horizontal bases and flattened tops and do not produce rain showers genus stratus st thumb right upright stratus nebulosus translucidus this is a flat or sometimes ragged nonconvective stratiform type that sometimes resembles elevated fog only very weak precipitation can fall from this cloud usually drizzle or snow grains when a very low stratus cloud subsides to surface level it loses its latin terminology and is given common name fog if prevailing surface visibility is less than 1 km if visibility is 1 km or higher visible condensation is termed mist multi level or vertical low to mid level cloud base thumb left deep multi level nimbostratus cloud covering sky with a scattered layer of low stratus fractus pannus see also species and supplementary features sections these clouds have low to mid level bases that form anywhere from near surface to about and tops that can extend into high altitude range nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent but without towering structure however with sufficient airmass instability upward growing cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group international civil aviation organization icao distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub group it is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations and forecasts to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence multi level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera and even species in case of cumulus congestus using satellite photography moderate or deep vertical thumb cumulus humilis and cumulus mediocris with stratocumulus stratiformis perlucidus in foreground see also species and varieties genus nimbostratus ns this is a diffuse dark grey multi level stratiform layer with great horizontal extent deep vertical development it lacks towering structure and looks feebly illuminated from inside nimbostratus normally forms from mid level altostratus and develops deep vertical extent when base subsides into low level during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity it achieves even greater vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area especially ahead of a warm front ackerman p 118 this thick cloud layer may be accompanied by embedded towering cumuliform or cumulonimbiform types meteorologists affiliated with world meteorological organization wmo officially classify nimbostratus as mid level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi level independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow wmo model and those who classify nimbostratus as low level despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in middle altitude range genus cumulus cu species mediocris moderate vertical extent these cumuliform clouds of free convection have clear cut medium grey flat bases and white domed tops in form of small and generally do not produce precipitation they usually form in low level of troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity when clouds bases can rise into middle altitude range cumulus mediocris is officially classified as low level and more informally characterized as having moderate vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level towering vertical thumb upright towering vertical cumulus congestus embedded within a layer of cumulus mediocris higher layer of stratocumulus stratiformis perlucidus 500px thumb progressive evolution of a single cell thunderstorm these clouds are sometimes classified separately from other vertical or multi level types because of their ability to produce severe turbulence genus cumulus cu species congestus great vertical extent increasing airmass instability can cause free convective cumulus to grow very tall to extent that vertical height from base to top is greater than base width of cloud cloud base takes on a darker grey coloration and top commonly resembles a cauliflower this cloud type can produce moderate to heavy showers and is designated towering cumulus tcu by icao genus cumulonimbus cb thumb left isolated cumulonimbus cloud over mojave desert releasing a heavy shower this genus type is a heavy towering cumulonimbiform mass of free convective cloud with a dark grey to nearly black base and a very high top in form of a mountain or huge tower cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms local very heavy downpours of rain that may cause flash floods and a variety of types of lightning including cloud to ground that can cause wildfires other convective severe weather may or may not be associated with thunderstorms and include heavy snow showers hail strong wind shear downbursts fujita ted 1985 downburst microburst and macroburst smrp research paper 210 and tornadoes of all these possible cumulonimbus related events lightning is only one of these that requires a thunderstorm to be taking place since it is lightning that creates thunder cumulonimbus clouds can form in unstable airmass conditions but tend to be more concentrated and intense when they are associated with unstable cold fronts species and varieties thumb altocumulus lenticularis forming over mountains in wyoming with lower layer of cumulus mediocris and higher layer of cirrus spissatus genus types are commonly divided into subtypes called species that indicate specific structural details which can vary according to stability and characteristics of atmosphere at any given time and location despite this hierarchy a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus especially if genera are of same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level there are a few species each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical form species types are grouped below according to physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated forms genera and species are listed in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity genus and species types are further subdivided into varieties whose names can appear after species name to provide a fuller description of a cloud some cloud varieties are not restricted to a specific altitude level or form and can therefore be common to more than one genus or species species stable or mostly stable of stratiform group high level cirrostratus comprises two species cirrostratus nebulosus has a rather diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi merged filaments that are transitional to or from cirrus mid level altostratus and multi level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species low stratus is of species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus see below cirriform clouds have three non convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions cirrus fibratus comprise filaments that may be straight wavy or occasionally twisted by non convective wind shear species uncinus is similar but has upturned hooks at ends cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading stratocumuliform genus types cirrocumulus altocumulus and stratocumulus that appear in mostly stable air have two species each stratiformis species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity clouds of lenticularis species tend to have lens like shapes tapered at ends they are most commonly seen as orographic mountain wave clouds but can occur anywhere in troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure these two species can be found in high middle or low levels of troposphere depending on stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time ragged species fractus shows variable instability because it can be a subdivision of genus types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics this subtype can be in form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets stratus fractus or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability cumulus fractus when clouds of this species are associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent they are also classified as accessory clouds under name pannus see section on supplementary features partly unstable these species are subdivisions of genus types that can occur in partly unstable air species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability usually in morning or afternoon this results in formation of cumuliform buildups of limited convection arising from a common stratiform base castellanus resembles turrets of a castle when viewed from side and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited convective patches of high level cirrus tufted clouds of more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure they are sometimes seen with cirrus cirrocumulus altocumulus and stratocumulus a newly recognized species of stratocumulus or altocumulus has been given name volutus a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation there are some volutus clouds that form as a consequence of interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud perhaps strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is morning glory a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over gulf of carpentaria in northern australia associated with a powerful ripple in atmosphere cloud may be surfed in glider aircraft unstable or mostly unstable more general airmass instability in troposphere tends to produce clouds of more freely convective cumulus genus type whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of clouds a cumulus cloud initially forms in low level of troposphere as a of species humilis that shows only slight vertical development if air becomes more unstable cloud tends to grow vertically into species mediocris then congestus tallest cumulus species which is same type that international civil aviation organization refers to as towering cumulus with highly unstable atmospheric conditions large cumulus may continue to grow into cumulonimbus calvus essentially a very tall congestus cloud that produces thunder then ultimately into species capillatus when supercooled water droplets at top of cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance varieties opacity based thumb left a layer of stratocumulus stratiformis perlucidus hiding setting sun with a background layer of stratocumulus cumulogenitus resembling distant mountains all cloud varieties fall into one of two main groups one group identifies opacities of particular low and mid level cloud structures and comprises varieties translucidus thin translucent perlucidus thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks and opacus thick opaque these varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity all three are associated with stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus however only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent formation of a perlucidus variety opacity based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent or in case of cirrus spissatus always opaque pattern based thumb left cirrus fibratus radiatus over eso s la silla observatory a second group describes occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface based observer cloud fields usually being visible only from a significant altitude above formations these varieties are not always present with genera and species with which they are otherwise associated but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation intortus and varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus they are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns usually by uneven wind currents that favor formation of these varieties variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at horizon it is sometimes seen with fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus and with genus altostratus thumbnail upright altocumulus stratiformis duplicatus at sunrise in california mojave desert usa higher layer orange to white lower layer grey another variety duplicatus closely spaced layers of same type one above other is sometimes found with cirrus of both fibratus and uncinus species and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of species stratiformis and lenticularis variety undulatus having a wavy undulating base can occur with any clouds of species stratiformis or lenticularis and with altostratus it is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes in form of a honeycomb or net it is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of species stratiformis castellanus and floccus and with stratocumulus of species stratiformis and castellanus combinations it is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time especially if one variety is opacity based and other is pattern based an example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus which would identify respectively its genus species and two combined varieties accessory clouds supplementary features and other derivative types supplementary features and accessory clouds are not further subdivisions of cloud types below species and variety level rather they are either hydrometeors or special cloud types with their own latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera species and varieties supplementary features whether in form of clouds or precipitation are directly attached to main genus cloud accessory clouds by contrast are generally detached from main cloud precipitation based supplementary features one group of supplementary features are not actual cloud formations but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals that make up visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching ground these being of genera cirrocumulus altocumulus altostratus nimbostratus stratocumulus cumulus and cumulonimbus when precipitation reaches ground without completely evaporating it is designated as feature praecipitatio this normally occurs with altostratus opacus which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development of latter upward growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier more extensive precipitation towering vertical clouds have greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast moving cold fronts showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds cumulonimbus largest of all cloud genera has capacity to produce very heavy showers low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation but this always occurs as feature praecipitatio due to fact this cloud genus lies too close to ground to allow for formation of virga cloud based supplementary features incus is most type specific supplementary feature seen only with cumulonimbus of species capillatus a cumulonimbus incus cloud top is one that has spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting stability layer at tropopause where air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude mamma feature forms on bases of clouds as downward facing bubble like protuberances caused by localized downdrafts within cloud it is also sometimes called mammatus an earlier version of term used before a standardization of latin nomenclature brought about by world meteorological organization during 20th century best known is cumulonimbus with mammatus but mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus cirrocumulus altocumulus altostratus and stratocumulus a tuba feature is a cloud column that may hang from bottom of a cumulus or cumulonimbus a newly formed or poorly organized column might be comparatively benign but can quickly intensify into a funnel cloud or tornado an arcus feature is a roll cloud with ragged edges attached to lower front part of cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that forms along leading edge of a squall line or thunderstorm outflow a large arcus formation can have appearance of a dark menacing arch several new supplementary features have been formally recognized by world meteorological organization wmo feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear when a stratocumulus altocumulus or cirrus cloud breaks into regularly spaced crests this variant is sometimes known informally as a kelvin helmholtz wave cloud this phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets and even in sun s atmosphere another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave like cloud feature associated with stratocumulus or altocumulus cloud has been given latin name supplementary feature is a circular fall streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude this type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes a murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering rotating cloud base than can lead to development of tornadoes a cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from murus cloud and is result of air feeding into storm accessory clouds supplementary cloud formations detached from main cloud are known as accessory clouds heavier precipitating clouds nimbostratus towering cumulus cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus typically see formation in precipitation of pannus feature low ragged clouds of genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus a group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud whereas a feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around middle or in front of parent cloud an accessory cloud recently officially recognized world meteorological organization is flumen also known more informally as beaver s tail it is formed by warm humid inflow of a super cell thunderstorm and can be mistaken for a tornado although flumen can indicate a tornado risk it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not rotate mother clouds left thumb cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over port of piraeus in greece clouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content if these characteristics change over time genus tends to change accordingly when this happens original genus is called a mother cloud if mother cloud retains much of its original form after appearance of new genus it is termed a genitus cloud one example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus a stratocumulus cloud formed by partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift if mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus it is considered to be a mutatus cloud thumb cumulonimbus mother cloud dissipating into stratocumulus at dusk other genitus and mutatus clouds genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre existing clouds term latin for fire made applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions smaller low level pyrocumulus or clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus latin for man made contrails formed from exhaust of aircraft flying in upper level of troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus homogenitus if a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of high level genera they are termed cirrus cirrostratus or cirrocumulus stratus latin for cataract made are generated by spray from waterfalls latin for forest made is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to air above a forest canopy stratocumulus fields stratocumulus clouds can be organized into fields that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics in general these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level they can often be found in following forms which resembles a leaf or a spoked wheel closed cell which is cloudy in center and clear on edges similar to a filled honeycomb open cell which resembles an empty honeycomb with clouds around edges and clear open space in middle vortex streets thumb cirrus fibratus intortus formed into a karman vortex street at

latitude it is most prevalent in and along low pressure zones of surface tropospheric convergence which encircle earth close to equator and near 50th parallels of latitude in northern and southern hemispheres adiabatic cooling processes that lead to creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence a process that involves horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location as well as rate at which this happens near equator increased cloudiness is due to presence of low pressure intertropical convergence zone itcz where very warm and unstable air promotes mostly cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds clouds of virtually any type can form along mid latitude convergence zones depending on stability and moisture content of air these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin this leads to formation of weather making extratropical cyclones composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to stability characteristics of various that are in conflict divergence along high pressure zones divergence is opposite of convergence in earth s troposphere it involves horizontal outflow of air from upper part of a rising column of air or from lower part of a subsiding column often associated with an area or ridge of high pressure cloudiness tends to be least prevalent near poles and in subtropics close to 30th parallels north and south latter are sometimes referred to as horse latitudes presence of a large scale high pressure subtropical ridge on each side of equator reduces cloudiness at these low latitudes similar patterns also occur at higher latitudes in both hemispheres luminance reflectivity and coloration luminance or brightness of a cloud is determined by how light is reflected scattered and transmitted by cloud s particles its brightness may also be affected by presence of haze or such as halos and rainbows in troposphere dense deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance 70 to 95 throughout visible spectrum tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into cloud before it is reflected out giving a cloud its characteristic white color especially when viewed from top increasing cloud reflectivity royal geographical society 2010 cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently so that intensity of solar radiation decreases with depth into gases as a result cloud base can vary from a very light to very dark grey depending on cloud s thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to observer high thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off white appearance however a thick dense ice crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity as a tropospheric cloud matures dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets if droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by air circulation they will fall from cloud as rain by this process of accumulation space between droplets becomes increasingly larger permitting light to penetrate farther into cloud if cloud is sufficiently large and droplets within are spaced far enough apart a percentage of light that enters cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving cloud a darker look a simple example of this is one s being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog this process of reflection absorption is what causes range of cloud color from white to black striking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude with color of a cloud usually being same as incident light during daytime when sun is relatively high in sky tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired color of their environment or background red orange and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise sunset and are result of scattering of sunlight by atmosphere when sun is just below horizon low level clouds are gray middle clouds appear rose colored and high clouds are white or off white clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky or whitish when illuminated by moon they may also reflect colors of large fires city lights or auroras that might be present a cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives cloud a blue color a green colorization occurs mostly late in day when sun is comparatively low in sky and incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm it only confirms its potential since a green blue tint signifies copious amounts of water a strong updraft to support it high winds from storm raining out and wet hail all elements that improve chance for it to become severe can all be inferred from this in addition stronger updraft is more likely storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds yellowish clouds may be seen in troposphere in late spring through early fall months during forest fire season yellow color is due to presence of pollutants in smoke yellowish clouds are caused by presence of nitrogen dioxide and are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels effects on troposphere climate and climate change tropospheric clouds exert numerous influences on earth s troposphere and climate first and foremost they are source of precipitation thereby greatly influencing distribution and amount of precipitation because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud free air clouds can be associated with vertical motions of air that may be convective frontal or cyclonic motion is upward if clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat warming air and thereby decreasing its density this can lead to downward motion because lifting of air results in cooling that increases its density all of these effects are subtly dependent on vertical temperature and moisture structure of atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect earth s climate complexity and diversity of clouds in troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying effects of clouds on climate and climate change on one hand white cloud tops promote cooling of earth s surface by reflecting shortwave radiation visible and near infrared from sun diminishing amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at surface enhancing earth s albedo most of sunlight that reaches ground is absorbed warming surface which emits radiation upward at longer infrared wavelengths at these wavelengths however water in clouds acts as an efficient absorber water reacts by radiating also in infrared both upward and downward and downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at surface this is analogous to greenhouse effect of greenhouse gases and water vapor high level genus types particularly show this duality with both short wave albedo cooling and long wave greenhouse warming effects on whole ice crystal clouds in upper troposphere cirrus tend to favor net warming however cooling effect is dominant with mid level and low clouds especially when they form in extensive sheets measurements by nasa indicate that on whole effects of low and mid level clouds that tend to promote cooling outweigh warming effects of high layers and variable outcomes associated with vertically developed clouds ackerman p 124 as difficult as it is to evaluate influences of current clouds on current climate it is even more problematic to predict changes in cloud patterns and properties in a future warmer climate and resultant cloud influences on future climate in a warmer climate more water would enter atmosphere by evaporation at surface as clouds are formed from water vapor cloudiness would be expected to increase but in a warmer climate higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds both of these statements are considered accurate and both phenomena known as cloud feedbacks are found in climate model calculations broadly speaking if clouds especially low clouds increase in a warmer climate resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases but if low clouds decrease or if high clouds increase feedback is positive differing amounts of these feedbacks are principal reason for differences in climate sensitivities of current global climate models as a consequence much research has focused on response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate leading global models produce quite different results however with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases for these reasons role of tropospheric clouds in regulating weather and climate remains a leading source of uncertainty in global warming projections randall d et al 2007 climate models and

stratospheric clouds psc s form in lowest part of stratosphere during winter at altitude and during season that produces coldest temperatures and therefore best chances of triggering condensation caused by adiabatic cooling moisture is scarce in stratosphere so nacreous and non nacreous cloud at this altitude range is restricted to polar regions in winter where air is coldest psc s show some variation in structure according to their chemical makeup and atmospheric conditions but are limited to a single very high range of altitude of about so they are not classified into altitude levels genus types species or varieties there is no latin nomenclature in manner of tropospheric clouds but rather descriptive names using common english supercooled nitric acid and water psc s sometimes known as type 1 typically have a stratiform appearance resembling cirrostratus or haze but because they are not frozen into crystals do not show pastel colours of nacreous types this type of psc has been identified as a cause of ozone depletion in stratosphere frozen nacreous types are typically very thin with mother of pearl colorations and an undulating cirriform or lenticular stratocumuliform appearance these are sometimes known as type 2 polar mesospheric thumb right noctilucent cloud over estonia polar mesospheric clouds form at an extreme level altitude range of about they are given latin name noctilucent because of their illumination well after sunset and before sunrise they typically have a bluish or silvery white coloration that can resemble brightly illuminated cirrus noctilucent clouds may occasionally take on more of a red or orange hue they are not common or widespread enough to have a significant effect on climate however an increasing frequency of occurrence of noctilucent clouds since 19th century may be result of climate change noctilucent clouds are highest in atmosphere and form near top of mesosphere at about ten times altitude of tropospheric high clouds from ground level they can occasionally be seen illuminated by sun during deep twilight ongoing research indicates that convective lift in mesosphere is strong enough during polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to point of saturation this tends to produce coldest temperatures in entire atmosphere just below these conditions result in best environment for formation of polar mesospheric clouds there is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt up meteors provide much of condensation nuclei required for formation of noctilucent cloud noctilucent clouds have four major types based on physical structure and appearance type i veils are very tenuous and lack well defined structure somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus type ii bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other they are usually more widely spaced than bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds type iii billows are arrangements of closely spaced roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus type iv whirls are partial or more rarely complete rings of cloud with dark centres distribution in mesosphere is similar to stratosphere except at much higher altitudes because of need for maximum cooling of water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of earth a major seasonal difference is that convective lift from below mesosphere pushes very scarce water vapor to higher colder altitudes required for cloud formation during respective summer seasons in northern and southern hemispheres sightings are rare more than 45 degrees south of north pole or north of south pole extraterrestrial cloud cover has been seen on most other planets in solar system venus s thick clouds are composed of sulfur dioxide due to volcanic activity and appear to be almost entirely stratiform they are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65 km
