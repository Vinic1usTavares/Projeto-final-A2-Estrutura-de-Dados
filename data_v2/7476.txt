couch gag for episode this was second time simpsons had chosen a guest director for its opening sequence following previous season s episode moneybart which was guest directed by british graffiti artist and political activist banksy previously kricfalusi had criticized simpsons staff in show s early years by saying that show succeeded despite writing and similarly derogatory comments producers responded with fourth season episode front 1993 in which ren stimpy show is nominated for a cartoon award during award ceremony clip from nominated episode is merely a black screen with text clip not done yet a comment on slow production time of show show was mentioned again in season six episode another simpsons clip show 1994 when lisa claims that ren stimpy recycles animation to make new episodes while referencing itchy scratchy s habit of doing same despite this kricfalusi changed his tone in an interview with aaron simpson in 2007 and claimed that simpsons made it easier to do more edgy work well it started with bakshi s mighty mouse new adventures and pee wee herman those were kid shows but with layers of perversion in them then simpsons came along and did edgy material in prime time cartoons thumb left 240px simpson family was drawn off model in a style similar to kricfalusi s earlier work after positive response to opening sequence by banksy creator matt groening and jean came to kricfalusi and asked him if he could do something similar originally they only wanted him to do storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it but kricfalusi insisted on doing animation himself explaining that if we had done it that way no one would even have known that i had anything to do with it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose on simpsons animators draw key poses and then let interpolate between those poses interpolation however is a straight a to b animation that way animation ends up having characters just going from pose to pose kricfalusi explains that on simpsons he wanted to try moving characters in crazy fun ways not just looking funny each time they come to a stop and further elaborated that way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work you can t write visual performance you have to actually draw it he showed groening and jean his adult swim shorts and groening responded by giving him free hands to do 35 second long segment groening told him to break all simpsons rules but kricfalusi explains that he tried not to break any rules in characters personalities just in execution of visuals i didn t follow any models not even my own more rules he broke more pleased groening and jean were with result contrary to banksy who works in secrecy kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw dubbing of final soundtrack while kricfalusi animated 2d parts he had john kedzie to help him with computer graphics and sarah and tommy tanner to do assistant animation in an interview by neil bennett from digital arts magazine kricfalusi revealed that he would have taken a different approach to animation if he were to animate entire episode primarily animation would be slower paced than it was in 35 second long segment couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas kricfalusi explains that if i did a whole episode i would definitely keep on experimenting with way they move and acting i m sure i would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut i would also want to do more stuff with marge i loved animating her and was inspired by way animated olive oyl i couldn t animate a whole half hour myself so i would hire other animators and designers painters etc with strong styles and cast them according to which parts of story would best take advantage of their individual talent release episode originally aired on fox network in united states on october 2 2011 it was watched by

roosevelts has been well received by television critics hayden childs of a v club gave this episode a b rating and commented that simpsons episodes that strive to have a little heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than random gag episodes at least at this point in storied history of simpsons and bart stops to smell roosevelts has enough wee little heart to see this episode through but further wrote that there were a number of jokes that didn t work milhouse s final scene in particular but episode had a steady stream of gags to push through lean times and that s all we can ask for ology s josh harrison was also positive and gave episode a rating of seven out of ten while commenting that he thought this was a definite downgrade from season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value but sincerity of bart s educational experience combined with enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice definitely made this one a winner couch gag for episode was acclaimed by television critics amid amidi of cartoon brew called opening revolutionary and explained that in 35 short and sweet seconds he liberates animation of simpsons from years of graphic banality he continued visual look of show which has been so carefully controlled by its producers becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play and balance of creative authority is shifted from writers room to animators in one fell swoop when comparing segment to banksy s amidi concluded that it is in fact far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement relegating show s dominant literary elements to back seat similarly television blend s katey rich wrote that she appreciates simpsons always being willing to push envelope in different ways but admitted that it would take her some time to get gangly legged marge simpson and leering homer simpson out of her brain tim long was nominated for a writers guild of america award for outstanding writing in animation at 64th writers guild of america awards for his script to this episode references external links bart stops to smell roosevelts at simpsons com john k stuff blog with sketches
