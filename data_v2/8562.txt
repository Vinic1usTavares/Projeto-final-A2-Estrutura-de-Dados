monroe louisiana like almost all southern towns and cities of that time west monroe was very segregated and russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives russell s father was once refused service at a gas station until staff had taken care of all white customers first when his father attempted to leave and find a different station attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn t stay and wait his turn in another incident russell s mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a white policeman accosted her he told her to go home and remove dress which he described as white woman s clothing during world war ii large numbers of blacks were moving to west to look for work there when russell was eight years old his father moved family out of louisiana and settled in oakland california while there family fell into poverty and russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects charles russell was described as a stern hard man who initially worked in a paper factory as a janitor which was a typical negro job low paid and not intellectually challenging as sports journalist john taylor commented when world war ii broke out elder russell became a truck driver russell was closer to his mother katie than to his father and he received a major emotional blow when she suddenly died when he was 12 years old his father gave up his trucking job and became a steelworker to be closer to his semi orphaned children russell has stated that his father became his childhood hero later followed up by minneapolis lakers superstar george mikan whom he met when he was in high school mikan in turn would say of russell college basketball player let s face it he s best ever he s so good he scares you initial exposure to basketball in his early years russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player although russell was a good runner and jumper and had large hands he simply did not understand game and was cut from team in junior high school as a freshman at high school in oakland russell was almost cut again however coach george powles saw russell s raw athletic potential and encouraged him to work on his fundamentals since russell s previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative he was delighted to receive warm words from his white coach he worked hard and used benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player but it was not until his junior and senior years that he began to excel winning back to back high school state championships russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense he later recalled to play good defense it was told back then that you had to stay at all times to react quickly when i started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots i was initially corrected but i stuck with it and it paid off wir sind stolz auf dirk sven simon five magazine issue 43 12 2007 p 69 russell in an autobiographical account notes while on a california high school all stars tour he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players moves e g footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play as preparation for defending against them which included practicing in front of a mirror at night russell further described himself as an avid reader of dell magazines 1950s sports publications which he used to scout opponents moves for purpose of defending against them future baseball hall of famer frank robinson was one of russell s high school basketball teammates college years basketball due to his race russell was ignored by college recruiters and did not receive a single letter of intent until recruiter hal dejulio from university of san francisco usf watched him play in a high school game dejulio was not impressed by russell s meager scoring and atrocious fundamentals but sensed that young center had an extraordinary instinct for game especially in clutch when dejulio offered russell a scholarship he eagerly accepted sports journalist john taylor described it as a watershed event in russell s life because russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism as a consequence russell swore to make best of it thumb left 180px russell practicing a free throw at usf c 1953 56 at usf russell became new starting center for coach phil woolpert woolpert emphasized defense and deliberate half court play which were concepts that favored russell s exceptional defensive skills woolpert s choices of how to deploy his players were unaffected by issues of skin color in 1954 he became first coach of a major college basketball squad to start three black players russell k c jones and hal perry in his usf years russell used his relative lack of bulk to develop a unique style of defense instead of purely guarding opposing center he used his quickness and speed to play help defense against opposing forwards and aggressively challenge their shots combining stature and shot blocking skills of a center with foot speed of a guard russell became centerpiece of a usf team that soon became a force in college basketball after usf kept holy cross star tom heinsohn scoreless in an entire half sports illustrated wrote if russell ever learns to hit basket they re going to have to rewrite rules actual quotation from sports illustrated follows ncaa did in fact rewrite rules in response to russell s dominant play lane was widened for his junior year after he graduated ncaa rules committee instituted a second new rule to counter play of big men like russell basket interference was now prohibited ncaa pays close attention to college basketball superstars over years several rule changes have gone into effect to counter dominant play of big men two good examples are goal tending in response to george mikan 1945 and prohibition of dunk shot by lew 1967 although that rule was eventually repealed thumb right 160px russell is all smiles during his two national championship seasons at university of san francisco however games were often difficult for usf squad russell and his black teammates became targets of racist jeers particularly on road in one notable incident hotels in oklahoma city refused to admit russell and his black teammates while they were in town for 1954 all college tournament in protest whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm which was later called an important bonding experience for group decades later russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds i never permitted myself to be a victim he said note this source appears to have a typo it was corrected in this article it reads i did now want in source it was changed to obviously intended form i did not want racism also shaped his lifelong paradigm as a team player at that time he has said it was never acceptable that a black player was best that did not happen my junior year in college i had what i thought was one of best college seasons ever we won 28 out of 29 games we won national championship i was most valuable player at final four i was first team all american i averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds and i was only guy in college blocking shots so after season was over they had a northern california banquet and they picked another center as player of year in northern california well that let me know that if i were to accept these as final judges of my career i would die a bitter old man so he made a conscious decision he said to put team first and foremost and not worry about individual achievements on hardwood his experiences were far more pleasant russell led usf to ncaa championships in 1955 and 1956 including a string of 55 consecutive victories he became known for his strong defense and shot blocking skills once denying 13 shots in a game ucla coach john wooden called russell greatest defensive man i ve ever seen during his college career russell averaged 20 7 points per game and 20 3 rebounds per game track and field besides basketball russell represented usf in track and field events russell was a standout in high jump he was ranked seventh best high jumper in world in 1956 his graduation year according to track field news this despite not competing in olympic high jump competition that year that year russell won high jump titles at central california aau meet pacific aau meet and west coast relays one of his highest jumps occurred at west coast relays where he achieved a mark of at meet russell tied charlie dumas who would later in year both win gold in melbourne olympics for united states and become first human to high jump like fellow world class high jumpers of that era russell did not use flop high jump technique with which all high jump world records after 1978 have been set russell also competed in race which he could complete in 49 6 seconds plans for a professional basketball career after college harlem globetrotters invited russell to join their exhibition basketball squad russell who was sensitive to any racial prejudice was enraged by fact that owner abe saperstein would only discuss matter with woolpert while saperstein spoke to woolpert in a meeting globetrotters assistant coach harry hanna tried to entertain russell with jokes russell however was livid after this snub and declined offer he reasoned that if saperstein was too smart to speak with him then he was too smart to play for saperstein instead russell made himself eligible for 1956 nba draft 1956 nba draft in 1956 nba draft boston celtics coach red auerbach set his sights on russell thinking his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were missing pieces celtics needed in retrospect auerbach s thoughts were unorthodox in that period centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output and their ability to play defense was secondary however boston s chances of getting russell seemed slim because celtics had finished second in previous season and worst teams had highest draft picks celtics had slipped too low in draft order to pick russell in addition auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward tom heinsohn but auerbach knew that rochester royals who owned first draft pick already had a skilled rebounder in maurice stokes were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay russell 25 000 signing bonus he requested red auerbach offered ice capades if they didn t draft russell number one rochester got their ice show st louis hawks who owned second pick drafted russell but were vying for celtics center ed macauley a six time all star who had roots in st louis auerbach agreed to trade macauley who had previously asked to be traded to st louis in order to be with his sick son if hawks gave up russell owner of st louis called auerbach later and demanded more in trade not only did he want macauley who was celtics premier player at time he wanted cliff hagan who had been serving in military for three years and had not yet played for celtics after much debate auerbach agreed to give up hagan and hawks made trade auerbach red and john feinstein 2004 let me tell you a story a lifetime in game little brown and company pp 75 6 during that same draft boston also drafted guard k c jones russell s former usf teammate thus in one night celtics managed to draft three future hall of famers russell jones and heinsohn russell draft day trade was later called one of most important trades in history of north american sports 1956 olympics before his nba rookie year russell was captain of u s national basketball team that competed at 1956 summer olympics avery brundage head of international olympic committee argued that russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur but russell prevailed he had option to skip tournament and play a full season for celtics but he was determined to play in olympics he later commented that he would have participated in high jump if he had been snubbed by basketball team under head coach gerald tucker russell helped national team win gold medal in melbourne by defeating soviet union 89 55 in final game united states dominated tournament winning by an average of 53 5 points per game russell led team in scoring averaging 14 1 points per game for competition 1956 olympic games tournament for men ref his former usf and future celtics teammate k c jones joined him on olympic squad and contributed 10 9 points per game professional career 1956 59 due to russell s olympic commitment he could not join celtics for 1956 57 season until december after rejoining celtics russell played 48 games averaging 14 7 points per game and a league high 19 6 rebounds per game during this season celtics featured five future hall of famers center russell forwards heinsohn and frank ramsey and guards bill sharman and bob cousy k c jones did not play for celtics until 1958 because of military service russell s first celtics game came on december 22 1956 against st louis hawks led by star forward bob pettit who held several all time scoring records auerbach assigned russell to shut down hawks main scorer and rookie impressed boston crowd with his man to man defense and shot blocking in previous years celtics had been a high scoring team but lacked defensive presence needed to close out tight games however with added defensive presence of russell celtics had laid foundation for a dynasty team utilized a strong defensive approach to game forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers which led to many easy points on fast breaks russell was an elite help defender who allowed celtics to play so called hey bill defense whenever a celtic requested additional defensive help he would shout hey bill russell was so quick that he could run over for a quick double team and make it back in time if opponents tried to find open man he also became famous for his shot blocking skills pundits called his blocks referring to wilson nba basketballs he shoved back into faces of opposing shooters this skill also allowed other celtics to play their men aggressively if they were beaten they knew that russell was guarding basket this approach allowed celtics to finish with a 44 28 regular season record team s second best record since beginning play in 1946 47 season and guaranteed a post season appearance however russell also received negative attention constantly provoked by new york knicks center ray felix during a game he complained to coach auerbach latter told him to take matters into his own hands so after next provocation russell punched felix unconscious paid a 25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls russell had a cordial relationship with his teammates with notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival heinsohn heinsohn felt that russell resented him because former was named 1957 nba rookie of year many people thought that russell was more important but russell had only played half season russell also ignored heinsohn s plea to give his cousin an autograph and openly said to heinsohn that he deserved half of his 300 rookie of year check relationship between two rookies remained reserved however despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off court interests his relationship with celtics point guard and fan favorite bob cousy was amicable in game 1 of eastern division finals celtics met syracuse nationals who were led by dolph schayes in russell s first nba playoff game he finished with 16 points and 31 rebounds along with a reported 7 blocks at time blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic after celtics 108 89 victory schayes quipped how much does that guy make a year it would be to our advantage if we paid him off for five years to get away from us in rest of this series celtics swept nationals in three games to earn franchise s first appearance in nba finals in nba finals celtics met st louis hawks who were again led by bob pettit as well as former celtic ed macauley teams split first six games and tension was so high that in game 3 celtics coach auerbach punched his colleague ben kerner and received a 300 fine in highly competitive game 7 russell tried his best to slow down pettit but it was heinsohn who scored 37 points and kept celtics alive however russell contributed by completing famous coleman play here russell ran down hawks guard jack coleman who had received an outlet pass at midcourt and blocked his shot despite fact that russell had been standing at his own baseline when ball was thrown to coleman block preserved boston s slim 103 102 lead with 40 odd seconds left to play in regulation saving game for celtics in second overtime both teams were in serious foul trouble heinsohn had fouled out and hawks were so depleted that they had only 7 players left with celtics leading 125 123 with one second left hawks had ball at their own baseline reserve guard alex hannum threw a long alley oop pass to pettit and pettit s tip in rolled indecisively on rim for several seconds before rolling out again celtics won earning their first nba championship at start of 1957 58 season celtics won 14 straight games and continued to succeed russell averaged 16 6 points per game and a league record average of 22 7 rebounds per game an interesting phenomenon began that year russell was voted nba most valuable player but only named to all nba second team this would occur repeatedly throughout his career nba reasoned that other centers were better all round players than russell but no player was more valuable to his team celtics won 49 games and easily made first berth in 1958 nba playoffs and made 1958 nba finals against their familiar rivals st louis hawks teams split first two games but then russell went down with a foot injury in game 3 and only returned for game 6 celtics surprisingly won game 4 but hawks prevailed in games 5 and 6 with pettit scoring 50 points in deciding game 6 in following 1958 59 season russell continued his strong play averaging 16 7 points per game and 23 0 rebounds per game in regular season celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games and russell s strong performance once again helped lead celtics through post season as they returned to nba finals in 1959 nba finals celtics recaptured nba title sweeping minneapolis lakers 4 0 lakers head coach john kundla praised russell stating we don t fear celtics without bill russell take him out and we can beat them he s guy who whipped us psychologically 1959 66 thumb upright russell circa 1960 in 1959 60 season nba witnessed debut of legendary philadelphia warriors center wilt chamberlain who averaged a record 37 6 points per game in his rookie year on november 7 1959 russell s celtics hosted chamberlain s warriors and pundits called matchup between best offensive and defensive centers big collision and battle of titans both men awed onlookers with nakedly awesome athleticism and while chamberlain outscored russell 30 to 22 celtics won 115 106 and match was called a new beginning of basketball matchup between russell and chamberlain became one of basketball s greatest rivalries in that season russell s celtics won a record 59 regular season games including a then record tying 17 game win streak and met chamberlain s warriors in eastern division finals chamberlain outscored russell by 81 points in series but celtics walked off with a 4 2 series win in 1960 finals celtics outlasted hawks 4 3 and won their third championship in four years russell grabbed an nba finals record 40 rebounds in game 2 and added 22 points and 35 rebounds in deciding game 7 a 122 103 victory for boston in 1960 61 season russell averaged 16 9 points and 23 9 rebounds per game leading his team to a regular season mark of 57 22 celtics earned another post season appearance where they defeated syracuse nationals 4 1 in eastern division finals celtics made good use of fact that los angeles lakers had exhausted st louis in a long seven game western conference finals and celtics convincingly won in five games following season russell scored a career high 18 9 points per game accompanied by 23 6 rebounds per game while his rival chamberlain had a record breaking season of 50 4 points per game and a 100 point game celtics became first team to win 60 games in a season and russell was voted as nba s most valuable player in post season celtics met philadelphia warriors of chamberlain and russell did his best to slow down 50 points per game scoring warriors center in pivotal game 7 russell managed to hold chamberlain to only 22 points 28 below his season average while scoring 19 himself game was tied with two seconds left when sam jones sank a clutch shot that won celtics series in 1962 nba finals celtics met los angeles lakers of star forward elgin baylor and star guard jerry west teams split first six games and game 7 was tied one second before end of regular time when lakers guard rod hundley faked a shot and instead passed out to frank who missed an open eight foot last second shot that would have won l a title though game was tied russell had daunting task of defending against baylor with little frontline help as three best celtics forwards heinsohn and tom sanders had fouled out in overtime baylor fouled out fourth forward frank ramsey so russell was completely robbed of his usual four men wing rotation but russell and little used fifth forward gene guarilia successfully pressured baylor into missed shots russell finished with a clutch performance scoring 30 points and tying his own nba finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110 107 overtime win celtics lost playmaker bob cousy to retirement after 1962 63 season but they drafted john havlicek once again celtics were powered by russell who averaged 16 8 points and 23 6 rebounds per game won his fourth regular season mvp title and earned mvp honors at 1963 nba all star game following his 19 point 24 rebound performance for east celtics reached 1963 nba finals where they again defeated los angeles lakers this time in six games in following 1963 64 season celtics posted a league best 58 22 record in regular season russell scored 15 0 ppg and grabbed a career high 24 7 rebounds per game leading nba in rebounds for first time since chamberlain entered league boston defeated cincinnati royals 4 1 to earn another nba finals appearance and then won against chamberlain s newly relocated san francisco warriors 4 1 it was their sixth consecutive and seventh title in russell s eighth year a streak unreached in any u s professional sports league russell later called celtics defense best of all time russell again excelled during 1964 65 season celtics won a league record 62 games and russell averaged 14 1 points and 24 1 rebounds per game winning his second consecutive rebounding title and his fifth mvp award in 1965 nba playoffs celtics played eastern division finals against philadelphia 76ers who had recently traded for wilt chamberlain russell held chamberlain to a pair of field goals in first three quarters of game 3 in game 5 russell contributed 28 rebounds 10 blocks seven assists and six steals however that playoff series ended in a dramatic game 7 five seconds before end sixers were trailing 110 109 but russell turned over ball however when sixers hall of fame guard hal greer john havlicek stole ball causing celtics commentator johnny most to scream havlicek stole ball it s all over johnny havlicek stole ball after division finals celtics had an easier time in nba finals winning 4 1 against los angeles lakers of jerry west and elgin baylor in following 1965 66 season celtics won their eighth consecutive title russell s team again beat chamberlain s philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1 in division finals proceeding to win nba finals in a tight seven game showdown against los angeles lakers with russell scoring 25 points and grabbing 32 rebounds in a 95 93 win in deciding seventh game during season russell contributed 12 9 points and 22 8 rebounds per game this was first time in seven years that he failed to average at least 23 rebounds a game 1966 69 thumb right 200px russell defends against wilt chamberlain of philadelphia 76ers in 1966 thumb right 200px russell and coach red auerbach with his trademark victory blackstone practice that is now illegal after winning 1966 nba championship celtics coach red auerbach retired before 1966 67 season he had initially wanted his old player frank ramsey to coach celtics but ramsey was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes his second choice was bob cousy who declined invitation stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates third choice tom heinsohn also said no because he did not think he could handle often surly russell however heinsohn proposed russell himself as a player coach and when auerbach asked his center he said yes on april 16 1966 bill russell agreed to become head coach of boston celtics a public announcement was made two days later russell thus became first black head coach in nba history and commented to journalists i wasn t offered job because i am a negro i was offered it because red figured i could do it celtics championship streak ended at eight in his first full season as head coach when wilt chamberlain s philadelphia 76ers won a record breaking 68 regular season games and beat celtics 4 1 in 1967 eastern finals sixers simply outpaced celtics when they shredded famed boston defense by scoring 140 points in clinching game 5 win russell acknowledged first real loss of his career he had been injured in 1958 when celtics lost nba finals by visiting chamberlain in locker room shaking his hand and saying great however game still ended on a high note for russell after loss he led his grandfather through celtics locker rooms and two saw white celtics player john havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate sam jones and discussing game suddenly jake russell broke down crying asked by his grandson what was wrong his grandfather replied how proud he was of him being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony in russell s penultimate season of 1967 68 his numbers slowly declined but at age 34 he still tallied 12 5 points per game and 18 6 rebounds per game latter good for third highest average in league in eastern division finals 76ers had better record than celtics and were slightly favored but then national tragedy struck as martin luther king was assassinated on april 4 1968 with eight of ten starting players on sixers and celtics being black both teams were in deep shock and there were calls to cancel series cherry 190 199 in a game called as unreal and devoid of emotion sixers lost 127 118 on april 5 in game 2 philadelphia evened series with a 115 106 win and in games 3 and 4 sixers won with chamberlain suspiciously often defended by celtics backup center wayne embry causing press to speculate russell was worn down prior to game 5 celtics seemed dead no nba team had ever come back from a 3 1 deficit however celtics rallied back winning game 5 122 104 and game 6 114 106 powered by a spirited havlicek and helped by a terrible sixers shooting slump in game 7 15 202 stunned philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100 96 defeat making it first time in nba history a team lost a series after leading 3 1 russell limited chamberlain to only two shot attempts in second half despite this celtics were leading only 97 95 with 34 seconds left when russell closed out game with several consecutive clutch plays he made a free throw blocked a shot by sixers player chet walker grabbed a rebound off a miss by sixers player hal greer and finally passed ball to teammate sam jones who scored to clinch win boston then beat los angeles lakers 4 2 in nba finals giving russell his tenth title in 12 years for his efforts russell was named sports illustrateds sportsman of year after losing for fifth straight time against russell and his celtics hall of fame lakers guard jerry west stated if i had a choice of any basketball player in league my no 1 choice has to be bill russell bill russell never ceases to amaze me however russell seemed to reach a breaking point during 1968 69 season he was shocked by assassination of robert f kennedy disillusioned by vietnam war and weary from his increasingly stale marriage to his wife rose couple later divorced he was convinced that u s was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball he was 15 pounds overweight skipped mandatory nba coach meetings and was generally lacking energy after a new york knicks game he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion russell pulled himself together and put up 9 9 points and 19 3 rebounds per game but aging celtics stumbled through regular season their 48 34 record was team s worst since 1955 56 and they entered playoffs as only fourth seeded team in east in playoffs however russell and his celtics achieved upsets over philadelphia 76ers and new york knicks to earn a meeting with los angeles lakers in nba finals l a now featured new recruit wilt chamberlain next to perennial stars baylor and west and were heavily favored in first two games russell ordered not to double team west who used freedom to score 53 and 41 points in game 1 and 2 laker wins russell then ordered to double team west and boston won game 3 in game 4 celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and lakers having ball but then baylor stepped out of bounds and in last play sam jones used a triple screen by bailey howell larry siegfried and havlicek and hit a buzzer beater which equalized series teams split next two games so it all came down to game 7 in l a where lakers owner jack kent cooke angered and motivated celtics by putting proceedings of lakers victory ceremony on game leaflets russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game because in that case not better but more determined team was going to win celtics were ahead by nine points with five minutes remaining in addition west was heavily limping after a game 5 thigh injury and chamberlain had left game with an injured leg west then hit one basket after other and cut lead to one and chamberlain asked to return to game however lakers coach bill van breda kolff kept chamberlain on bench until end of game saying later that he wanted to stay with lineup responsible for comeback celtics held on for a 108 106 victory and russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years at age 35 russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last nba game after game russell went over to distraught west who had scored 42 points and was named only nba finals mvp in history from losing team clasped his hand and tried to soothe him days later 30 000 enthusiastic celtics fans cheered their returning heroes but russell was not there man who said he owed public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to celtics it came as so surprising that even red auerbach was blindsided and as a consequence he made mistake of drafting guard jo jo white instead of a center although white became a standout celtics player celtics lacked an all star center went just 34 48 in next season and failed to make playoffs for first time since 1950 in boston both fans and journalists felt betrayed because russell left celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for 10 000 to sports illustrated russell was accused of selling out future of franchise for a month of his salary nba career

nation of islam s practice of replacing a european slave name with an x and even purchased land in liberia russell s public statements became increasingly militant and he was quoted in a 1963 sports illustrated interview with words i dislike most white people because they are people i like most blacks because i am black however russell articulated these views with a measure of self criticism i consider this a deficiency in myself maybe if i looked at it objectively detached myself it would be a deficiency however when his white celtics teammate frank ramsey asked whether he hated him russell claimed to have been misquoted but few believed it according to taylor russell discounted fact that his career was facilitated by white people who were proven anti racists his high school coach george powles person who encouraged him to play basketball his college coach phil woolpert who integrated usf basketball celtics coach red auerbach who is regarded as an anti racist pioneer and

as first negro head coach in a major league sport can you do job impartially without any racial prejudice in reverse he replied yes reporter asked how russell replied because most important factor is respect and in basketball i respect a man for his ability period as a result of repeated racial bigotry russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors thinking it was insincere and hypocritical this attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists he alienated celtics fans by saying you owe public same it owes you nothing i refuse to smile and be nice to kiddies this supported opinion of many white fans that russell who was by then highest paid celtic was egotistical paranoid and hypocritical already hostile atmosphere between
