frederick university which included a stint as assistant to christopher hansteen holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at christiania cathedral school in 1818 where he met future renowned mathematician niels henrik abel holmboe s lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of abel both in school and privately two became friends and remained so until abel s early death holmboe moved to royal frederick university in 1826 where he worked until his own death in 1850 holmboe s significant impact on mathematics in fledgling norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools it was widely used but faced competition from christopher hansteen s alternative offering sparking what may have been norway s first debate about school textbooks early life and career bernt michael holmboe was born in vang in 1795 son of vicar jens holmboe 1746 1823 and his wife cathrine holst 1763 1823 he grew up in eidsberg with his nine siblings and was elder brother of noted philologist christopher andreas holmboe holmboe was homeschooled from an early age but was sent to christiania cathedral school in 1810 to complete his secondary education there he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics he enrolled as a student at royal frederick university in 1814 a turbulent year in norwegian history norway had been a province of denmark since 1397 but had come under swedish control in january 1814 treaty of kiel following norway s declaration of independence in constitution of 17 may sweden responded by waging a military campaign against norway during summer of 1814 holmboe was a spokesperson for student group opposed to presence of swedish troops in country any outspokenness from student community was highly visible at time as university

under christopher hansteen a lecturer at university and delivered some lectures himself in early 1818 holmboe became a mathematics teacher at christiania cathedral school a position that had become vacant in 1817 school principal jacob had invited holmboe s brother christopher andreas who had also studied mathematics to take up position but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology christopher went on to research sanskrit language among others in his teaching holmboe drew inspiration from joseph louis lagrange niels henrik abel at christiania cathedral school holmboe met niels henrik abel then a pupil there holmboe quickly discovered abel s talent and proclaimed him as a splendid genius in his report card quote in english a splendid mathematical genius remark written by holmboe school s primary focus was on classical education and latin and so holmboe tutored abel privately his personal support for abel has been called holmboe s most important contribution to mathematics quote in english way holmboe supported and helped abel should be considered his most important contribution to mathematics statement of article writer holmboe and abel became close friends two of holmboe s younger brothers studied with abel and three were also on friendly terms abel was invited to holmboe family residence in eidsberg on several occasions including to celebrate christmas abel died from tuberculosis in 1829 at age of twenty six ten years after abel s death holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumes oeuvres completes de n h abel complete works of n h abel he was first to do so later life and career holmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825 274 page book was named laerebog i mathematiken forste deel textbook in mathematics part one in 1827 he followed with second volume laerebog i mathematiken anden deel textbook in mathematics part two consisting of a further 155 pages he used his own teaching experience as background for his writing mainly abstract purpose of books was to instill logical thinking for instance in field geometry it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper books became widely used and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively in 1826 holmboe was appointed a lecturer at royal frederick university some claimed that he owed his appointment to abel s absence as latter was travelling around in europe at that time holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college from 1826 until his death and was promoted to professor at royal frederick university in 1834 his later publications include stereometry 1833 plan og plan and spherical trigonometry 1834 and laerebog i den mathematik textbook of advanced mathematics 1849 holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as abel including ole jacob broch born 1818 at university holmboe again met christopher hansteen who had become a professor there in 1816 in 1835 hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools a reaction to holmboe s books and method of teaching it was more practically oriented holmboe wrote a review of book for newspaper morgenbladet in which he advised schools not to use it a public debate followed with contributions from other mathematicians it has been claimed that this was first debate on subject of school textbooks in norway hansteen s

companies on other side of table from 1847 holmboe was a member of board of directors of insurance company founded by his former student ole jacob broch legacy a bernt michael holmboe memorial prize

named after bernt michael holmboe before 1879 it was named hansteens gate after christopher hansteen marriage and children holmboe married twice his first wife nikoline antonie born 1804 in toten died
