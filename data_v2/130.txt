original idea for it alt a man speaks into a microphone two dozen and one greyhounds was written by mike scully and directed by bob anderson simpsons writers al jean and mike reiss came up with original idea for episode idea came to them after watching 1961 disney film one hundred and one dalmatians david mirkin episode s show runner later jokingly said that jean and reiss liked to steal ideas from disney and pointed to an episode in season eight that they wrote as proof titled annoyed grunt which was based on 1964 disney film mary poppins mirkin thought that it was great that they could take stuff from disney and do darker versions on simpsons in a completely legal way matt groening was happy with episode because he thought it felt like a callback to first episode of simpsons simpsons roasting on an open fire and because it features references to one hundred and one dalmatians disney film thrilled groening as a child and was one of reasons he was first interested in animation and cartooning in one hundred and one dalmatians puppies watch cartoons on television several times idea of a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled groening and said that this idea inspired him to create itchy scratchy show a fictional television show within simpsons universe mr burns says in episode that puppy that stands up only on its hind legs reminds him of rory calhoun an american actor who lived from 1922 to 1999 simpsons writer george meyer came up with joke but groening argued against it because he did not think audience would know who calhoun was writers decided to keep it in anyway because it was later expanded into a key part of episode s ending several years later groening stated that he was proven correct after pointing to discussions on internet about episode asking who calhoun was as bart and lisa sneak away to mr burns mansion they see him loading a gun and singing a musical number called see my vest in which he proclaims his intention to kill puppies to make a tuxedo out of them when staff discussed how they could gloss over horrifying things mr burns would do to dogs one of writers suggested that if they communicated his plan through a song it would stay fun and light scully who agreed that idea was good came in following day with complete lyrics that he wrote for see my vest which was a parody of song be our guest sung by jerry orbach in 1991 film beauty and beast mirkin loved scully s work on parody song commenting rhymes are really clever it s one of our very best songs on simpsons he also liked fact that songs could be used in episodes of simpsons without episodes turning into musicals saying we ll just do one song and that s plenty we have fun with that and then we re out animation and voice acting even though animals in cartoons often behave with semi human awareness groening said he preferred animals in cartoons to behave exactly way they do in real life claiming that this was how animals were depicted in two dozen and one greyhounds mirkin said there were some exceptions for gags but most of time they tried to keep animals acting realistically animal noises for episode were performed by frank welker who was praised by mirkin on dvd audio commentary for episode saying he can do anything and it fits perfectly you forget you re listening to a guy and he s a pleasure to work with welker was also praised by groening who said welker was unbelievably good at doing animal noises staff had a big fight with fox network censors over scene in which santa s little helper mates with she s fastest writers were originally worried about idea but mirkin knew that they could show dogs having sex in a manner that was not explicit in scene s final version dogs are only seen from shoulders up crew s animatic showing scene in full was later released on dvd anderson noted that during episode s censor screening there was a giant laugh at depiction cultural references overarching plot of episode and its title are inspired by
