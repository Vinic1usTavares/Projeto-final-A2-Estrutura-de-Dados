rajasaurus is a genus of carnivorous abelisaurid theropod dinosaur from late cretaceous of india containing one species rajasaurus narmadensis bones were excavated from lameta formation in gujarat state of western india probably inhabiting what is now narmada river valley it was formally described by palaeontologist jeffrey a wilson and colleagues in 2003 based on a partial skeleton comprising braincase spine hip bone legs and tail a first for an indian theropod dinosaur likely measured and had a single horn on forehead which was probably used for display and head butting like other abelisaurids rajasaurus was probably an ambush predator india at this time was an island due to break up of supercontinent gondwana though it is possible animals still were able to migrate to and from nearby continents creation of subfamily majungasaurinae and its inclusion of abelisaurids from india madagascar and europe including rajasaurus further reiterates this lameta formation has yielded several other dinosaur species including abelisaurids and titanosaurian sauropods similar to other gondwanan landmasses area during cretaceous was probably forested and served as a nesting grounds for several creatures rajasaurus has become a tourist attraction for state of gujarat discovery and naming thumb left narmada river near which remains of rajasaurus were found alt a calm blue river with forested banks visible on either side lameta formation was first discovered in 1981 by geologists working for geological survey of india gsi g n dwivedi and after being given limestone structures later recognized as dinosaur eggs by workers of acc cement quarry in village of rahioli near city balasinor in gujarat state of western india remains of rajasaurus were found in this fossil rich limestone bed to which gsi geologist suresh srivastava was assigned to excavate on two separate trips from 1982 1983 and 1983 1984 in 2001 teams from american institute of indian studies and national geographic society with support of university joined study in order to reconstruct excavated remains fragments of rajasaurus were also found near jabalpur in madhya pradesh in northern part of lameta formation namely a piece of upper jaw rajasaurus was then formally described in 2003 by geologist jeffrey a wilson and colleagues holotype specimen of rajasaurus comprises a partial skeleton gsi type no 1 33 which includes maxillae premaxillae braincase and quadrate bone on skull and spine hip bone legs and tail in post cranial remains it is first indian theropod to have preserved these post cranial remains it is possible rajasaurus lametasaurus and indosaurus are synonymous though this cannot be confirmed due to fragmentary remains and lametasaurus specimen has been lost generic name rajasaurus derives from sanskrit raja meaning king sovereign chief or best of its kind and ancient greek sauros meaning lizard and its specific name narmadensis refers to narmada river in central india near where it was discovered description thumb scale diagram of rajasaurus and a human in 2010 palaeontologist gregory s paul estimated body length of rajasaurus at and weight at in 2016 its length was estimated to be same year another estimation listed it at 10 5 metres 34 5 feet and 3 metric tons 3 3 short tons rajasaurus closely resembled madagascan abelisaurid majungasaurus with a 20 million year separation abelisaurids typically had four fingers short arms and to compensate a heavily constructed head which was primary tool for hunting however skull was short they probably had modest jaw musculature and teeth were short abelisaurids probably had a bite force similar to allosaurus at around thumb left life restoration on braincase only left sides of parietal and frontal bones are preserved braincase is thick with frontals achieving a maximum thickness of above eye socket on frontals near midline is a path for olfactory tract which is a part of smelling rims of supratemporal fossae depressions on either side of top of skull form a low sagittal crest along middle of top of skull front rims of fossae are unusually steep abelisaurids typically had elongated fenestrae holes in skull below quadrate bone near bottom of skull but rajasaurus had elongated supratemporal fenestrae near top of skull unlike in other theropods but similar to majungasaurus crista which is typically a ridge along otic capsule bone in ear more so juts outward as a stump thumb upright abelisaurid tibiae g is rajasaurus rajasaurus had a low horn on its forehead that is primarily made of nasal bone more than frontal unlike horn on majungasaurus horn in life was probably same size as fossilized horn unlike in carnotaurus where in life horn was extended by a thickened layer skin though rajasaurus did have a thickened layer of skin it probably did not add to overall length of horn a trough like groove bordered by a raised wall is present where frontal meets nasal decreasing in height and width towards midline serving to support horn on nasal only one neck vertebra likely a middle vertebra is preserved and it is proportionally shorter than that of other ceratosaurs broader than is tall and spool shaped like in other ceratosaurs back face of vertebra where it connects to another vertebra is very concave however unlike in other ceratosaurs front face is also concave like other ceratosaurs neck vertebra has two air pockets though they are unusually close to head eleven partial spool shaped dorsal vertebrae were found but only one most likely fourth thoracic vertebra is well preserved faces are concave and more deeper than broad in contrast to neck vertebra which is opposite these vertebrae contain many air pockets bottom side of six sacral vertebrae are preserved they are elongated and have a decreasing width towards ends and have no arching three partial tail vertebrae were found likely from middle section of tail and they also have concave faces but are more cylindrical than spool shaped part of hip that juts out to attach to ischium ischial peduncle projects farther out than pubic peduncle which causes hip joint to be farther down on back underside of hip iliac crests on other side of hip from ischium and pubic bone are thin compared to hip joint area respectively in thickness fibula on outside portion of lower leg below knee decreases in width from top to bottom and is slightly concave similar to ceratosaurus second metatarsal bone which connects ankle bone to second toe is robust has an oval shaped and slightly concave joint between it and ankle and width does not decrease as it gets nearer toes fourth metatarsal bone has similar proportions to second metatarsal both second metatarsals are preserved and only left fourth metatarsal is preserved classification wilson in 2003 assigned rajasaurus to subfamily carnotaurinae being more closely related to abelisaurids like majungasaurus and south american carnotaurus than to african abelisaurids as africa he believed had separated from gondwana first and south america india and madagascar were connected via antarctica on basis of several similarities such as presence of a sagittal crest neck vertebrae with two air pockets configuration of nasal bones a fleshy growth excrescence on frontal bone and a thick skull roof however if this were case then african abelisaurids would display endemism and not rajasaurus in 2008 palaeontologist matthew carrano created subfamily for south american abelisaurids as a sister taxon to carnotaurinae with abelisaurids migrating through gondwanan continents via small land connections as they broke apart until they were completely separated in middle cretaceous in 2014 subfamily majungasaurinae was erected by palaeontologist thierry tortosa to separate newly discovered european majungasaurus indosaurus rahiolisaurus and rajasaurus from south american abelisaurids based on physical characteristics such as elongated antorbital fenestrae in front of eye sockets and a sagittal crest that widens into a triangular surface towards front of head despite large oceanic barriers it has been suggested that a migration of abelisaurids took place in late cretaceous between africa europe madagascar and india which ultimately isolated south american abelisaurids it is possible that migration occurred between europe and india across africa given its proximity to both and volcanic dras kohistan island arc may have allowed island hopping and an indirect path to asia though these are still questionable explanations following cladogram was recovered by tortosa 2014 rajasaurus is distinguished from other genera by its single forehead horn though majungasaurus also only has one elongated supratemporal fenestrae holes in upper rear of skull and ilia bones on hip which feature a ridge separating brevis shelf from hip joint palaeobiology thumb restoration of rajasaurus with prey horn of rajasaurus could have been used for display or head butting with other rajasaurus individuals head butting inferred from lack of shock absorbing cancellous bone in skull could have been both or either low motion shoving matches like modern day marine iguanas amblyrhynchus cristatus or focused on neck and flank like giraffes giraffa spp neck muscles though in abelisaurids were adapted for withstanding high stress horn could have been used for defending territory or for mating matches abelisaurids may have been ambush predators using a bite and hold tactic to hunt large prey leg bones of majungasaurus are comparatively short to other similarly sized theropods suggesting dinosaur was comparatively slower this same condition is seen in rajasaurus however ceratosaurs may have been able to rapidly accelerate palaeoecology thumb left india was an island in late cretaceous rajasaurus has been found in lameta formation a rock unit radiometrically dated to maastrichtian age of latest cretaceous representing an arid or semi arid landscape with a river flowing through it probably providing shrub cover near water which formed between episodes of volcanism in deccan traps rajasaurus likely inhabited what is now narmada river valley formation is known for being a sauropod nesting site yielding several dinosaur eggs and sauropod herds likely chose sandy soil for nesting though eggs belonging to large theropods have been found it is unknown if they belong to rajasaurus sauropod coprolite remains indicate they lived in a forested landscape consuming plants such as podocarpus araucaria and conifers cycads palm trees early grass and and acanthaceae flowering plants prehistoric snake sanajeh mainly raided nests of sauropods for eggs though it is possible it also targeted smaller theropod eggs india by late cretaceous had separated from madagascar and south america during break up of gondwana and rajasaurus lived on an isolated island likely causing endemism and unique characteristics not seen in other abelisaurids however despite being an island there is no evidence of endemic animals with unique traits from late cretaceous india perhaps indicating a continued connection to other parts of world likely africa due to its proximity similarity between european and indian sauropod egg taxa suggests an inter continental migration of animals between india europe and south america during cretaceous despite water barriers thumb sanajeh feeding in a titanosaur nest several dinosaurs have been described from lameta formation such as noasaurid laevisuchus abelisaurids indosaurus lametasaurus and rahiolisaurus and titanosaurian sauropods and diversity of and titanosaurian dinosaurs in cretaceous india indicates they shared close affinities to dinosaur life of other gondwanan continents which had similar inhabitants dinosaurs in india probably all went extinct due to volcanic activity around 350 000 years before cretaceous paleogene boundary dinosaurs probably avoided areas with volcanic fissure vents and lava flows cultural significance gujarat state has declared fossil site in balasinor a dinosaur park sometimes called jurassic park of india in reference to 1993 film in response to massive rush of tourism with crowning attraction being rajasaurus in rahioli a life sized statue was erected in honour of its discovery indian theme park
