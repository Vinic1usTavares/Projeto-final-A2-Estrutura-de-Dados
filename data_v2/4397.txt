philippines in early june conson slowly traveled towards north gradually strengthening storm reached typhoon status late on june 7 according to joint typhoon warning center and several hours later according to japan meteorological agency after turning towards northeast typhoon brushed taiwan and reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km h 90 mph 10 minute winds on june 9 after reaching its peak conson gradually weakened passing through okinawa before being downgraded to a tropical storm next day on june 11 storm made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in kochi prefecture just before becoming extratropical extratropical remnants continued towards northeast and were last mentioned on june 14 crossing international date line typhoon conson brought heavy rains and high winds to philippines taiwan okinawa and japan flooding in philippines killed two people and caused about php1 6 million us 35 000 in damages however some reports state that up to 30 people died in philippines in ryukyu islands storm brought heavy rains and high winds to several islands damaging crops and leaving many without power as it became extratropical conson caused moderate damage in southern japan including a few landslides which prompted evacuations throughout japan losses reached 355 7 million yen us 3 8 million meteorological history early on june 4 joint typhoon warning center jtwc began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with deep convection about 780 km 485 mi south southeast of hong kong later that day following notable development they classified system as tropical depression 07w at same time japan meteorological agency jma also began monitoring system as a tropical depression slowly moving towards southeast 07w gradually strengthened being classified a tropical storm by jtwc at 1200 utc next day around same time storm entered philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration s area of responsibility and was given local name frank twenty four hours later 07w made its closest approach to philippines passing within 295 km 185 mi of manila a few hours later jma upgraded depression to a tropical storm and gave it name conson a name contributed by vietnam that is a picturesque place in country consisting of a mountain pine forest streams pagodas and many historical monuments a ridge located over central philippines caused conson to turn towards north continuing to intensify jtwc assessed storm to have reached typhoon status at 1800 utc on june 7 jma also upgraded storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later a 28 km 17 mi wide eye developed as cyclone turned towards northeast originally forecasts showed typhoon making landfall in southern taiwan but turn towards northeast spared island from a direct hit shortly after being classified as a typhoon by jma jtwc upgraded conson to a category 2 typhoon on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds of 155 km h 100 mph 1 minute winds eye later became slightly disorganized and cloud tops around center warmed however storm reorganized next day and was upgraded to a category 3 typhoon by jtwc with winds of 185 km h 115 mph 1 minute winds intensification was result of influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow around this time pagasa issued their final advisory on typhoon frank as it moved out of their area of responsibility right thumb typhoon conson near peak intensity on june 9 strengthening was result of conson passing over warm waters of kuroshio current forward motion on typhoon also began to increase as it interacted with a baroclinic zone shortly after jma assessed storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km h 90 mph 10 minute winds and a minimum pressure of 960 hpa mbar later that day storm passed over okinawa as it weakened by june 10 conson began to undergo an extratropical transition continuing increase in forward speed caused low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on southern edge of circulation around 1200 utc center of circulation became separated from deep convection leading to typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later early on june 11 jtwc reported that storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of japan however jma kept conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in kochi prefecture as a minimal tropical storm shortly after landfall it was classified as an extratropical cyclone continuing towards northeast storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed international date line on june 14 near aleutian islands japan meteorological agency uses 10 minute sustained winds while joint typhoon warning center uses 1 minute sustained winds conversion factor between two is 1 14x jma s peak intensity for conson was 150 km h 90 mph 10 minute sustained or 160 km h 105 mph 1 minute sustained jtwc s peak intensity for conson was 185 km h 115 mph 1 minute sustained or 155 km h 100 mph 10 minute sustained national meteorological center of china estimated a peak intensity of 150 km h 90 mph 10 minute sustained or 160 km h 105 mph 1 minute sustained hong kong observatory assessed conson to be slightly weaker than other agencies with peak winds estimated at 130 km h 80 mph 10 minute sustained or 150 km h 90 mph 1 minute sustained preparations and impact philippines on june 7 philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration raised public storm signal no 1 for most of luzon as conson strengthened into

northeast conson headed towards okinawa where schools were closed and local transportation was disrupted due to storm japan meteorological agency warned residents about threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from storm a united states naval base located in okinawa was placed under a tropical cyclone condition of readiness tccr four as typhoon conson was approaching as storm neared islands naval base was put under tccr three indicating that winds of 92 km h 57 mph were anticipated within 48 hours ahead of storm upwards of 254 mm 10 in fell across islands which were indirectly related to storm in southern japan several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions heavy rains peaking at 345 mm 13 5 in on tarama triggered flooding and landslides throughout islands highest
