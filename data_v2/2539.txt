toll estimates hata s major contribution to nanking massacre studies is his book nankin jiken nanking incident published in 1986 which is a detailed study of event based on japanese chinese and

for its relatively low estimate of death toll which hata put at up to 40 000 because he based number of civilian killing on work of lewis s c smythe who conducted survey of massacre in immediate war damage in nanking area dec 1937 to march 1938 urban and rural surveys and also exclude chinese soldiers takashi yoshida making of rape of nanking new york oxford university press 2006 pp 98 100 hata s book is acknowledged as first to discuss what might have caused massacre whereas previous books had focused only on event itself hata argued that japanese army s lack of military police and facilities to detain pows its ignorance of international laws and chinese general tang s decision to flee city without formally surrendering which left large number of plain clothes soldiers within civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping up operations by japanese among factors which led to slaughter some contemporary researchers including historian hora and journalist honda expressed

book rape of nanking who asked him why he doubted testimony of japanese pows who had stated that hundreds of thousands of chinese were killed in atrocity when hata replied that torture and coercion of japanese pows made their testimony unreliable chang walked out and audience became unruly shouting hata down and yelling insults at him moderator perry link barely kept situation under control peter

prevented hata from speaking at a number of universities that he visited bob wakabayashi of york university argues that hata became more strident in his tone following these attacks once calling it nanking industry in comparison with norman finkelstein s holocaust industry in 1980s hata had stated that death toll was 38 000 to 42 000 while holding out possibility that it might have been as high as 60 000 daqing yang convergence or divergence recent historical writings on rape of nanjing american historical review june 1999 p 851 but when he wrote second edition of nankin jiken in 2007 he

argues that comfort women were not sex slaves but largely willing prostitutes with a minority of them being sold by their parents and more crucially no direct involvement by japanese military except a few incidents in south east asia summed up his views on issue with there were at most 20 000 comfort women none of them were forcibly recruited forty percent of them were from japan most heavily represented nation many were sold to brokers by their parents some responded willingly to brokers offers others were deceived i would add that on average living conditions in comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for american troops during vietnam war historian sarah soh notes that hata had put total number of comfort women at 90 000 in 1993 but he later revised number downward because of his political alignment with conservative anti redress camp in japan that emerged in latter half of 1990s c sarah soh comfort women sexual violence and postcolonial

retraction of kono statement on comfort women was only historian appointed to committee established by government of shinzo abe to re examine statement in 2015 hata led of group of japanese historians in requesting that publisher mcgraw hill make corrections to what they believed were erroneous descriptions of comfort women in a world history textbook published in united states ideological leanings hata s general ideological leanings have been described in a variety of manners some sources have referred to him as being a right leaning scholar such as thomas u berger who has called him a highly respected conservative japanese historian thomas u berger war guilt and world politics after world war ii cambridge cambridge university press 2012 126 others however find characterizing hata in these terms to be inaccurate such as military historian masahiro yamamoto who notes that in historical debate on nanking massacre hata was a centrist who actually leaned closer to traditionalist scholars than conservative revisionists masahiro yamamoto nanking anatomy of an atrocity westport connecticut praeger 2000 252 253 262 264 takao yamada likewise points out that hata has criticized all sides in

emperor s recollection of wartime japan which he recorded shortly after world war ii had likely been created to prove to united states that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently hata theorized that an english language translation must have also been drawn up at same time a theory which was mocked by right wing scholars who felt monologue was created as a simple historical record
