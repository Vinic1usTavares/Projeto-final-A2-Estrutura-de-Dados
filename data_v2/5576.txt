hypnagogic pop is pop or psychedelic music that explores elements of cultural memory and nostalgia by drawing on popular entertainment and recording technology of past particularly 1980s genre developed in mid to late 2000s as american lo fi and noise musicians began referencing retro aesthetics remembered from childhood such as 1980s radio rock new age mtv one hit wonders and hollywood synthesizer soundtracks as well as analog technology and outdated pop culture term was coined by journalist david keenan in an august 2009 issue of wire to label developing trend which he characterized as pop music refracted through memory of a memory it was used interchangeably with chillwave or glo fi and would gain critical attention in late 2000s through artists such as ariel pink and james ferraro hypnagogic pop has been variously described as a 21st century update of psychedelia a reappropriation of media saturated capitalist culture and an american cousin to british

format for cultural appropriation and sonic renegotiation hypnagogic pop has a preoccupation with both decaying analog technology and bombastic representations of synthetic elements in 1980s and 1990s popular culture according to critic adam trainer he wrote that music is defined by a shared approach rather than a particular sound and that it draws from collective unconscious of late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture while being indebted stylistically to various traditions of experimentalism such as noise drone repetition and improvisation as of 2011 music was often issued in form of

inspired by a comment made by james ferraro keenan referred to a developing trend of 2000s lo fi and post noise music in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia childhood memory and outdated recording technology around that time a wave of retro inspired home recording artists had begun dominating underground indie scenes among artists discussed in keenan s article were ferraro spencer clark ariel pink zola jesus ducktails emeralds and pocahaunted he employed term hypnagogic as referring to psychological state between waking and sleeping liminal zones where mis hearings and hallucinations feed into formation of dreams according to keenan these artists began to draw on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and hom ing in on futuristic signifiers of period he alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as pop music refracted through memory of a memory and as 1980 s inspired psychedelia that engages with capitalist detritus of past in an attempt to dream of future thumb left upright james ferraro pictured in 2012 was called godfather of hypnagogic music hypnagogic pop was later described as an american counterpart to britain s music scene which also engaged with notions of nostalgia and memory while critic simon reynolds attributed to southern california and its culture trainer said style arguably emerged from numerous simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of post noise neo psychedelia reynolds identified pink clark and ferraro as godparents of hypnagogic he also singled out pink as central figure to what he calls altered zones generation an umbrella term he designed for lo fi retro inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on altered zones an associate site for pitchfork pink gained recognition in mid 2000s through a string of self produced albums pioneering a sound that reynolds called 70s radio rock and 80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio glimmers of melody flickering in and out of fog tiny mix tapes jordan redmond wrote that pink s early collaborator john maus was also placed at nexus of a number of recent popular movements including hypnagogic pop and that maus was as much of a progenitor of this sound as pink even though pink has tended to be headline grabber critic adam harper disputed reynolds arguments writing that pink s largely rock based music lacked pop art pastiche of hypnagogic pop and that instead of progenitor or az generation pink can easily be understood as youngest member of this mid 80s cassette culture generation it hopefully doesn t need emphasising that ariel pink didn t invent home recording or lo fi or even retro lo fi among pink s predecessors harper lists r stevie moore and martin newell as most notable matthew ingram of wire additionally recognized moore s influence on pink and hypnagogic pop through his disciple he has unwittingly provided genre s template another precursor to genre was nick nicely s 1982 single hilly fields 1892 red bull musics j r moore wrote that nicely was out there on his own updating 60s psychedelic pop with newer technology while maintaining a uniquely haphazard diy aesthetic in doing so nicely basically invented sound of 2000s hypnagogic pop movement decades beforehand in 2008 nicely returned to live performances after a long absence from public sharing concert billings with pink and maus chillwave and vaporwave once hypnagogic pop was coined a variety of music blogs immediately wrote about phenomenon by 2010 albums by ariel pink and neon indian were regularly hailed by publications like pitchfork and wire with hypnagogic pop chillwave and glo fi employed to describe evolving sounds of such artists a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles pink was frequently called godfather of hypnagogic chillwave or glo fi as new acts that were associated with him aesthetically personally geographically or professionally attracted notice from critics as movement s popularity grew analogue lo fi aspirations of ferraro and pink were taken up by groups with names like tape deck mountain memory tapes memory cassette and turned into cliche in 2010 rewind issue of wire keenan described year as year that h pop migrated from a process designed to liberate desire from marketing formulas to a carrot in mouth of a corpse that has proved irresistible to underground musicians looking for an easy route to mainstream acceptance chillwave a tag used to describe a similar trend was coined one month before keenan s 2009 article and was originally used synonymously with hypnagogic pop while two styles are similar in that they both evoke 1980s 90s imagery chillwave has a more commercial sound with an emphasis on cheesy hooks and reverb effects keenan described chillwave as one of more meaningless applied to new future pop visions and a much more appropriate description of mindless embracing of mainstream values that h pop has come to be associated with a contemporary review by marc hogan for neon indian s psychic chasms 2009 listed dream beat chillwave glo fi hypnagogic pop and hipster gogic pop as interchangeable terms for psychedelic music that s generally one or all of following synth based homemade sounding 80s referencing cassette oriented sun baked laid back warped hazy emotionally distant slightly out of focus writing for vice morgan described emerging style as making awkward bedfellows out of experimental music enthusiasts and weird progressive pop theorists she described a typical manifestation of style as featuring long tracks saturated with echo delay smothered guitars and amputated synths experimental tendencies of hypnagogic pop artists like pink and ferraro were soon amplified by internet centric genre dubbed vaporwave although name shares wave suffix it is only loosely connected to chillwave stereogums miles bowe summarized vaporwave as a combination of chopped and screwed of dan lopatin with nihilistic easy listening of james ferraro s muzak on 2011 album far side virtual there are several differences and similarities between hypnagogic pop and vaporwave according to adam harper two genres share an affinity for trash music both are dreamy and chirpy and both manipulate their material to defamiliarise it and give it a sense of uncanny such as slowing it down and or lowering pitch making it as term goes screwed of differences vaporwave does not typically engage in long tracks lo fi productions or non sampled material and it draws more from early 1990s than it does 1970s and 1980s critical response simon reynolds described hypnagogic pop as a 21st century update of psychedelia in which lost innocence has been contaminated by pop culture and hyper reality he notes a particular concern with scrambling of pop time suggesting that perhaps secret idea buried inside hypnagogic pop is that 80s never ended that we re still living there subject to that decade s endless end of history adam trainer suggested that style allowed artists to engage with products of media saturated capitalist consumer culture in a way that focuses on affect rather than irony or cynicism adam harper noted among hypnagogic pop artists a tendency to turn trash something shallow and determinedly throwaway into something sacred or mystical and to manipulate their material to defamiliarise it and give it a sense of uncanny genre has been likened to sonic fictions or intentional forgeries creating half baked memories of things that never were approximating imprecise nature of memory itself some artists labeled with hypnagogic pop tag such as neon indian and toro y moi rejected label or denied that such a unified style exists guardians dorian lynskey called hypnagogic tag pretentious new york times writer jon pareles criticized style as annoyingly noncommittal
