before being put into revenue service this was because nyct needed to recover a greater amount of braking energy and reduce power demand peaks with introduction of ac motored cars with capability for regenerative braking a kinetic energy storage system with kess technology was installed and as a result voltage regulation of track improved system provides voltage support to revenue tracks as well as reinforcing voltage of test track during testing of new trains continuing north rockaway line crosses jamaica bay before reaching howard beach distance of between two stations is longest between
