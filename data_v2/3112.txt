babulnath temple as spaces of terror she wrote these display sites which are central to cartography of bombay are turned into nodes of violence and death mazumdar also said film destroyed image of bombay as dream city and turned it into a violent nightmare according to filmfare film blurs lines of black and white for its heroes and adds shades of grey to villain writing as two brothers face off on conflicting sides of morality parinda speaks of themes like family values bonding unemployment illegal trades etc ashish rajadhyaksha and paul willemen note in their book encyclopaedia of indian cinema that parinda represented a postmodern variation of crime genre in hindi cinema film also explores themes of childhood and memory all its major characters are orphans city in film is shattered into dark morbid spaces with all characters framed within a light and shadow zone tapan k ghosh in his book bollywood baddies villains vamps and henchmen in hindi cinema said film showcased sociopolitical scenario of that time and showed smuggling rivalry on a gruesome scale authors nandi and esha chatterjee in their book spectacles of blood a study of masculinity and violence in postcolonial films drew metaphorical similarities between parinda and martin scorsese s crime film mean streets 1973 saying both films explore masculinity of young men who commit violence and reject societal norms because of a lack of guidance through its frequent use of night shots and dark spaces parinda uses aesthetics of film noir in its visual style accolades at 37th national film awards
