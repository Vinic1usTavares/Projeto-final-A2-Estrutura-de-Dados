donna s father geoff in runaway bride filmed several scenes for this episode but died before his scenes for remainder of season were completed producers retired his character out of respect and dedicated him in closing credits for episode producer phil collinson suggested transferring his traits to unrelated character stan mott from voyage of damned and rewriting his role as donna s grandfather executive producers russell t davies and gardner liked idea and recalled bernard cribbins to role to re film attfield s scenes with character renamed as wilfred a name davies favoured for donna s grandfather in time for credits of voyage of damned to be changed writing davies took a different approach while writing episode david tennant and sarah lancashire noted character of miss foster had good intentions but was morally ambiguous premise of adipose pill was equally ambiguous with rare side effects but was a win win situation for anyone involved davies based character of miss foster on supernanny star jo frost and argentine philanthropist and politician eva peron and lancashire compared her character to mary poppins adipose are a different style to regular doctor who villains antagonists such as lazarus in lazarus experiment or werewolf in tooth and claw were singular monsters designed to scare audience adipose were written as cute to provide a bizarre and surreal experience davies made some changes to donna s character character was rounded out from being a shouting fishwife to someone who s quite vulnerable and emotional donna was written to provide a caustic and grown up attitude towards doctor in opposition to rose and martha who fell in love with him tate considered donna to be more equal to doctor because her character did not romanticise him allowing her to question his morality more easily donna s mime in this production script requires catherine tate as donna noble to reintroduce herself to doctor in mime stage directions by writer russell t davies are as follows tate says davies had suggested that she might come up with something on day she improvised her mime during filming filming episode was in fourth production block in season and

further consultation with post production team mill resulted in ears and singular fang each adipose has stephen regelous who won an academy award for his software massive flew to london to supervise creation of crowd special effects regelous a doctor who fan was enthusiastic about helping mill with special effects stating that when i first found out that mill was working on doctor who i was quietly hoping that massive might be used to create hordes of daleks or cybermen and with series 4 i jumped at opportunity to be involved mill created two types of adipose extras with artificial intelligence and independent movement and hero adipose which were hand animated broadcast and reception thumb upright tennant described billie piper s return as a genuine prickle up spine broadcast

preston writing for daily telegraph called episode an undiluted triumph opening his review he said last night s episode struck me as being as close to 50 minutes of pure pleasure as you re likely to get on television he noted episode s clever tackling of topical theme of obesity and its mixture of emotion and special effects in closing he said dejected critic denied even smallest nit to pick walks glumly away scott matthewman of stage lamented that adipose were not threatening enough he liked adipose s execution of miss foster a momentary pause in mid air gravity only kicking in when character looks down comparing it to wile e coyote and chuck jones which was a nice little touch in an episode full of them he also appreciated tate saying that david tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal sam wollaston of guardian wrote that tate was not right for this role and too hysterical too comedy not cool enough and felt her inclusion was an attempt to trade on popularity of her own series and broaden appeal of dr who still further he also found music a bit oppressive but concluded that despite these criticisms show was still awfully nice television keith watson of metro gave episode 4 stars out of 5 he admitted that despite his dislike of tate she isn t that bad his review of adipose was positive citing them as a reason of quality of show closing he said it split his sides jon wise of people said doctor who is a super galactic way of spending a saturday night indoors and appreciated that donna was not romantically interested in doctor unlike martha or rose ben rawson jones gave episode a wholly positive review summarising it as containing pure fantastic family fun delivering a winning blend of action comedy poignancy and one unexpected shock cameo episode received several negative reviews andrew billen writing for times lamented that davies had forgotten that doctor who s main task is to send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with odd philosophical idea occasional classical reference a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty billen also criticised writing and acting but commended tate for a toned down performance alan stanley blair of syfy portal summarised it as a runaway saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story blair found flaws with comedy and music in episode but was impressed with tate s acting and piper s cameo kevin o sullivan of sunday mirror criticised tate and tennant for overacting and had concerns about writing it didn t exactly ooze tension all we got in way of terrifying space enemies was sarah lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies ian hyland of news of world criticised child friendly storyline comparing it to back of a fag packet he also criticised tennant for appearing jaded and tate for still shouting references
