mixed reviews from critics described book for guardian as a comprehensive and occasionally downright hilarious explanation of nordic miracle and praised its companionable lightly mocking tone alwyn turner gave book 4 out of 5 stars in a review for daily telegraph writing that if booth s tone is sometimes a little too jokey his enthusiasm is contagious and that real joy of book lay in collection of interesting trivia literary review bernard porter found book to be a thoroughly entertaining read written brilliantly but criticised its largely impressionistic nature and lack of sources and references ian thomson of guardian described book as informative if strenuously humorous but felt that booth s schoolboy humour was at times pretty embarrassing anna vesterinen writing for rationalist association felt that booth relied too much on quoted studies and surveys and ought to have included more interviews with ordinary locals financial times richard milne wrote that despite booth s tendency to reinforce some stereotypes behind jokey tone is a lot of good material and described book as a welcome rejoinder to those who cling to idea of nordic region as a promised land sara opined in that book s section on iceland was somewhat superficial and that booth s analysis of sweden was too critical but nevertheless while he does make a lot of fun of nordic countries i think you can feel his affection for inhabitants too references category 2014 books category 2014 non fiction books category british travel books category jonathan cape books category nordic countries category
