a spinal cord injury sci is damage to spinal cord that causes temporary or permanent changes in its function symptoms may include loss of muscle function sensation or autonomic function in parts of body served by spinal cord below level of injury injury can occur at any level of spinal cord and can be complete injury with a total loss of sensation and muscle function or incomplete meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past injured area of cord depending on location and severity of damage symptoms vary from numbness to paralysis to incontinence long term outcomes also ranges widely from full recovery to permanent tetraplegia also called quadriplegia or paraplegia complications can include muscle atrophy pressure sores infections and breathing problems in majority of cases damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents gunshot wounds falls or sports injuries but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection insufficient blood flow and tumors just over half of injuries affect cervical spine while 15 occur in each of thoracic spine border between thoracic and lumbar spine and lumbar spine alone diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and medical imaging efforts to prevent sci include individual measures such as using safety equipment societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic and improvements to equipment treatment starts with restricting further motion of spine and maintaining adequate blood pressure corticosteroids have not been found to be useful other interventions vary depending on location and extent of injury from bed rest to surgery in many cases spinal cord injuries require long term physical and occupational therapy especially if it interferes with activities of daily living in united states about 12 000 people a year survive a spinal cord injury most commonly affected group are young adult males sci has seen great improvements in its care since middle of 20th century research into potential treatments includes stem cell implantation engineered materials for tissue support epidural spinal stimulation and wearable robotic exoskeletons classification 90px alt a human spinal alt a person with dermatomes mapped out on effects of injury depend on level along spinal column left a dermatome is an area of skin that sends sensory messages to a specific spinal nerve right 260px alt diagram of vertebrae and spinal nerves exit spinal cord between each pair of vertebrae spinal cord injury can be traumatic or nontraumatic and can be classified into three types based on cause mechanical forces toxic and ischemic from lack of blood flow damage can also be divided into primary and secondary injury cell death that occurs immediately in original injury and biochemical cascades that are initiated by original insult and cause further tissue damage these secondary injury pathways include ischemic cascade inflammation swelling cell suicide and neurotransmitter imbalances they can take place for minutes or weeks following injury at each level of spinal column spinal nerves branch off from either side of spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae to innervate a specific part of body area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome and group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome part of spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to spinal nerves at that level and below injuries can be cervical 1 8 c1 c8 thoracic 1 12 t1 t12 lumbar 1 5 l1 l5 or sacral s1 s5 a person s level of injury is defined as lowest level of full sensation and function paraplegia occurs when legs are affected by spinal cord damage in thoracic lumbar or sacral injuries and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected cervical damage sci is also classified by degree of impairment international standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury published by american spinal injury association asia is widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following sci it is based on neurological responses touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome and strength of muscles that control key motions on both sides of body muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0 5 according to table on right and sensation is graded on a scale of 0 2 0 is no sensation 1 is altered or decreased sensation and 2 is full sensation each side of body is graded independently muscle strength asia impairment scale for classifying spinal cord injury grade muscle function grade description 0no muscle injury no motor or sensory function is preserved in sacral segments s4 or s5 1 muscle incomplete sensory but not motor function is preserved below level of injury including sacral segments 2 full range of motion gravity incomplete motor function is preserved below level of injury and more than half of muscles tested below level of injury have a muscle grade less than 3 see muscle strength scores left 3 full range of motion against gravity incomplete motor function is preserved below level of injury and at least half of key muscles below neurological level have a muscle grade of 3 or more 4 full range of motion against no motor or sensory deficits but deficits existed in past 5 normal strength complete and incomplete injuries level and completeness of injuries complete incomplete 3 34 1 0 18 5 in a complete spinal injury all functions below injured area are lost whether or not spinal cord is severed an incomplete spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below level of injury in spinal cord to be classed as incomplete there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in areas innervated by s4 to s5 e g voluntary external anal sphincter contraction nerves in this area are connected to very lowest region of spinal cord and retaining sensation and function in these parts of body indicates that spinal cord is only partially damaged incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing some degree of sensation is preserved in sacral dermatomes even though sensation may be more impaired in other higher dermatomes below level of lesion sacral sparing has been attributed to fact that sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to lamination of fibers within spinal cord spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality exists when sci is present but there is no evidence of spinal column injury on radiographs spinal column injury is trauma that causes fracture of bone or instability of ligaments in spine this can coexist with or cause injury to spinal cord but each injury can occur without other abnormalities might show up on magnetic resonance imaging mri but term was coined before mri was in common use central cord syndrome thumb right incomplete lesions of spinal cord central cord syndrome top anterior cord syndrome middle and brown sequard syndrome bottom central cord syndrome almost always resulting from damage to cervical spinal cord is characterized by weakness in arms with relative sparing of legs and spared sensation in regions served by sacral segments there is loss of sensation of pain temperature light touch and pressure below level of injury spinal tracts that serve arms are more affected due to their central location in spinal cord while corticospinal fibers destined for legs are spared due to their more external location most common of incomplete sci syndromes central cord syndrome usually results from neck hyperextension in older people with spinal stenosis in younger people it most commonly results from neck flexion most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents however other possible causes include spinal stenosis and impingement on spinal cord by a tumor or vertebral disk anterior cord syndrome anterior cord syndrome due to damage to front portion of spinal cord or reduction in blood supply from anterior spinal artery can be caused by fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks below level of injury motor function pain sensation and temperature sensation are lost while sense of touch and proprioception sense of position in space remain intact these differences are due to relative locations of spinal tracts responsible for each type of function brown sequard syndrome brown sequard syndrome occurs when spinal cord is injured on one side much more than other it is rare for spinal cord to be truly severed on one side but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds such as gunshot or knife wounds or fractured vertebrae or tumors are common on ipsilateral side of injury same side body loses motor function proprioception and senses of vibration and touch on contralateral opposite side of injury there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations posterior cord syndrome posterior cord syndrome in which just dorsal columns of spinal cord are affected is usually seen in cases of chronic myelopathy but can also occur with infarction of posterior spinal artery this rare syndrome causes loss of proprioception and sense of vibration below level of injury while motor function and sensation of pain temperature and touch remain intact usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma dorsalis due to injury to posterior part of spinal cord caused by syphilis results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes conus medullaris syndrome is an injury to end of spinal cord located at about t12 l2 vertebrae in adults this region contains s4 s5 spinal segments responsible for bowel bladder and some sexual functions so these can be disrupted in this type of injury in addition sensation and achilles reflex can be disrupted causes include tumors physical trauma and ischemia cauda equina syndrome ces results from a lesion below level at which spinal cord splits into cauda equina at levels l2 s5 below conus medullaris thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not cord itself however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at same time due to their proximity ces can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome it can cause low back pain weakness or paralysis in lower limbs loss of sensation bowel and bladder dysfunction and loss of reflexes unlike in conus medullaris syndrome symptoms often occur on only one side of body cause is often compression e g by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor since nerves damaged in ces are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from spinal cord injury has better prognosis for recovery of function peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than central nervous system signs and symptoms actions of spinal nerves level motor function c1 flexors c1 extensors c3 c4 diaphragm mostly c4 c5 shoulder raise arm deltoid flex elbow biceps c6 externally rotate arm c6 elbow and wrist triceps and wrist extensors pronate wrist c7 wrist supply small muscles of hand t1 and trunk above waist t7 muscles l1 thigh l2 l3 l4 adduct thigh extend leg at knee quadriceps l4 l5 thigh flex leg at knee hamstrings foot anterior extend toes l5 s1 leg at hip maximus plantar flex foot and flex toes signs observed by a clinician and symptoms experienced by a patient vary depending on where spine is injured and extent of injury a section of skin innervated through a specific part of spine is called a dermatome and injury to that part of spine can cause pain numbness or a loss of sensation in related areas a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of skin is another symptom a person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it a group of muscles innervated through a specific part of spine is called a myotome and injury to that part of spinal cord can cause problems with movements that involve those muscles muscles may contract uncontrollably spasticity become weak or be completely paralysed spinal shock loss of neural activity including reflexes below level of injury occurs shortly after injury and usually goes away within a day an erection of penis may be a sign of acute spinal cord injury specific parts of body affected by loss of function are determined by level of injury some signs such as bowel and bladder dysfunction can occur at any level neurogenic bladder involves a compromised ability to empty bladder and is a common symptom of spinal cord injury this can lead to high pressures in bladder that can damage kidneys lumbosacral effects of injuries at or above lumbar or sacral regions of spinal cord lower back and pelvis include decreased control of legs and hips genitourinary system and anus people injured below level l2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles bowel and bladder function are regulated by sacral region it is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury as well as dysfunction of bowel and bladder including fecal and urinary incontinence thoracic in addition to problems found in lower level injuries thoracic chest height spinal lesions can affect muscles in trunk injuries at level of t1 to t8 result in inability to control abdominal muscles trunk stability may be affected even more so in higher level injuries lower level of injury less extensive its effects injuries from t9 to t12 result in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control thoracic spinal injuries result in paraplegia but function of hands arms and neck are not affected one condition that occurs typically in lesions above t6 level is autonomic dysreflexia ad in which blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke it results from an overreaction of system to a stimulus such as pain below level of injury because inhibitory signals from brain cannot pass lesion to dampen excitatory sympathetic nervous system response signs and symptoms of ad include anxiety headache nausea ringing in ears blurred vision flushed skin and nasal congestion it can occur shortly after injury or not until years later other autonomic functions may also be disrupted for example problems with body temperature regulation mostly occur in injuries at t8 and above another serious complication that can result from lesions above t6 is neurogenic shock which results from an interruption in output from sympathetic nervous system responsible for maintaining muscle tone in blood vessels without sympathetic input vessels relax and dilate neurogenic shock presents with dangerously low blood pressure low heart rate and blood pooling in limbs which results in insufficient blood flow to spinal cord and potentially further damage to it cervical spinal cord injuries at cervical neck level result in full or partial tetraplegia also called quadriplegia depending on specific location and severity of trauma limited function may be retained function after complete cervical spinal cord injury level motor function respiratory function c1 c4 full paralysis of limbs cannot breathe without mechanical ventilation of wrists hands and coughing may need help clearing secretions of wrist flexors triceps and hands c7 hand muscle weakness difficulty grasping and releasing additional signs and symptoms of cervical injuries include low heart rate low blood pressure problems regulating body temperature and breathing dysfunction if injury is high enough in neck to impair muscles involved in breathing person may not be able to breathe without help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator complications complications of spinal cord injuries include pulmonary edema respiratory failure neurogenic shock and paralysis below injury site in long term loss of muscle function can have additional effects from disuse including atrophy of muscle immobility can lead to pressure sores particularly in bony areas requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours in acute setting to relieve pressure in long term people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure another complication is pain including pain indication of potential or actual tissue damage and pain when nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals in absence of noxious stimuli spasticity uncontrollable of muscles below level of injury occurs in 65 78 of chronic sci it results from lack of input from brain that muscle responses to stretch reflexes it can be treated with drugs and physical therapy spasticity increases risk of contractures shortening of muscles tendons or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb this problem can be prevented by moving limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure loss of bone density bone demineralization thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles can increase risk of fractures conversely a poorly understood phenomenon is overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas called ossification it occurs below level of injury possibly as a result of inflammation and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27 of people thumb left muscle mass is reduced as muscles atrophy with disuse people with sci are at especially high risk for respiratory and cardiovascular problems so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them respiratory problems especially pneumonia are leading cause of death in people with sci followed by infections usually of pressure sores urinary tract infections and respiratory infections pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath fever and anxiety another potentially deadly threat to respiration is deep venous thrombosis dvt in which blood forms a clot in immobile limbs clot can break off and form a pulmonary embolism lodging in lung and cutting off blood supply to it dvt is an especially high risk in sci particularly within 10 days of injury occurring in over 13 in acute care setting preventative measures include anticoagulants pressure hose and moving patient s limbs usual signs and symptoms of dvt and pulmonary embolism may be masked in sci cases due to effects such as alterations in pain perception and nervous system functioning urinary tract infection uti is another risk that may not display usual symptoms pain urgency and frequency it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity risk of uti likely most common complication in long term is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters catheterization may be necessary because sci interferes with bladder s ability to empty when it gets too full which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage bladder permanently use of intermittent catheterization to empty bladder at regular intervals throughout day has decreased mortality due to kidney failure from uti in first world but it is still a serious problem in developing countries an estimated 24 45 of people with sci suffer disorders of depression and suicide rate is as much as six times that of rest of population risk of suicide is worst in first five years after injury in young people with sci suicide is leading cause of death depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as uti and pressure ulcers that occur more when self care is neglected causes thumb falling as a part of recreational activities can cause spinal cord injuries spinal cord injuries are most often caused by physical trauma forces involved can be forward movement of head hyperextension backward movement lateral stress sideways movement rotation twisting of head compression force along axis of spine downward from head or upward from pelvis or distraction pulling apart of vertebrae traumatic sci can result in contusion compression or stretch injury it is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture pre existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits such as hemiparesis to result from otherwise minor trauma in us motor vehicle accidents are most common cause of scis second are falls then violence such as gunshot wounds then sports injuries in some countries falls are more common even surpassing vehicle crashes as leading cause of sci rates of violence related sci depend heavily on place and time of all sports related scis shallow water dives are most common cause winter sports and water sports have been increasing as causes while association football and trampoline injuries have been declining hanging can cause injury to cervical spine as may occur in attempted suicide military conflicts are another cause and when they occur they are associated with increased rates of sci another potential cause of sci is iatrogenic injury caused by an improperly done medical procedure such as an injection into spinal column sci can also be of a nontraumatic origin nontraumatic lesions cause anywhere from 30 to 80 of all sci percentage varies by locale influenced by efforts to prevent trauma developed countries have higher percentages of sci due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries in developed countries most common cause of nontraumatic sci is degenerative diseases followed by tumors in many developing countries leading cause is infection such as hiv and tuberculosis sci may occur in intervertebral disc disease and spinal cord vascular disease spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of protective membranes that line cord and intervertebral disks can herniate damage can result from dysfunction of blood vessels as in arteriovenous malformation or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to cord when systemic blood pressure drops blood flow to spinal cord may be reduced potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in areas supplied by affected level of spinal cord congenital conditions and tumors that compress cord can also cause sci as can vertebral and ischemia multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage spinal cord as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis herpes zoster or herpes simplex meningitis and syphilis prevention vehicle related sci is prevented with measures including societal and individual efforts to reduce driving under influence of drugs or alcohol distracted driving and drowsy driving other efforts include increasing road safety such as marking hazards and adding lighting and vehicle safety both to prevent accidents such as routine maintenance and brakes and to mitigate damage of crashes such as head restraints air bags seat belts and child safety seats falls can be prevented by making changes to environment such as materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers railings for stairs child and safety gates for windows gun related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training gun safety education campaigns and changes to technology of guns such as trigger locks to improve their safety sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head first tackling in association football diagnosis a person s presentation in context of trauma or non traumatic background determines suspicion for a spinal cord injury features are namely paralysis sensory loss or both at any level other symptoms may include incontinence a radiographic evaluation using an x ray ct scan or mri can determine if there is damage to spinal column and where it is located x rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of spinal column but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage thus when x ray findings are normal but sci is still suspected due to pain or sci symptoms ct or mri scans are used ct gives greater detail than x rays but exposes patient to more radiation and it still does not give images of spinal cord or ligaments mri shows body structures in greatest detail thus it is standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in sci or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury neurological evaluations to help determine degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly in early stages of treatment this determines rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis asia impairment scale outlined above is used to determine level and severity of injury management prehospital treatment thumb spine motion restriction with a long spine board first stage in management of a suspected spinal cord injury is geared toward basic life support and preventing further injury maintaining airway breathing and circulation and restricting further motion of spine in emergency setting most people who has been subjected to forces strong enough to cause sci are treated as though they have instability in spinal column and have spinal motion restricted to prevent damage to spinal cord injuries or fractures in head neck or pelvis as well as penetrating trauma near spine and falls from heights are assumed to be associated with an unstable spinal column until it is ruled out in hospital high speed vehicle crashes sports injuries involving head or neck and diving injuries are other mechanisms that indicate a high sci risk since head and spinal trauma frequently coexist anyone who is unconscious or has a lowered level of consciousness as a result of a head injury is spinal motion restricted a rigid cervical collar is applied to neck and head is held with blocks on either side and person is strapped to a backboard extrication devices are used to move people without excessively moving spine if they are still inside a vehicle or other confined space use of a cervical collar has been shown to increase mortality in people with penetrating trauma and is thus not routinely recommended in this group modern trauma care includes a step called clearing cervical spine ruling out spinal cord injury if patient is fully conscious and not under influence of drugs or alcohol displays no neurological deficits has no pain in middle of neck and no other painful injuries that could distract from neck pain if these are all absent no spinal motion restriction is necessary if an unstable spinal column injury is moved damage may occur to spinal cord between 3 and 25 of scis occur not at time of initial trauma but later during treatment or transport while some of this is due to nature of injury itself particularly in case of multiple or massive trauma some of it reflects failure to adequately restrict motion of spine sci can impair body s ability to keep warm so warming blankets may be needed early hospital treatment initial care in hospital as in prehospital setting aims to ensure adequate airway breathing cardiovascular function and spinal motion restriction imaging of spine to determine presence of a sci may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize other life threatening injuries acute sci merits treatment in an intensive care unit especially injuries to cervical spinal cord people with sci need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons people should be removed from spine board as rapidly as possible to prevent complications from its use if systolic blood pressure falls below 90 mmhg within days of injury blood supply to spinal cord may be reduced resulting in further damage thus it is important to maintain blood pressure which may be done using intravenous fluids and vasopressors vasopressors used include dopamine or norepinephrine mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmhg for seven days after injury treatment for shock from blood loss is different from that for neurogenic shock and could harm people with latter type so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock however it is also possible for both causes to exist at same time another important aspect of care is prevention of insufficient oxygen in bloodstream which could deprive spinal cord of oxygen people with cervical or high thoracic injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate treatment to speed it may include atropine corticosteroid medication methylprednisolone has been studied for use in sci with hope of limiting swelling and secondary injury as there does not appear to be long term benefits and medication is associated with risks such as gastrointestinal bleeding and infection its use is not recommended as of 2018 its use in traumatic brain injury is also not recommended surgery may be necessary e g to relieve excess pressure on cord to stabilize spine or to put vertebrae back in their proper place in cases involving instability or compression failing to operate can lead to worsening of condition surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on cord such as bone fragments blood material from ligaments or intervertebral discs or a lodged object from a penetrating injury although ideal timing of surgery is still debated studies have found that earlier surgical intervention within 24 hours of injury is associated with better outcomes sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early surgery is controversial because it has potential complications such as infection so in cases where it is not clearly needed e g cord is being compressed doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of patient s condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits in cases where a more conservative approach is chosen bed rest cervical collars motion restriction devices and optionally traction are used surgeons may opt to put traction on spine to remove pressure from spinal cord by putting dislocated vertebrae back into alignment but herniation of intervertebral disks may prevent this technique from relieving pressure gardner wells tongs are one tool used to exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or dislocation and to reduce motion to affected areas rehabilitation sci patients often require extended treatment in specialized spinal unit or an intensive care unit rehabilitation process typically begins in acute care setting usually inpatient phase lasts 8 12 weeks and then outpatient rehabilitation phase lasts 3 12 months after that followed by yearly medical and functional evaluation physical therapists occupational therapists recreational therapists nurses social workers psychologists and other health care professionals work as a team under coordination of a to decide on goals with patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for person s condition thumb left orthopedic devices such as ankle foot orthoses can aid in walking in acute phase physical therapists focus on patient s respiratory status prevention of indirect complications such as pressure ulcers maintaining range of motion and keeping available musculature active for people whose injuries are high enough to interfere with breathing there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery weakness of respiratory muscles impairs ability to cough effectively allowing secretions to accumulate within lungs as sci patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques e g apical breathing glossopharyngeal breathing that typically are not taught to healthy individuals physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations postural drainage respiratory muscle training and assisted cough techniques patients are taught to increase their intra abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions quad cough technique is done lying on back with therapist applying pressure on abdomen in rhythm of cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction include respiratory muscle pacing use of a constricting abdominal binder ventilator assisted speech and mechanical ventilation amount of functional recovery and independence achieved in terms of activities of daily living recreational activities and employment is affected by level and severity of injury functional independence measure fim is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate function of patients throughout rehabilitation process following a spinal cord injury or other serious illness or injury it can track a patient s progress and degree of independence during rehabilitation people with sci may need to use specialized devices and to make modifications to their environment in order to handle activities of daily living and to function independently weak joints can be stabilized with devices such as ankle foot orthoses afos and knee afos but walking may still require a lot of effort increasing activity will increase chances of recovery prognosis thumb holly koester incurred a spinal injury as a result of a motor vehicle collision and is now a wheelchair racer spinal cord injuries generally result in at least some incurable impairment even with best possible treatment best predictor of prognosis is level and completeness of injury as measured by asia impairment scale neurological score at initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is best predictor of how much function will return most people with asia scores of a complete injuries do not have functional motor recovery but improvement can occur most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function chances of recovering ability to walk improve with each ais grade found at initial examination e g an asia d score confers a better chance of walking than a score of c symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of outcome a person with a mild incomplete injury at t5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe complete injury at exactly same place of incomplete sci syndromes brown sequard and central cord syndromes have best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has worst people with nontraumatic causes of sci have been found to be less likely to suffer complete injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis and to have shorter hospital stays their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic sci upon hospital admission but when they were tested upon discharge those with traumatic sci had improved such that both groups results were same in addition to completeness and level of injury age and concurrent health problems affect extent to which a person with sci will be able to live independently and to walk however in general people with injuries to l3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally and below to walk around house with bracing and c7 and below to live independently new therapies are beginning to provide hope for better outcomes in patients with sci but most are in experimental translational stage one important predictor of motor recovery in an area is presence of sensation there particularly pain perception most motor recovery occurs in first year post injury but modest improvements can continue for years sensory recovery is more limited recovery is typically quickest during first six months spinal shock in which reflexes are suppressed occurs immediately after injury and resolves largely within three months but continues resolving gradually for another 15 sexual dysfunction after spinal injury is common problems that can occur include erectile dysfunction loss of ability to ejaculate insufficient lubrication of vagina and reduced sensation and impaired ability to orgasm despite this many people learn ways to adapt their sexual practices so they can lead satisfying sex lives although life expectancy has improved with better care options it is still not as good as uninjured population higher level of injury and more complete injury greater reduction in life expectancy mortality is very elevated within a year of injury epidemiology worldwide number of new cases since 1995 of sci ranges from 10 4 to 83 people per million per year this wide range of numbers is probably partly due to differences among regions in whether and how injuries are reported in north america about 39 people per every million incur sci traumatically each year and in western europe incidence is 16 per million in united states incidence of spinal cord injury has been estimated to be about 40 cases per 1 million people per year or around 12 000 cases per year in china incidence is approximately 60 000 per year estimated number of people living with sci in world ranges from 236 to per million estimates vary widely due to differences in how data are collected and what techniques are used to extrapolate figures little information is available from asia and even less from africa and south america in western europe estimated prevalence is 300 per million people and in north america it is 853 per million it is estimated at 440 per million in iran 526 per million in iceland and 681 per million in australia in united states there are between 225 000 and 296 000 individuals living with spinal cord injuries and different studies have estimated prevalences from 525 to 906 per million sci is present in about 2 of all cases of blunt force trauma anyone who has undergone force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is at high risk for other injuries also in 44 of sci cases other serious injuries are sustained at same time 14 of sci patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma abdominal trauma pelvic fractures and long bone fractures males account for four out of five traumatic spinal cord injuries most of these injuries occur in men under 30 years of age average age at time of injury has slowly increased from about 29 years in 1970s to 41 rates of injury are at their lowest in children at their highest in late teens to early twenties then get progressively lower in older age groups however rates may rise in elderly in sweden between 50 and 70 of all cases of sci occur in people under 30 and 25 occur in those over 50 while sci rates are highest among people age 15 20 fewer than 3 of scis occur in people under 15 neonatal sci occurs in one in 60 000 births e g from breech births or injuries by forceps difference in rates between sexes diminishes in injuries at age 3 and younger same number of girls are injured as boys or possibly more another cause of pediatric injury is child abuse such as shaken baby syndrome for children most common cause of sci 56 is vehicle crashes high numbers of adolescent injuries are attributable in a large part to traffic accidents and sports injuries for people over 65 falls are most common cause of traumatic sci elderly and people with severe arthritis are at high risk for sci because of defects in spinal column in nontraumatic sci gender difference is smaller average age of occurrence is greater and incomplete lesions are more common history thumb right ancient egyptian edwin smith papyrus is earliest known description of sci sci has been known to be devastating for millennia ancient egyptian edwin smith papyrus from 2500 bc first known description of injury says it is not to be treated hindu texts dating back to 1800 bc also mention sci and describe traction techniques to straighten spine greek physician hippocrates born in fifth century bc described sci in his hippocratic corpus and invented traction devices to straighten dislocated vertebrae but it was not until aulus cornelius celsus born 30 bc noted that a cervical injury resulted in rapid death that spinal cord itself was implicated in condition in second century ad greek physician galen experimented on monkeys and reported that a horizontal cut through spinal cord caused them to lose all sensation and motion below level of cut seventh century greek physician paul of aegina described surgical techniques for treatment of broken vertebrae by removing bone fragments as well as surgery to relieve pressure on spine little medical progress was made during middle ages in europe it was not until renaissance that spine and nerves were accurately depicted in human anatomy drawings by leonardo da vinci and andreas vesalius in 1762 a surgeon named andre louis removed a bullet from lumbar spine of a patient who regained motion in legs in 1829 surgeon gilpin smith performed a successful that improved patient s sensation however idea that sci was untreatable remained predominant until early 20th century in 1934 mortality rate in first two years after injury was over 80 mostly due to infections of urinary tract and pressure sores it was not until latter half of century that breakthroughs in imaging surgery medical care and rehabilitation medicine contributed to a substantial improvement in sci care relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since mid 20th century due mainly to emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients creation of emergency medical services to professionally transport people to hospital is given partial credit for an improvement in outcomes since 1970s improvements in care have been accompanied by increased life expectancy of people with sci survival times have improved by about 2000 since 1940 in 2015 2016 23 of people in nine spinal injury centres in england had their discharge delayed because of disputes about who should pay for equipment they needed research directions scientists are investigating various avenues for treatment of spinal cord injury therapeutic research is focused on two main areas neuroprotection and former seeks to prevent harm that occurs from secondary injury in minutes to weeks following insult and latter aims to reconnect broken circuits in spinal cord to allow function to return neuroprotective drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation damage by free radicals excitotoxicity neuronal damage by excessive glutamate signaling and apoptosis cell suicide several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways like these are under investigation in human clinical trials thumb left human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells seen under phase contrast microscope 63 x magnification stem cell transplantation is an important avenue for sci research goal is to replace lost spinal cord cells allow reconnection in broken neural circuits by regrowing axons and to create an environment in tissues that is favorable to growth a key avenue of sci research is research on stem cells which can differentiate into other types of cells including those lost after sci types of cells being researched for use in sci include embryonic stem cells neural stem cells mesenchymal stem cells olfactory cells schwann cells activated macrophages and induced pluripotent stem cells hundreds of stem cell studies have been done in humans with promising but inconclusive results an ongoing phase 2 trial in 2016 presented data showing that after 90 days 2 out of 4 subjects had already improved two motor levels and had thus already achieved its endpoint of 2 5 patients improving two levels within 6 12 months six month data is expected in january 2017 another type of approach is tissue engineering using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose they fall into two categories and nanofibers these materials can also be used as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues one avenue being explored to allow paralyzed people to walk and to aid in rehabilitation of those with some walking ability is use of wearable powered robotic exoskeletons devices which have motorized joints are put on over legs and supply a source of power to move and walk several such devices are already available for sale but investigation is still underway as to how they can be made more useful preliminary studies of epidural spinal cord for motor complete injuries have demonstrated some improvement see also paralyzed veterans of america references bibliography external links category medical
