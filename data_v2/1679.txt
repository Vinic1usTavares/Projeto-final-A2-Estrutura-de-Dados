am2r was developed by milton guasti under pseudonym over course of about ten years although with several periods of no work done on game guasti wanted to recreate fast gameplay of metroid zero mission and atmosphere and solitude of super metroid after having finished metroid ii for first time he imagined it to be cool to play game with modern gameplay an in game mini map rather than with a physical map on one s lap and omega metroids as tall as screen as guasti was not a programmer at time he used a trial and error method to modify a platforming game engine by martin within game creation system gamemaker with learning being his main motivation for working on game at first remake followed original metroid ii map layout and already existing sprites from metroid zero mission and super metroid as guasti kept working on game engine and polished each ability he felt that am2r started to seem more and more authentic after game had been made public several artists contacted guasti and volunteered to create original art for game metroid evolutions were redesigned and new enemies and areas unrelated to other metroid games were added he remade music himself while waiting for customers in his recording studio added log system was designed to deliver narrative in a non intrusive way because so much was changed in am2r compared to original metroid ii with color a larger screen less claustrophobic caves and new gameplay controls guasti was faced with challenge of recreating original s feeling of danger within a more modern style metroid ii featured tight quarters combat while am2r greater amount of screen space and mobility meant that metroids behavior had to be changed they were made more agile and aggressive with intent that players would have to use all tools available to them to defeat them scale of rooms throughout game world also had to be changed with some landmarks being redesigned to make better use of larger screen some however were kept similar in size to their metroid ii counterparts while game s first areas were made colorful and accurate to their counterparts in metroid ii later areas were expanded and introduced new elements featuring progressively darker caves tighter passages and metroids found in more dangerous locations this along with increasingly darker and menacing music was to recreate feeling of metroid ii which guasti described as being lost in a dark mysterious cave without knowing what s ahead in latter parts of game s development largest challenge was to coordinate guasti s and his collaborators work when guasti started working as a programmer he learned about project management and applied it to am2r but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated as everyone was working on game free in their spare time in late 2014 project was ported to newer version gamemaker studio which enabled improved loading times and performance but required complete rewriting of some features and changes to designs of some levels this move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make leaving development progress in a more expedient and productive state later in same year developers worked on improving visuals giving fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality release guasti released a first demo in late 2011 and another in early 2013 full game was released free following a countdown through its website on august 6 2016 coinciding with metroid series 30th anniversary updated versions with further improvements and features were planned but shortly after first release nintendo sent dmca notices to websites hosting it download links on game s website were removed on august 7 but guasti said that he planned to work on game privately he said he understood nintendo s need to protect its intellectual properties and encouraged am2r players to buy official nintendo eshop release of metroid ii on september 2 guasti received a dmca takedown request from nintendo and announced that he had ended development he released soundtrack later that month including several tracks intended for unfinished version 1 2 update development of game was

that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with nintendo s games zack furniss of destructoid liked game to point that he thought nintendo should use some ideas from it in future metroid titles jonathan holmes also at destructoid said that am2r does a good job at filling void left by nintendo s lack of new 2d metroid games calling it even more of an extensive re imagining than metroid zero mission was to metroid 1 lopes at nintendo life said that game was a great way to celebrate series 30th anniversary and a dream come true for metroid fans and that he imagined people would be willing to pay money for it if sold on nintendo s eshop matthew castle at nintendo gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right tom sykes at pc gamer praised am2r as a great game in its own right regardless of whether one had played metroid ii prior or not nf magazine tony ponce initially worried that game would lose eerie charm of metroid ii but found it to be able to keep a high tension feeling as well as including new things for longtime fans of original furniss found that gameplay changes compared to original metroid ii such as ability to grab onto ledges all felt natural and called user interface sleek he liked log system calling it one of biggest additions and enjoyed how opening added more story content while not being overdone instead feeling like opening to super metroid holmes commended boss battles calling them arguably best across all 2d metroid games ponce found precise win conditions for metroid battles annoying considering how often they are fought but similarly thought that new non metroid bosses were among most exciting and challenging in all 2d games in series his favorite new gameplay elements were gimmicks such as player operated tunneling drill machine and walker robot minigame machkovech said that game looks phenomenal and that its beautiful easily discernible sprites and 60 frames per second animations made it look modern despite resolution he particularly enjoyed game s color palette saying that it made am2r feel like a completely new game furniss called game gorgeous praising colors and increased graphical detail alec meer at rock paper shotgun said that game looked lovely and that it was a large improvement over game boy version s green screen jeffrey matulef writing for eurogamer found it impressive how closely game
