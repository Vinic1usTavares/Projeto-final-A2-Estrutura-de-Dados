advertisements for sabre wulf in april 1984 company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements they had already prepared knight lore third game in sabreman series in advance of character s introduction in sabre wulf ultimate withheld knight lore for about a year because they felt sabre wulf would not have sold as well once players saw former s graphical advancements knight lore

would have similar legacies magazine wrote that their inability to intuit sabreman s current inventory or resistance to damage added to game s mystique and that ultimate was particularly skilled at not giving hints but leaving sufficient clues through game s design personal computer games found one such tip that indigenous enemies make a sound when aligned with an amulet piece in a similar experience popular computing weekly slowly learned to use rather than avoid orchids cvg described game s instructions as cryptic crash later reflected that comparisons to atic atac at its launch were unfair similar to calling any two text adventures identical critics had high praise for colourful and detailed graphics and animations in opinion of cvg reviewers sabre wulf carried ultimate s

sabre wulf to an interactive maze packed with colour and hack and slash gameplay magazine likened game s colour choice and setting to what magazine considered ultimate s best arcade game dingo 1983
