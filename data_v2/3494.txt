obtain it began production in 1994 and was first product developed by meretzky s company boffo games production was troubled thanks to a 100 million securities fraud scandal at media vision which led to project s sale to virgin during development boffo discovered that hodj n podj appealed to a wider demographic than meretzky s past work and meretzky has since cited it as an early casual game selling 40 000 to 50 000 units hodj n podj was commercially unsuccessful reviewers found game simplistic but enjoyable although computer gaming world criticized its reuse of minigames from titles like dr brain series retrospectively meretzky has called hodj n podj a career turning point that led him toward casual game development and an inspiration for his subsequent work with worldwinner and playdom in 2009 he reported that hodj n podj continued to receive as many fan letters as all of his other games combined gameplay and plot thumb left player seeks to win at battlefish minigame a

and steal princesses by succeeding in a competitive minigame development and release after spending several years as a contractor for legend entertainment designer steve meretzky started company boffo games with two of his friends in 1994 discussions about this venture had begun in 1993 but final decision was made after media vision an american electronics manufacturer offered group a lucrative multi game contract in january 1994 as a result developer was founded in february hodj n podj became boffo s first project under media vision which acted as its publisher it was highest budget production of meretzky s career at that time later surpassed by space bar and was first project on which he acted only as a designer rather than as a designer and programmer according to boffo co founder mike dornbrook hodj n podj concept was chosen in order to meet a difficult deadline proposed by media vision which wanted boffo s first title finished by august 1994 simplicity of hodj n podj made it viable in this timeframe in part because its segmented structure allowed numerous programmers to develop different sections of game simultaneously its completion date was ultimately set for september 30 following closure of his employer infocom meretzky had conceived hodj n podj in summer 1989 five or more years before project began his initial goal was to revive all those fun simple games which had pretty much disappeared at time to increase its value he believed it needed a structure that tied together its minigames and this inspired its storyline and board game motif its story written was in style of fractured fairy tales from rocky and bullwinkle show meretzky later noted that other companies beat him to reviving these games in years between hodj n podjs conception and release and saw success without using any overarching structures however he still felt very happy creatively with final design of his project as production of hodj n podj progressed team began to suspect that it was going to appeal to a very different gaming audience according to meretzky they discovered that an unexpected number of female players families and non gamers reacted with praise toward game compared to meretzky s past projects in a post release letter to computer gaming world meretzky wrote f or first time i have designed a game which my 4 year old daughter and my 70 year old mother both enjoy he has retrospectively called hodj n podj an example of a casual game on may 10 after three months of development reports broke that media vision was being scrutinized by federal bureau of investigation it became public that company had engaged in a 100 million securities fraud which meretzky later called kind of a mini enron media vision filed for bankruptcy in july but boffo was able to proceed with hodj n podj during publisher s dissolution because much of its funding had come as a down payment ultimately bankruptcy estate opted to give boffo enough money to complete game and then liquidate final product as this would be more profitable than canceling it mid development it was finished around second week of october 1994 below its expected budget following bids from companies such as bmg interactive and ocean software hodj n podj was purchased at auction by virgin interactive alongside titles daedalus encounter and rivers of dawn united states bankruptcy court overseeing media vision s case delayed final sale of hodj n podj to december virgin obtained game on 9th a point deemed too late in holiday shopping season to justify a launch in addition none of game s packaging had been created as a result game missed 1994 hodj n podj ultimately debuted in march 1995 dornbrook explained that virgin had pushed its release back from january to avoid a conflict with launch of its game 11th hour which was ultimately delayed boffo s title was released with what meretzky considered a half hearted marketing effort by virgin dornbrook remarked that it was really launched with no marketing support as a result of corporate restructuring at publisher and that game s pr was actually done completely by us like other games of time hodj n podj was sold through traditional retail channels which meretzky later believed to be a mistake he argued in 2009 retail channel evolved and eventually perfected art of selling hardcore games to a hardcore audience but it was horribly inadequate for selling any other type of game or reaching any other demographic reception hodj n podj sold between 40 000 and 50 000 copies which meretzky later called a disappointing number even in much smaller games market of time despite its low sales it went on to surpass all of his other games in its number of fan letters by 2009 he still received as many fan letters about hodj n podj as rest of his gameography put together he said in 2005 that hodj n podj was his only game that he could play for enjoyment and that he continued to play it with my kids every now and then ann m marcus of electronic entertainment summarized hodj n podj as charming and considered it an exquisitely illustrated hilariously funny medieval romp despite some minor quibbles she considered game a true delight reviewer for next generation wrote that it won t appeal to those hungry for action but that it was ideal for laid back fun on a rainy afternoon in entertainment weekly bob strauss summarized this impeccable british production is one of those rare cd roms that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults and its simple menu driven interface guarantees that you ll keep it on your hard drive long after your other software has vanished william r trotter of pc gamer us wrote don t expect too much from this game it breaks no new ground pushes no envelopes and veteran gamers will no doubt be bored by parts of it however he argued that players who accept hodj n podj in spirit in which it is offered will derive considerable delight in playing it especially if you have kids computer gaming worlds charles ardai found game s use of traditional games downright baffling given their presence in past compilations as well as in sam max hit road and dr brain series although he enjoyed game s graphics and humor he summarized you ve seen all puzzles before often done better than they re done here how jazzed can you get about life or solitaire anyway legacy a sequel to hodj n podj was commissioned by virgin interactive before first game s release and development began in late 1994 funded by boffo games earlier payment from media vision project was canceled after virgin s restructuring in early 1995 according to mike dornbrook an offer for sequel was made later in 1995 by sanctuary woods in august 2000 steve meretzky joined worldwinner as a game designer among draws of job in his view was that it allowed him to create games very reminiscent of kind of games in hodj n podj he has cited game as a career turning point which led him away from adventure games and toward casual game market while working at playdom on role playing game sorority life he took direct inspiration from hodj n podjs implementation of minigames into an overarching structure sorority life was a success which meretzky saw as proof that hodj n podjs commercial failure was caused by marketing and distribution factors rather than design flaws references external links article
