thrasybulus brave willed c 440 388 bc was an athenian general and democratic leader in 411 bc in wake of an oligarchic coup at athens pro democracy sailors at samos elected him as a general making him a primary leader of successful democratic resistance to that coup as general he was responsible for recalling controversial nobleman alcibiades from exile and two worked together extensively over next several years in 411 and 410 thrasybulus commanded along with alcibiades and others at several critical athenian naval victories after athens defeat in peloponnesian war thrasybulus led democratic resistance to new oligarchic government known as thirty tyrants which victorious spartans imposed on athens in 404 bc he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded spartan ruled attica and in successive battles defeated first a spartan garrison and then forces of oligarchy in wake of these victories democracy was re established at athens as a leader of this revived democracy in 4th century bc thrasybulus advocated a policy of resistance to sparta and sought to restore athens imperial power he was killed in 388 bc while leading an athenian naval force during corinthian war personal life and early career almost nothing is known of thrasybulus s background or early life his father was named thucydides peloponnesian war 8 75 2 and he was a native of deme of in athens xenophon hellenica 4 8 he was probably born between 455 and 441 bc although a date as late as late 430s bc cannot be ruled out he was married and had two children several facts make it clear that he was from a wealthy family he held office of trierarch thucydides peloponnesian war 8 73 4 which involved significant personal expenditures on several occasions and in 4th century bc his son was able to pay a substantial fine of 10 talents demosthenes on false embassy 280 by 411 bc thrasybulus was clearly established to some degree as a pro democracy politician as events discussed below make clear he is not mentioned in any sources before 411 so it is impossible to present a picture of his actions as a politician thrasybulus consistently advocated several policies throughout his career he was an advocate of athenian imperialism and expansionism and a strong supporter of democracy he seems to have been an unspectacular public speaker although plutarch notes that he had loudest voice of athenians plutarch life of alcibiades during his period of prominence within democracy he seems to have led what might now be termed a populist faction all otherwise information in this section is from r j buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy according to historical account provided by xenophon he is murdered as an acting general of a military expedition on its way to rhodes on a stopover in aspendus on eurymedon river during night by angry inhabitants of that area for his soldiers recent transgressions of excess against local farmers and their farmsteads coup of 411 bc in 413 bc a massive athenian expedition force was completely obliterated in sicily in wake of this defeat athens found itself facing a crisis of unprecedented magnitude cities throughout its aegean empire began to rebel and a peloponnesian fleet sailed to assist them seeking to contain crisis athens tapped its reserve fund to rebuild its fleet and dispatched what ships it had to establish an advance naval base at samos in this general atmosphere of crisis aristocrats at athens who had long desired to overthrow democracy there began to agitate publicly for a change of government and formed a conspiracy to bring an oligarchy to power in athens their plans included recalling alcibiades who had been exiled by democratic government these oligarchs initiated their plans at samos where they successfully encouraged a number of samian oligarchs to begin a similar conspiracy thucydides peloponnesian war 8 73 a dispute has arisen among modern historians over thrasybulus involvement in this plot donald kagan has suggested that thrasybulus was one of founding members of scheme and was willing to support moderate oligarchy but was alienated by extreme actions taken by plotters donald kagan peloponnesian war 385 r j buck on other hand maintains that thrasybulus was probably never involved in plot possibly because he was absent from samos at time of its inception r j buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 27 28 upon their return to athens conspirators succeeded in ending democratic rule and imposing an oligarchy of 400 rulers at samos however coup did not go forward so smoothly samian democrats learned of conspiracy and notified four prominent athenians generals leon and thrasybulus and thrasyllus at that time a hoplite in ranks with support of these men and athenian soldiers in general samian democrats were able to defeat conspirators when they attempted to seize power a ship was dispatched to athens to notify city of this success against oligarchs upon its arrival however crew was arrested as news of a democratic victory was far from welcome to new oligarchic government learning of this army at samos deposed its generals and elected new generals who were believed to be more steadfast in their support of democracy thrasybulus and thrasyllus among them army stating that they had not revolted from city but that city had revolted from them resolved to stand by democracy while continuing to prosecute war against sparta thucydides peloponnesian war 8 76 one of first actions thrasybulus took as general was to bring about recall of alcibiades a policy that he had supported since before coup after persuading sailors to support his plan thrasybulus sailed to retrieve alcibiades and returned with him to samos aim of this policy was to win away persian support from spartans as it was believed that alcibiades had great influence with alcibiades was elected as general alongside thrasybulus and others thucydides peloponnesian war 8 81 shortly after this following revolt of euboea government of 400 at athens was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy which would eventually give way to democracy thucydides peloponnesian war 8 97 in command in

prevent encirclement battle ended in athenian victory thucydides peloponnesian war 8 105 106 shortly afterwards thrasybulus again commanded a wing of athenian fleet at abydos another athenian victory

join up with athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce sailors and marines on beach spartans and persians overwhelmed by arrival of multiple forces from several directions were defeated

command but his actions are difficult to trace he appears to have spent much of time campaigning in thrace recapturing cities for empire and restoring flow of tribute from region in 407 bc he was in command of a fleet sent to besiege phocaea this siege had to be lifted however after spartans under lysander defeated main athenian fleet at this defeat led to downfall and exile of alcibiades thrasybulus was either removed from command on spot by alcibiades or not reelected at end of his term either way he was out of office from then until end of war buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 46 thrasybulus did return to action however at battle of arginusae in 406 bc there he was a trierarch in athenian relief fleet sent out to assist admiral conon who was blockaded at mytilene that battle was a major athenian victory after battle generals in charge took majority of their ships to attack peloponnesian fleet blockading conon leaving behind a force under thrasybulus and his fellow trierarch theramenes to rescue survivors this operation was thwarted however by a sudden storm which drove rescue force to land and a great number of athenians estimates as to precise figure have ranged from near 1 000 to as many as 5 000 drowned kagan peloponnesian war 459 gives number as perhaps a thousand while fine ancient greeks 515 states it as between 4 000 and 5 000 result was one of great athenian political scandals of war which culminated in a vicious debate between theramenes and generals at athens over who was to blame for disaster after which generals were executed thrasybulus for unknown reasons seems to have had very little involvement in this debate buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 56 60 thirty tyrants in 404 bc following a defeat at battle of athens was forced to surrender ending peloponnesian war in wake of this surrender spartan lysander imposed a strict oligarchic government on athens which came to be known as thirty tyrants this government executed a number of citizens and deprived all but a few of their rights eventually growing so extreme that even moderate oligarch theramenes fell afoul of government and was executed fearing for their lives numerous athenians fled to thebes xenophon hellenica 2 3 thrasybulus had been one of first to oppose oligarchy and had been exiled to thebes shortly after its rise to power cornelius nepos life of thrasybulus there he was welcomed and supported by theban leader and his followers who assisted him in preparing for a return to athens in 403 bc he led a party of 70 exiles to seize phyle a defensible location on border of attica and boeotia a storm prevented forces of thirty from expelling him immediately and numerous exiles flocked to join him when spartan garrison of athens supported by athenian cavalry was sent out to oppose him thrasybulus led his force now 700 strong in a surprise daybreak raid on their camp killing 120 spartans and putting rest to flight five days later thrasybulus led his force which had already grown to point that he could leave 200 men at phyle while taking 1 000 with him to piraeus port of athens there he fortified a hill that dominated port and awaited coming attack forces of thirty supported by spartan garrison marched to piraeus to attack him thrasybulus and his men were outnumbered 5 to 1 but held a superior position and presumably benefited from consternation amidst ranks of oligarchs in battle exiles put oligarchic forces to flight killing critias leader of thirty buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 71 79 see also xenophon

and unwilling to push issue he arranged a settlement between forces of thrasybulus and oligarchs in city democracy was restored while those oligarchs who wished to do so withdrew to eleusis buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 79 83 in power thrasybulus pushed through a law which pardoned all but a few of oligarchs preventing a brutal reprisal by victorious democrats for his actions thrasybulus was awarded an olive crown by his countrymen later actions in revived democracy established in 403 bc thrasybulus became a major and prestigious leader although he was soon superseded at head of state by thrasybulus seems to have advocated a more radically democratic policy than populace was willing to accept at time he called for reinstating pay for political service and sought to extend citizenship to all metics and foreigners who had fought alongside him against thirty he was initially cautious about offending sparta but when persian support became available at start of corinthian war he became an advocate of aggressive action and about this time seems to have regained his preeminence in athenian politics he initiated rebuilding of long walls which had been demolished at end of peloponnesian war and commanded athenian contingents at and coronea these two defeats however damaged his political stature and he was replaced at head of state by conon whose victory at cnidus had ended sparta s dreams of naval empire buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 100 105 thrasybulus largely faded from view for several years as conon led athenian fleet to a series of victories but in 392 bc conon was imprisoned by persian satrap while attending a peace conference at sardis although released he died in cyprus without returning to athens thrasybulus leading faction that sought to reject peace offer regained his position atop athenian politics in 389 bc he led a force of triremes to levy tribute from cities around aegean and support rhodes where a democratic government was struggling against sparta on this campaign thrasybulus relaid much of framework for an athenian empire on 5th century bc model he captured byzantium imposed a duty on ships passing through hellespont and collected tribute from many of islands of aegean buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 115 118 in 388 bc as he led his fleet south through aegean his soldiers ravaged fields of aspendus in retaliation raided athenian camp by night thrasybulus was killed in his tent xenophon hellenica 4 8 25 30 gains that thrasybulus made on this campaign were soon reversed however by persian intervention alarmed by sudden reappearance of something resembling athenian empire that had driven them from aegean in 5th century bc persians began supporting sparta and a persian fleet was soon in hellespont threatening athens grain supply peace was quickly concluded on same terms that athenians had rejected in 392 bc thrasybulus campaigns though impressively successful in spreading athenian influence had little long term effect since they prompted persia to force athenians to give up what they had gained j v fine ancient greeks a critical history 553 555 historical opinions thrasybulus has been widely recognized as a successful military commander most of major ancient historians assigned credit for dramatic athenian victories of 411 bc to alcibiades but a few such as cornelius nepos pointed to decisive role that was played in these battles by thrasybulus more recent historians such as donald kagan and r j buck have tended to support this analysis pointing to role that thrasybulus played in crafting athenian strategy in all these battles and specifically to decisive action he took at cyzicus which saved alcibiades s force from being swamped and turned a potential athenian defeat into a stunning victory kagan peloponnesian war thrasybulus and athenian democracy 39 r j buck has suggested that thrasybulus suffered from an anti democratic tradition of ancient historiography which led many writers to minimize accomplishments of one of democracy s strongest advocates buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 122 throughout his career thrasybulus defended democracy at athens against its opponents he was one of few prominent citizens whom samians trusted to defend their democracy and whom fleet selected to lead it through troubled time of conflict with 400 later in his opposition to thirty tyrants thrasybulus risked his life when few others would and his actions were responsible for quick restoration of democracy in words of cornelius nepos john fine points to clemency shown by thrasybulus and other democrats in wake of their victory over thirty as a key contribution towards reestablishing stable government in athens while many city states throughout greek world broke down into vicious cycles of civil war and reprisal athens remained united and democratic without interruption until near end of 3rd century bc and democracy albeit interrupted several times by conquest or revolution continued there until roman times several centuries later ref j v fine ancient greeks a critical history 522 525 ref second century travel writer pausanias called thrasybulus greatest of all famous athenians for overthrowing thirty as well as his other exploits making clear that he thought him greater than even pericles pausanias description of greece paragraph 1 29 3 thus thrasybulus won praise as an athenian patriot and staunch principled democrat he has been criticized by modern historians however for failing to recognize that athens in 4th century bc could not sustain an imperial policy henry dickinson westlake and simon hornblower thrasybulus from oxford classical dictionary simon hornblower and antony spawforth ed r j buck suggests that thrasybulus who came of age in heady days when democracy and empire under pericles were at their fullest extent never accepted that devastating losses athens had suffered in peloponnesian war made return of those times impossible buck thrasybulus and athenian democracy 123 thrasybulus was a capable general particularly successful in naval warfare and a competent speaker but was frequently overshadowed or pushed aside by more charismatic or spectacularly successful leaders buck has compared him to winston churchill another advocate of imperial policies who held fast to his beliefs after tide of history had turned against him and who rose to his peak of prominence at his country s darkest hour throughout his two decades of prominence whether in or out of leadership thrasybulus remained a steady advocate of traditional athenian imperial democracy and he died fighting for same cause he was advocating on his first appearance in 411 notes references
