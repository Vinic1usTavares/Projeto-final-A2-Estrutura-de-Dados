mayo foundation v united states 562 u s 44 2011 is a united states supreme court case in which court upheld a treasury department regulation on grounds that courts should defer to government agencies in tax cases in absence of an unreasonable decision on part of agency under federal insurance contributions act fica students and their educational employers are exempted from paying social security taxes treasury department issued a regulation in 2004 declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption mayo foundation filed suit to challenge regulation and for a refund of taxes it had paid on its medical residents recently graduated physicians who work more than full time providing patient care but who are still considered trainees by medical profession district court ruled for mayo foundation and struck regulation but was reversed by court of appeals supreme court ruled unanimously to uphold regulation as within treasury department s statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of fica court clarified that deferential standard of chevron u s a inc v natural resources defense council inc 1984 applied notwithstanding prior court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations applying chevron court first found that congress had left matter to agency because statute was silent on definition of student and its applicability to medical residents specifically second court found that regulation was a reasonable interpretation of statute and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work simplified enforcement and furthered broad coverage of social security background in first decade of 21st century vast majority of medical residents in united states were physicians who had recently graduated from a medical school in united states while graduating from a medical school provides an individual with a medical degree a state medical license is required to practice medicine all states require that an individual pass step 3 of or exams and complete at least one year of residency training to obtain an unrestricted medical license in practice most practicing physicians complete their multiyear residency while training residents practice medicine with considerable autonomy under supervision of attending physicians medical residencies traditionally require lengthy hours of their trainees residents in past had literally resided in hospitals for duration of their training by 2010 when case was argued before supreme court regulations from accreditation council for graduate medical education and american osteopathic association had limited work hours to about 80 hours per week and a first year resident at mayo clinic made 47 259 plus benefits in 1935 united states congress passed federal insurance contributions act fica which imposed a payroll tax on workers revenues of tax were meant to be used to finance social security an amendment to act passed four years later provided that a service performed in employ of a school college or university if such service is performed by a student enrolled in and regularly attending classes at such school college or university would be exempt first year residents or interns were also specifically exempted in 1965 congress repealed intern exemption but left student exemption in place until 1990s act and its application to medical residents were not an issue many hospitals assessed and paid fica taxes on behalf of their employees university of minnesota s hospitals did not however and in early 1990s social security administration sued to recover a small portion of those taxes an initial administrative review ruled for social security administration but district court reversed eighth circuit affirmed district court s decision after granting a de novo review minnesota v 151 f 3d 742 8th cir 1998 and university recovered 40 million a number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits attempting to recoup taxes they had paid after some of those programs were successful in other circuit courts treasury agreed to repay taxes it had collected however it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in april 2005 that stated that any full time employee which includes nearly all medical residents were ineligible to receive student exemption relevant section of treasury s regulation states services of a full time employee are not incident to and for purpose of pursuing a course of study determination of whether an employee is a full time employee is based on employer s standards and practices except regardless of employer s classification of employee an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full time employee an employee s normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at start of an academic term however whether an employee is a full time employee is reevaluated for remainder of academic term if employee changes employment positions with employer an employee s work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether employee s normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week determination of an employee s normal work schedule is not affected by fact that services performed by employee may have an educational instructional or training aspect 26 c f r 3121 b 10 2 d 3 iii clearly stating that it was doing so to overturn court rulings that had upheld view that residents remained students lower court proceedings and arguments before supreme court mayo clinic and university of minnesota sued in federal court to overturn those regulations district courts agreed with them but upon appeal eighth circuit consolidated two cases into one and reversed judgments remanding cases for entry of judgments in favor of united states this decision was at odds with decisions from second sixth seventh and eleventh circuits which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for purpose of fica taxes eighth circuit s ruling created a circuit split and on appeal supreme court agreed to hear case mayo and minnesota supported by amicus briefs from a number of residency programs and medical organizations argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature they asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine they also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work but also an educational curriculum conferences and lectures much like clinical years of medical school mayo s attorney former bush administration solicitor general theodore olson also argued that rule was arbitrary as tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week medical schools proposed that irs should base their determination on primary purpose of a program providing an education versus providing a livelihood in response assistant to solicitor general matthew d roberts argued on behalf of united states that patient care and not educational curricula occupies vast majority of residents time he also argued that although 1939 fica amendment had originally specifically exempted interns residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into social security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits during oral arguments chief justice john roberts noted that case was a very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student and that only way that one could draw a line between two is to have somebody say this is going to be line he was of opinion that if anyone should draw line internal revenue service should be one associate justice sonia sotomayor on other hand felt that residents were employees as evidenced by her statement you don t think receiving 50 000 or 60 000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone according to wall street journal associate justice samuel alito appeared to be more favorable to medical schools asking justice department s lawyer at one point in general why do medical students become residents are they enrolled in program to make money or do they want additional education opinion of court in a decision written by chief justice roberts supreme court unanimously upheld eighth circuit s decision associate justice elena kagan recused herself from participating in case as she had signed government s brief during her tenure as solicitor general of united states declining to review using a standard set out in national muffler dealers assn inc v united states 1979 court instead used a standard set out in chevron u s a inc v natural resources defense council inc 1984 chevron a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies instituted a two part test job of reviewing court is to first establish whether congress has unambiguously spoken about matter if so court is to follow congress intent if not it is job of court to determine whether agency s statutory interpretation was a reasonable one national muffler on other hand requires that reviewing courts take into account whether regulation harmonizes with plain language of statute its origin and its purpose and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after passage of original act on merits mayo foundation had requested that court rule according to national muffler standard while united states argued that court should use chevron standard arguing that national muffler had been superseded court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984 but agreed with government s position stating that it would not be wise to carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only despite mayo foundation s arguments otherwise court ruled that student was a sufficiently ambiguous term to state that congress has specifically addressed issue court also noted that congress in past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available which in court s eyes made mayo foundation s arguments about unreasonable therefore according to chevron role of courts should solely be to determine whether treasury department made a reasonable decision and court concluded that treasury did just that in writing for court roberts stated that treasury department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors who work long hours serve as high skilled professionals and typically share some or all of terms of employment of career employees are kind of workers that congress intended to both contribute and benefit from social security system impact mayo clinic noted that it had been paying taxes while case was pending in courts so 15 page opinion would not force them to pay back taxes in march 2010 while case was pending before supreme court treasury announced that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to april 2005 regulation it would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date which would cost residency programs a total of approximately 700 million annually or 3 100 a year for a resident earning 50 000 a year and equivalent amount for resident s employer an article in new england journal of medicine noted that r could find additional support in court s unambiguous holding for efforts to enforce other workplace rights such as unemployment benefits e g after hospital closure or protection under family medical leave act supreme court s decision to use chevron as its test for reviewing treasury department s decision for marked a departure from previous practice court had courts have previously given less deference to internal revenue service s statutory interpretations citing according to an article in federal circuit bar journal court s application of national muffler standard to tax regulations promulgated under in years following chevron created confusion among lower courts mayo foundation decision settled matter partially citing according to an article in florida tax review court in doing so unambiguously overruled its previous decision in national muffler in favor of chevron finding that an agency should have leeway in interpreting statute in question no matter when or how long ago statute was placed in effect how consistent agency was in interpreting statute importance of statute or how closely congress has looked into agency s decision national muffler indicated that proper standard for judicial review should be following in determining whether a particular regulation carries out congressional mandate in a proper manner we look to see whether regulation harmonizes with plain language of statute its origin and its purpose a regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent if regulation dates from a later period manner in which it evolved merits inquiry other relevant considerations are length of time regulation has been in effect reliance placed on it consistency of commissioner s interpretation and degree of scrutiny congress has devoted to regulation during subsequent re enactments of statute however an article in george washington law review which advocates for use of national muffler standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations states that national muffler may not have been entirely overruled arguing that court implied that chevron test is only to be used in complex questions of statutory interpretation and that court left open possibility that a future scenario may warrant use of national muffler test instead of chevron test court also overruled rowan cos v united states 1981 and united states v vogel fertilizer co 1982 stating that chevron test does not depend on whether congress intended to delegate out general authority over a matter or just specific authority notes
