thumb right mugshot of kgb mole aldrich ames following his 1994 arrest 1995 cia disinformation controversy arose when central intelligence agency revealed that between 1986 and 1994 it had delivered intelligence reports to u s government based on agent reporting from confirmed or suspected soviet operatives from 1985 to his arrest in february 1994 cia agent and kgb mole aldrich ames compromised agency sources and operations in soviet union and eastern europe leading to arrest of many cia agents and execution of at least ten of them this allowed kgb to replace cia agents with its own operatives or to force them to cooperate and double agents then funneled a mixture of disinformation and true material to u s intelligence although cia s soviet east european se and central eurasian divisions knew or suspected sources to be soviet double agents they nevertheless disseminated this feed material within government some of these intelligence reports even reached presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush as well as president elect bill clinton disclosure of deception in 1995 following investigations into ames case led to a media stir and heavy congressional criticism agency s inspector general frederick hitz identified 12 cia personnel he deemed responsible for lapse including three former directors cia director john m deutch criticized seven of these employees calling affair a major intelligence failure a damage assessment determined that disinformation altered intelligence analyses of soviet and later russian military towards end of cold war creating a false impression of soviet strength however initial charges that faulty reports led to billions of dollars worth of pentagon spending proved to be exaggerated regardless revelation further undermined cia s credibility in wake of ames case background aldrich ames a cia counterintelligence agent working in se division approached soviet embassy in washington d c on april 16 1985 and within a month received 50 000 from kgb in exchange for espionage service meeting with soviet official and go between sergey dmitriyevich on june 13 ames passed him copied documents identifying over ten soviet agents working for cia and fbi as a cia review related soviets began arresting and sometimes executing u s operatives later in 1985 and cia realized that it was faced with a major ci problem suspicions initially fell on edward lee howard a former cia officer who also compromised cia operations in 1985 and defected to soviet union on september 21 however cia realized by fall 1985 that howard was not responsible for all of damage three agents arrested in fall 1985 and later executed some of cia s most valuable sources had been betrayed by ames not howard by december six se agents had vanished a trend which continued into 1986 according to a congressional report over 20 operations ames revealed amounted to a virtual collapse of cia s soviet operations ames who stated that he spied for kgb due to his financial debt gave thousands of pages of classified documents to soviets and later admitted to disclosing over 100 cia fbi military and allied operations he was deemed responsible for arrests and executions of ten u s sources thumb left fbi wanted poster of u s defector edward lee howard moreover by compromising cia methods ames enabled kgb and its successor svr to filter feed material to cia from 1986 to 1993 in 1987 kgb agent aleksandr zhomov offered to sell cia intelligence on how soviets had detected and arrested cia s agents se division accepted zhomov and assigned him zhomov who was actually a soviet double agent assigned to protect ames furnished fake documents ascribing cia s agent losses to superior kgb surveillance and luck he then told cia that he would identify upcoming kgb plants but only on condition that cia treat them as genuine lest kgb discover leak and arrest him fake agents soon overwhelmed moscow station s resources and zhomov disappeared in july 1990 after receiving payment from u s spurious sources and disinformation they provided reportedly convinced cia that 1985 1986 debacle was an anomaly thus protecting ames other genuine cia agents were compromised by soviets who used them to feed false intelligence back to u s cia began to investigate disappearances of its agents initially suspecting that bad tradecraft a soviet breach of moscow station or cia s communications or a mole was responsible for disaster suspicions fell on spy dust a kgb compromise of cia cables or new soviet surveillance tactics but these probes proved unsuccessful ames conspicuous spending drew attention of in late 1989 but he passed a polygraph test however regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on case attention focused on ames and other suspects and his finances were investigated once more in 1992 in august investigators linked ames bank deposits with his meetings with soviets in march 1993 unit concluded that there was a kgb mole within cia who had followed howard and fbi began close surveillance of ames monitoring his office and home and tracking his car a june 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work an analysis of his finances found an unexplained 1 326 310 and subsequent searches of ames trash and residence found further documents on cia operations and agents as well as ames own espionage for kgb on february 21 1994 ames and his wife rosario were arrested by fbi agents duo pled guilty to espionage and senate intelligence committee requested that cia s inspector general review case initial revelation on october 31 1995 cia director john m deutch presented two investigations into ames espionage to house and senate intelligence committees damage assessment conducted by executive director of intelligence community affairs richard l haver and cia inspector general frederick p hitz s report reports indicated that in 1980s and 1990s as a result of ames betrayal cia had given presidents and other senior officials intelligence derived from soviet double agents hitz also recommended reprimands for nearly 12 serving and former cia officers including several deputy directors for operations and former directors william h webster robert m gates and r james woolsey jr for not closely supervising sensitive information sent to president hitz s report also claimed that cia officers in directorate of operations do distributed sensitive intelligence reports despite suspecting that their sources were soviet controlled however some cia officials reportedly disputed this saying that dubious sources were properly identified thumb right cia director john m deutch same day deutch publicly criticized six former and one serving cia officers for devastating intelligence failure although he did not hold three of his predecessors accountable he stated that would create an independent national intelligence council managed customer review process for agent reporting and said that he had already installed new management stressed counterintelligence at cia and established new accountability boards among other reforms deutch added that if 12 cia officers cited in hitz s report were still employed he would have fired two of them he said that he had reprimanded only officer still at agency that two officers he would have fired were banned from future employment with agency and that four others had been reprimanded or warned deutch insisted that efforts to improve counterintelligence would prevent a recurrence of ames catastrophe and provided fbi with damage assessment report so bureau could assist in subsequent investigations cia s 1995 damage assessment report singled out former se division reports chief robert lubbehusen for sending reports without disclosing that they were from double agents despite agency rules requiring warnings on such reports he and other mid level officers allegedly saw controlled agent reporting as genuine and feared that revealing reports sources would distract officials from supposedly valuable intelligence he may have also been swayed by pressure from defense department for more intelligence according to reporter james risen reports officers were sometimes more knowledgeable about cia sources than case officers and were often first to see raw intelligence and thus had opportunity to describe sources in reports following approval by se division s chief cia intelligence analysts would then view reports but had to rely on reports officers to describe sources however one anonymous source backed lubbehusen saying that some of intelligence may have been genuine material sent by soviets to bolster their moles bona fides even after lubbehusen was removed his successors continued to leave out disclosures on reports although lubbehusen s reprimand was reputedly strongest of seven deutch issued congressional and pentagon investigations congressional committee members stated that blend of genuine information and disinformation altered american perceptions of ussr and possibly affected billions of dollars worth of military acquisition decisions congress pointed to multibillion dollar f 22 fighter project as a possible result of inflated estimates on ussr committee members charged that cia never warned recipients of suspicious intelligence because it sought to protect dubious sources they cited a case in which a cia officer forwarded 16 reports without mentioning that they were derived from a confirmed soviet agent in another case questioned sources provided documents on a new soviet anti aircraft missile indicating it had a new capability prompting costly american spending on aircraft radar senator arlen specter r pa chairman of senate intelligence committee called revelation mind boggling and sought a hearing with webster gates and woolsey however representative larry r tex chairman of house intelligence committee stressed that nothing has been proven and that intelligence may not have been wholly spurious intelligence officials countered that specter s claims of reports damage were exaggerated saying that development and acquisition decisions would never be based solely on agent reporting senator bob kerrey d neb vice chairman of senate intelligence committee criticized deutch s refusal to deem three former cia directors responsible saying that they should have known about tainted reports kerrey also cited an october 30 letter from three former directors to deutch in which they defended themselves and suggested investigating cia s inspector general trio insisted that they knew nothing of reports and said they should not be faulted for incident webster gates and woolsey stated that hitz in a 1991 report on se division did not highlight problem of faulty intelligence trio claimed they had never seen report and argued that hitz had failed to detect disinformation operation former directors also asked deutch to publicly announce that he would not hold them accountable which kerrey denounced saying that accountability was needed to improve agency morale richard kerr cia s deputy director in 1991 stated that cia debated authenticity of 1988 soviet military documents provided by suspected double agents which were forwarded to pentagon regardless kerr said he never saw hitz s 80 page report although a cia spokesman confirmed that webster s office had received it on november 9 1995 specter revealed that from 1986 to 1994 cia gave defense officials presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush and president elect bill clinton 95 reports from suspected or known soviet russian sources for 35 of these reports which dealt with weapons technology and arms control cia believed that they came from double agents of these 11 were sent to presidents and clinton received at least one before his inauguration according to specter presidents were not alerted to sources of intelligence although reports to other agencies indicated their questionable origins decision to continue disseminating reports was allegedly made by mid level do officers who thought they had screened out disinformation on november 1 department of defense said it would examine whether disinformation had caused wasteful spending a november 17 report by journalist walter pincus indicated that review panel led by defense intelligence agency dia director lt gen kenneth minihan had not found any policy or weapon purchase decision that in and of itself was shaped by tainted soviet intelligence claim that billions of dollars had been wasted on defense spending was deemed an overreaction former dia chief lt gen james r clapper told house intelligence committee that intelligence affected no policy or weapons acquisition decisions which was echoed by haver damage assessment report cia damage assessment team dat reviewed credibility of all of agency s soviet agents from mid 1980s onward then separated them into three groups those whom ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence those whom ames was suspected of betraying and those whom ames spying may have helped soviets identify and agents whom neither ames nor moscow uncovered dat thus deemed intelligence supplied by first group suspicious although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed debate over second group s bona fides proved especially contentious while information from third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised deutch related conclusions from dat report on december 7 1995 noting that ames assisted soviet russian perception management operations deutch acknowledged that disinformation was channeled to policymakers unaware of reports suspect provenance but maintained that operations scope and success were unclear deutch said that dat had identified 900 reports from 1985 to 1994 then found that many of reports were sourced from russian and soviet controlled agents while some reports indeed came with warnings 95 reports from suspected double agents were not labelled as such of those at least three featured in reports to president including two from questioned sources and one from an agent believed to be controlled he stated that it was critical to prevent incident from reoccurring by informing policymakers whether reports are derived from suspected double agents reviewing whether disinformation influenced any decisions and if so deciding if and how to react deutch concluded that soviets attempted to persuade u s that they retained superpower status and strong military research and development he added that a dat review of acquisition decisions showed impact ranged from negligible to measurable but only on margin dat highlighted three particular cases where double agents influenced analysis a late 1980s report on u s general purpose forces analyses that altered theater level logistics and basing plans and reporting that possibly exaggerated soviet russian cruise missile and fighter aircraft r d programs deutch denied that controlled reporting influenced policy and decisions but confirmed its substantial role in framing debate director also stated that disinformation did not influence arms control negotiations and that ames espionage hampered u s coverage of internal soviet affairs soviet russian foreign policy concerning nonproliferation and cis and extent of decline of soviet and russian military technology and procurement programs in response specter and kerrey insisted that true extent of damage caused by ames was still unknown noting that dat had not reviewed all intelligence reports from suspect sources and that state department was not included in study specter also quoted a defense official who said that accelerated procurement cost about 200 million analysis author thomas powers writes that cia continued to pass on reports from double agents because it sought to hide its ames inflicted losses former cia chief historian benjamin b fischer argues that se division still needed sources and still needed to produce intelligence reports which motivated it to continue disseminating material from dubious sources similarly another intelligence source recalled constant demands from defense department s research and development and weapons procurement staffs to turn over raw soviet military intelligence as quickly as possible hitz later contended that incident which he deemed most bizarre case of fabrication during cold war fostered a feeling that agency couldn t be trusted as deutch noted revelation also seriously damaged cia s credibility with senior officials see also robert
