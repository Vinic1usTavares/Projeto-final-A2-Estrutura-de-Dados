three sisters are closely spaced volcanic peaks in u s state of oregon they are part of cascade volcanic arc a segment of cascade range in western north america extending from southern british columbia through washington and oregon to northern california each more than in elevation they are third fourth and fifth highest peaks in oregon located in three sisters wilderness at boundary of lane and deschutes counties and willamette and deschutes national forests they are about south of nearest town sisters diverse species of flora and fauna inhabit area which is subject to frequent snowfall occasional rain and extreme temperature variation between seasons mountains particularly south sister are popular destinations for climbing and scrambling although they are often grouped together as one unit three mountains have their own individual geology and eruptive history neither nor has erupted in last 14 000 years and it is considered unlikely that either will ever erupt again last erupted about 2 000 years ago and could erupt in future threatening life within region after satellite imagery detected tectonic uplift near in 2000 united states geological survey improved monitoring in immediate area geography three sisters are at boundary of lane and deschutes counties and willamette and deschutes national forests in u s state of oregon about south of nearest town of sisters three peaks are third fourth and fifth highest in oregon and contain 16 named glaciers their ice volume totals sisters were named faith hope and charity by early settlers but are now known as north sister middle sister and south sister respectively wilderness three sisters wilderness covers an area of making it second largest wilderness area in oregon designated by united states congress in 1964 it borders mount washington wilderness to north and shares its southern edge with waldo lake wilderness area includes of trails and many forests lakes waterfalls and streams including source of whychus creek three sisters and nearby broken top account for about a third of three sisters wilderness and this area is known as alpine crest region rising from about to in elevation alpine crest region features wilderness area s most frequented glaciers lakes and meadows physical geography thumb right aerial view over three sisters wilderness showing middle sister left and south sister alt an aerial image displays middle sister on left and south sister to right above vegetation of three sisters wilderness weather varies greatly in area due to rain shadow caused by cascade range air from pacific ocean rises over western slopes which causes it to cool and dump its moisture as rain or snow in winter precipitation increases with elevation once moisture is wrung from air it descends on eastern side of crest which causes air to be warmer and drier on western slopes precipitation ranges from annually while precipitation over eastern slopes varies from in east temperature extremes reach in summers and during winters three sisters have about 130 snowfields and glaciers ranging in altitude from with a cumulative surface area of about linn and villard glaciers are north of north sister summit while thayer glacier is on its eastern slope collier glacier is nestled between north sister and middle sister and flows to northwest renfrew and hayden glaciers are northwestern and northeastern slopes of middle sister respectively while diller glacier is on its southeastern slope irving carver and skinner glaciers lie between middle sister and south sister finally around summit of south sister in a clockwise direction are prouty lewis clark lost creek and eugene glaciers collier glacier despite a retreat and a 64 loss of its surface area between 1910 and 1994 is generally considered to be largest of three sisters at eliot glacier on mount hood is now two and a half times larger than collier glacier according to sources prouty glacier is sometimes considered to be larger than collier glacier thumb left carver lake is dammed by a glacial moraine and could produce a dangerous mudflow alt a snow covered lake surrounded by dark glacial till when little ice age glaciers retreated during 20th century water filled in spaces left behind forming moraine dammed lakes which are more common in three sisters wilderness than anywhere else in contiguous united states local area has a history of flash floods including an event on october 7 1966 caused by a sudden avalanche this flash flood reached cascade lakes scenic byway concerned about hazard of similar flooding events scientists in 1980s from united states geological survey usgs identified that carver lake on south sister could flood and breach its natural dam producing a large mudflow that could endanger wilderness visitors and town of sisters studies at collier lake and diller lake suggested that both had breached their dams in early 1940s and in 1970 respectively other moraine dammed lakes within wilderness area include thayer lake on north sister s east flank and four members of chambers lakes group between middle and south sister before settlement of area at end of 19th century wildfires frequently burned through local forests especially ponderosa pine forests on eastern slopes due to fire suppression over past century forests have become overgrown and at higher elevations they are further susceptible to summertime fires which threaten surrounding life and property in 21st century wildfires have been larger and more common in deschutes national forest in september 2012 a lightning strike caused a fire that burned in pole creek area within three sisters wilderness leaving area closed until may 2013 in august 2017 officials closed in western half of three sisters wilderness including of pacific crest trail to public because of 11 lightning caused fires including milli fire as a result of increasing incidence of fires public officials have factored role of wildfire into planning including organizing prescribed fires with scientists to protect habitats at risk while minimizing adverse effects on air quality and environmental health geology thumb upright 1 4 right location of three sisters relative to other major volcanoes in cascade range of oregon alt three sisters are in a north south row of major volcanoes in oregon from north to south mount hood mount jefferson three sisters crater lake and mounth mcloughlin newberry volcano is displaced to east between three sisters and crater lake three sisters join several other volcanoes in eastern segment of cascade range known as high cascades which trends north south constructed towards end of pleistocene epoch these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north south faulting in surrounding region part of cascade volcanic arc and cascade range each of three volcanoes formed at different times from several variable magmatic sources amount of rhyolite present in lavas of younger two mountains is unusual relative to nearby peaks three sisters form leading edge of a rhyolitic crustal melting anomaly which might be explained by a combination of mantle flow movement of earth s solid silicate mantle layer caused by convection currents and decompression that has generated similar melting and rhyolitic volcanism nearby for past 16 million years like other cascade volcanoes three sisters were fed by magma chambers produced by subduction of juan de fuca tectonic plate under western edge of north american tectonic plate three mountains were also shaped by changing climate of pleistocene epoch during which multiple glacial periods occurred and glacial advance eroded mountains thumb left rock mesa is an example of a rhyolite dome near three sisters south sister rises in background alt a rough textured light colored lava dome with a volcanic peak behind three sisters form center of a region of closely grouped volcanic peaks this is in contrast to typical spacing between volcanoes elsewhere in cascades among most active volcanic areas in cascades and one of most densely populated volcanic centers in world three sisters region includes nearby peaks such as belknap crater mount washington black butte and three fingered jack to north and broken top and mount bachelor to south most of surrounding volcanoes consist of mafic basaltic lavas only south and middle sister have an abundance of silicic rocks such as andesite dacite and rhyodacite mafic magma is less viscous it produces lava flows and is less prone to explosive eruptions than silicic magma region was active in pleistocene with eruptions between about 650 000 and about 250 000 years ago from an explosively active complex known as tumalo volcanic center this area features andesitic and mafic cinder cones such as lava butte as well as rhyolite domes cinder cones accumulate from airfall of many pyroclastic rock fragments of various sizes while viscous rhyolite domes extrude onto surface like toothpaste tumalo volcano spread ignimbrites and plinian deposits in ground eruptions across area similar to eruption of vesuvius that destroyed pompeii these deposits spread from tumalo to town of bend basaltic lava flows from north sister overlay youngest tumalo pyroclastic deposits indicating that north sister was active more recently than 260 000 years ago north sister thumb right north sister alt highly eroded north sister volcano sits above a forested area with some ice and snow visible scattered across mountain north sister also known as faith is oldest and most highly eroded of three with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers it is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named little brother north sister is wide and its summit elevation is consisting primarily of basaltic andesite it has a more mafic composition than other two volcanoes its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders and they are progressively more iron rich younger they are north sister s lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout mountain s long eruptive history oldest lava flows on north sister have been dated to roughly 311 000 years ago though oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119 000 years old estimates place volcano s last eruption at 46 000 years ago in late pleistocene north sister possesses more dikes than any similar cascade peak caused by lava intruding into pre existing rocks many of these dikes were pushed aside by intrusion of a wide volcanic plug dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion at one point volcano stood more than high but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third plug is now exposed and forms north sister s summits at prouty peak and south horn middle sister thumb right middle sister is cone shaped alt middle sister covered in snow and ice rises above a sparsely forested area middle sister also known as hope is a basaltic stratovolcano that has also erupted more viscous andesite dacite and rhyodacite smallest and least studied of three middle sister began eruptive activity 48 000 years ago and it was primarily built by eruptions occurring between 25 000 and 18 000 years ago one of earliest major eruptive events about 38 000 years ago produced rhyolite of obsidian cliffs on mountain s northwestern flank thick and rich in dacite flows extended from northern and southern sides they stand in contrast to older andesitic lava remains that reach as far as from its base with an elevation of mountain is cone shaped eastern side has been heavily eroded by glaciation while western face is mostly intact of three sisters middle sister has largest ice cover hayden and diller glaciers continue to cut into east face while renfrew glacier sits on northwestern slope large but retreating which contains of ice and is thickest and largest glacier in region descends along north side of middle sister cutting into west side of north sister erosion from pleistocene and holocene glaciation exposed a plug near center of middle sister south sister thumb right south sister alt south sister which features patches of snow and ice can be seen above a plain forest is visible in foreground south sister also known as charity is tallest volcano of trio standing at eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite it is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure its modern structure is no more than 50 000 years old and it last erupted about 2 000 years ago although its first eruptive events from 50 000 to 30 000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic between 38 000 and 32 000 years ago volcano began to alternate between dacitic rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions volcano built a broad andesitic cone forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27 000 years ago south sister remained dormant for 15 000 years after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava an eruptive episode about 2 200 years ago termed rock mesa eruptive cycle first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from south and southwest flanks followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow next devils hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows unlike previous eruptive period it was caused by intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on southeast side and from a smaller line on north side these eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on northern southern eastern and southeastern sides of volcano these relatively recent postglacial eruptions suggest presence of a silicic magma reservoir under south sister one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions thumb left teardrop pool on south sister is highest lake in oregon alt a small pool of water in a snowfield with other peaks in mist receding in distance unlike its sister peaks south sister has an uneroded summit crater about in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as teardrop pool highest lake in oregon its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria hodge crest a false peak formed between 28 000 and 24 000 years ago roughly around same time as main cone despite its relatively young age every part of south sister other than its peak has undergone significant erosion due to pleistocene and holocene glaciation between 30 000 and 15 000 years ago south sister s southern flanks were covered with ice streams and a small amount of ice extended below on volcano s northern flank below summit peak erosion from these glaciers exposed a headwall about high during holocene smaller glaciers formed alternating between advance and retreat depositing moraines and till between on mountain lewis and clark glaciers have cirques or glacial valleys that made outer walls of crater rim significantly steeper slopes of south sister contain small glaciers including lost creek and prouty glaciers recent history and potential hazards when first geological reconnaissance of three sisters region was published in 1925 its author edwin t hodge suggested that three sisters and five smaller mountains in present day wilderness area were remains of an enormous collapsed volcano that had been active during miocene or early pliocene epochs naming this ancient volcano mount multnomah hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as mount mazama collapsed to form crater lake in 1940s howel williams completed an analysis of three sisters vicinity and concluded that multnomah had never existed instead demonstrating that each volcano in area possessed its own individual eruptive history williams 1944 paper defined basic outline of three sisters vicinity though he lacked access to chemical techniques and radiometric dating over past 70 years scientists have published several reconnaissance maps and petrographic studies of three sisters including a detailed geological map published in 2012 thumb right 500px map of hazards from three sisters showing risk of lava flows and lahars in immediate area alt map showing high lava risk immediately near volcanoes with risk of lahars flowing down rivers to towns nearby neither north nor middle sister is likely to resume volcanic activity an eruption from south sister would pose a threat to nearby life as proximal danger zone extends from volcano s summits during an eruption tephra could accumulate to in city of bend and mudflows and pyroclastic flows could run down sides of mountain threatening any life in their paths eruptions from south sister could be either explosive or effusive though an eruption of ash with local volcanic rock accumulation and slow lava flows is considered most likely three sisters area does not have fumarole activity although there are hot springs west of south sister from 1986 to 1987 usgs surveyed three sisters vicinity with tilt leveling networks and electro optical distance meters but south sister was not subject of close geodetic analysis for next two decades volcano was found to be potentially active in 2000 when satellite imagery showed a deforming tectonic uplift west of mountain ground began to bulge in late 1997 as magma started to pool about underground scientists became concerned that volcano was awakening but examination of interferograms or diagrams of patterns formed by wave interference revealed that only small amounts of deformation occurred a 2002 study inferred that composition of intruding magma was basaltic or rhyolitic a map at lava lands visitor center of newberry national volcanic monument south of bend shows extent of uplift which reaches a maximum of in 2004 an earthquake swarm occurred with an epicenter in area of uplift hundreds of small earthquakes subsided after several days according to a 2011 study this swarm may have initiated a significant decrease in peak uplift rate which dropped by 80 percent after 2004 by 2007 uplift had slowed though area was still considered potentially active a study published in 2010 described magma intrusion as having a volume of about scientists determined in 2013 that uplift had slowed to a rate of about per year compared to up to per year in early 2000s because of uplift at south sister usgs planned to increase monitoring of three sisters and their vicinity by installing a global positioning system gps receiver sampling airborne and ground based gases and adding seismometers agency completed a gps survey campaign including planning documentation and data processing and archiving at south sister in 2001 as well as annual insar radar observations from 1992 to 2001 and it followed up with campaign gps and tilt leveling surveys in august 2004 as of 2009 semi permanent gps networks have been deployed every year at three sisters continually showing that inflation persists at south sister ecology thumb

american black bear bobcats cougars coyotes wolverines martens badgers weasels bald eagles and several hawk species are many of predators throughout three sisters area human history three sisters area was occupied by amerindians since end of last glaciation mainly northern paiute to east and molala to west they harvested berries made baskets hunted and made obsidian arrowheads and spears traces of rock art can be seen at devils hill south of south sister thumb left upright portrait of peter skene ogden discoverer of three sisters circa 1854 alt a stern looking man in an suit in style of mid 18th century first westerner to discover three sisters was explorer peter skene ogden of hudson bay company in 1825 he describes a number of high mountains south of mount hood ten months later in 1826 botanist david douglas reported snow covered peaks visible from willamette valley as willamette valley was gradually colonized in 1840s euro americans approached summits from west and probably named them individually at that time explorers such as nathaniel jarvis wyeth in 1839 and john fremont in 1843 used three sisters as a landmark from east area was further explored by john strong newberry in 1855 as part of pacific railroad surveys in 1862 to connect willamette valley to ranches of central oregon and gold mines of eastern oregon and idaho felix and marion scott traced a route over scott pass this route was known as scott trail but was superseded in early 20th century by mckenzie pass road further north around 1866 there were reports that one of three sisters emitted some fire and smoke in late 19th century there was extensive wool production in eastern oregon shepherds led their herds of 1 500 to 2 500 sheep to three sisters they arrived in eastern foothills near whychus creek by may or june and then climbed to higher pastures in august and september by 1890s area was getting overgrazed despite regulatory measures sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in 1930s at north and middle sister and in 1940 at south sister in 1892 president grover cleveland decided to create cascades forest reserve based on authority of forest reserve act of 1891 cascades reserve was a strip of land from wide around main crest of cascade range stretching from columbia river almost to border with california in 1905 administration of reserve was moved from general land office to united states forest service reserve was renamed cascade national forest in 1907 in 1908 forest was split eastern half became deschutes national forest while western half merged in 1934 to form willamette national forest thumb right north and middle sister with collier glacier between two peaks alt two volcanoes rise above a landscape of mixed forest and lava with a glacier spanning area between two peaks most of three sisters glaciers were described for first time by ira a williams in 1916 collier glacier between north and middle sister was first studied and mapped by edwin hodge ruth keen took a forty year photographic record of collier glacier documenting part of retreat of glacier from 1910 to 1994 in 1930s three sisters were part of a proposed national monument to maintain its authority over region forest service decided to create a primitive area in 1937 following year at instigation of forest service employee bob marshall it was expanded by in french pete creek basin in 1957 forest service decided to reclassify area as a wilderness area and removed old growth forest of french pete creek basin despite protests of local environmental activists area became part of national wilderness preservation system when wilderness act of 1964 was passed but area still excluded french pete creek basin responding to environmental mobilization throughout state of oregon congress passed endangered american wilderness act of 1978 which led to reinstatement of french pete creek and its surroundings in three sisters wilderness area oregon wilderness act of 1984 further expanded wilderness with addition of around erma bell lakes recreation thumb two hikers on pacific crest trail in three sisters wilderness alt two hikers with backpacks walk along a trail in three sisters wilderness surrounded by trees with three sisters visible in background three sisters are a popular climbing destination for hikers and mountaineers due to extensive erosion and rockfall north
