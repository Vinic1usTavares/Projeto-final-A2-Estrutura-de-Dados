spira is fictional world of square role playing video games final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2 spira is first final fantasy world to feature consistent all encompassing spiritual and mythological influences within planet s civilizations and their inhabitants daily lives world of spira itself is very different from mainly european style worlds found in previous final fantasy games being much more closely modeled on a setting influenced by south pacific thailand and japan most notably with respect to its vegetation topography and architecture creation of spira includes distinct ethnic minorities including a portrayal of fictional al bhed language that is prevalent throughout game s dialogue backstory and concept behind dark religious themes of final fantasy x were a central theme to story and their ultimate resolution was well received popularity of eternal calm video served as impetus of square enix to do final fantasy x 2 to make their first direct sequel in video game form and depict evolution of spiran society after religious and political upheaval results in new factions and instability in world spira and its inhabiting characters have been featured in several other square enix works including dissidia final fantasy dissidia 012 final fantasy three games within kingdom hearts series and theatrhythm final fantasy there have been numerous academic essays on game s presentation narrative and localization aspects washburn writes that mastering game comes with mastering of cultural knowledge of spira to unlock skills and abilities o hagan writes on localization of games that impact game experience detailing alterations to script and dialogue with modifications additions and omissions another aspect was that presentation of spira without an overworld view can be considered a pioneer in 3d role playing game maps concept and creation in speaking about inspiration behind spira producer yoshinori kitase recounted that players had found fault with science fiction atmosphere of final fantasy vii and final fantasy viii instead desiring a simple fantasy world to kitase word fantasy did not indicate a purely medieval european setting so he intentionally set out with objective of redefining stereotype held in players minds nomura identified south pacific thailand and japan as major influences on cultural and geographic design of spira particularly in regard to geographic locations of besaid and kilika yusuke naora art director noted that during concept stage many people on project were interested in asian themes including nojima and kitase for zanarkand uzbek city of samarkand has been cited as an inspiration 2001 in studio final fantasy x ultimania o in japanese digicube square enix 476 nomura said that spira deviates from worlds of past final fantasy games most notably in level of detail incorporated something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during design process fumi nakashima sub character chief designer concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing nakashima wanted machine oriented society of al bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance koji sugimoto main programmer for characters said that complexities of playstation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult but more rewarding because details on yuna s sleeves to depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically final fantasy x was first game that allowed for 3 d model rendering of backgrounds that increased presentation including small details like grass blowing in wind and cloud movement takayoshi nakazato decided to abandon typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction final fantasy xs spatial presentation of spira is tied to progression with a player s progress being marked through panoramic introduction and depiction of area upon first entry chiharu supervising sound editor commented that transition in sound from one environment to next was done seamlessly in order to mimic natural surroundings of these environments as player moved through them decision to create final fantasy x 2 came after fan response to eternal calm in international edition of final fantasy x which depicted events two years following yuna s final battle dark religious theme of first game was concluded and cultural changes were explored as people of spira focus on fashion that reflects their state of mind toriyama believes most important element incorporated into final fantasy x 2 was peaceful world of spira achieved in ffx and unification of characters state of mind kitase identified final fantasy xs theme as independence from ties of law and customs and final fantasy x 2s theme is about changes that occurred from chaos after gaining that independence for final fantasy x 2 many pop culture references were used including charlie s angels and with transformation of dress spheres being a reference to magical girl genre of anime remastering square enix chose to update final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2s graphics for a remastered release in high definition with a production cycle longer than two years graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures kitase commented that he wanted to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up possibility of further remasters based on reception many views could not simply be reframed to 16 9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off screen so remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to visuals setting geography thumb right artistic topography of spira main landmass of spira is surrounded by small islands including besaid a tropical town serving as origin of yuna s pilgrimage kilika a larger island featuring dense jungles and numerous conflicts during games and desert island of bikanel which is also location of al bhed s headquarters home ruins of temple are on an island to south of spira mainland this is where tidus begins his journey in spira mainland of spira is where bulk of final fantasy x takes place southernmost location of mainland luca is a large city home to spira s pastime blitzball north of luca is mountainous area of djose which features a yevonite temple connecting luca and djose are several roads mi ihen highroad a historical path that features chocobos for transportation mushroom rock road home of failed operation to defeat sin and djose highroad a rocky path

moonflow leads to guadosalam home of guado race and gateway to north of guadosalam are thunder plains which are site of a never ending thunderstorm made safe by lightning rods calibrated by al bhed thunder plains lead into macalania a sparkling forest complemented by a frozen lake and a yevonite temple bevelle spiritual center of yevon religion lies on a thin strip of land slightly north of macalania city is built as a series of layers with headquarters of yevon located at top via located beneath bevelle serves as an oubliette for outcasts further north are calm lands a series of plains that have been site of numerous battles in spira s history cavern of stolen fayth an equally historical area and mt gagazet home of lastly sacred city of zanarkand is on northern tip of spiran mainland reduced to ruins by sin one thousand years before events of final fantasy x final fantasy x 2 features several changes to locations of spira djose temple abandoned by a faltering yevon after final fantasy x becomes headquarters of machine faction likewise youth league sets up their headquarters at site of failed operation on mushroom rock road bevelle remains capital of new yevon faction although game introduces a large technological area hidden beneath city several new enterprises have been started including a new pastime in luca called sphere break a group of entertainers at moonflow a tourist service at zanarkand ruins and machina transportation in favor of chocobos on mi ihen highroad lastly death of aeons at end of final fantasy x causes macalania forest and lake to melt sinking former yevon temple and destroying forest s life final fantasy x 2 also introduces floating ruins atop mt gagazet and previously unexplored caverns throughout spira creatures and races although it is predominantly populated by humanoids spira features a variety of races people of spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like bevelle and luca al bhed is a unique ethnic group which plays an important role in storyline and world of games with distinctive green eyes with spiral shaped pupils culture and conflicts of al bhed permeate games main characters rikku is al bhed and yuna is part al bhed on her mother s side and assistance in gaining through a cast of supporting al bhed character s prevalent in final fantasy x 2 with collapse of teachings of yevon and wider acceptance of machina at end of final fantasy x prejudice against al bhed seems to have eased significantly by time of final fantasy x 2 though it is still present al bhed speak their own language which is really just a substitution cipher of english a system of transposing certain letters for others however within game world it is intended to be an actual language original japanese version of cipher uses syllable based kana system of writing where each symbol represents a combination of consonant vowel or simply a vowel certain keywords are not translated into al bhed in game to give impression of use of loanwords compared to modern foreign languages most keywords are proper nouns but some common nouns also are not translated such as fiend e g y fiend eh a fiend in human disguise alexander smith decided to map common phonemes in english to common phonemes in welsh and gave preference to welsh pronunciations but had to work with new diphthongs to maintain consistency in al bhed language several other races are found throughout spira including guado hypello and ronso races guado are an arboreal humanoid race with long limbs and fingers pale skin and wild tangled hair guado are keepers of entryway to farplane where dead are sent and have unique ability to smell deceased and other abilities related to pyreflies ronso are a race of horned blue furred lion like humanoids who live on mt gagazet which they consider sacred and guard fiercely ronso are tall and formidable warriors with a strong sense of honor and loyalty a subplot of final fantasy x involves kimahri ronso s conflict with his social status that results in his leadership of ronso in final fantasy x 2 hypello are a docile amphibious race with blue skin and live primarily in and around area of moonflow though extremely quick and agile swimmers they are only race in spira that does not participate in blitzball tournaments male hypello are all voiced by john spira also features various animal species and fictional species such as gigantic shoopuf and chocobo that are used primarily for transport purposes most other unusual creatures encountered in final fantasy x are fiends monsters created from restless dead by pyreflies to devour living aeons and unsent are also forms created by pyreflies sin bringer of destruction is a powerful fiend that is made of high density pyreflies it can control gravitation forces to replenish its strength and even fly sin s high concentration of pyreflies affect pyreflies present in bodies of those present it is known as sin s toxin despite final summoning being able to destroy sin itself central core of sin which is an entity known as yu yevon would survive from this sin is reborn after a time fictional history spira s fictional history centers around an ancient war a thousand years prior to start of game between bevelle and zanarkand latter s ruler deeming his city s eventual demise and reserve to preserve its memory fayth long ago there was a war a war between zanarkand and bevelle bevelle s machina assured their victory from start spira had never seen such power summoners of zanarkand didn t stand a chance zanarkand was doomed to oblivion that s why we tried to save it if only in a memory remaining summoners and townspeople that survived war they all became fayth fayth for summoning yevon s people became fayth to create this manifestation and yevon made himself core of a powerful monster known as sin to protect it though process destroyed his mind as he continuously maintains sin s summoning as creature is compelled to destroy mika spira has lost its only hope destruction is inevitable yu yevon s spiral of death will consume us all i have no desire to watch spira die rikku wait gramps who s yu yevon mika he who crafts souls of dead into unholy armor an armor called sin through machinations of yevon s daughter yunalesca bevelle established a religious faith built on atonement and sacrifice to conceal spiral of death that runs throughout spira s history this process involves yunalesca teaching a summoner a ritual known as final summoning which would give spira a brief reprieve from sin s terror in a period known tidus what s calm lulu calm is a time of peace it comes after a summoner defeats sin and lasts until sin reappears however final summoning is based on a strong bond and requires a summoner to turn their guardian into fayth of a final aeon whose summoning kills summoner who is memorialized as a high summoner though final aeon can destroy sin it would become a new vessel of yu yevon and turned into a new sin a thousand years following establishment of yevon order spira became a rustic land almost completely devoid of large cities and higher civilization due to actions of sin and yevon ban on machina few territories reached larger than hamlet size as they were destroyed by sin and their populations decimated before they were able to develop only cities left larger than small villages were luca which houses only blitzball stadium in spira and bevelle center of temples of yevon tidus i thought every town was little you know like besaid and kilika yuna towns don t usually get bigger than that because when a lot of people start to gather tidus sin yuna and her guardians break cycle and bring about eternal calm as a result of events in final fantasy x in final fantasy x 2 teachings of yevon were deemed invalid after order s secrets were exposed while al bhed accepted by spirans with association with machina no longer sacrilegious spirans in general had a positive outlook with onset of eternal calm new political groups fought for power two being youth league new yevon party while machine faction seeks to salvage machina yuna ultimately restores peace and saves spira a second time with multiple endings based on player s performance mythos in world of final fantasy x and its sequel many supernatural elements influence events in fictional world of spira defining life of planet s inhabitants magic spiritual energy and power of memories are heavily intertwined and their effects manifest in a number of situations including sporting events religious practices technology and even in some of native wildlife of planet most popular pastime is blitzball depiction of sin as a existence that agonizes world and as a disaster with form plays an important role in spira s everyday life throughout final fantasy x in final fantasy x 2 population of spira pursues additional including attending concerts and a coin collecting fad called sphere break in spira when a person dies suddenly and unexpectedly his or her life force manifested as pyreflies must be released from body and sent to farplane final resting place of departed souls if sending is not performed body s spirit may remain trapped in physical plane and take on form of a fiend lulu dead need guidance filled with grief over their own death they refuse to face their fate they yearn to live on and resent those still alive you see they envy living and in time that envy turns to anger even hate should these souls remain in spira they become fiends that prey on living sad isn t it sending takes them to farplane where they may rest in peace a spirit of dead may resist transformation into a fiend even when not sent and remain amongst living they are unsent unsent play a prominent role in storyline and mythos including playable character auron and other characters including maester jyscal guado shuyin and lady yunalesca pyreflies pyreflies are a mysterious naturally occurring phenomenon that heavily influence events of final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2 as well as world of spira at large heavily prevalent throughout spira these bundles of life energy are closely associated with death and other spiritual events and entities by people of spira at high concentrations pyreflies are capable of recording memories sights and sounds pyreflies are also associated with many commonplace technological innovations including sphere shaped recording devices and large suspended spherical conglomerations of congealed water called sphere pools that serve as playing field for blitzball games pyreflies are also a source of raw energy to empower giant machina shinra of gullwings suggests that life energy flowing through spira on farplane could possibly be harnessed for purpose of supplying electricity to a city yuna what are you looking at shinra farplane data more i study it more fascinating it gets there s limitless energy swirling around in there life force that flows through our planet i think with a little work we could probably extract energy in a usable form yuna think how much spira would change if we ever got it to work maybe one day we could build a city full of light one that never sleeps in interviews published in final fantasy x ultimania o and final fantasy x 2 ultimania guidebooks scenario writer kazushige nojima and producer yoshinori kitase revealed that final fantasy vii and final fantasy x 2 share a plot related connection in which shin ra corporation in final fantasy vii is founded on another planet after about one thousand years after space travel became possible by descendants of shinra of gullwings in final fantasy x 2 this connection was conceived of only after final fantasy x was already finished and realized in final fantasy x 2 riding on success of original game and is not reflected in gameplay or storylines of final fantasy vii or final fantasy x religion religion is an important part of life for many of peoples of spira with a large majority of population describing themselves as though by end of final fantasy x some people had begun to question them nevertheless teachings of yevon were millennium old and heavily influential yevonite clergy taught that sin was a divine punishment set upon people for their pride in use of machines as a result temples forbade use of modern technology and promoted a culture of atonement for past sins in hopes of appeasing sin tidus yuna why does sin always come back yuna sin is our punishment for our vanity and it will not go away until we ve atoned while yevon church forbids most machina including weapons their capital bevelle retains machina to ensure its dominance al bhed are seen as dangerous to yevon clergy because they use machina and pose a threat to church s uncontested control of spira church retains its power by role in using final summoning which results in sacrifice of summoner and her guardian to prevent its secrets from being divulged though yevon set up operation mi ihen to instill further loyalty to teachings by making crusaders use machina that would never win against sin by end of final fantasy x yevon religion was effectively disbanded once evidence of its corruption was discovered and its remaining priests volunteered truth half a year later moral teachings of yevon were revitalized in form of new yevon party later led in final fantasy x 2 by praetor baralai although technically a splinter group of yevon new yevon party was not a religion but a simple philosophy their motto and position on spira s advancement being one thing at a time in final fantasy x is an important song its fictional history started as a song of defiance turned scripture and has numerous variations that is played throughout game throughout yuna s journey primarily as music of temples let me tell you about hymn of fayth it was once a zanarkand song sung in defiance of bevelle of course yevon clergy of bevelle forbade it then as these things often go those who disliked yevon began to sing it al bhed for instance hymn of fayth became symbol of defiance against yevon yevon could do nothing but capitulate they lifted ban on song and spread a new story they said hymn was a song sung to soothe souls of dead and so saying they took song and made it scripture though hymn s words apparently have no discernible meaning within context of spira lyricist and scenario writer kazushige nojima composed a small puzzle with lyrics using japanese syllables when properly deciphered they form sentences that translates thus pray to yu yevon dream fayth forever and ever grant us prosperity hymn was composed and arranged by nobuo uematsu and masashi hamauzu final fantasy xs negative depiction of organized religion has been compared to catholic church and of organized religion in general with ultimate battle against a god stark writes that game is a thesis on religion and final battle with yu yevon offers a discourse on how to defeat it by let ting it die a slow death murder it with sheer force or utilize one s knowledge of game world to give it no power to stand on game theorists add additional concepts going further as to cite final fantasy as anti religion aeons and fayth are humans who willingly give up their lives to have their souls sealed in statues and commune with summoners with whom they have established a mental link this link grants a summoner access to a fayth s dreams and enables him or her to physically realize those dreams as powerful creatures which may be employed to aid summoner in battle or in a time of special need lulu fayth are people who gave their lives to battle sin yevon took their souls willingly given from their still living bodies now they live forever trapped in statues but when a summoner beckons souls of fayth emerge once again that s what we call an aeon during events of final fantasy x fayth of aeon bahamut serves as chosen representative of fayth as a collective fayth aids high summoner yuna and her guardians in bringing spiral of death to an end which results in their own passing in final fantasy x 2 fayth return in their aeon forms this time having been overcome by despair and malice of shuyin rendering them his unwilling puppets of chaos yuna and her allies free both fayth and shuyin from darkness that has consumed them ten aeons are identified in final fantasy x valefor ifrit shiva ixion bahamut anima yojimbo and three magus sisters game builds on mythological figures through inclusion of aeons such as arabic ifrit hindu deity shiva and even jungian figure anima and demon valefor wilder wrote on jungian analysis of anima and tied square enix s depiction of aeon as both a representation of seymour s corruption wilder analyzes chained and blinded depiction of figure that is seymour s mother and tying form to her bound to servitude to seymour in his descent into madness militant factions crusaders formerly known as crimson blades were a loosely knit army that existed to protect towns and temples from sin group was founded by lord mi ihen who made a journey to bevelle 800 years ago to calm maesters fears that he was assembling an army to conquer them mi ihen managed to win their trust and crimson blades were thereafter inducted into yevon clergy as crusaders road mi ihen had walked was renamed mi ihen highroad in his honor unlike guardians crusaders are directly related to temples no non yevonite is permitted to serve as a crusader although there are unofficial chapters composed entirely of people who have been excommunicated all of crusaders were excommunicated however when they set up operation mi ihen a joint crusader al bhed attempt to destroy sin with a giant machina weapon operation failed and crusaders were largely eradicated in process a group known as crimson squad was also formed around operation mi ihen paine yevon created squad and started training members two years ago it was supposed to be an elite fighting force best were to be assigned leadership of crusader chapters across spira three candidates survived final exercise baralai and all of whom would eventually lead one of three political factions during events of final fantasy x 2 appearances spira is world of final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2 but elements of its world and characters have been included in other final fantasy media for dissidia final fantasy and its sequel remake dissidia 012 final fantasy characters tidus yuna jecht and an area known as were featured dreams end shares similarities to

characters tidus auron and yuna are also playable characters in theatrhythm final fantasy analysis in imagined history fading memory mastering narrative in final fantasy x washburn writes that final fantasy x makes relationship of memory history and struggle for control of knowledge a central element of both its gameplay and its narrative washburn gives a synopsis of game s alternate history and describes spira s development as evok ing a number of culturally vital discourses in japan that designers of game drew on modernist aesthetics of evanescence loss of faith and belief in a society where technology and religion clash desire for a dream realm of memories as source of an alternative history and nostalgic desire for sublime experience of annihilation of past and completion of history washburn uses final fantasy x and analysis of its narrative to make case for academic study of medium and counter critical views held by detractors like espen summarizing that ability to complete game requires mastering not only instrumental controls needed to acquire and perfect game skills but also narrative itself cultural knowledge of spira that facilitates acquisition of skills and abilities in languages of navigation within computer games flynn asserts that final fantasy xs navigation is a representative and symbolic language writing that a final fantasy x establishes itself through opening cut scene as narrative based it becomes clear that a poetic and mythic experience of space rather than a cinematic sense of space is in operation localization process of final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2 was analyzed as a case study by mangiron and o hagan to highlight liberties of localization technical limitations include localizing over a thousand weapons with unique names that must be conveyed in 15 characters yet have no english equivalent as in case of that became painkiller in english other cases include addition of accents as in case of final fantasy x 2s o aka a merchant who speaks cockney despite no accent being present in japanese also included were references to lollapalooza and humorous references to speech with rikku s verb conjugation of a noun having been modified for english audiences other differences like sano s name being changed to ormi for english version with mangiron and o hagan noting a possible issue with spanish meaning of sano as healthy in stark contradiction to ormi s obese appearance mangiron and o hagan conclude that these changes and by addition result in instead of just translation using games as a case study mangiron and o hagan highlight that freedom to modify omit or add content results in traditional concept of fidelity being discarded to maintain game experience in marie curie on challenges of multidimensional translation minako o hagan expanded on localization issue including extreme rewrite of final fantasy x 2s theme song 1000 words and international edition using in game dialogues are produced fresh to match dubbed american version instead of using original japanese script o hagan noted a point of contention raised by fans were yuna s final words to tidus in final fantasy x as thank you being translated in english as i love you this translation would extend to european release and voice dialogue would be in english other academic publications refer to localization process of final fantasy x including and marco final fantasy xs depiction of spira set a new standard with traversing of real time 3d environments instead of an overworld map making portrayal of spira a pioneer in 3 d rpg
