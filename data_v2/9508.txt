batrachotomus is a genus of prehistoric archosaur fossils of this animal have been found in southern germany and dated from ladinian stage of middle triassic period around 242 to 237 million years ago batrachotomus was described by palaeontologist david j gower 22 years after its discovery locality where batrachotomus lived was a swampy region and name comes from greek frog and tome tome cutting slicing which refers to its preying on large amphibian mastodonsaurus gower 1999 p 6 in contrast with sprawling reptiles like crocodiles this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance a remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired flattened bony plates batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of gower 1999 p 1 which lived during dawn of dinosaurs description thumb left artist s life restoration batrachotomus was a heavily built large quadrupedal reptile reaching in length a trait that characterized batrachotomus compared to other crurotarsans was a series of paired small plates on its back which were attached to each vertebra gower and schoch 2009 p 117 these bony deposits forming scales are called osteoderms flattened and leaf shaped these extended from behind head along column and reducing in size ended at tail there is also evidence that osteoderms were present on ventral region of tail as seen in ferox and even on flank belly and limbs gower and schoch 2009 p 104 like rauisuchians batrachotomus walked with an erect posture although limbs were not located directly under trunk limbs were not equal in length as forelimbs were about 70 of hindlimbs gower and schoch 2009 p 109 toe bones phalanges are poorly preserved and only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal bone in hindlimbs attached to toe bones which was hooked in shape however hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five gower and schoch 2009 p 119 figure 8 thumb skull museum fur naturkunde stuttgart batrachotomus had a tall and narrow skull estimated at in length gower 1999 p 7 it had five pairs of fenestrae skull openings two pairs of which were for eyes called orbits and nostrils behind orbits were two temporal fenestrae these holes probably helped to reduce weight of skull and enabled jaw to open more widely benton 2005 p 112 as a typical archosaur batrachotomus had two antorbital fenestrae between orbits and nostrils and a fifth pair of small openings at rear part of lower jaw jaws contained sharp teeth which were compressed laterally and unequal in size and shape gower 1999 p 37 and this variation of tooth shape is known as gower 1999 p 38 teeth on premaxillae bones at very tip of upper jaw were slender unlike those of maxillae main tooth bearing bones in upper jaw which had a straight posterior edge gower 1999 pp 37 38 upper jaw bore 30 teeth with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11 while lower jaw held 22 teeth discovery and history thumb left kupferzell locality in germany where fossils of batrachotomus have been discovered remains of batrachotomus have been found in southern germany mainly in kupferzell fossil locality in northern baden wurttemberg fossil collector johann g discovered first specimens in a 1977 excavation at erfurt formation dated from late ladinian age gower 1999 p 5 gower and schoch 2009 p 121 other remains attributed to batrachotomus have been collected in vellberg eschenau about 10 km east of schwabisch hall and in most notable are from vellberg eschenau which are represented by well preserved ribs and vertebrae mhi 1895 and evidence of forelimbs and hindlimbs smns batrachotomus today is displayed in museum ingelfingen stuttgart fossils recovered from a remained undescribed until 1999 and palaeontologists referred to genus simply as or kupferzellia in 1999 palaeontologist david j gower described holotype smns from 1977 excavation which is largest specimen of genus comprised by incomplete skull and postcranial material anatomy of braincase smns was made three years later shedding light on evolutionary relationships of poorly known group of rauisuchia gower 2002 p 49 in 2009 gower and rainer r schoch reported a detailed reconstruction of postcranial skeleton for first time gower and schoch 2009 p 103 classification thumb skeletal elements museum am stuttgard batrachotomus was a a member of a family of carnivorous archosaurs within larger group rauisuchia family name prestosuchidae was established in 1966 by american paleontologist alfred romer were quadrupedal reptiles medium to large in size characterized by erect posture large and narrow skull and large antorbital openings sill 1974 p 317 attention was first brought to batrachotomus in 1993 by michael parrish a palaeontologist at northern illinois university parrish hypothesized that batrachotomus then kupferzellia belonged to family of rauisuchidae another clade of carnivorous reptiles and species of parrish 1993 p 301 however description of braincase and a revisited cladistic analysis by benton and walker showing close relationships between batrachotomus and led to transfer of batrachotomus to family prestosuchidae benton and walker 2002 pp 40 41 sterling j nesbitt 2011 revised classification of basal archosaurs and using most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for this group to date found prestosuchidae to be non monophyletic members of this clade were recovered as basal of which batrachotomus was found to be most derived i e most closely related to clade containing crocodylomorpha and rauisuchidae subsequent derivatives of this analysis further support this hypothesis in a yet to be formally published revision of a medium sized 5 m long from upper group of wyoming it was recovered as sister taxon of batrachotomus using a derivative of nesbitt 2011 analysis cladogram below follows an analysis by sterling j nesbitt 2011 thumb model background in triassic environment paleoecology since 1977 rich vertebrate fauna found at baden wurttemberg reflect a moist region of middle triassic in germany along with batrachotomus palaeontologists recovered remains of fishes amphibians such as and mastodonsaurus and even animals like and distinct marine reptile flora of locality consisted of horsetails ferns cycads and conifers suggesting that there was rich vegetation 2008 p 4
