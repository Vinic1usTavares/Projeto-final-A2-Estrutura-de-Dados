on 9 february 1945 a force of allied bristol beaufighter aircraft suffered many losses during an attack on german destroyer z33 and its escorting vessels operation was called black friday by allied survivors german ships were sheltering in a strong defensive position in forde fjord norway forcing allied aircraft to attack through massed anti aircraft fire beaufighters and their escort of mustang mk iii fighters from 65 squadron raf were intercepted by twelve focke wulf fw 190s of jagdgeschwader 5 fighter wing 5 of luftwaffe allies damaged at least two of german ships for loss of seven beaufighters shot down by flak guns two beaufighters and a mustang were shot down by fw 190s and four or five of fws were shot down by allied aircraft including that of german ace rudi linz decision to attack z33 and her escorts rather than a nearby group of merchant ships followed instructions from british admiralty to raf coastal command losses led to merchant ships being made priority over destroyers and small warships another squadron of p 51 mustangs was assigned to protect allied aircraft operating near norway from german fighters background due to allied victories in france and eastern europe germany s surface shipping was largely confined to lower baltic and norwegian waters by late 1944 this left ports in norway as germany s last remaining bases to continue battle of atlantic and conduct trade with sweden goulter 1995 pp 234 235 when baltic iced over during winter of 1944 45 germany was forced to transport its vital imports of swedish iron ore from port of narvik in northern norway milson 2010 p 50 in response to growing importance of german maritime transport routes through norwegian waters royal air force s coastal command transferred seven squadrons of anti shipping aircraft from bases in eastern england to northern scotland during september and october 1944 three squadrons equipped with mosquito light bombers were stationed at raf banff while a wing made up of four squadrons operating beaufighter heavy fighters was based at raf dallachy dallachy wing comprised british no 144 squadron canadian no 404 squadron australian no 455 squadron and new zealand no 489 squadron these four squadrons were veterans of many anti shipping operations over north sea herington 1963 pp 368 373 thumb left alt six young men wearing flying suits standing in front of a world war ii era twin engined monoplane some of no 455 squadron s aircrew posing in front of a beaufighter at raf dallachy in november 1944 attacks by banff wing quickly forced german ships travelling along norwegian coast to sail at night and take shelter in deep fjords during day where they were very difficult to attack in order to locate german ships two wings sent out aircraft on almost daily patrols along norwegian coastline from skagerrak to trondheim during this period allied squadrons developed a tactic of sending two outriders ahead of main body of patrol these aircraft were manned by experienced aircrew and penetrated into fjords in search of shipping which might not be spotted by other aircraft by december 1944 patrols were also routinely escorted by raf mustang mk iii fighters and accompanied by vickers warwick air sea rescue aircraft herington 1963 pp 373 376 only a single squadron of mustangs was available however as these long ranged fighters were needed to escort daylight raids by heavy bombers against germany roskill 1961 p 280 german fighters began to be encountered off norwegian coast in december and from end of month onwards it was common for allied wing sized operations near norway to be attacked by groups of up to 30 fighters in march 1945 luftwaffe had 85 single engined and about 45 twin engined aircraft operating from ten or twelve airfields south of trondheim goulter 1995 pp 245 246 during first weeks of 1945 allied strike wings flew few operations due to severe weather milson 2010 p 51 on 15 january banff wing was intercepted by 30 fw 190 fighters from iii gruppe of jagdgeschwader 5 iii jg 5 during a raid on town of leirvik in resulting fighting five mosquitos and five fw 190s were shot down bowman 1997 p 77 by 9 february ninth and twelfth squadrons of jg5 were based at herdla near bergen about to south of forde fjord these units were equipped with fw 190s and twelfth squadron was commanded by leutnant rudi linz a 28 year old flying ace with 69 kills to his credit conyers nesbit 1995 pp 224 225 german z33 entered service in february 1943 she served in norwegian waters from july of that year and saw combat on several occasions she was last german destroyer to leave northern norway and sailed for germany on 5 february 1945 koop and schmolke 1995 p 114 it was intended that which had completed initial repairs at bergen after being heavily damaged in action of 28 january 1945 would join her to make a joint passage to baltic roskill 1961 p 254 however z33 ran aground in on 7 february damaging her port shaft and propeller and causing both engines to fail she was subsequently taken under tow to be repaired in trondheim z33 and two tugboats that were towing her chose to shelter in forde fjord during daylight hours of 9 february while en route to trondheim parry 2002 p 47 battle preliminaries on morning of 9 february two new zealand crewed beaufighters from no 489 squadron conducted a patrol of norwegian coast these aircraft first sighted a 1 500 ton merchant ship in fjord continuing north they were surprised to find a narvik class destroyer accompanied by a minesweeper and two flak ships in forde fjord aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in nord and two minesweepers and a flak ship near conyers nesbit 1995 p 219 despite pilots surprise allied command was aware that z33 was in area from ultra signals intelligence dallachy wing was on alert to attack any ships found by reconnaissance patrol although group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target coastal command came under operational command of admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels conyers nesbit 1995 p 2009 p 180 as a result wing was dispatched against z33 even though destroyer and its escorts were well protected and in a difficult position for aircraft to attack alexander 2009 p 181 thumb alt two ships close to shore of a body of water near steep snow covered hills much of body of water is covered by sheets of ice z33 and another german ship in position they sailed to after being

pp 181 182 plan called for two outriders to precede main force and confirm location of german ships beaufighters would then arrive to east of german anchorage turn to west and attack ships before escaping over sea milson 2010 p 53 davenport sought to minimise allied casualties but location of german ships in a narrow and protected fjord meant that operation was inherently risky strike leader was wing commander colin milson 25 year old commanding officer of no 455 squadron and a veteran of anti shipping operations against italian and german ships in mediterranean and north seas milson had reservations about making what was likely to be a costly raid particularly given that war was clearly coming to an end but carried out order to attack z33 to best of his ability conyers nesbit 1995 p 221 after being spotted german ships in forde fjord sailed further up fjord and prepared for an allied attack z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to steep southern slopes of fjord near village of bjorkedal meanwhile other ships moored near northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire milson 2010 p nesbit 1995 p 224 this anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on shore of fjord attack at 1 30 pm on 9 february milson led 31 or 32 beaufighters into air from dallachy strike force was joined by either ten or twelve p 51 mustang fighters from no 65 squadron raf and two warwick air sea rescue aircraft from no 279 squadron raf carrying life rafts to help any aircrew forced to ditch all four of dallachy wing s squadrons contributed aircraft to force no 404 and no 455 squadron beaufighters were armed with rockets while aircraft from no 144 squadron and single no 489 squadron beaufighter dispatched were armed only with their four 20 mm cannon and six machine guns thumb left alt a ship sailing on a body of water amidst lumps of ice and explosions in water a german ship under attack in forde fjord after attackers crossed norwegian coastline at 3 40 pm two beaufighters from no 144 and no 489 squadrons detached themselves from main force and pressed ahead as outriders two outriders crossed forde fjord near where german ships had been sighted that morning at 3 50 pm they sent milson a radio message stating that they could not see ships outriders then turned to east and overflew town of forde before searching next fjord to north during their flight near forde fjord they did not spot german warships in their new position meanwhile ninth and twelfth squadrons of jg5 were scrambled from herdla at 3 50 pm and ordered to attack dallachy wing and its escorts conyers nesbit 1995 p 225 several minutes later main body of raid reached southern shore of forde fjord travelling north to their surprise allied planes passed directly over german ships and came under intense attack from anti aircraft guns though no aircraft were hit in response milson wheeled his force to right in an attempt to attack ships from east to west as planned steep walls of fjord protected z33 from attack from this direction however as a result milson led force west to near mouth of fjord and ordered beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east this required aircraft to fly into face of alerted german defences and then escape over steep mountains narrow confines of fjord also meant that beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able to swamp german defences as they normally sought to do goulter 1995 p 254 milson led first group of beaufighters into forde fjord at about 4 10 pm his aircraft escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other beaufighters followed him into fjord at about this time 12 fw 190s arrived at forde fjord and flew through german flak to intercept beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack british mustangs were taken by surprise but dived to intercept german fighters milson 2010 p 54 this led to an intense air battle with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack german ships it was largest aerial conflict ever fought over norway fighting continued until 4 25 pm by that time german ships had shot down seven beaufighters fw had claimed another two beaufighters and a mustang iii allied losses included six of eleven no 404 squadron aircraft involved in attack greenhous 1994 p 473 overall germans killed 14 allied airmen and took four prisoner of war conyers nesbit 1995 pp 226 228 allies damaged z33 and several of other german ships and shot down either four or five fw 190s milson 2010 pp 54 nesbit 1995 p 228 linz and another german pilot were killed kriegsmarine fatalities included four sailors on z33 and three on converted trawler both of these ships were damaged during attack there may also have been fatalities on other

were damaged returned to raf dallachy several had difficulty making safe landings and two were forced to land on their bellies due to undercarriage damage but no further aircraft were lost air and ground crew were shocked by scale of losses and battle became known as black friday conyers nesbit 1995 pp 228 2010 p 55 losses suffered by dallachy wing on 9 february were highest any of coastal command s strike wings sustained in a single operation during war german fighters many of which were short of fuel and ammunition also broke off at about 4 25 pm and returned to base on night of 9 10 february german ships left forde fjord and continued their journey to trondheim a subsequent allied attack on ships by a different strike wing was also unsuccessful z33 arrived in trondheim on 11 february and was repaired she subsequently departed for germany on 26 march and safely arrived in swinemunde on 2 april she did not see any further combat and was decommissioned at brunsbuttel in late april as navy lacked fuel needed to operate her losses incurred during raid on forde fjord led to changes in tactics used by raf coastal command s anti shipping squadrons following attack admiralty agreed to a proposal by air chief marshal sir sholto douglas commander of coastal command to assign a higher priority to attacking merchant vessels than to destroyers and small warships goulter 1995 p 255 a second squadron of mustangs was also assigned to protect coastal command aircraft operating near norway from early march milson was awarded a bar to his distinguished service order on 13 july 1945 for his leadership and personal courage during raid on forde fjord which was described in citation as a brilliantly executed operation raid was commemorated in norway after war a monument to aircrew killed in battle was dedicated in town of forde on 8 may 1985 40th anniversary of norway s liberation this monument was later moved to bergen airport alexander 2009 p 182 air combat museum in
