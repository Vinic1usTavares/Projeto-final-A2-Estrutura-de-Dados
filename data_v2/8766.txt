gollancz in 1930 dealt to a large extent with his conversion and spiritual identity as both a jew and an englishman this subject would become a recurring theme in his numerous mystical poems christ in synagogue reached only a small audience and received fewer than a dozen reviews but manchester guardian nation and athenaeum times literary supplement and new age wrote favourably of it extracts of reviews are reprinted in notwithstanding aaronson s small readership v gollancz published a second verse collection in 1933 titled poems despite being little known to general public aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers his third collection homeward journey and other poems was published in 1946 by christophers a small london publisher some of his works also appeared in journals and anthologies such as 1953 faber book of twentieth century verse since aaronson s poetry does not display formal innovation literature professor william baker characterises him as a post georgian rather than a modernist poet baker further notes that aaronson s poetry deals with several issues of his time such as rise of fascism and second world war but points out that aaronson did not directly write about holocaust upon aaronson s death poet arthur chaim jacobs compared him with isaac rosenberg more celebrated poet of same anglo jewish generation according to jacobs aaronson was clearly influenced by him in terms of diction and in a kind of verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry but he was less radical than rosenberg in his use of language and tended towards luxuriance and sweetness poet jon silkin also unfavourably compared aaronson to rosenberg writing it cannot be said that his work attains to either burning majesty or depth of rosenberg s poetry and this is explicable perhaps by fact that aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots although much of aaronson s writings centred on his conversion to christianity jacobs traces a continuing hebraic mood in his poetry and wrote that his christianity was hardly familiarly anglican and there is in his work an avowed sensuality which could in some ways be compared to that of modern hebrew poets like or shneur or later avraham according to his friend joseph leftwich aronson himself in old age acknowledged influences from both traditional judaism and martin buber s unorthodox interpretation of hasidism aaronson s poetry was not widely publicised and he left over a thousand unpublished poems at his death little scholarly attention has been paid to his life and poetry upon aaronson s death jacobs stated that further assessment of his work awaits more substantial publication about 40 years later baker who has written most extensively on aaronson named him among whitechapel intellectual writers and artists today consigned to oblivion bibliography christ in synagogue london v gollancz 1930 poems london v gollancz 1933 homeward journey and other poems london
