right thumb alt cricketer donald bradman sits on a bench in a sports stadium and displays a cricket bat with his brand name on it he wears a 1940s style double breasted suit and has his hair parted and slicked back with haircream he is smiling and posing rather awkwardly having scored triple centuries in two of his three previous test matches at ground bradman scored 173 not out to help australia seal series with a successful test world record runchase of 404 fourth test of 1948 ashes series was one of five tests in a cricket series between australia and england match was played at headingley stadium at leeds from 22 to 27 july with a rest day on 25 july australia won match by seven wickets to take an unassailable 3 0 series lead in successfully chasing a target of 404 they set a new world record for highest victorious runchase in test history needing to win match to prevent an australian series victory england captain norman yardley won toss and elected to bat england continued to rearrange their team making three changes in an attempt to find a combination that could challenge australia which made two changes forced by injury unlike preceding tests england s openers were able to withstand australian new ball attack and partnership of len hutton and cyril washbrook put on 168 for opening stand washbrook fell for 143 in last over of day but england clearly had better of play ending at 268 2 by stumps australia s bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance which was seen as lethargic next day england continued to amass runs with australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge bill edrich and nightwatchman alec bedser who batted until mid afternoon bedser and edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as england then collapsed and lost 8 73 to be all out for 496 late in day hosts were heavily criticised for collapse which was largely due to unforced errors among australian bowlers wickets were shared australia then reached 63 1 in reply at stumps on day two australia were in early trouble on third morning when english bowler dick pollard removed arthur morris and captain donald bradman in same over to leave score at 68 3 however keith miller 58 and neil harvey 112 launched a rapid counter attack adding 121 runs in 90 minutes in a display praised for its aesthetic beauty they were later supported by sam loxton 93 who hit five sixes and ray lindwall 77 who both struck ball powerfully australia ended day at 457 9 having added 394 runs in one day and 102 runs for last two wickets to that point australia were bowled out for 458 early on fourth morning after rest day and england set about extending their lead adding 129 for first wicket until both openers fell without further addition in meantime workload on australian bowlers was heavy as ernie toshack had broken down in first innings and unable to participate further edrich and denis compton took score to 232 2 until a late collapse saw england reach stumps at 362 8 england batted on for two overs on final day declaring at 365 8 bill johnston was most successful bowler with 4 95 this left australia a target of 404 in less than a day which would require a world record runchase and allowed yardley to use heavy roller to break up pitch making batting even harder for tourists most observers predicted an easy england win on a deteriorating surface australia started slowly and bradman joined morris at 57 1 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes they put together a stand of 301 in only 217 minutes aided by erratic bowling several missed catches and stumpings to help australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining morris made 182 while bradman was unbeaten on 173 england selectors were heavily criticised after match for failing to include a leg spinner in team to exploit favourable conditions for third time in a row match set a new record for highest attendance at a test in england background australia had proceeded through first two months of their tour of england undefeated after winning 10 of first 12 games other two being drawn eight of these by an innings they won first test by eight wickets between tests they defeated northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against yorkshire they crushed england by 409 runs in second test at lord s defeating surrey by ten wickets and crushing gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs after amassing 774 7 declared their highest score of season third test was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost a day and a half of play england had been in a strong position having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came at end of third day australia proceeded to claim a ten wicket triumph over middlesex in their only county game before fourth test australia made two changes for test at headingley middle order batsman neil harvey replaced injured opener sid barnes perry 2002 p 101 who had collapsed while fielding during third test after being hit in ribs by a dick pollard pull shot australia declined to replace barnes with reserve opener bill brown instead opting to use vice captain lindsay hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in middle order harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in recent tour matches against surrey and gloucestershire respectively ron saggers replaced first choice wicket keeper don tallon behind stumps tallon s little left finger had swelled up after third test and he exacerbated injury during match against middlesex lemmon p 103 former australian test leg spinner bill o reilly criticised australians for opting to use only one spinner pointing out that he and chuck fleetwood smith a left arm wrist spinner had taken 17 wickets between them during last anglo australian test at headingley in 1938 o reilly cited a further instance of an ashes test at same venue in 1934 in which he and clarrie grimmett had significant success for australia he wanted at least one of two leg spinners colin mccool or doug ring to have played alongside off spinner ian johnson o reilly p 110 only specialist spinner to have played in three preceding tests england made three changes george emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on his debut and len hutton was recalled to take his opening position after being controversially omitted after second test england s leading batsman hutton had scored 74 in first test and made 52 and 64 for marylebone cricket club against australia in lead up matches when none of his teammates passed 26 o reilly praised decision and england selectors for stopping all nonsense and phoney tactics o reilly p 105 he further speculated that they would have done so irrespective of hutton s form to avoid wrath of parochial yorkshire spectators at headingley but in any case he regarded original axing as scapegoating for england s two losses o reilly believed english administrators were penalising hutton for angering them rather than poor performance o reilly p 109 decision to recall hutton was met with wide approval from cricketing public jim laker off spinner replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague jack young who had taken 1 78 in previous match against australia for middlesex and totalled 3 174 in his two tests in series since his omission after second test laker had taken 15 wickets in four matches for surrey middle order batsman tom dollery who had made only 38 in three innings in second and third tests was replaced by all rounder ken cranston playing mainly for lancashire cranston had scored a century and four fifties and taken 37 wickets in his last ten matches but his previous outings against tourists had not been successful in two matches for mcc and lancashire against australia he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2 109 english commentator john arlott said cranston s selection was an indication that selectors were again hankering after non existent test all rounder arlott p 98 o reilly regarded it as best team that english selectors chose during season but felt they would be largely incapable of

on an ideal batting pitch which was seen as being unhelpful to fast bowling despite saying pitch would be more conducive to spinners o reilly described playing strip as being so green that it was difficult to decide where out field ended and pitch began o reilly p 111 although fast outfield was bumpy in some parts on some sections of ground there was a downward slope towards edge of playing arena meaning ball would accelerate downhill after being hit at times crowd spilled over unfenced boundary making ground smaller than intended all these factors meant scoring a boundary would be an easier task for batsmen fingleton p 148 england openers cyril washbrook and len hutton were given a loud reception as they walked out to bat particularly yorkshire local hutton they had to face australian opening pair of ray lindwall and keith miller without aid of sightscreen it was first time some of australians had played in a first class match without a sightscreen and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance it was believed yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered capacity of ground and thus gate takings large crowd roared boisterously as hutton got off mark with a single in first over from lindwall at other end miller bowled with less pace than normal and his opening over saw three full tosses in miller s first over hutton scored first boundary of day driving past mid off both australian pacemen felt their legs for strained muscles and after two overs o reilly described as very innocuous miller was taken off he was replaced by left arm pace of bill johnston who appeared to be having back problems johnston had bowled most overs of any bowler on tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues o reilly p 112 johnston s apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine that he should have been given more rest in county matches australian bowlers appeared to be unsettled and bradman made four bowling changes in first 50 minutes of play arlott p 99 bradman thought his faster bowlers could not extract much bounce from surface and soon removed short leg fielder and pursued a 6 3 off side field with three slips and a deep point trying to encourage english openers to cut through vacant area between slips and extra cover o reilly p 113 however they declined bradman s incentive and decided to bat in a low risk manner favouring straight batted shots after 80 minutes of batting england s openers reached 50 first time they had put on a half century in series fingleton p 151 hutton and washbrook appeared set for long haul and did not react to applause they continued on cautiously and persisted in eschewing cross batted cut and pull shots and relying on safe accumulation of singles fingleton p 152 hutton then edged a ball from left arm medium pacer ernie toshack through slips and was dropped by lindsay hassett on 25 after flicking ball behind square leg from medium pace of sam loxton hutton then hit a square drive past point and washbrook pulled a ball along ground past harvey who was patrolling midwicket boundary england were 88 without loss at lunch interval with hutton and washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively after a slow start they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50 and five boundaries were hit from a spell of six overs by lindwall immediately after lunch lindwall made a confident appeal for leg before wicket lbw against washbrook but was not supported behind stumps by a silent saggers and umpire ruled against tourists at other end hutton square drove toshack for four bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes he followed this with another boundary in same direction and washbrook back cut lindwall for four more at other end this brought up england s 100 its first without loss for series washbrook then on drove a ball to boundary and brought up his half century as bradman pondered how to capture australia s first wicket england brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions up to this point australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate in bright sunshine bradman called on off spin of ian johnson who had delivered only three overs to this point rest of proceedings having been through fast bowlers fingleton p 153 seeking to stem flow of runs bradman set a defensive ring field with no slip in place while johnson bowled two consecutive maidens washbrook took 24 at other end to reach 85 o reilly said bradman s defensive field settings made sorry admission of bradman then called for new ball with score on 164 which hutton on drove for four from lindwall this took opening partnership to 168 best by england in series washbrook refrained from hook shot which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in series partnership ended on very next ball when hutton went onto front foot and was clean bowled by lindwall much to dismay of home crowd nevertheless england had made a strong start continuing their spirited showing in previous test washbrook was joined by edrich who had scored two 50s in third test at old trafford after a lean start to series o reilly said hosts incoming batsmen had an ideal opportunity to amass a large score as australian attack was completely at mercy of two englishmen it had lost all its sting and looked quite innocuous o reilly p 114 washbrook reached his century with score on 189 1 he reached triple figures half an hour after tea having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries washbrook avoided cross batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from back foot and profited from many over pitched balls which he drove away for boundaries it was a welcome return to form for opener from lancashire he had scored six one eight 37 and 11 in his first five innings of series and was dropped on 21 in second innings of third test before proceeding to an unbeaten 85 fingleton p 154 after reaching his century washbrook began to play more expansively driving in a manner that prompted arlott to compare him to frank woolley washbrook and edrich batted until late in first day when former was dismissed by johnston for 143 in last over before stumps hitting a catch to lindwall in slips arlott p 101 his innings included 22 fours and dismissal ended a second wicket partnership worth exactly 100 runs washbrook had been solid in his back foot defence and scored many runs from overpitched deliveries bedser was sent in as nightwatchman and he survived last four balls from johnston as england closed at 268 2 without further addition to score with edrich who played fluently as he had done in previous test o reilly p 115 on 41 england s supporters were much buoyed with situation at end of first day former test batsman jack fingleton who covered tour as a journalist said australia s day went progressively downhill and described efforts as country s worst day of bowling since world war ii citing proliferation of full tosses england had batted conservatively steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers and miller bowled placidly fingleton s fellow journalist and former playing colleague o reilly criticised bowling display as worst by australians on tour and said none of bowlers could be excused he lambasted attack for operating without object hopelessly and throughout day he decried so called attack for being so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length and likened it to what was on offer in another monotonously uninteresting county match o reilly criticised bradman s players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in morning which gradually became more lethargic throughout day as home team strengthened their position o reilly speculated that tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 2 0 series lead 23 july day two next day england resumed hoping for more of what happened on opening day ground was again full with even more people squashed in than previous day sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover further hindering visibility of a ground without a sightscreen fingleton p 155 two english batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently and only two singles were scored in first 15 minutes of play england team frequently looked towards sky as they needed to win match and were in a good position they hoped that time would not be lost to rain bradman set a deep set defensive field as he sought to have lindwall and johnston contain batsmen before third new ball became available in all england scored only five runs in first half hour as two batsmen sought to survive and be set when new ball was taken and australian attack advantaged during this time main threat to batsmen was lindwall who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled edrich who sparred at a number of balls as soon as it was possible bradman took new ball and bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield denis compton and other middle order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball during this period bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit ball hard continuing defensive strategy of seeing off new ball it was not until 48th minute of play that edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past outside edge however hosts had seen off new ball without losing a wicket bedser then glanced a ball for four england scored only 22 runs in first hour after new ball bowlers had finished their new ball spells bradman reverted to slower bowlers using run saving defensive field settings immediately thereafter bedser targeted toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over bradman immediately removed left armer and replaced him with johnson australian captain set his infield rather deep effectively allowing batsmen to take easy singles bedser responded cautiously surveying johnson s off spin for one over before going on attack in next he lofted johnson into leg side three times yielding a six over long on and two fours taking his score to 47 bedser then hit a ball back to bowler loxton which was almost caught before reaching 50 bradman also brought back a tired miller to bowl medium pace off breaks to no avail england went to lunch adjournment at 360 2 with edrich on 76 and bedser on 52 they had added 92 for session including 70 in second hour fingleton p 156 lindwall had been only bowler who caused much difficulty to batsmen particularly concerning edrich but englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and miller nursing fitness concerns was forced to bowl medium paced off breaks o reilly p 116 edrich and bedser continued to amass runs after break and lindwall appealed for lbw for fourth time while saggers remained silent pair brought up their century partnership as england scored 22 runs in 30 minutes after lunch johnson came on and edrich lofted him for six to reach 96 edrich then hit a long hop from part time wrist spin of arthur morris for four to reach his century fingleton p 157 bedser joined attack and lifted morris high over square leg for six and bradman replaced him with toshack who bowled a maiden o reilly said that during partnership only lindwall appeared capable of threatening batsmen he said lindwall kept slogging away tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after other members of attack had lost all signs of hostility bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of galley slave work o reilly p 117 o reilly decried lindwall s workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity o reilly p 118 however against run of play bedser was out caught and bowled by johnson after almost three hours of batting ending a 155 run stand for third wicket his on drive was intercepted by bowler who dived across pitch to his right hand side to complete catch o reilly p 119 bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a test best of 79 he appeared upset by his dismissal ball back to bowler when he could have hit it decisively edrich attempted to pull a johnson long hop to leg side targeting large gap between square leg and mid on but only ballooned ball to morris who completed catch diving forwards at wide mid on this came only three runs after bedser s dismissal and left score at 426 4 edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111 with 13 fours and a six with two new batsmen compton and jack crapp at crease australia quickly made further inroads toshack bowled crapp for five with an inside edged half volley to leave england at 447 5 with this bradman took new ball and compton exploited its hardness to score quickly however after shine wore off and ball went soft compton could not score for 25 minutes fingleton p 158 o reilly decried compton s helpless effort in failing to dispatch tired australian bowling as worst test innings i have seen him play after compton and captain norman yardley had added 26 for sixth wicket former edged lindwall down leg side and saggers completed his first test catch to leave england at 473 6 o reilly speculated that compton s inability to make progress against bowling deflated his colleagues playing in his second test of summer loxton bowled ken cranston for 10 to claim his first ashes wicket leaving england at 486 7 cranston opted to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump o reilly p 120 loxton then removed godfrey evans and jim laker in quick succession as england fell to 496 9 evans fell meekly prodding a ball straight to hassett at silly mid on prompting o reilly to deem loxton lucky to be on deck when english tail were falling over themselves in their nervous speed to commit hara kiri in contrast laker edged loxton down leg side and it took a diving low catch from saggers to complete dismissal umpire baldwin asked his colleague chester at square leg to confirm ball had carried on full before sending laker back to pavilion o reilly p 121 miller then bowled yardley to end england s innings at 496 home side had batted for 192 1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for addition of 73 runs loxton took 3 55 while lindwall and johnson both took two apiece however late wickets came at a cost for australia who lost services of toshack to a knee injury cashman et al pp 299 300 collapse was heavily condemned fingleton said england encountered something ascendancy over australia which they had not known in post war cricket with australia and did not know how to handle it o reilly called capitulation a disgustingly bad show he asked what was there to make bowlers pulverize carefully chosen cream of english batting on a perfect wicket before concluding that collapse was caused by an unfortunate absence of concentration rather than opposition bowling both thought england had wasted an opportunity to put themselves in an unassailable position with barnes injured hassett moved up from middle order to open innings with morris using new ball bedser removed morris who chipped ball in air to cranston at mid wicket and fell for six to leave australia at 13 1 this brought bradman to crease and he was mobbed by spectators on a ground where he had scored two triple centuries in tests in 1930 and 1934 many spectators surged onto playing arena to greet bradman and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to acknowledge them fingleton pp 158 159 fingleton wrote on this field he bradman has won his greatest honours nowhere else has he been so acclaimed fingleton p 159 bradman got off mark from his first ball which compton prevented from going for four with a diving stop near boundary hassett was restrained while bradman attacked taking three fours from one edrich over bradman was 31 and hassett 13 as tourists reached stumps at 63 1 australian captain did majority of scoring in late afternoon adding 31 in a partnership of 50 tourists batted with little discomfort on a pitch that was still offering even bounce at a gentle pace arlott p 105 24 july day three thumb upright 1 2 loxton congratulates harvey with his first century in a test against england on third morning play resumed under hot and humid conditions there had been rain on pitch at 07 00 and bradman resumed proceedings by taking a single from a bedser no ball in same over one ball reared from pitch and moved into bradman hitting him in groin causing a delay as he recovered from pain and recomposed himself before play resumed in second over of day pollard got second ball to lift caught out by unexpected bounce hassett was unable to get out of way and edged ball to crapp in slips for 13 miller came to crease and drove his first ball for three runs bringing bradman on strike for fourth ball of over pollard then pitched a ball in same place as he did to hassett but this time it skidded low off pitch deviated back in and knocked out bradman s off stump for 33 fingleton p 160 according to o reilly bradman backed away from ball as it cut off pitch with a noticeable flinch o reilly attributed bradman s unwillingness to get behind ball to blow inflicted on him by bedser in previous over and rearing ball that dismissed hassett o reilly p 123 sensing importance of two quick wickets in particular that of bradman who had been so productive at headingley crowd erupted australia were struggling at 68 3 as harvey playing his first ashes test and youngest member of squad at age of 19 walked out bareheaded to join miller at crease fingleton p 161 tourists were more than 400 behind and another wicket would expose lower order and give england opportunity to take a large first innings lead harvey told his senior partner what s going on out here eh let s get stuck into em perry 2005 p 245 he got off mark by forcing ball behind point fingleton pp 161 162 pair launched a counterattack miller taking lead he hoisted off spinner laker s first ball over square leg fence for six miller shielded harvey from laker as his younger partner was struggling against off breaks that were turning away from him including one that spun and bounced sharply to beating outside edge fingleton p 162 miller drilled one off drive off laker for four and after mis hitting next much to amusement of crowd hit off spinner flat over his head almost for six into sightscreen this allowed australia to seize initiative and harvey joined fightback in next over hitting consecutive boundaries against laker second of which almost cleared playing area he struck another boundary to reach 44 while miller s score stayed on 42 fingleton p 163 after half an hour of play early morning life in pitch appeared to have died out miller then lifted laker for another six over long off hitting a spectator in head english captain noted for his ability to break partnerships with his occasional bowling brought himself on miller responded by striking a four over long on from yardley s bowling to reach 54 he drove next ball through cover for four english skipper responded by stacking leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump challenging miller to attempt another hit for six yardley bowled a half volley outside leg stump and batsman obliged but edged ball off back of his bat onto wicket keeper evans head and was caught by a forward diving edrich at short fine leg o reilly p 124 perry 2005 p 246 partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes and was likened by wisden cricketers almanack to a hurricane fingleton said he had never known a more enjoyable hour of delectable cricket fingleton pp 162 163 he acclaimed miller s innings as one of rarest gems in test collection of all time and a moment to live in cricket memory o reilly said miller and harvey had counter attacked with such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult if not absolutely impossible to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation crowd was in raptures at both batting and edrich s catch fingleton p 164 arlott said two of greatest innings of all test cricket were being played arlott p 108 and praised miller for elevating cricket to a point of aesthetic beauty arlott p 109 loxton came in to join harvey at 189 4 who continued attacking unperturbed by miller s departure cranston came on and harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries yardley moved a man from fine leg to location where previous hook had gone harvey responded by glancing a ball to where fine leg fielder had been collecting three more runs australia thus went to lunch at 204 4 with harvey on 70 after lunch australia scored slowly as loxton struggled to find his fluency against bowling yardley took new ball in an attempt to trouble batsmen with extra pace but instead loxton began to settle in australian lofted pollard to leg side almost for six and hit three fours off a subsequent pollard over harvey accelerated as well and 80 minutes into middle session reached his century to a loud reception as australia passed 250 he had taken 177 minutes and hit 14 fours fingleton p 165 loxton then dominated scoring in a display of power hitting he brought up his 50 by hitting cranston into pavilion for six eliciting spontaneous applause from english players century stand yielded 105 runs in only 95 minutes harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls bowled by laker while playing a cross batted sweep his shot selection prompted bradman to throw his head back in disappointment fingleton p 166 nevertheless it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of wicket and harvey s fast scoring helped to wrest match back from england s firm control cashman et al pp 174 175 o reilly said innings was one of no inhibitions completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot he added that it was very mirror of truth in batting art delightfully untrammeled by of good advice or any other handicapping influence and deemed harvey s innings to be most pleasing he had seen since stan mccabe s 232 at trent bridge in 1938 o reilly p 125 harvey s departure at 294 5 brought first of bowlers johnson to crease this did not deter loxton who was particularly severe on laker lifting off spinner for four more sixes two over leg side followed by consecutive off drives into gallery perry 2005 p 247 on each occasion umpire chester walked to edge of playing field and tried to inspect where ball landed amongst crowd trying to see if point of impact was beyond original playing arena they were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought chester s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes o reilly p 126 laker refused to be deterred by aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive off or leg theory o reilly p 127 johnson scored 10 before falling with score at 329 6 hitting laker to cranston australia was still some way behind when lindwall replaced johnson at crease fifteen runs later yardley bowled loxton for 93 who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross batted swing with a maiden test century beckoning saggers came in and only managed five in his first test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by laker who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries undeterred by sixes loxton had hit from him rather than bowling leg theory this left australia at 355 8 ten minutes before tea with only johnston and toshack remaining lindwall hit out scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling pollard 1990 p 14 dominating stands of 48 and 55 with johnston and toshack respectively he particularly liked to use his feet to get to ball on half volley so he could hit lofted drives o reilly p 132 of 103 added for last two wickets johnston and toshack managed only 25 between them johnston accompanied lindwall for 80 minutes before toshack lasted last 50 minutes until stumps with johnston as his runner australia were 457 9 at stumps with lindwall on 76 and toshack on 12 fingleton p 167 during lindwall s partnership with johnston yardley bowled himself for over an hour failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge batsmen o reilly p 128 lindwall farmed strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during over but yardley did not resort to tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to lindwall to get tailenders on strike despite toshack and johnston s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively and resulting disorders in running between wickets lindwall was able to manipulate strike so he faced most of balls o reilly p 131 lindwall s partners were able to survive against english pacemen leading o reilly to lament absence of leg spinner doug wright whose guile and flight was held in high regard by australians o reilly p 129 o reilly thought yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain australians rather than dismiss them before close of play so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when visitors attack could have made inroads however yardley was neither able to contain nor dismiss australian tail o reilly pp 131 132 26 july day four sunday was a rest day and match resumed on monday morning fingleton p 168 in third over of day lindwall was last man out at 458 leaving australia 38 runs in arrears on first innings bradman s men had added only one run to its overnight score of 457 9 bedser took final wicket as lindwall edged and crapp took catch low down in slips with his left hand bedser ended with 3 92 and laker 3 113 while pollard and yardley ended with two wickets each england s use of cranston as an all rounder had not been successful he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket although england had only a slight lead australia had disadvantage of being a bowler short due to toshack s injury this meant johnston and johnson among slower bowlers were left to exploit wearing pitch for remainder of fourth day england set about extending their lead early in innings capacity crowd encroached substantially onto ground and umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back to edge of official playing area but they again spilled over initially hutton and washbrook played cautiously to see off new ball before trying to lift run rate o reilly pp 132 133 lindwall s first two overs were maidens but hutton and washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs while taking only five from miller s six overs arlott p 112 english batsmen attacked bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running england reached lunch at 72 0 with hutton on 40 and washbrook on 28 fingleton p 169 washbrook was particularly confident and bradman decided to not risk johnson in morning session afternoon session continued with further spectator encroachments after lunch bradman set defensive fields with intent of restricting scoring and used his remaining bowlers in short spells to conserve their energy expecting a long day in field absence of toshack also meant loxton had a substantial workload with ball o reilly p 133 english batsmen continued to accelerate and when bradman finally brought johnson into attack they targeted him washbrook hit a straight six from johnson and hutton followed suit to take england from 98 to 104 for second time in match english openers had put on a century stand and shot also brought up hutton s 50 in 125 minutes this feat made hutton and washbrook first pair to make century opening partnerships in both innings of a test on two occasions they had done this for first time against australia in fourth test at adelaide oval in 1946 47 bradman replaced johnson with lindwall immediately and washbrook responded by cutting paceman for four to reach his half century lindwall responded with two bouncers washbrook then hooked one a short ball from johnston and got a top edge but bradman failed to take catch fingleton p 170 washbrook then attempted another hook from johnston towards deep square leg connecting with middle of bat he imparted much power on ball which flew flat and never went more than six metres above ground harvey quickly moved in across outfield from square leg fence and bent over to catch ball at his ankles while still on run fingleton called it catch of season or indeed would have been had harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at oval in an earlier match against surrey o reilly doubted whether any other player on either side could have made distance to get to ball let alone make a neat catch of it o reilly pp 133 134 he further said hook was a beauty and catch was a classic o reilly p 134 johnson then removed hutton for 57 without further addition to total caught by bradman on run leaving england at 129 2 yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it high in air after being beaten in flight arlott p 113 and australian captain ran backwards from mid on to complete catch this meant two new batsmen at crease edrich and compton were still yet to score and second new ball was only six overs away so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for australia s fast bowlers during a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour edrich and compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place after 45 minutes compton premeditated a charge down pitch and hit johnson to leg side for a boundary pair accelerated compton taking risks in cutting johnson against spin australia took new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up fifty partnership which took an hour worried by substantial and hazardous craters he and other bowlers had created in pitch while following through on left hand side of crease lindwall changed to bowling from around wicket and was warned by umpire baldwin for running on pitch before reverting to over wicket although he delivered from edge of crease to avoid holes o reilly said baldwin s warning to lindwall had played into australia s hands as bowler s follow through from around wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside right hander s off stump which english bowlers could target when bradman s men had to chase target o reilly p 135 compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from lindwall and johnston and england went to tea at 209 2 compton was on 42 and edrich 33 fingleton p 171 after interval bradman continued with his strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells and set a defensive well spread field for johnson s bowling arlott p 114 edrich hit three consecutive boundaries from johnson before lofting a fourth ball into crowd for six he then passed his half century his fourth consecutive test score in excess of 50 before lindwall trapped him lbw for 51 to leave england at 232 3 ending a third wicket partnership of 103 crapp came in and added 18 before he was bowled by lindwall inside edging an attempted forcing stroke through off side from back foot this left england at 260 4 and precipitated a mini collapse yardley deliberately lifted lindwall over vacant slips region and reached seven before he fell to johnston caught by a leaping harvey while attempting a lofted shot johnston then had cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave england at 278 6 a lead of 316 evans came in and edged his first ball through slips at a height for four compton drove lindwall for a boundary but then fell to johnston for 66 caught by miller at cover england were 293 7 with no recognised batsmen remaining having lost 4 33 wicket keeper evans was joined by bedser and pair added 37 before miller removed latter laker came in and helped evans to add a further 32 as england reached 362 8 at close of fourth day evans mainly through boundaries had helped england to add 69 runs in last 45 minutes of play 27 july day five england batted on for five minutes during final morning adding three runs in two overs before yardley declared at 365 8 with evans unbeaten on 47 johnston had pick of bowling figures with 4 95 batting into final day allowed yardley to ask groundsman to use a heavy roller at start of morning which would help break up wicket and make it more likely to spin bradman had done a similar thing during previous ashes series in australia before setting england a target hosts needed to beat australia to avoid a series defeat fingleton p 172 bradman elected to not have pitch rolled at all demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make surface less favourable for batting fingleton p 173 declaration left australia with a victory target of 404 runs at time this would have been highest ever fourth innings score to result in a test victory for batting side australia had only 345 minutes to reach target and local press wrote them off predicting their dismissal by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spinners in addition most of australian onlookers present at ground thought their team had no chance of victory o reilly p 138 morris and hassett started slowly making only six runs in first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce it appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve target at a later point in bedser s second over third of innings morris chipped ball in air towards mid wicket in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal but this time ball evaded cranston after 15 minutes australia had scored only 10 runs fingleton p 174 after bedser had bowled three overs yardley introduced laker in his place in seventh over to exploit spin an attacking field with two slips and a gully was put in a place but laker bowled inaccurately and australian openers took 13 runs from his first over hassett hit a four and took a single to give morris strike morris hit a four was beaten by a bouncing ball that hurried off pitch and then hit another boundary despite this over only 44 runs came in first hour meaning that 360 runs were needed in 285 minutes after his poor first over laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs arlott p 117 frustrated crowd heckled australian openers for their slow scoring and morris was ironically applauded after taking a single evans then missed a leg side stumping opportunity against hassett and bedser beat each of australians with extra bounce during his early spell laker was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably noting laker s ability to extract substantial turn from pitch yardley brought on part time left arm unorthodox spin of compton who bowled inaccurately although with some turn morris struck two fours in compton s first over to register australia s 50 in 64 minutes compton s next over was more potent he deceived morris who danced down pitch and missed ball but evans fumbled stumping opportunity at time morris was on 32 and australia at 55 0 fingleton pp 174 175 laker beat morris in next over with an off break that spun a foot and in succeeding over hassett was dismissed by compton with score at 57 compton had caught hassett s leading edge and dived forward in his follow through to catch ball one handed just above ground fingleton p 175 bradman joined morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes after receiving another rapturous welcome from headingley spectators in his last innings at ground australian captain signalled his intentions by hitting a boundary from compton and another off first ball he faced from laker cover driving against spin bradman reached 12 in six minutes yardley then called upon occasional leg spin of hutton in an attempt to exploit turning wicket latter had taken only four wickets in 1947 english season and had never dismissed an australian batsman in ten tests against such opponents arlott p 119 as australia were still behind required run rate yardley could afford to take risks and sacrifice some runs if he got wickets in return morris promptly joined bradman in counter attack hitting three consecutive fours from hutton s first over which fingleton described as rather terrible due to errant length this over took morris to 51 after an economical over from compton bradman took two fours off hutton s next over before almost holing out to yardley despite near miss 20 runs from hutton s two inaccurate overs had allowed australia to reach 96 1 from 90 minutes in next over compton bowled a googly to deceive bradman who expected ball to turn in however it went other way took outside edge and ran away past slip for four bradman leg glanced next ball for another boundary before again failing to read a googly on third ball of over this time edge went to crapp who failed to hold on to catch sixth ball of compton s over beat bradman and hit him on pads compton had control of bradman for over but went unrewarded fingleton pp 175 176 at other end morris continued to plunder hutton s inaccurate leg breaks and australia reached lunch at 121 1 with morris on 63 and bradman on 35 pollard p 15 hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs fingleton p 176 and in half hour preceding interval australia had added 64 runs both morris and bradman had been given lives although australia had scored at a reasonable rate they had also been troubled by many of deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat o reilly p 139 upon resumption compton continued as yardley attempted to exploit turning wicket however compton was not a regular bowler and he sent down a series of ill directed full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs morris struck seven fours in two overs of what fingleton called indescribably bad bowling this included six fours in eight balls as morris continued to attack compton began to crack under pressure and his inaccuracy increased part time bowler had generated trouble for batsmen by tossing ball up and beating bat or inducing edges but morris counterattacked with drives compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven but australian opener pounced on shorter balls o reilly p 140 morris reached 90s just 14 minutes after interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in a little over two hours morris had added 37 runs since lunch mainly from compton s wayward offerings while bradman had added only three onslaught prompted yardley to take new ball and replace compton with his pacemen bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from cranston s bowling but sliced it in air to point yardley dived forward and got his hands to ball but failed to hold on australia reached 202 halfway to required total with 165 minutes left after morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from laker england began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate bradman hooked two boundaries but suffered a fibrositis attack which put him in significant pain drinks were taken while bradman was being treated fingleton p 177 and morris had to shield his captain from strike until pain had subsided australia reached 250 shortly before tea with morris on 133 and bradman on 92 bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as second wicket stand passed 200 morris was given another life on 136 when laker dropped him while fielding at square leg from compton s bowling bradman was given another life at 108 when he advanced two metres down pitch to laker and missed but evans fumbled stumping opportunity with batsman far out of his ground australia reached tea at 292 1 with morris on 150 pair had added 171 during session morris was eventually dismissed by yardley for 182 after hitting a tired looking shot to mid off having partnered bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes he struck 33 fours in a 290 minute innings this brought miller to crease with 46 runs still required miller struck two boundaries and helped take score to 396 before falling lbw to cranston with eight runs still needed harvey came in and got off mark with a boundary that brought up winning runs australia had won by seven wickets setting a new world record for highest successful test runchase with bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes of batting with 29 fours perry 2001 pp 84 89 attendance of 158 000 was highest for any cricket match on english soil and takings were 34 000 pounds crowd remains a record for a test in england aftermath after fourth test australians had five tour matches before final test they defeated derbyshire by an innings before having a washout against glamorgan australians then defeated warwickshire by nine wickets before drawing with lancashire who hung on with three wickets in hand on final day this was followed by a two day non first class match against durham which was drawn after rain washed out second day fingleton pp 190 210 during this period barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury toshack also recovered to play against lancashire but injured himself again and was ruled out of remainder of tour following australia s unlikely win at headingley england selectors were widely condemned for their failure to choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit turning pitch this was cited as a reason for hosts loss as part timer compton was able to trouble batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings fingleton pp 175 180 in response english selectors made four changes to team for fifth test one of these being inclusion of leg spinner eric hollies their frequent changes to team meant hosts used a total of 21 players for five tests and repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism fingleton p 182 despite hollies being able to trouble most of their batsmen australia completed test series with a convincing innings victory in fifth test to complete a 4 0 result fifth test was last international match and australia had only seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil bradman s aim of going through tour undefeated they secured three consecutive innings victories against kent gentlemen of england and somerset they proceeded to take first innings leads of more than 200 against south of england and leveson gower s xi but both matches were washed out last two matches were two day non first class matches against scotland both won by an innings bradman s men thus completed tour undefeated earning themselves sobriquet
