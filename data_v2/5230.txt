raid on manila of january 1798 was a royal navy false flag military operation during french revolutionary wars intended to scout strength of defences of manila capital of spanish philippines capture a manila galleon and assess condition of spanish navy squadron maintained in port spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in war of first coalition into an enemy in 1796 thus presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to china fleet an annual convoy of east indiaman merchant ships from macau in qing dynasty china to britain which was of vital economic importance to britain so severe was this threat that a major invasion of spanish philippines had been planned from british india during 1797 but had been called off following treaty of campo formio in europe and possibility of a major war in india between british east india company and kingdom of mysore to ensure safety of merchant ships gathering at macau in winter of 1797 98 british commander in east indies rear admiral peter rainier sent a convoy to china escorted by frigates hms sybille and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke after completing his mission cooke decided to investigate state of readiness of spanish forces in manila himself he was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from manila which would make a valuable prize sailing in sybille and accompanied by captain pulteney malcolm in fox cooke reached spanish capital on 13 january 1798 anchored in manila bay cooke pretended that his ships were french vessels and successfully lured successive boatloads of spanish officials aboard taking them prisoner in turn once he had determined from his captives state of defences in manila that treasure ship had been unloaded at cavite and that spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in mouth of pasig river capturing gunboats in a bloodless attack cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards unsuccessfully assaulting zamboanga before returning to macau background in 1796 after three years of french revolutionary wars spain and french republic signed treaty of san ildefonso secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally in east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that dominant british forces in region were faced with threat of attack from spanish philippines to east britain dominated east indies in 1796 controlling trade routes through indian ocean from ports of bombay madras and calcutta dutch ceylon dutch cape colony and parts of dutch east indies had been captured in 1795 and french presence in region had been confined to ile de france and a few subsidiary islands in western indian ocean some of most important trade routes began at canton and macau in qing dynasty china early in each year a large convoy known as china fleet composed of large east indiaman merchant ships in employ of british east india company sailed westwards to europe from macau laden with tea and other commercial cargo this convoy was economically significant to britain one convoy in 1804 was valued at over ps8 million equivalent of ps as of in january 1797 convoy had been attacked by french squadron in east indies comprising six frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey in ensuing bali strait incident commander deceived sercey into believing that unescorted convoy contained disguised ships of line and french admiral retreated only learning of his error on his return to ile de france there was considerable concern in india that sercey might try again in 1798 or that spanish who maintained a powerful squadron at cavite might make an attempt of their own rainier s initial impulse on learning in november 1796 of impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of philippines centred on manila in repetition of successful british capture of manila in 1762 co operating with governor general of india sir john shore and colonel arthur among others a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for operation which was in advance planning stages when unexpected news arrived in india in august 1797 announcing treaty of campo formio which brought war of first coalition to an end britain now faced france and spain alone while emissaries from tipu sultan of kingdom of mysore an old opponent of britain in southern india were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities resources planned for operation against manila were therefore retained in india and operation cancelled but protection of china fleet was still essential and rainier diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in spring of 1797 in preparation for trip to macau to load trade goods and join china fleet to escort this force rainier provided 40 gun frigate hms sybille captured from french at battle of mykonos in 1794 and 50 gun hms centurion which sailed with convoy in july taking passage through straits of malacca joined there by ships of line hms victorious and hms trident and 32 gun frigate hms fox under captain pulteney malcolm for final voyage to macau convoy arrived without incident on 13 december 1797 although crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses cooke s raids reconnaissance of manilla with his convoy safely at anchor in macau and china fleet several weeks from sailing cooke decided to reconnoitre manila and make observations on port and spanish squadron based there as an added motivation rumours in macau suggested that annual manila galleon was due to arrive this ship brought up to two million spanish silver dollars from acapulco across pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila depositing its dollars in philippines ship then loaded trade goods from east indies for return journey to new spain this round trip was essential to maintenance of spanish empire in east indies which operated at an enormous financial loss only mitigated by substantial subsidy from new spain spanish dollars were accepted currency across most of east indies and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking manila galleons since thomas cavendish in 1587 leaving heavier warships at macau cooke sailed on 5 january 1798 only with sybille and fox latter carrying a mr bernard an experienced linguist passing luzon cooke s ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel which was lured towards frigates which were flying french tricolors seizing spanish vessel cooke closely questioned captain and learned that most of spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at cavite and were unfit to sail cooke rewarded captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact although he did remove 3 900 silver dollars spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in april 1797 and much of damage had still not been repaired by time cooke s small squadron arrived off manila cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as french vessels modelling sybille on powerful 40 gun forte and fox on smaller prudente dinner on sybille late in afternoon of 13 january 1798 sybille and fox arrived in manila bay slipping unchallenged past fortress of corregidor and then sailing across bay on morning of 14 january anchoring between manila and cavite from his vantage point cooke could see spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in cavite ships of line san pedro europa and montanes and frigates maria de la and luisa in dock and unfit for action to cooke s disappointment he could also see manila galleon being unloaded at cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in harbour spanish had learned only shortly before cooke s arrival that british frigate hms resistance under captain edward pakenham was in philippine waters and had decided to remove valuable cargo from treasure ship rather than risk an attack fox was first british ship into anchorage and was consequently approached by guardboat whose crew came aboard malcolm like cooke spoke french fluently and with bernard translating was able to persuade officer in charge that new arrivals were forte and prudente seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at earliest cooke then joined party on deck of fox claiming to be commodore latour a french officer who unknown to spanish had been killed in action of 9 september 1796 off sumatra spanish officer was now completely convinced by ruse which had been augmented by fake french uniforms inviting visitor below decks cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of toasts including downfall of england for an hour officers drank malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about state of defences and squadron in philippines until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to greet french arrivals this vessel was personal barge of spanish commander at cavite rear admiral don ignacio maria de alava who was not aboard but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat each time officers were escorted below to join festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war in malcolm s cabin captured officers were informed of their situation promised release before british frigates sailed and offered more wine crew of fox meanwhile forced captured spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing climbing into spanish boats this party rowed for mouth of nearby pasig river where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored taking crews by surprise british boarding parties drove off spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside fox these vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well armed one with a 32 pounder long gun and two with 24 pounder long guns each supplemented by four swivel guns harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards furious at seizure of gunboats and demanding they be returned malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join other captured officers in his cabin while boat s crew were imprisoned below decks shortly afterwards at 16 00 cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and grog to crew total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately 200 once meal was finished cooke allowed all of captives to return to their boats and row for shore without conditions of parole although he retained captured gunboats zamboanga cooke led his small squadron past corregidor on 15 january and turned south four days later in a storm one of gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again lost with its twelve crew frigates subsequently scouted mindanao before reaching zamboanga on 22 january there cooke raised spanish colours in an attempt to deceive authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but sybille grounded on a sandbank at entrance to port which raised suspicions of a guardboat sent by governor of zamboanga espanol recuerdos de un hecho por mundos no 161 june 1908 p viii x captain of spanish boat asked british ships names of their captains and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire he put town on alert with defenders forewarned cooke abandoned his ruse and after refloating sybille following morning ordered a bombardment of fort protecting harbour this had little effect though later spanish recovered at least 450 cannonballs from different calibres and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm landward side of fort boats came under heavy fire one smashed by a cannonball killing two and wounding four another boat grounded on a sandbar and became stuck so with his force in disarray as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove british from beach malcolm called off operation after exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range with two dead and one wounded on sybille and eight wounded on fox in addition to those lost in boats defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded with his frigates now requiring repairs cooke withdraw half a league from zamboanga and spent three days refitting masts and rigging of ships then he sailed north scuttling two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive return journey to canton four days later on 27 january squadron halted at a village named in north of sultanate of maguindanao to collect fresh water on beach a boat party from sybille was set upon by tribesmen two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into forest before rescuers could arrive cooke complained to sultan at kuta and captured sailors were eventually recovered although not before sybille and fox had sailed for china to escort merchant convoy back to india aftermath cooke s opportunistic diversion had determined that spanish forces in philippines posed no immediate threat although mission had cost 18 lives admiral rainier later expressed his satisfaction with outcome in a letter to admiralty more might have been achieved with reinforcements historian c northcote parkinson suggests that had cooke s squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy disarmed spanish warships at cavite he also notes however that in this scenario pakenham would have been commanding officer a man with considerably less imagination and guile than cooke historian richard woodman was critical of mission considering operation to have no glorious outcome and citing failure to capture treasure ships as its greatest short coming 1798 china fleet sailed without further incident during ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in bangka strait and majority of rainier s forces were focused on disrupting french occupation of suez in red sea this diversion of british resources created gaps in coverage in merchant shipping and sercey was able to send frigate preneuse and corvette brule gueule to manila late in year to join repaired spanish squadron at beginning of february 1799 this combined force sailed to macau taking british defences by surprise british commander captain william hargood counterattacked advancing on franco spanish force which retreated during day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in archipelago combined squadron then dispersed and china fleet was not attacked again until battle of pulo aura in 1804 at which a french squadron was again driven off in confusion frigates cooke had mimicked forte and prudente were sent to operate independently against british trade in indian ocean in early 1799 prudente was captured by hms daedalus at action of 9 february 1799 near southern africa and forte was intercepted by hms sybille under cooke on 28 february near balasore in bengal in ensuing battle forte was captured but
