from new york new york with an ensemble in recognition of his many years of association with las vegas frank sinatra was elected to gaming hall of fame in 1997 artistry while sinatra never learned how to read music well he had a fine natural understanding of it and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music he did however learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by carefully following patterns and groupings of notes arranged on page and made his own notations to music using his ear to detect differences granata states that some of most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding and remarked that sinatra had a sixth sense which demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within orchestra sinatra was an aficionado of classical music and would often request classical strains in his music inspired by composers such as puccini and impressionist masters his personal favorite was ralph vaughan williams he would insist on always recording live with band because it gave him a certain feeling to perform live surrounded by musicians by mid 1940s such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by alec wilder which were for strings and woodwinds he became conductor at columbia records for six of wilder s compositions air for oboe air for english horn air for flute air for bassoon slow dance and theme and variations works which combine elements of jazz and classical music were considered by wilder to have been among finest renditions and recordings of his compositions past or present at one recording session with arranger claus ogerman and an orchestra sinatra heard a couple of little strangers in string section prompting ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist s errors critic gene lees a lyricist and author of words to jobim melody this happy madness expressed amazement when he heard sinatra s recording of it on sinatra company 1971 considering him to have delivered lyrics to perfection voice coach john quinlan was impressed by sinatra s vocal range remarking he has far more voice than people think he has he can vocalize to a b flat on top in full voice and he doesn t need a mic either as a singer early on he was primarily influenced by bing crosby but later believed that tony bennett was best singer in business bennett also praised sinatra himself claiming that as a performer he had perfected art of intimacy according to nelson riddle sinatra had a fairly rangy voice remarking that his voice has a very strident insistent sound in top register a smooth lyrical sound in middle register and a very tender sound in low his voice is built on infinite taste with an overall inflection of sex he points everything he does from a sexual standpoint despite his heavy new jersey accent according to richard schuller when sinatra sang his accent was virtually undetectable with his diction becoming precise and articulation meticulous his timing was impeccable allowing him according to charles l granata to toy with rhythm of a melody bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric tommy dorsey observed that sinatra would take a musical phrase and play it all way through seemingly without breathing for eight ten maybe sixteen bars dorsey was a considerable influence on sinatra s techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on trombone and sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power thumb right sinatra with axel stordahl at hall in new york 1947 arrangers nelson riddle and anthony found sinatra to be a perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament granata comments that sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about music or showing off his power over others on days when he felt that his voice was not right he would know after only a few notes and would postpone recording session until following day yet still pay his musicians after a period of performing sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with once he found ones that he liked he actively sought to work with them as often as he could and made friends with many of them he once told sammy cahn who wrote songs for anchors aweigh if you re not there monday i m not there monday over years he recorded 87 of cahn s songs of which 24 were composed by jule styne and 43 by jimmy van heusen cahn styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954 when van heusen succeeded him as sinatra s main composer unlike many of his contemporaries sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings he would spend weeks thinking about songs he wanted to record and would keep an arranger in mind for each song if it was a mellow love song he would ask for gordon jenkins if it was a rhythm number he would think of billy may or perhaps neil hefti or some other favored arranger jenkins considered sinatra s musical sense to be unerring his changes to riddle s charts would frustrate riddle yet he would usually concede that sinatra s ideas were superior barbara sinatra notes that sinatra would almost always credit songwriter at end of each number and would often make comments to audience such as isn t that a pretty ballad or don t you think that s most marvelous love song delivered with childlike delight she states that after each show sinatra would be in a buoyant electrically charged mood a post show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of performance he d just given sinatra s split with gardner in fall of 1953 had a profound impact on types of songs he sang and on his voice he began to console himself in songs with a brooding melancholy such as i m a fool to want you don t worry bout me my one and only love and there will never be another you which riddle believed was direct influence of ava gardner lahr comments that new sinatra was not gentle boy balladeer of forties fragility had gone from his voice to be replaced by a virile adult s sense of happiness and hurt author granata considered sinatra a master of art of recording noting that his work in studio set him apart from other gifted vocalists during his career he made over 1000 recordings recording sessions would typically last three hours though sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by piano beforehand to vocalize followed by a short rehearsal with orchestra to ensure balance of sound during his columbia years sinatra used an rca 44 microphone which granata describes as old fashioned microphone which is closely associated with sinatra s crooner image of 1940s though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet shaped rca 77 at capitol he used a neumann an ultra sensitive microphone which better captured timbre and tone of his voice in 1950s sinatra s career was facilitated by developments in technology as disc jockey jonathan schwartz said never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length in words of author john lahr as many as sixteen songs could be held by twelve inch l p and this allowed sinatra to use song in a novelistic way turning each track in a kind of chapter which built and moods to illuminate a larger theme santopietro writes that through 1950s and well into 1960s every sinatra lp was a masterpiece of one sort of another whether uptempo torch song or swingin affairs track after track brilliant concept
