minority view more prominent in recent years ranks him as highest of three opinions have ranged from those of hugh macdiarmid who called him a complete wash out f r leavis who wrote that auden s ironic style was self defensive self indulgent or merely irresponsible haffenden p 222 and harold bloom who wrote close thy auden open thy wallace stevens to obituarist in times who wrote w h auden for long enfant terrible of english poetry emerges as its undisputed master joseph brodsky wrote that auden had greatest mind of twentieth century critical estimates were divided from start reviewing auden s first book poems 1930 naomi mitchison wrote if this is really only beginning we have perhaps a master to look forward to haffenden p 83 but john sparrow recalling mitchison s comment in 1934 dismissed auden s early work as a monument to misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets and fact that he is being hailed as a master shows how criticism is helping poetry on downward path haffenden pp 7 8 auden s clipped satiric and ironic style in 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as charles madge who wrote in a poem there waited for me in summer morning auden fiercely i read shuddered and knew smith companion p 123 he was widely described as leader of an auden group that comprised his friends stephen spender cecil day lewis and louis macneice four were mocked by poet roy campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named haffenden p 34 auden s propagandistic poetic plays including dog beneath skin and ascent of f6 and his political poems such as spain gave him reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice in contrast to eliot but this political stance provoked opposing opinions such as that of austin clarke who called auden s work liberal democratic and humane haffenden p 29 and john drummond who wrote that auden misused a characteristic and popularizing trick generalized image to present ostensibly left wing views that were in fact confined to bourgeois experience haffenden p 31 auden s departure for america in 1939 was debated in britain once even in parliament with some seeing his emigration as a betrayal defenders of auden such as geoffrey grigson in an introduction to a 1949 anthology of modern poetry wrote that auden arches over all his stature was suggested by book titles such as auden and after by francis scarfe 1942 and auden generation by samuel hynes 1977 thumb right commemorative plaque at one of auden s homes in brooklyn heights new york in us starting in late 1930s detached ironic tone of auden s regular stanzas became influential john ashbery recalled that in 1940s auden was modern poet auden s formal influences were so pervasive in american poetry that ecstatic style of beat generation was partly a reaction against his influence from 1940s through 1960s many critics lamented that auden s work had declined from its earlier promise randall jarrell wrote a series of essays making a case against auden s later work and philip larkin s what s become of wystan 1960 had a wide impact haffenden pp 414 19 after his death some of his poems notably funeral blues musee des beaux arts refugee blues unknown citizen and september 1 1939 became known to a much wider public than during his lifetime through films broadcasts and popular media first full length study of auden was

account of auden s revisions of his earlier work first systematic critical account was monroe k spears poetry of w h auden disenchanted island 1963 written out of conviction that auden s poetry can

elder statesman and a memorial stone for him was placed in poets corner in westminster abbey in 1974 encyclopaedia britannica writes that by time of eliot s death in 1965 a convincing case could be made for assertion that auden was indeed eliot s successor as eliot had inherited sole claim to supremacy when yeats died in 1939 with some exceptions british critics tended to treat his early work as his best while american critics tended to favour his middle and later work haffenden p 54 aidan auden and american literary world in sharpe w h auden in context pp 118 37 another group of critics and poets has maintained that unlike other modern poets auden s reputation did not decline after his death and influence of his later writing was especially strong on younger american poets including john ashbery james merrill anthony hecht and maxine typical later evaluations describe him as arguably 20th century s greatest poet peter parker and frank kermode who now clearly seems greatest poet in
