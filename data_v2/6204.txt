reluctance to fight and an aversion to killing in spirit world winter solstice part 1 aang encounters an angry spirit destroying a village and kidnapping villagers but instead of fighting spirit aang negotiates he is also depicted showing ethical reluctance in killing ozai and eventually strips ozai of his bending instead of murdering him bending elements as avatar aang is capable of bending all four elements air water earth and fire series creators consulted a professional martial artist in design of show s fighting style each of these styles philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific bending arts creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of world everything in avatar s world whether it be clothing culture or infrastructure is influenced by bending city of omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies water tribes were a naval superpower their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation fire nation were first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master metallurgy with their bending or fire and lightning at start of series aang is initially only proficient in air having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child through teaching katara and zuko he gradually learns waterbending and firebending but struggles with toph s teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom aang utilizes all elements equally but heavily favor s airbending for crowd control and non lethal purposes in accordance with his pacifism principles airbending martial art aang primarily uses in entire franchise is a southern temple style based on an internal chinese martial art called baguazhang aang is only person in living memory to have mastered this form of airbending and would later pass down this knowledge to his son tenzin who with aid of korra would prove instrumental in reconstruction and preservation of air nomad oral and intangible cultural heritage due to genocide of his people all other styles of airbending arts have been forever lost to history this fighting style focuses on circular movements and does not have many finishing moves traits meant to represent unpredictability of air and peaceful character of airbenders airbending represents element of freedom ehasz aaron writer spaulding ethan director june 2 2006 bitter work avatar last airbender season 2 episode 9 nickelodeon and is categorized as most elusive of four bending arts airbending involves smooth coiling and uncoiling actions dynamic footwork throws and open handed techniques and swift evasive maneuvers designed to evoke intangibility and explosive power of wind these techniques are intended to increase difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury a pacifist philosophy that is prevalent among air nomad people airbending lacks finishing moves or effective methods for permanently disabling foes a weakness frequently exploited by opponents waterbending martial art katara teaches aang in series is based on chinese martial arts techniques of internal style t ai chi ch uan and jeet kune do when aang traveled north he learned northern tribe yin style during legend of korra katara is only master of

pliable of four bending arts waterbending emphasizes softness and breathing over hard aggression fluid and graceful acting in concert with environment creating opportunities where none exist this flow of energy allows their defensive maneuvers to translate into focus on control and counter offenses turning their opponents momentum against them despite these advantages waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation earthbending martial art toph teaches aang in series is based on

opportunity to counterattack reveals itself emphasizes heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke mass and power of earth and demands precise stepping footwork to maintain constant contact with ground earthbending parallels five animals movements such as tiger s hard blows and crane s affinity to landing gracefully earthbending is at its strongest when feet or hand are in direct contact with ground enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves this reliance on direct contact with earth is a literal achilles heel separating earthbenders from any contact with earth renders them ineffective firebending martial art zuko teaches aang in series is based on chinese martial arts techniques of long xing mo qiao and xing yi quan

and spirit world plane of existence where universe s disembodied spirits dwell his spirituality training progressed swiftly granting visions and access to various memories from his past lives his most powerful ability is avatar state which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors in addition he also receives a massive boost in raw power enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on form is activated by aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger while speaking in avatar state aang s voice becomes in sync with that of raava s as a testament to their connection his weaknesses in state is that he is vulnerable and if killed then this would cause avatar to cease being reincarnated critical reception aang was received exceptionally by critics and fans kendall lyons stated aang seems to be lighthearted kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with and that he seems to bring comfort in most dangerous or hostile situations there are many similar descriptions about aang as a
