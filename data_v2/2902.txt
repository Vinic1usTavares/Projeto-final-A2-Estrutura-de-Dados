history of harvard extension school dates back to its founding in 1910 by abbott lawrence lowell from beginning harvard extension school was designed to serve educational interests and needs of greater boston community but has since extended its academic resources to public locally nationally and internationally growing out of lowell institute it first became commission on university extension in cooperation with other boston area universities and then eventually became a harvard only institution early students were able to earn an associate in arts degree which was equivalent of a bachelor s degree but which did have a residency requirement that was later renamed an adjunct in arts before finally settling on a bachelor s degree first graduate degree was awarded in 1980 harvard extension school has been a leader in distance education offering courses on radio and television and even on board navy ships online education began in mid 1980s and in 2012 school partnered with edx to expand its reach after 100 years an estimated 500 000 students have taken courses at extension school lowell institute john lowell jr a wealthy boston businessman became gravely ill during a camel trip across egyptian desert and wrote his will on banks of nile river in cairo he died on march 4 1836 shortly after arriving in bombay india and his will was executed back in boston in it he set aside half his fortune to be used for maintenance and support of public lectures to be delivered in said boston upon philosophy natural history and arts and sciences for promotion of moral and intellectual and physical instruction or education of citizens of said city of boston lowell also directed that lectures be given on natural religion showing its conformity to that of our savior on historical and internal evidences in favor of christianity and avoiding all disputed points of faith and ceremony by directing lecturers to moral doctrines of gospel lectures were supposed to be free for those of limited means and for those who could afford to attend more abstruse or erudite lectures maximum charge was to be no more than value of two bushels of wheat in an equally egalitarian measure lectures were specifically open to women as well as to men some of most notable intellectual figures of america and europe lectured as part of program when lowell institute foundation formed to sponsor lectures opened in 1839 initial value of fund was 250 000 or 5 309 180 in 2012 dollars annual interest on corpus of 18 000 or 382 260 96 in 2012 dollars by 1897 fund had more than 1 million in it with an annual income of more than 50 000 institute was to be headed by a single trustee and one preferably a male descendant of lowell s grandfather first trustee john amory lowell administered trust for more than forty years according to terms of will each year 10 of earnings must be turned into non expendable capital early years establishment of university extension a lawrence lowell thumb lack of an endowment was one reason why harvard president charles william eliot declined to begin a continuing education program in 1902 i would strongly disapprove of starting proposed institute without an endowment eliot said it should not be dependent on other institutions at a meeting of boston city club in 1909 a lawrence lowell said that john lowell jr had wanted to found a popular university and that in order to fulfill that vision it had to be connected to an already existing educational institution when a lawrence lowell succeeded his father as trustee of lowell institute in 1900 he was already a trustee at both harvard and mit he reorganized lectures first as school for industrial foremen at mit and then later renamed it lowell institute school under auspices of mit first year of school had courses in higher branches of mathematics and second year was devoted to theory and practice between 30 and 50 men graduated from program each year in 1907 lowell institute school began offering courses at harvard and a course on literature had to turn people away because largest hall harvard had could only seat 300 persons most classes taught by best harvard professors had roughly 20 students and at end of course same examination is taken that harvard college students would take two years later in 1909 a lawrence lowell was elected president of harvard as president a lawrence lowell wanted to serve many people in our community who have not been to college but who have desire and aptitude to profit by so much of a college education as amid work of earning their living they are able to obtain james hardy ropes extension s first dean said that our aim will be to give young people of boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at harvard he added that many persons who wish that they had a college education will be able to get gradually an effective substitute for it in some respects more effective than ordinary college education because of greater eagerness and maturity of such students students under 20 were not permitted unless they had been graduated from high school but adults were not required to have a high school diploma in spring of 1910 a few months before first students would enroll a lawrence lowell wrote to boston school department asking which courses university extension could offer that school department would accept as qualifications for a teaching position at boston latin or one of other high schools in city in september of that year school committee voted to accept extension s associate of arts degree as sufficient to teach in a high school it was noted that elementary school teachers could take courses in evenings and qualify for a better paying high school teaching position same was true for other young workers as well ropes said when university extension was announced it garnered major media coverage in boston boston globe declared extension program to be one of hopeful signs of times this democratization of education congratulating extension for fine opportunities offered to those who hunger and thirst after knowledge early courses and professors thumb extension professor john kenneth galbraith classes which were identical with regular classes offered by harvard professors began at end of september 1910 it offered according to boston globe an opportunity for an education such has never been obtainable hitherto unlike a similar program at columbia university university extension courses were taught by most experienced teachers that can be secured in 1938 there were 28 professors for commission faculties including 11 full professors early faculty included charles townsend copeland theodore spenser b j whiting william elliot payton s wild jr william l langer oscar kenneth b murdoch perry miller william hocking raphael demos john kenneth galbraith frank m carpenter in 1953 there were still 28 professors and each was paid an extra stipend to teach classes in addition to their regular course load early courses included classes on english literature principles of economics psychology and applied and experimental electricity with laboratory experiments it total there were 19 courses offered during evenings late afternoons and saturdays a lawrence lowell believed that it was more important to have high quality courses than to offer a larger number of courses and that there should be a good deal of variety from year to year in early years business courses were also offered in conjunction with chamber of commerce but these were not designed to be part of a degree program they were all of same grade as college courses involving much same work tested by examinations and would demand same amount of work required of a regular college student a lawrence lowell said that there is no use in a university s trying to run a kindergarten for public teachers are not fitted for such work their object should be to give public advantage of those riches which exist within their own walls boston globe opined that early program of courses was a comprehensive course of study which should attract young men and women of metropolitan boston who deprived though various circumstances of opportunity to go to college first year of courses saw 863 students enroll with 395 of them earning certificates a lawrence lowell as both president of harvard and trustee of lowell institute saw university extension as a trust for community for public and we are nothing but a successive series of servants to public ropes goal was to supply a thorough university training to those who have previously been denied one and supply it at a very low figure while provid ing technical or culture instruction for persons who are unable to spend four years in college courses in 1920 cost 5 for a one hour course 10 for a two hour course and 15 for a three hour course prices were designed to be low enough that it would not be considered an impediment to anyone who really wanted such instruction and all courses were offered after working hours beginning in 1919 students were required to be present for 75 of classes to earn credit despite falling revenue due to great depression a lawrence lowell insisted in 1931 that will of john lowell jr prevented courses from costing more than two bushels of wheat as a result a half year course cost could no more than 5 and a full course no more than 10 some courses cost as little as 2 50 however increases in salaries required additional funding to avoid an increase in tuition and cut in lowell institute funding that would follow an exam fee of 5 was added for those who wished to earn a certificate these prices remained in effect at least into 1950s when national university extension association was created in 1915 harvard was a charter member several years later when arthur f whittem took over as dean of university extension it comprised summer school of arts and sciences and of education commission on extension courses and special students office several years after retiring president lowell wrote that extension courses have given a service to public which seems to me of utmost importance commission on university extension popularity of courses convinced a lawrence lowell that they should be taken in a more systematic approach he thus organized a commission on university extension with representatives from harvard boston university boston college mit simmons college tufts university wellesley college and school of museum of fine arts members of commission were required to be president of university or an executive there commission also received financial support from boston chamber of commerce and it was at a meeting of education committee of chamber that commission s creation was announced courses taken at boston normal school also once counted for credit while commission was formed in 1910 it had already lost some of its vitality by time dean ropes retired as chairman in 1922 and when a lawrence lowell stepped down as president of harvard in 1933 commission had lost most of its viability as a consortium though it still existed in name from that time forward it functioned mainly as an umbrella for a program that was run by university extension at harvard in 1975 commission finally stopped functioning and university extension began as a self sufficient program lowell institute continued to give a contribution though instead of paying for operating costs it was used to fund scholarships for local high school students and faculty to take courses growth of extension lehman hall thumb from beginning of commission harvard tufts and wellesley all awarded an associate in arts degree which was designed to be equivalent to a bachelor s degree but did not require an entrance exam or residency at any of various colleges it was designed to be an appropriate reward really within reach of persons unable to attend a traditional college program in 1912 two years after extension program began nine students were pursuing a degree through it two students john coulson and ellen m earned degree in first year it was offered 1913 according to ropes there is then in operation in boston a kind of extension college giving courses which lead to an adequately guarded degree and administered by joint action of neighboring colleges during 1920s professors from boston and harvard universities left confines of their campuses and traveled to teach courses offsite while they were primarily aimed at teachers courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest professors traveled on a weekly basis to places around new england and as far away as yonkers new york in 1933 connecticut legislature considered and passed a bill allowing junior colleges to award associate degrees for two years study in 23 years that university extension had been in existence 120 people had already earned an associate degree from harvard for four years worth of work a lawrence lowell upon hearing this news was uncharacteristically impassioned and asked dean whitten what is proper word for a person from whom his good name has been for thou art that man read enclosed and you will see that name of associate in arts has been degraded probably beyond recovery by wicked thievish and otherwise disreputable institutions so as to differentiate itself from lesser degrees being offered elsewhere president lowell decided to invent a new degree which may retain its dignity until somebody by imitation steals it on may 8 1933 a new degree of adjunct in arts was created and women were allowed to receive it at harvard not just at radcliff college depression affected both enrollment figures of university extension and finances of lowell institute which necessitated cuts in number of courses offered during post war era however number of courses offered and enrollments were on rise including 12 consecutive years between 1951 and 1963 in 1936 a survey found that 56 of students that year had never attended college before a similar study in 1952 found that more than half had a profession notably teaching more than half had at least two years of college and 75 enrolled out of general interest in 1938 another survey found that 64 of all extension graduates went on to do graduate work a figure much higher than number of graduates from college a total of 60 graduate degrees were awarded to alumni as were six ph d s in 1958 courses cost about 200 each and in 1963 students could earn a harvard degree for roughly 1 000 this was according to dean reginald h phelps a bargain that simply can not be matched anywhere in field of education adding to value study spaces conferences rooms library facilities and a dining hall were set up in lehman hall for students in 1964 in addition there was a television lounge were students could watch wgbh programs television and radio harvard extension was a pioneer in distance education beginning on december 5 1949 courses were offered on lowell institute s new radio station new englanders could go to college six nights a week at 7 30 in their living rooms simply by tuning into courses on psychology world history and economics first course on radio was by peter a bertocci of boston university for 30 years he taught extension courses with never fewer than 100 students he often over 300 students per course and once had over 400 over years bertocci had at least 7 000 extension students surely a record in annals of extension at harvard radio courses proved to be so successful that when television station wgbh went on air in october 1951 they began broadcasting an extension class every weekday at 3 30 and 7 30 first course offered by robert g albion was on european imperialism on monday and thursday evenings in late 1960s three of televised courses were offered in deer island prison students who watched courses on television could attend six conferences and take a mid term and a final exam at harvard in order to gain credit for class television classes continued at least through 1970s united states navy uss little rock thumb in 1960 united states navy approached harvard about adapting television courses that had been broadcast on wgbh for use on polaris submarines a two year program known as polaris university extension program was developed with wgbh producing five to six courses a year in engineering math physics foreign languages and electives lab courses and in class instruction were provided to submariners when subs were in port those who finished course received a certificate of completion eventually program spread to surface ships as well being rechristened as program for afloat college education pace and it proved to be an effective and practical means of education for hundreds of navy men by 1963 64 there were 17 courses with plans to have 32 within a few years and 90 sailors enrolled just a year later in 1964 65 there was 440 sailors taking courses and in 66 67 there were 803 sailors enrolled by time it ended in 1972 73 there were 5 903 registrations by navy men in 40 classes navy had anticipated huge enrollments but vietnam war made it difficult for men to find time to study additionally courses offered were weighted towards sciences while classes in humanities proved much more popular occasionally instruction was provided while ships were at sea during 1967 spring crisis in middle east navy paid for five instructors to go to mediterranean to teach on deck of in february 1968 five instructors were flown by navy to antarctica to teach at mcmurdo base late 20th century thumb sever hall by 50th anniversary of university extension in 1960 more than 1 400 courses had been offered and there had been more than 85 000 enrollments while vast majority of classes were held on harvard campus a few in late 1960s were offered at mit and bu as well as at old south meeting house at this time non credit courses cost between 15 and 25 and courses for credit cost between 20 and 35 in 1970s university realized it had a problem retaining employees so it began tuition assistance plan tap in first year 238 employees took advantage by 1982 it was 834 students with 37 degree candidates program effectively solved retention problem in 1978 a survey found that majority of students had a family income of less than 15 000 which was less than national average of 16 000 on occasion of 50th anniversary of his 1930 graduation from harvard college phelps said of all his administrative duties at harvard he found extension most rewarding partly this was no doubt because i could run a rising program with practically no interference partly it was feeling that a second chance in education for people passed by in normal run of school and college is one of finest aspects of american education and partly it was chance to establish and maintain friendly relations thorough our programs with black people in boston who would otherwise have not have had any contact with harvard graduates in 1982 went on to harvard law harvard business school harvard graduate school of education kennedy school of government and top others in 1983 84 library moved to sever hall and saw a doubling of usage to nearly 30 000 student visits with 13 000 reserve books being circulated since mid 1990s academic and career services have been provided that most traditional students receive ensuring education is commensurate division of continuing education was created in 1985 same year that extension school was officially established as a formal school in 1992 indian computer academy opened in bangalore india a joint venture between extension school and an indian businessman with offices in bombay india and dedham massachusetts program at academy was designed to consist of one year of full time study leading to certificate in applied sciences from beginning principals in india were treating it like a for profit venture and financially it was a failure harvard pulled out in 1994 but not before approximately 150 students were educated in two years of operation roy j glauber a future nobel prize winner began teaching core curriculum physics course to extension students in 1985 course was designed for advanced high school students and their teachers over 150 students and teachers from 42 schools in greater boston area took part first year and thousands more took part in years to come early 21st century after 100 years an estimated 500 000 students have taken courses at extension school a proposal before faculty of arts and science in 2009 and 2010 to rename school and degrees offered was not accepted a committee led by professor of computer science harry r lewis proposed renaming school harvard school of continuing and professional studies and to drop words in extension studies from degrees so that school would offer bachelor of arts and master of arts degrees some faculty objected saying that those degrees were already offered by college and graduate school of arts and sciences during six years huntington d lambert was dean number of students grew to more than 30 000 his first year in office there were 645 graduates his last year in office 2019 there were more than 1 200 graduates graduating class of 2019 largest class to date had 1184 students receiving degrees students had an average age of 37 and were nearly equally split between genders with 54 being male graduating class had students from 49 different countries degree development thumb harvard class of 2015 graduates in harvard yard there were 452 degree recipients in 58 years between 1910 and 1968 and 481 in 39 between 1969 and 2008 including certificates there have been 12 464 graduates in extension s history in 2013 there were 163 undergraduate degree earners largest class to date bringing total to 5 415 graduates as of 2009 five most popular graduate programs are in government biology psychology history and english accounting for 75 of graduates by 1953 undergraduate degree holders went on to earn 16 master of arts degrees 11 masters of education one bachelor of sacred theology and five doctors of philosophy since founding there have been 250 students who earned an undergraduate degree at extension school and then an advanced degree at harvard including 30 doctorates approximately 10 of alm graduates have gone on to doctorates including 16 at harvard there have been 328 aa and ab degrees awarded to employees since tap was started in 1978 105 alms and 166 certificates given success students had as early as 1953 in continuing their education after earning a degree from extension school phelps said it would seem therefore that extension courses and degree for which they count are each year fulfilling educational purpose for which they were originally established while there has never been an entrance exam and fees were kept as low as possible to allow as many as possible to enroll only 18 have ever earned a degree including certificate earners 2 5 have graduated today more degrees are awarded each year than were awarded in first 50 years combined undergraduate from 1913 to 1933 students had to take 17 courses in order to earn an associate s equivalent of a bachelor s degree university extension had been awarding adjunct in arts degrees since 1933 but in 1960 a new bachelor of arts in extension studies was created to replace it to earn one required meeting same standards as were required for a bachelor of arts degree from harvard college but it was designed for specifically for adult learners in 1971 an associate degree was established and following year bachelor s degrees were awarded with honors in 1963 first bachelor s degrees were first awarded to 14 people students largest class yet and total number of graduates rose to 299 this number would grow to 1 000 in 1976 and in 1982 graduating class rose to more than 100 students for first time throughout 1950s and 1960s university extension was strictly a liberal arts program with no intention of offering professional programs in 1971 however it was recognized that our charter is too narrow our staff too small for what world needed in that day and age and a committee was appointed by president derek bok to review structure and purpose of extension to meet needs of community university extension was stretched from a traditional liberal arts program to a community vocational arm of university with programs specifically designed for residents of cambridge and roxbury as well as an urban studies program and a teacher training program upon his retirement in 1975 phelps remarked that with community needs in mind extension has moved a long way from traditional path but that we need to reach far more of poor than we do graduate in 1980 first master s degree alm was awarded next year restrictions were lifted on degree and 741 students enrolled in program demands of labor market meant new initiatives in professional studies had to grow along with traditional liberal arts programs a graduate certificate of advanced study was established in 1977 for a full year of study in humanities social sciences or natural sciences due to success of alm however this certificate was phased out after 1985 certificate s success prompted creation of a certificate of special studies in administration and management in 1980 for students with a bachelor s degree but no prior training in business or management in 2007 it became an alm in management which soon became most popular program at extension school to meet growing need for biotech industry staff in boston area a certificate of advanced studies in applied sciences was established in 1982 in 1986 a certificate of public health was launched and first award to a greek pharmacist in 1987 this was followed in 1989 by a certificate in museum studies in time museum

in 1996 in 2001 02 a pilot program was created to address shortage of qualified math teachers in boston public schools one in five middle and high school math teachers for a total of 86 boston teachers took 117 classes this led to creation of an alm in mathematics for teaching 2004 a certificate in technologies of education was created in 2000 01 which grew to become an alm in educational technologies in 2005 06 also beginning in 2004 alms could be earned in biotechnology or environmental management following year alm in journalism first journalism degree offered at harvard was established in 2018 an alm in field of data science was added to expand existing certificate program pre medical program a pre med program was established at extension school in 1980 two years later in 1982 five students applied to medical school and 3 were accepted at university of massachusetts tufts university and new york university of 19 students who applied to medical schools in 1985 15 were admitted including two women to harvard medical school all 27 graduates who applied to medical school in 1989 were accepted including three to harvard medical school and nine to university of massachusetts five years later 90 of students were accepted to medical school including 5 to harvard only one in three were accepted nationwide health careers program has sponsored nearly 1 000 students for admission to medical school since it was started in 1979 80 and more than 845 were accepted this 85 success rate far exceeds national acceptance rate of 35 online education thumb some extension courses became available as podcasts downloadable on itunes in 2005 extension school developed its online project in 1980s in 1984 a calculus course was offered via voice data modem kicking off its online education effort in 1988 a joint venture was developed with beijing normal university on a five week course on artificial intelligence it was taught in harvard square at nights and chinese students simultaneously took class in what was morning for them after extension school became a self sufficient program and commission disbanded lowell institute funding was no longer used for direct operating costs and was instead turned into a scholarship fund for local high school students and teachers in 1997 98 nearly 100 students most of them high school students in far flung places such as alaska or hawaii were taking one of six different calculus courses online their schools did not offer course and lowell scholarships allowed them to take it at a greatly reduced rate beginning in 1997 courses were also being videotaped and then put online within 36 hours for distance students to view by 2000 online courses had evolved from an experiment to an established academic program and in 2001 there were 25 online courses with 2 200 student enrollments in 2003 program had expanded to 36 online courses including six from harvard college and in by 2004 there were 43 including a
