by making games that inspire emotional responses in player that other games are lacking although he and thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games he does not plan on commercially

parents were a middle class family and his father worked in software development industry having previously worked on one of earliest giant computers in china although chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child his father influenced him towards computers entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old he found himself interested in video games that he saw there but was not as enthusiastic about programming while a teenager he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played including legend of sword and fairy which he ascribes to fact that he was not as exposed to books films or life events that other people would have had those experiences with these experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult when more emotional maturity had caused his standards to rise in what would move him in a game it was during high school that he chose english name jenova after a character in final fantasy vii wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were thousands of jason he earned a degree in computer science engineering in shanghai jiao tong university which due to his background in computers he found quite easy but describes himself as spending much of his time there teaching himself digital art and animation and later did a minor in digital art and design at donghua university still interested in video games he was involved in making three video games as part of a student group while in school upon graduating he had trouble finding a job in chinese video game industry that combined his interests of engineering art and design and additionally felt that very few games had actually achieved those qualities that would be interesting to an adult he also considered working in digital animation for films he then went to united states to earn a master s degree in school of cinematic arts at university of southern california chen studied in interactive media program a new division of school of cinematic arts his intention at time was to use degree to get kind of job he wanted back in china at usc he became inspired when he went to game developers conference where he positively compared games he had made in college with student work present at independent games festival portion of conference while at usc he met kellee santiago another student in same program and two decided to work together on games that would be outside of mainstream their first game which won a grant of twenty thousand dollars from usc to produce was cloud released in 2005 which focuses on a young hospital patient who soars in his mind despite being trapped indoors idea was partially based on himself as when he was a child he was often hospitalized for asthma it was designed as an attempt to expand spectrum of emotions video games evoke at a student showcase at game developers conference chen and santiago showed game to a representative from sony john hight saying that it was first game in zen genre hight was interested though no deal was forthcoming game won best student philosophy award at slamdance guerilla games competition and a student showcase award at independent games festival and was showcased on spike tv g4tv and cbs sunday chen felt that reason that cloud had been so warmly received was because emotions it sparked in players were different than any other game available at time and believed that it was his calling to make more games that changed what people saw video games as chen went on to do his master s thesis following year in concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment where game adjusts how it reacts to player based on past and present actions of that player chen illustrated his ideas with flow a flash game made with nicholas clark game involves player guiding an aquatic microorganism through various depths of ocean consuming other organisms and evolving in process it was released in march 2006 it received 100 000 downloads in its first two weeks and by july had been downloaded over 650 000 times a playstation 3 version was announced in may 2006 as a downloadable game via playstation store and was released in february 2007 a version for playstation portable developed by supervillain studios was released in march 2008 flow became most downloaded game on playstation network in 2007 and won best downloadable game at game developers choice awards after graduating chen and santiago formed their own game company thatgamecompany in los angeles where he still lives and signed a deal with sony for three playstation store games ps3 version of flow was first and while it was in development chen worked for maxis on game spore upon flows release chen returned to thatgamecompany and began working on their second game thatgamecompany next game flower was chen and thatgamecompany s first game outside safety net of academia chen was creative director in charge of game while santiago was producer and clark was lead designer company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of game s development flower was intended by chen to provoke positive emotions in player and to act as an emotional shelter chen described game as an interactive poem exploring tension between urban and nature he decided on a nature theme early in development process saying that he had this concept that every playstation is like a portal in your living room it leads you to somewhere else i thought wouldn t it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature chen designed game around idea that primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was feelings that they evoked in audience and that emotional range of most games was very limited to make flower have emotional spectrum that he wanted chen looked at development process as creating a work of art rather than a fun game which would not provoke desired emotions in 2008 during flower s development chen was named to mit technology review as one of top 35 innovators in world under age of 35 after flower was released to critical praise and awards chen and thatgamecompany moved on to their next game journey journey was intended by chen to focus on element of communication and social interaction in video games since in most games communication between players is focused on specific goals in journey chen intended for player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players but not be able to communicate with them directly instead players have to build relationships with each other through their actions helping each other or leaving as they choose journey was released on playstation network on march 13 2012 and has received critical acclaim influences and philosophy chen plays a wide variety of video games but he names his greatest influences as katamari damacy ico and shadow of colossus he also names final fantasy vii as an influence and game that he took his adopted name from he personally plays games competitively including titles such as street fighter iv and starcraft he feels he has a competitive nature which he has turned towards winning at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in market rather than towards creating competitive games as he was raised in china and works in america chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer as such instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture when chen quit maxis to re join thatgamecompany he did so knowing that it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career he felt though that it was important to industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in player than just excitement or fear while chen is not opposed to making action games and his company has made internal exciting games that were well received at sony he feels that there is no point to thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers as they would not be making anything new that justified cost of remaining an independent studio similarly chen does not intend for thatgamecompany to make big budget blockbuster games as pressure on profits that entails would stifle innovation that he wants thatgamecompany to focus on chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games similar to how film has thriller romance and comedy genres based on emotions they provoke he feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in same way they do children intellectually whereby work reveals a new perspective about world that you have not seen before by emotionally touching someone and by creating a social environment where intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people references external links chen s website chen s thesis thatgamecompany s website category chinese video game designers category american video
