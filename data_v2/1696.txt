believe himself to be fabricated harrison star trek khan issue 4 idw publishing published january 2014 development initial development writer carey wilber pitched space seed to star trek producers roddenberry gene coon and robert justman with an 18 page outline dated august 29 1966 in outline wilber envisioned crew of botany bay as criminals sent on a 1 500 year journey to make room on earth for others khan was represented as a nordic criminal with a magnificent body harald ericsson producers suggested changes to outline in a series of memos in memos dated september 7 and 9 coon suggested significant changes to ericsson i want to rather do more with him than you have indicated in story outline he wrote believing that ericsson misspelled as erickson in memo could be a worthy adversary for kirk coon suggested that character be in fact very similar to james kirk our captain except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture in other words carey build us a giant of a man first draft of script introduced character as john ericssen who is revealed to be a man involved in first world tyranny named ragnar thorwald character of thorwald was more brutal than khan in final version killing guards using a phaser in original script kirk forgives ericssen and offers him and his people a chance at a fresh start something that remained in final episode but character committing murder would have precluded such an ending as nbc censors would have necessitated bad guy be punished for his actions by final draft khan is indian a character guesses that khan is from northern india and probably a sikh marla mcgivers from northern india area i d guess probably a sikh they were most fantastic warriors khan s full name was based on that of kim noonien singh a pilot gene roddenberry served with during second world war roddenberry lost touch with his friend and had hoped that khan s similar name might attract his attention and renew his old acquaintance in space seed khan is presented as having several positive characteristics he is gracious smiling fearless and generous he is not threatened by success of others and encourages their self esteem he is also ambitious desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of rights of others author paul cantor asserts that khan is a mirror image of kirk sharing his aggressiveness ambition and even his womanizing tendencies but possessing them in far greater degree during episode several of characters express their admiration for man even as they oppose him with kirk referring to him as best of tyrants and most dangerous character s spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most star trek characters wrath of khan thumb right 300px alt a film still showing montalban as khan on bridge of a spacecraft wearing a torn golden shirt his exposed chest bears a large scar and his hair is long and grey in background his followers wear similar clothes khan ricardo montalban and his followers in star trek ii wrath of khan after disappointing response to first star trek feature film motion picture paramount executives appointed harve bennett a television producer who had never watched star trek to be executive producer for sequel bennett watched all original series episodes and chose khan from space seed as a possible villain for film early drafts of script had khan as a shadowy tyrant leading a planet in revolt later drafts added genesis device which khan would steal costume designer robert fletcher wanted to emphasize effects of their harsh environment on khan and his followers my intention with khan was to express fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure so they had to cannibalize from spaceship whatever they used or wore therefore i tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed ship he said director nicholas meyer told montalban to keep khan s right glove on at all times in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to character meyer has been repeatedly asked if montalban wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front meyer replied in audio commentary for film that montalban who was 61 during filming is one strong cookie and that no prosthetics were applied to actor s sizeable frame at no point during wrath of khan are khan and kirk in same location they speak to each other only over communication links such as view screens this was due in part to fact that set of reliant was a redress of enterprise bridge and two actors scenes were filmed four months apart montalban recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to william shatner montalban said in promotional interviews for film he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous villain may do villainous things but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons montalban further stated he always tried to find a flaw in character as no one is completely good or completely evil while khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of death of his wife khan quotes character of ahab from moby dick throughout film driving home his lust to make kirk pay for wrongs he has inflicted upon him star trek into darkness thumb right benedict cumberbatch plays khan in star trek into darkness following box office success of j j abrams star trek reboot and announcement that actors chris pine and zachary quinto had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels internet rumors began circulating about plot of second film abrams hinted that because of alternate timeline created in first film reintroducing khan into star trek lore remained a possibility abrams told mtv khan and kirk exist and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with i would argue that a person s character is what it is abrams said of notion that his khan could be just as evil even if kirk never stranded him on ceti alpha v certain people are destined to cross paths and come together and khan is out there even if he doesn t have same issues writer damon lindelof declared that khan s intense gravity particularly regarding character s delivery of monologues made him an obligatory character to use even if its iconic status made crew afraid of fan reaction lindelof jokingly stated that it was never really a should we or shouldn t we as much as it was we really have to do this but if we don t get it right people are going to kill us as part of secrecy campaign benedict cumberbatch denied that he was playing khan during interviews describing harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes as well as someone that s activated and manufactured in a way by starfleet and it s a scene that has come back to haunt him he discussed character s moral ambiguity saying it fit adage one man s terrorist is another man s freedom fighter adding parallels to current world order whether it s u s foreign policy or actions of some terrorists into darkness writers roberto orci and alex kurtzman added that they used character of khan not just for his popularity with fandom it s so easy to fall into trap of doing something because you think people are going to love it you must come up with what movie can be on its own and then if it turns out villain maybe can be khan then you can do it but you can t start there but for fitting sequel s theme of how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us some protested cumberbatch s casting as khan believing that a person of indian descent should have been given role instead analysis superficially khan has been compared to friedrich nietzsche s concept of ubermensch superman or overman khan is mentally and physically superior to any normal human in star trek enterprise episode borderland malik leader of a group of supermen created from same genetic engineering project as khan quotes nietzsche telling archer that mankind is something to be surpassed professor william j devlin and coauthor shai biderman examined khan s character compared to ubermensch and found that khan s blind pursuit of revenge is against nietzsche s ideals of transcendence and self creation of a meaningful life instead authors offer spock s self sacrifice in wrath of khan as a better example of ubermensch reception and legacy montalban s performance as khan was favorably received by critics discussing star trek motion pictures associated press noted that star trek films were measured by how menacing their foe was and that khan was among best in series a 2002 review of star trek films ranked khan as greatest enemy seen in any of films reviewers of wrath of khan such as roger ebert rated khan as one of strongest aspects of film new yorker critic pauline kael said montalban s performance was only validation he has ever had of his power to command big screen critic christopher null notes that it is nearly gospel now among trekkies that star trek ii wrath of khan is undisputed best of series and will likely never meet its equal and calls khan greatest role of montalban s career though he felt that villain of star trek motion picture v ger was more cerebral and interesting author james notes that most fans and moviegoers preferred archetypical good versus evil fight that struggle between khan and kirk represents villains in subsequent star trek films have been measured by standard of khan with paramount promising fans that villain of star trek generations would be equal to genetic superman ign ranked khan as best star trek villain noting that he set pattern for revenge seeking villains in series in decades since film s release even those with a passing interest in trek know name star trek producer rick berman called villain threatening and memorable khan is also recognized as a great villain outside of star trek series associated press called character one of sci fi s great villains in 2002 online film critics society s 132 members voted khan as 10th greatest screen villain of all time only star trek character to appear in listing in 2006 emmy magazine voted khan tv s most out of this world character beating out other science fiction characters such as doctor and commander adama editors wrote that khan was so cool we would ve bought a chrysler cordoba if he d told us to referring to an ad campaign montalban appeared in for chrysler character also had a cultural impact outside of star trek fandom a clip from wrath of khan featuring kirk screaming was one popular culture appropriation that became a popular fad driving success of website in 2004 star trek franchise returned to khan s backstory in a three episode story arc on star trek enterprise in borderland cold station 12 and augments a 22nd century scientist is portrayed as having revived genetically engineered embryos from khan s time and raised them as

rolling stone magazine calling it a tour de force to be reckoned with and his character a villain for ages joe neumaier of new york s daily news wrote that cumberbatch delivered one of best blockbuster villains in recent memory jonathan romney of independent specifically noted cumberbatch s voice saying it was so resonant that it could have been synthesised from combined timbres of ian mckellen patrick stewart and alan rickman holding an elocution contest down a well new york times praised his screen presence saying he fuses byronic charisma with an impatient imperious intelligence that seems to raise ambient i q whenever he s on screen christian blauvelt from website hollywood com criticized casting of khan in star trek into darkness as being whitewashed into oblivion star trek voyager actor garrett wang tweeting casting of cumberbatch was a mistake on part of producers i am not being critical of actor or his talent just casting co producer and co screenwriter roberto orci addressed issue of casting saying basically as we went through casting process and we began honing in on themes of movie it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color particularly any one of middle eastern descent or anyone evoking that one of points of movie is that we must be careful about villain within us not some other race in 2016 screenrant rated khan as 6th
