rebellion broke out in bosnia on 27 july this included local uprisings in southwest bosnia which spread across ndh but kpj organisation was initially swept along rather than leading rebellion on 29 august drenovic distinguished himself by planning and leading capture of mrkonjic grad by rebels but when town was recaptured by ndh forces four days later kpj blamed him and his troops citing their poor discipline and anti muslim chauvinism in september four battalions of fighters were formed in ribnik and region one of these 3rd petar kocic battalion was commanded by drenovic who unlike other battalion commanders in region did not allow kpj to appoint political commissars to his companies in an area largely free of kpj activity but under sway of sectarian serb elite of mrkonjic grad drenovic arrested muslim communists in area even confronting senior members of partisan staff for bosanska krajina on 26 september 1941 at stolice in german occupied serbia partisan leadership decided to standardise its military organisation across occupied yugoslavia as result during october and november three detachments were formed in bosanska krajina from existing units such as 3rd petar kocic battalion and drenovic was appointed as deputy commander of 3rd krajina detachment responsible for territory of central bosnia this region had strong pro chetnik currents and of 34 companies in detachment only 13 had kpj organisations only 11 had commanders that were members of kpj and only 18 had a political commissar many kpj activists in region were muslims or croats not easily accepted by mass of rank and file who were serb chauvinist peasants drenovic himself was leading exponent of chetnik ideology in central bosnia he despised muslims and croats but according to historian marko attila hoare was diplomatic enough to keep his feelings in check when necessary in october staff of 3rd krajina detachment attempted to win over muslim village of by gaining agreement of headman to contribute five armed men to detachment when headman reneged on deal bulk of detachment attacked village but rest of detachment had to prevent drenovic s battalion from burning and looting it on 26 november 1941 at a meeting of staff of 3rd krajina detachment drenovic advocated collaboration with italian occupation forces on basis that italians were protecting serbs from ustase this was rejected by senior kpj members of staff but they were not in a position to force him to abandon idea at same meeting drenovic refused to commit 3rd petar kocic battalion to fight italians under pressure he agreed to advise neighbouring battalions if italians moved through his territory in return staff of 3rd krajina detachment agreed that drenovic could refer to his force as a military chetnik detachment on 10 december senior kpj members of 3rd krajina detachment concluded that 50 percent of their command staff did not support leading role of kpj in uprising partisan staff for bosanska krajina later observed that staff of 3rd krajina detachment had made no effort to remove chetnik elements from its ranks or stop their serb chauvinist agitation in early february 1942 drenovic took a leading role in a conference intended to bring 7th glamoc battalion which had declared itself as chetnik back into partisan structure drenovic argued for chetnik side and was expelled from meeting along with his supporters and battalion returned to fold on 6 february a meeting of leaders of 1st 2nd and 4th battalions of 3rd krajina detachment met and decided to bring drenovic back into partisan movement by organising an attack on italian and ustase garrison of mrkonjic grad under pressure from his own rank and file drenovic formally participated in attack but he was able to prevent its success through allowing italians to move past his battalion and attack partisan rear according to partisan sources he forewarned italians and ustase forces and divulged partisan plan to them alliance

response to highly effective pro chetnik agitation from within many partisan units defected to chetniks in second half of april 1942 partisans responded with aggressive military action against defectors unit that led this offensive was shock anti chetnik battalion formed earlier that month from wholly loyal and reliable troops this offensive spelt end of drenovic s petar kocic chetnik detachment and drenovic took refuge with ustase in mrkonjic grad on 27 april he and other defeated chetnik commanders signed an agreement with ndh agreement had eight points requiring that hostilities between ustase and drenovic s chetniks come to an end that ndh forces protect serb villages from partisans and that ustase units assist chetniks in fighting partisans agreement also required ustase to restore religious and civil rights to serbs of krajina in turn drenovic issued a declaration in which he recognised sovereignty of ndh historian enver argues that agreement was reached out of military and political necessity he writes ustase chetnik accords were driven neither by a confluence of serbian and croatian national interests nor by mutual desire for acceptance and respect but rather because each side needed to obstruct partisan advances ustase and chetniks two long time foes sought help from one another at a time when ustase were facing national political disgrace among croats and chetniks were losing support of serbs thumb right 220px drenovic s grave at church klisina in alt a grey polished stone grave with a stone walled church in background ndh authorities considered that alliance would mean that chetniks could continue to subvert partisan units on 30 april ndh authorities recognised rights of drenovic and his troops to remain armed in order to fight partisans agreement between ndh and drenovic s chetniks was soon made public by entire ustase press serb public opinion remained divided by may drenovic had a force of about 350 chetniks at mid month he signed an agreement with a croatian general staff officer in banja luka agreeing to cooperate with ndh in fighting partisans drenovic soon emerged as one of most important chetnik leaders in western bosnia that summer when order had been established in significant parts of italian occupation zone drenovic and other chetnik detachment leaders and their principal political spokesmen with italian second army headquarters were recognised by italians as auxiliaries and early in summer italian commander mario allowed for delivery of arms munitions and supplies to chetniks other chetnik leaders in bosnia who had concluded alliances with ndh by june 1942 included mane branko stevo and momcilo dujic political scientist sabrina p ramet observes that this co operation must be seen as a function of their mutual fear of partisans and emphasises uncertainty and distrust that accompanied it by june drenovic s chetniks numbered about 600 men in 1943 drenovic was awarded order of karadorde s star by king peter based on a recommendation by chetnik leader draza mihailovic following italian capitulation drenovic agreed to all actions of his chetniks being performed in close cooperation with local german units and was informed at end of year that ustase units would again be stationed in serb inhabited areas in october 1943 a team from 1st battalion of 4th brandenburg division under oberleutnant hermann kirchner began working alongside drenovic s chetniks in northwest bosnia operating forward reconnaissance groups and developing contact with anti communist farmers to keep an eye on partisan troop movements there were about 950 chetniks serving under drenovic that year positioned around manjaca and glamoc drenovic had about 400 chetniks under his command by following year his was only
