sakhalin koreans are russian citizens and residents of korean descent living on sakhalin island who trace their roots to immigrants from gyeongsang and jeolla provinces of korea during late 1930s and early 1940s latter half of japanese colonial era at time southern half of sakhalin island then known as karafuto prefecture was under control of empire of japan japanese government both recruited and forced korean labourers into service and shipped them to karafuto to fill labour shortages resulting from world war ii red army invaded karafuto days before japan s surrender while all but a few japanese there repatriated successfully almost one third of koreans could not secure permission to depart either to japan or their home towns in south korea for next forty years they lived in exile in 1985 japanese government offered transit rights and funding for repatriation of original group of sakhalin koreans however only 1 500 of them returned to south korea in next two decades vast majority of koreans of all generations chose instead to stay on sakhalin due to differing language and immigration history sakhalin koreans may or may not identify themselves as koryo saram term koryo saram may be used to encompass to all koreans in former ussr but typically refers to ethnic koreans from hamgyong province whose ancestors emigrated to russian far east in 19th century and then were later deported to central asia issue of self identification is complicated by fact that many sakhalin koreans feel that koreans from central asia look down on them history under japanese colonialism origins frame right approximate locations of near kamishisuka shang fu xiang 2 maoka near mizuho village rui sui cun korean immigration to sakhalin began as early as 1910s when mitsui group began recruiting labourers from peninsula for their mining operations in 1920 ten years after annexation of korea by japan there were fewer than one thousand koreans in whole of karafuto prefecture overwhelmingly male aside from an influx of refugees from maritimes who escaped to karafuto during russian revolution of 1917 number of koreans in province did not rise very rapidly as late as mid 1930s there were fewer than 6 000 koreans in karafuto however as japan s war effort picked up japanese government sought to put more people on ground in sparsely populated prefecture in order to ensure their control of territory and fill increasing demands of coal mines and lumber yards recruiters turned to sourcing workers from korean peninsula at one point over 150 000 koreans were relocated to work on island of those around 10 000 mine workers were relocated to japan prior to war s end present day sakhalin koreans efforts to locate them proved futile imperial japanese army in karafuto frequently used local ethnic minorities and ainu to conduct intelligence gathering activities because as indigenous inhabitants their presence would not arouse suspicion on soviet half of island ethnic koreans could also be found on both sides of border but use of koreans as spies was not common as karafuto police were wary of support for independence movement among koreans soviet suspicion towards korean nationalism along with fears that korean community might harbour japanese spies led to 1937 deportation of koreans from soviet controlled northern sakhalin and russian far east soviet invasion and japanese massacres soviet union invaded japanese portion of sakhalin on august 11 1945 resulting deaths of 20 000 civilians see soviet japanese war 1945 in confusion that ensued a rumour began to spread that ethnic koreans could be serving as spies for soviet union and led to massacres of koreans by japanese police and civilians despite generally limited amount of information about massacres two examples of massacres are comparatively well known today incident in kamishisuka now on august 18 1945 and incident in mizuho village now which lasted from august 20 to august 23 1945 in kamishisuka japanese police arrested 19 koreans on charges of spy activities 18 were found shot within police station next day has photos sole survivor a korean known only by his japanese name nakata had survived by hiding in a toilet he later offered testimony about event in mizuho village japanese fleeing soviet troops who had landed at maoka now kholmsk claimed that koreans were cooperating with red army and that they were pillaging japanese property though koreans and japanese worked alongside each other in village on farms and construction projects japanese civilians turned against their korean neighbors killing 27 between august 20 and 23 other individual koreans may have been killed to cover up evidence of japanese atrocities committed during evacuation one woman interviewed by a us russian joint commission investigating issue of allied prisoners of war held by imperial japanese army in camps on sakhalin reported that her ethnic korean lover had been murdered by japanese troops after he had witnessed mass shootings of hundreds of american prisoners of war integration into soviet union repatriation refused in years after soviet invasion most of 400 000 japanese civilians who had not already been evacuated during war left voluntarily under auspices of us ussr agreement on repatriation of those left in ussr signed in december 1946 many of 150 000 koreans on island safely returned to mainland japan and some went to northern half of korean peninsula however roughly 43 000 were not accepted for repatriation by japan and also could not be repatriated to southern half of korean peninsula due to political situation soviet government initially had drawn up plans to repatriate koreans along with japanese but local administration on sakhalin objected arguing that incoming russians from mainland would not be sufficient to replace skilled labourers who had already departed indecision about ultimate fate of sakhalin koreans persisted until outbreak of korean war after which repatriation became a political impossibility some sources claim stalin himself blocked their departure because he wanted to retain them as coal miners on island in 1957 seoul appealed for tokyo s assistance to secure departure of ethnic koreans from sakhalin via japan but tokyo took no real action on request and blamed soviet intransigence for lack of progress in resolving issue japan continued its earlier policy of granting entrance only to sakhalin koreans who were married to japanese citizens or had a japanese parent during late 1940s ranks of ethnic koreans on island were augmented by another 8 000 north korean expatriates recruited by soviet government to work in state owned fisheries in an effort to integrate korean labourers who were unfamiliar with soviet system and unable to speak russian local authorities set up schools using korean language as medium of instruction however sakhalin koreans were believed to have been infected with japanese spirit and so for most part authorities did not trust them to run any of their own collective farms mills factories schools or hospitals instead these tasks were left to several hundred ethnic koreans imported from central asia who were bilingual in russian and korean resentment towards social dominance of koreans from central asia over sakhalin koreans led to tensions between two groups latter developed a number of disparaging terms in korean to refer to former sakhalin government s policy towards sakhalin koreans continued to shift in line with bilateral relations between north korea and soviet union during 1950s north korea demanded that soviets treat sakhalin koreans as north korean citizens and through their consulate even set up study groups and other educational facilities for them analogous to s similar more successful efforts among zainichi koreans during late 1950s it became increasingly difficult for sakhalin koreans to obtain soviet citizenship and a growing proportion chose instead to become north korean citizens rather to than deal with burdens of remaining stateless which included severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and requirement to apply for permission from local government in order to travel outside of sakhalin as of 1960 only 25 had been able to secure soviet citizenship 65 had declared north korean citizenship with remaining 10 choosing to remain unaffiliated despite difficulties this entailed however as relations between soviet union and north korea deteriorated authorities acted to de emphasise korean language education and reduce influence of north korea within community by early 1970s sakhalin koreans were once again encouraged to apply for soviet citizenship attention from outside world in late 1960s and early 1970s situation of sakhalin koreans improved as outside world began to pay much more attention to their situation starting in 1966 park no hak a former sakhalin korean who had earlier received permission to leave sakhalin and settle in japan by virtue of his having a japanese wife petitioned japanese government a total of 23 times to discuss issue of sakhalin koreans with soviet government his actions inspired 500 000 south koreans to form an organisation to work towards repatriation of their co ethnics in response south korean began radio broadcasts targeted at sakhalin koreans in an effort to assure them that they had not been forgotten at same time rei mihara a tokyo housewife formed a similar pressure group in japan and 18 japanese lawyers attempted to sue japanese government to force them to accept diplomatic and financial responsibility for transportation of sakhalin koreans and their return to south korea additionally soviet government finally began to permit sakhalin koreans to however as many as 10 continued to refuse both soviet and north korean citizenship and demanded repatriation to south korea by 1976 only 2 000 more of their population had been able to obtain permission to depart from sakhalin but that year sakhalin government made a public announcement that people seeking to emigrate to south korea could simply show up at immigration office to file an application within a week they had received more than 800 such applications including some from north korean citizens this caused north korean embassy to complain to their soviet counterparts about new emigration policy soviet authorities in end chose for unspecified reasons to refuse to issue exit visas to most of those concerned leading to unusual case of public demonstrations about refusals by korean families this level of open dissent provoked authorities to completely reverse their liberalising stance towards sakhalin koreans they arrested more than 40 protestors and in november 1976 deported them but to north korea rather than to south as they desired further purges and intimidation of those seeking to emigrate also followed through to early 1980s locally born korean youth increasingly interested in their heritage were seen as traitors by their russian neighbours for wanting to know more about their ancestral land and for seeking to emigrate nadir of ethnic relations came after 1983 shooting down of korean air lines flight 007 by soviet union perestroika glasnost and post soviet period improving relations with japan in 1985 japan agreed to approve transit rights and fund repatriation of first generation of sakhalin koreans soviet union also began to liberalize their emigration laws in 1987 as of 2001 japan spends us 1 2 million a year to fund sakhalin koreans visits to seoul foreign ministry allocated about 5 million to build a cultural centre in sakhalin which was intended to feature a library an exhibition hall korean language classrooms and other facilities but project had not begun causing protests among sakhalin koreans on april 18 1990 taro nakayama japan s minister for foreign affairs stated japan is deeply sorry for tragedy in which these korean people were moved to sakhalin not of their own free will but by design of japanese government and had to remain there after conclusion of war translation in kenichi takagi rethinking japan s postwar compensation voices of victims tr by nakano foreign trade of sakhalin with japan is still roughly four times that with korea and japanese companies greatly outnumber their korean on island as a result while members of first generation still carry anti japanese sentiment younger generations have developed an interest in japanese culture and have taken up study of japanese language much to consternation of their elders on october 28 2006 a korean student from sakhalin state university placed second in all cis japanese language students competition north and south korean influence during 1990s commerce communication and direct flights opened up between sakhalin and south korea and two koreas began to vie openly for influence among sakhalin koreans television and radio programmes from both north and south korea as well as local programming began to be broadcast on sakhalin korean broadcasting only korean television station in all of russia north korea negotiated with russia for closer economic relations with sakhalin and sponsored an art show in yuzhno sakhalinsk in 2006 they have also permitted delegations of sakhalin koreans to visit relatives in north korea scholarly studies suggest that roughly 1 000 sakhalin koreans have opted to repatriate to north korea but rise of south korean economy combined with ongoing economic and political turmoil in north have made this option less attractive sakhalin koreans have also provided assistance to refugees fleeing north korea either those who illegally escaped across border or those who escaped north korean labour camps in russia itself south korea and japan jointly funded building of a nursing home for elderly sakhalin koreans in a suburb of seoul and under auspices of korean red cross 1 544 people had settled there and in other locations while another 14 122 had travelled to south korea on short term visits at japanese government expense south korean investors also began to participate in international tenders for works contracts to develop sakhalin shelf as they are interested in potential supply of liquefied natural gas by year 2000 south korean missionaries had opened several churches and south koreans comprised majority of international students at sakhalin state university korean residents association on sakhalin an ethnic representative body is generally described as being pro south korean analogous to japan s in addition to elderly a few younger koreans have also chosen to move to south korea either to find their roots or for economic reasons as wages in south korea are as much as three times those in sakhalin however upon arrival they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by south korean locals despite their previous exposure to korean culture in sakhalin as one returnee put it sakhalin koreans live in a different world than sakhalin russians but that world isn t korea in general younger sakhalin koreans especially those lacking fluency in korean language prefer to stay on sakhalin of 1 544 koreans who repatriated to south korea nearly 10 eventually returned to sakhalin conversely some foreign students from korea studying in sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local koreans claiming that latter looked down on them for being foreigners local interethnic relations in late 1980s suspicions against sakhalin koreans remained with relaxation of internal migration controls and dissolution of soviet union russians began moving en masse back to mainland making ethnic koreans an increasing proportion of population there were fears that they might become a majority of island s population and seek an autonomous republic or even independence however rise of regional economy and cultural assimilation of younger generations drove more than 95 of koreans to stay in sakhalin or move to russian far east rather than leave for south korea as they have come to consider russia their home country sakhalin koreans family connections in south korea have benefited even those who remained on sakhalin with easier access to south korean business and imports trade with south korea has brought sakhalin koreans a better economic standing than average resident of sakhalin by 2004 inter ethnic relations between russians and koreans had improved greatly and were generally not described as being a problem on sakhalin however sakhalin koreans who have travelled to mainland of russia or have relocated to there a population of roughly 10 000 report that they have encountered various forms of racism among koreans who remain on sakhalin roughly 7 000 of original generation of settlers survive while their locally born descendants make up rest of local korean population they are highly urbanized half live in administrative centre of yuzhno sakhalinsk where koreans constitute nearly 12 of population around thirty per cent of sakhalin s thirty thousand koreans still have not taken russian citizenship unlike ethnic russians or other local minority groups sakhalin koreans are exempted from conscription but there have been calls for this exemption to be terminated culture personal and family names korean surnames when may be spelled slightly differently from used in us resulting common pronunciations also differ as can be seen in table at right furthermore korean naming practices and russian naming practices conflict in several important ways while most members of older generations of sakhalin koreans used korean names members of younger generations favor their russian names however with increasing exposure to south korean pop culture some younger koreans have named their children after characters in korean television dramas use of is not widespread in addition to korean names oldest generation of sakhalin koreans are often legally registered under japanese names which they had originally adopted due to soshi policy of japanese colonial era after soviet invasion sakhalin authorities conducted name registration for local koreans on basis of japanese identity documents issued by old karafuto government as of 2006 russian government uniformly refused requests for re registration under korean names language due to their greater population density and expectation that they would one day be allowed to return to korea sakhalin koreans have kept something of a sojourner mentality rather than a settler mentality which influenced their relation to surrounding society even today they tend to speak much better korean than those who were deported to central asia a weekly korean language newspaper saegoryeo saegoryeo sinmun has been published since 1949 while sakhalin korean broadcasting began operation in 1956 korean language television programmes are broadcast locally but typically with russian subtitles additionally during soviet era sakhalin koreans were often hired to act as announcers and writers for official media aimed at koryo saram in central asia however unlike koryo saram spoken korean of sakhalin is not very closely related to hamgyong dialect or koryo mar but is instead descended from jeolla and gyeongsang dialects as a result of diplomatic situation up until 1980s during which south korea had no relations with soviet union korean language instructional materials were provided by north korea or developed domestically oddly enough as a result sakhalin koreans writing like that of koryo saram follows north korean standard but their spoken korean in radio broadcasts has come to resemble seoul dialect of south korea religion since dissolution of soviet union there has been significant growth in religious activities among sakhalin koreans establishment of churches was noted in scholarly articles as early as 1990 christian hymns have become popular listening material supplementing more typical russian western and korean pop music korean churches also broadcast religious content through sakhalin korean broadcasting a baptist church run by ethnic koreans sponsors a journalist there however large scale religious events can be subjected to restriction by government authorities in june 1998 local russian orthodox church and regional administration of sakhalin successfully pressured korean presbyterian missionaries to cancel a conference of more than 100 presbyterian and other protestant missionaries from around former soviet union ethnic koreans are numerous among church goers of st james cathedral seat of apostolic prefecture of yuzhno sakhalinsk in yuzhno sakhalinsk catholic missions in kholmsk and have also a fair number of korean parishioners music in one survey a third of sakhalin korean population expressed a preference for traditional korean music a far higher proportion than in any other ethnic korean community surveyed however despite their better knowledge of korean language same survey showed that korean pop music is less widespread among sakhalin koreans than among ethnic koreans in kazakhstan possessing about same degree of popularity as in uzbekistan sakhalin koreans also reported listening to western popular and classical music at much lower rates than koreans in rest of former soviet union study of traditional korean musical instruments has also been gaining popularity across all generations ethnos arts school was established in 1991 in yuzhno sakhalinsk to teach children s
