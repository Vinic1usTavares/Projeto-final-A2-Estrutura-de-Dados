hubble space telescope often referred to as hst or hubble is a space telescope that was launched into low earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation it was not first space telescope but it is one of largest and most versatile and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy hubble telescope is named after astronomer edwin hubble and is one of nasa s great observatories along with compton gamma ray observatory chandra x ray observatory and spitzer space telescope hubble features a mirror and its four main instruments observe in ultraviolet visible and near infrared regions of electromagnetic spectrum hubble s orbit outside distortion of earth s atmosphere allows it to take extremely high resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground based telescopes it has recorded some of most detailed visible light images allowing a deep view into space many hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics such as determining rate of expansion of universe hubble telescope was built by united states space agency nasa with contributions from european space agency space telescope science institute stsci selects hubble s targets and processes resulting data while goddard space flight center controls spacecraft space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 hubble was funded in 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983 but project was beset by technical delays budget problems and challenger disaster 1986 it was finally launched by in 1990 but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly and created a spherical aberration compromising telescope s capabilities optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993 hubble is only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts five space shuttle missions have repaired upgraded and replaced systems on telescope including all five of main instruments fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following columbia disaster 2003 but nasa administrator michael d griffin approved fifth servicing mission which was completed in 2009 telescope is operating and could last until 2030 2040 its successor is james webb space telescope jwst which is scheduled to be launched in march 2021 conception design and aim proposals and precursors thumb astronaut owen garriott works next to skylab s manned solar space observatory 1973 in 1923 hermann oberth considered a father of modern rocketry along with robert h goddard and konstantin tsiolkovsky published rocket into planetary space which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into earth orbit by a rocket history of hubble space telescope can be traced back as far as 1946 to astronomer lyman spitzer s paper astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory spitzer lyman jr report to project rand astronomical advantages of an extra terrestrial observatory reprinted in nasa sp 2001 4407 exploring unknown chapter 3 document iii 1 p 546 in it he discussed two main advantages that a space based observatory would have over ground based telescopes first angular resolution smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished would be limited only by diffraction rather than by turbulence in atmosphere which causes stars to twinkle known to astronomers as seeing at that time ground based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0 5 1 0 arcseconds compared to a theoretical diffraction limited resolution of about 0 05 arcsec for a telescope with a mirror in diameter second a space based telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light which are strongly absorbed by atmosphere spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for development of a space telescope in 1962 a report by us national academy of sciences recommended development of a space telescope as part of space program and in 1965 spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope space based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following world war ii as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology first ultraviolet spectrum of sun was obtained in 1946 and national aeronautics and space administration nasa launched orbiting solar observatory oso to obtain uv x ray and gamma ray spectra in 1962 an orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by united kingdom as part of ariel space program and in 1966 nasa launched first orbiting astronomical observatory oao mission oao 1 s battery failed after three days terminating mission it was followed by oao 2 which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972 well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year oso and oao missions demonstrated important role space based observations could play in astronomy in 1968 nasa developed firm plans for a space based reflecting telescope with a mirror in diameter known provisionally as large orbiting telescope or large space telescope lst with a launch slated for 1979 these plans emphasized need for manned maintenance missions to telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life and concurrent development of plans for reusable space shuttle indicated that technology to allow this was soon to become available quest for funding continuing success of oao program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within astronomical community that lst should be a major goal in 1970 nasa established two committees one to plan engineering side of space telescope project and other to determine scientific goals of mission once these had been established next hurdle for nasa was to obtain funding for instrument which would be far more costly than any earth based telescope u s congress questioned many aspects of proposed budget for telescope and forced cuts in budget for planning stages which at time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for telescope in 1974 public spending cuts led to congress deleting all funding for telescope project in response a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers many astronomers met congressmen and senators in person and large scale letter writing campaigns were organized national academy of sciences published a report emphasizing need for a space telescope and eventually senate agreed to half of budget that had originally been approved by congress funding issues led to something of a reduction in scale of project with proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2 4 m both to cut costs and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for telescope hardware a proposed precursor space telescope to test systems to be used on main satellite was dropped and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with european space agency esa agreed to provide funding and supply one of first generation instruments for telescope as well as solar cells that would power it and staff to work on telescope in united states in return for european astronomers being guaranteed at least 15 of observing time on telescope memorandum of understanding between european space agency and united states national aeronautics and space administration reprinted in nasa sp 2001 4407 exploring unknown chapter 3 document iii 29 p 671 congress eventually approved funding of for 1978 and design of lst began in earnest aiming for a launch date of 1983 in 1983 telescope was named after edwin hubble who confirmed one of greatest scientific breakthroughs of 20th century made by georges lemaitre that universe is expanding construction and engineering thumb grinding of hubble s primary mirror at perkin elmer march 1979 once space telescope project had been given go ahead work on program was divided among many institutions marshall space flight center msfc was given responsibility for design development and construction of telescope while goddard space flight center was given overall control of scientific instruments and ground control center for mission msfc commissioned optics company perkin elmer to design and build optical telescope assembly ota and fine guidance sensors for space telescope lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate spacecraft in which telescope would be housed optical telescope assembly optically hst is a cassegrain reflector of ritchey chretien design as are most large professional telescopes this design with two hyperbolic mirrors is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view with disadvantage that mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test mirror and optical systems of telescope determine final performance and they were designed to exacting specifications optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of wavelength of visible light but space telescope was to be used for observations from visible through ultraviolet shorter wavelengths and was specified to be diffraction limited to take full advantage of space environment therefore its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of or about 1 65 of wavelength of red light on long wavelength end ota was not designed with optimum ir performance in mind for example mirrors are kept at stable and warm about 15 degc temperatures by heaters this limits hubble s performance as an infrared telescope thumb backup mirror by kodak its inner support structure can be seen because it is not coated with a reflective surface perkin elmer intended to use custom built and extremely sophisticated computer controlled polishing machines to grind mirror to required shape however in case their cutting edge technology ran into difficulties nasa demanded that pe sub contract to kodak to construct a back up mirror using traditional mirror polishing techniques team of kodak and itek also bid on original mirror polishing work their bid called for two companies to double check each other s work which would have almost certainly caught polishing error that later caused such problems kodak mirror is now on permanent display at national air and space museum an itek mirror built as part of effort is now used in 2 4 m telescope at magdalena ridge observatory construction of perkin elmer mirror began in 1979 starting with a blank manufactured by corning from their ultra low expansion glass to keep mirror s weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates each thick sandwiching a honeycomb lattice perkin elmer simulated microgravity by supporting mirror from back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force this ensured that mirror s final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed mirror polishing continued until may 1981 nasa reports at time questioned perkin elmer s managerial structure and polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget to save money nasa halted work on back up mirror and put launch date of telescope back to october 1984 mirror was completed by end of 1981 it was washed using of hot deionized water and then received a reflective coating of aluminum and a protective coating of magnesium fluoride thumb ota metering truss and secondary baffle are visible in this image of hubble during early construction doubts continued to be expressed about perkin elmer s competence on a project of this importance as their budget and timescale for producing rest of ota continued to inflate in response to a schedule described as unsettled and changing daily nasa postponed launch date of telescope until april 1985 perkin elmer s schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter and at times delays reached one day for each day of work nasa was forced to postpone launch date until march and then september 1986 by this time total project budget had risen to spacecraft systems spacecraft in which telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge it would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into darkness of earth s shadow which would cause major changes in temperature while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of telescope a shroud of multi layer insulation keeps temperature within telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which telescope and instruments sit within shell a graphite epoxy frame keeps working parts of telescope firmly aligned because graphite composites are hygroscopic there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by truss while in lockheed s clean room would later be expressed in vacuum of space resulting in telescope s instruments being covered by ice to reduce that risk a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching telescope into space david 1987 space telescope new york michael friedman publishing p 50 while construction of spacecraft in which telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than construction of ota lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage and by summer of 1985 construction of spacecraft was 30 over budget and three months behind schedule an msfc report said that lockheed tended to rely on nasa directions rather than take their own initiative in construction computer systems and data processing thumb df 224 in hubble before it was replaced in 1999 two initial primary computers on hst were 1 25 mhz df 224 system built by rockwell autonetics which contained three redundant cpus and two redundant 1 nasa standard spacecraft computer model 1 systems developed by westinghouse and gsfc using diode transistor logic a co processor for df 224 was added during servicing mission 1 in 1993 which consisted of two redundant strings of an intel based processor with an math co processor df 224 and its 386 co processor were replaced by a 25 mhz intel based 80486 processor system during servicing mission 3a in 1999 new computer is 20 times faster with six times more memory than df 224 it replaced it increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from ground to spacecraft and saves money by allowing use of modern programming languages additionally some of science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor based control systems mats multiple access transponder components mat 1 and mat 2 utilize hughes aircraft microprocessors wide field and planetary camera wfpc also utilized an rca 1802 microprocessor or possibly older 1801 version wfpc 1 was replaced by wfpc 2 during servicing mission 1 in 1993 which was then replaced by wide field camera 3 wfc3 during servicing mission 4 in 2009 initial instruments thumb exploded view of hubble space telescope when launched hst carried five scientific instruments wide field and planetary camera wf pc goddard high resolution spectrograph ghrs high speed photometer hsp faint object camera foc and faint object spectrograph fos wf pc was a high resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations it was built by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest instrument contained eight charge coupled device ccd chips divided between two cameras each using four ccds each ccd has a resolution of 0 64 megapixels wide field camera wfc covered a large angular field at expense of resolution while planetary camera pc took images at a longer effective focal length than wf chips giving it a greater magnification 40 mb pdf file ghrs was a spectrograph designed to operate in ultraviolet it was built by goddard space flight center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90 000 also optimized for ultraviolet observations were foc and fos which were capable of highest spatial resolution of any instruments on hubble rather than ccds these three instruments used photon counting as their detectors foc was constructed by esa while university of california san diego and martin marietta corporation built fos final instrument was hsp designed and built at university of wisconsin madison it was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness it could take up to 100 000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2 or better bless rc walter le white rl 1992 high speed photometer instrument handbook v 3 0 stsci hst s guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument its three fine guidance sensors fgs are primarily used to keep telescope accurately pointed during an observation but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate astrometry measurements accurate to within 0 0003 arcseconds have been achieved ground support thumb hubble control center at goddard space flight center 1999 space telescope science institute stsci is responsible for scientific operation of telescope and delivery of data products to astronomers stsci is operated by association of universities for research in astronomy aura and is physically located in baltimore maryland on homewood campus of johns hopkins university one of 39 us universities and seven international affiliates that make up aura consortium stsci was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between nasa and scientific community at large nasa had wanted to keep this function in house but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment roman nancy grace exploring universe space based astronomy and astrophysics in nasa sp 2001 4407 exploring unknown pdf nasa chapter 3 p 536 space telescope european coordinating facility st established at bei munchen near munich in 1984 provided similar support for european astronomers until 2011 when these activities were moved to european space astronomy centre one rather complex task that falls to stsci is scheduling observations for telescope hubble is in a low earth orbit to enable servicing missions but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by earth for slightly less than half of each orbit observations cannot take place when telescope passes through south atlantic anomaly due to elevated radiation levels and there are also sizable exclusion zones around sun precluding observations of mercury moon and earth solar avoidance angle is about 50deg to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of ota earth and moon avoidance keeps bright light out of fgss and keeps scattered light from entering instruments if fgss are turned off however moon and earth can be observed earth observations were used very early in program to generate flat fields for wfpc1 instrument there is a so called continuous viewing zone cvz at roughly 90deg to plane of hubble s orbit in which targets are not occulted for long periods due to precession of orbit location of cvz moves slowly over a period of eight weeks because limb of earth is always within about 30deg of regions within cvz brightness of scattered may be elevated for long periods during cvz observations hubble orbits in low earth orbit at an altitude of approximately and an inclination of 28 5deg position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable density of upper atmosphere varies according to many factors and this means that hubble s predicted position for six weeks time could be in error by up to observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that target would be unobservable by time it was due to be observed engineering support for hst is provided by nasa and contractor personnel at goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland south of stsci hubble s operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up hubble s flight operations team challenger disaster delays and eventual launch thumb upright sts 31 lifts off carrying hubble into orbit thumb hubble being deployed from discovery in 1990 by early 1986 planned launch date of october that year looked feasible but challenger accident brought u s space program to a halt grounding space shuttle fleet and forcing launch of hubble to be postponed for several years telescope had to be kept in a clean room powered up and purged with nitrogen until a launch could be rescheduled this costly situation about per month pushed overall costs of project even higher this delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests swap out a possibly failure prone battery and make other improvements furthermore ground software needed to control hubble was not ready in 1986 and was barely ready by 1990 launch eventually following resumption of shuttle flights in 1988 launch of telescope was scheduled for 1990 on april 24 1990 successfully launched telescope into its planned orbit during sts 31 mission from its original total cost estimate of about telescope cost about by time of its launch hubble s cumulative costs were estimated to be about in 2010 twenty years after launch list of hubble instruments hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time plus fine guidance sensors which are mainly used for aiming telescope but are occasionally used for scientific astrometry measurements early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during shuttle servicing missions costar was a corrective optics device rather than a science instrument but occupied one of five instrument

is in space place at university of wisconsin madison first wfpc was dismantled and some components were then re used in wfc3 flawed mirror thumb an extract from a wf pc image shows light from a star spread over a wide area instead of being concentrated on a few pixels within weeks of launch of telescope returned images indicated a serious problem with optical system although first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground based telescopes hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond instead of having a point spread function psf concentrated within a circle 0 1 arcsec in diameter as had been specified in design criteria analysis of flawed images showed that cause of problem was that primary mirror had been polished to wrong shape although it was probably most precisely figured optical mirror ever made smooth to about at perimeter it was too flat by about this difference was catastrophic introducing severe spherical aberration a flaw in which light reflecting off edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from light reflecting off its center effect of mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on particular observation core of psf was sharp enough to permit high resolution observations of bright objects and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss however loss of light to large out of focus halo severely reduced usefulness of telescope for faint objects or high contrast imaging this meant that nearly all of cosmological programs were essentially impossible since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects nasa and telescope became butt of many jokes and project was popularly regarded as a white elephant for instance in 1991 comedy naked gun 2 1 2 smell of fear in a scene where high profile disasters were displayed hubble was pictured with lusitania hindenburg and edsel nonetheless during first three years of hubble mission before optical corrections telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets error was well characterized and stable enabling astronomers to partially compensate for defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution origin of problem thumb upright 1 5 optical evolution of hubble s primary camera system these images show spiral galaxy as seen with wfpc1 in 1993 before corrective optics left with wfpc2 in 1994 after correction center and with wfc3 in 2018 right a commission headed by lew allen director of jet propulsion laboratory was established to determine how error could have arisen allen commission found that a reflective null corrector a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non spherical mirror had been incorrectly assembled one lens was out of position by during initial grinding and polishing of mirror perkin elmer analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors however for final manufacturing step figuring they switched to custom built reflective null corrector designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances incorrect assembly of this device resulted in mirror being ground very precisely but to wrong shape a few final tests using conventional null correctors correctly reported spherical aberration but these results were dismissed thus missing opportunity to catch error because reflective null corrector was considered more accurate commission blamed failings primarily on perkin elmer relations between nasa and optics company had been severely strained during telescope construction due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns nasa found that perkin elmer did not review or supervise mirror construction adequately did not assign its best optical scientists to project as it had for prototype and in particular did not involve optical designers in construction and verification of mirror while commission heavily criticized perkin elmer for these managerial failings nasa was also criticized for not picking up on quality control shortcomings such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument design of a solution thumb upright some of carina nebula by wfc3 design of telescope had always incorporated servicing missions and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to problem that could be applied at first servicing mission scheduled for 1993 while kodak had ground a back up mirror for hubble it would have been impossible to replace mirror in orbit and too expensive and time consuming to bring telescope back to earth for a refit instead fact that mirror had been ground so precisely to wrong shape led to design of new optical components with exactly same error but in opposite sense to be added to telescope at servicing mission effectively acting as spectacles to correct spherical aberration eric 1994 hubble wars astrophysics meets in two billion dollar struggle over hubble space telescope harper collins p 184 first step was a precise characterization of error in main mirror working backwards from images of point sources astronomers determined that conic constant of mirror as built was instead of intended same number was also derived by analyzing null corrector used by perkin elmer to figure mirror as well as by analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of mirror thumb right costar being removed in 2009 because of way hst s instruments were designed two different sets of correctors were required design of wide field and planetary camera 2 already planned to replace existing wf pc included relay mirrors to direct light onto four separate charge coupled device ccd chips making up its two cameras an inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel aberration of primary however other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way and so required an external correction device corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar system was designed to correct spherical aberration for light focused at foc fos and ghrs it consists of two mirrors in light path with one ground to correct aberration to fit costar system onto telescope one of other instruments had to be removed and astronomers selected high speed photometer to be sacrificed by 2002 all of original instruments requiring costar had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics costar was removed and returned to earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at national air and space museum area previously used by costar is now occupied by cosmic origins spectrograph servicing missions and new instruments hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit instruments and limited life items were designed as orbital replacement units orbital replacement units hst five servicing missions sm 1 2 3a 3b and 4 were flown by nasa space shuttles first in december 1993 and last in may 2009 servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with shuttle s mechanical arm necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered spacewalks over a period of four to five days after a visual inspection of telescope astronauts conducted repairs replaced failed or degraded components upgraded equipment and installed new instruments once work was completed telescope was redeployed typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address orbital decay caused by atmospheric drag servicing mission 1 thumb right astronauts musgrave and hoffman install corrective optics during sm1 after problems with hubble s mirror were discovered first servicing mission assumed greater importance as astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics seven astronauts for mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools sm1 flew aboard endeavour in december 1993 and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days most importantly high speed photometer was replaced with costar corrective optics package and wfpc was replaced with wide field and planetary camera 2 wfpc2 with an internal optical correction system solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced as well as four gyroscopes in telescope pointing system two electrical control units and other electrical components and two magnetometers onboard computers were upgraded with added and hubble s orbit was boosted on january 13 1994 nasa declared mission a complete success and showed first sharper images mission was one of most complex performed up until that date involving five long extra vehicular activity periods its success was a boon for nasa as well as for astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope servicing mission 2 thumb hubble as seen from discovery during its second servicing mission servicing mission 2 flown by discovery in february 1997 replaced ghrs and fos with space telescope imaging spectrograph stis and near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer nicmos replaced an engineering and science tape recorder with a new solid state recorder and repaired thermal insulation nicmos contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce thermal noise from instrument but shortly after it was installed an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle this led to an increased warming rate for instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4 5 years to about 2 years servicing mission 3a servicing mission 3a flown by discovery took place in december 1999 and was a split off from servicing mission 3 after three of six onboard gyroscopes had failed fourth failed a few weeks before mission rendering telescope incapable of performing scientific observations mission replaced all six gyroscopes replaced a fine guidance sensor and computer installed a voltage temperature improvement kit vik to prevent battery overcharging and replaced thermal insulation blankets servicing mission 3b servicing mission 3b flown by columbia in march 2002 saw installation of a new instrument with foc which except for fine guidance sensors when used for astrometry was last of original instruments being replaced by advanced camera for surveys acs this meant that costar was no longer required since all new instruments had built in correction for main mirror aberration mission also revived nicmos by installing a closed cycle cooler and replaced solar arrays for second time providing 30 percent more power servicing mission 4 plans called for hubble to be serviced in february 2005 but columbia disaster in 2003 in which orbiter disintegrated on re entry into atmosphere had wide ranging effects on hubble program nasa administrator sean o keefe decided that all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach safe haven of international space station should in flight problems develop as no shuttles were capable of reaching both hst and space station during same mission future crewed service missions were canceled this decision was criticised by numerous astronomers who felt that hubble was valuable enough to merit human risk chapter 7 given intrinsic value of a serviced hubble and high likelihood of success for a shuttle servicing mission committee judges that such a mission is worth risk hst s planned successor james webb telescope jwst as of 2004 was not expected to launch until at least 2011 a gap in space observing capabilities between a decommissioning of hubble and commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers given significant scientific impact of hst consideration that jwst will not be located in low earth orbit and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in event of an early failure only made concerns more acute on other hand many astronomers felt strongly that servicing of hubble should not take place if expense were to come from jwst budget in january 2004 o keefe said he would review his decision to cancel final servicing mission to hst due to public outcry and requests from congress for nasa to look for a way to save it national academy of sciences convened an official panel which recommended in july 2004 that hst should be preserved despite apparent risks their report urged nasa should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to hubble space telescope in august 2004 o keefe asked goddard space flight center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission these plans were later canceled robotic mission being described as not feasible in late 2004 several congressional members led by senator barbara mikulski held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support including thousands of letters from school children across u s to get bush administration and nasa to reconsider decision to drop plans for a hubble rescue mission thumb nickel hydrogen battery pack for hubble nomination in april 2005 of a new nasa administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background michael d griffin changed situation as griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission soon after his appointment griffin authorized goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned hubble maintenance flight saying he would make final decision after next two shuttle missions in october 2006 griffin gave final go ahead and 11 day mission by atlantis was scheduled for october 2008 hubble s main data handling unit failed in september 2008 halting all reporting of scientific data until its back up was brought online on october 25 2008 since a failure of backup unit would leave hst helpless service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for primary unit servicing mission 4 sm4 flown by atlantis in may 2009 was last scheduled shuttle mission for hst sm4 installed replacement data handling unit repaired acs and stis systems installed improved nickel hydrogen batteries and replaced other components sm4 also installed two new observation instruments wide field camera 3 wfc3 and cosmic origins spectrograph cos and soft capture and rendezvous system which will enable future rendezvous capture and safe disposal of hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission except for acs s high resolution channel which could not be repaired and was disabled work accomplished during sm4 rendered telescope fully functional and it remains so major projects thumb one of hubble s most famous images pillars of creation shows stars forming in eagle nebula 2014 image since start of program a number of research projects have been carried out some of them almost solely with hubble others coordinated facilities such as chandra x ray observatory and

caitlin casey and and involves more than 200 scientists in a dozen countries public use thumb upright star cluster pismis 24 with nebula policy anyone can apply for time on telescope there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation but funding for analysis is only available to us institutions competition for time on telescope is intense with about one fifth of proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on schedule proposals calls for proposals are issued roughly annually with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year proposals are divided into several categories general observer proposals are most common covering routine observations snapshot observations are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time including overheads such as acquiring target snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular go programs astronomers may make target of opportunity proposals in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by proposal occurs during scheduling cycle in addition up to 10 of telescope time is designated director s discretionary dd time astronomers can apply to use dd time at any time of year and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae other uses of dd time have included observations that led to views of hubble deep field and hubble ultra deep field and in first four cycles of telescope time observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers public image processing of hubble data is encouraged as most of data in archives has not been processed into color imagery use by amateur astronomers thumb upright hst is sometimes visible from ground as in this 10 second exposure first director of stsci riccardo giacconi announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use telescope total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit did not duplicate proposals made by professionals and required unique capabilities of space telescope thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on telescope with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997 one such study was transition comets uv search for oh very first proposal a hubble space telescope study of brightening and albedo changes on io was published in icarus a journal devoted to solar system studies a second study from another group of amateurs was also published in icarus after that time however budget reductions at stsci made support of work by amateur astronomers untenable and no additional amateur programs have been carried out scientific results thumb upright 2 7 center hubble space telescope ultra deep field galaxies to legacy field zoom out video 00 50 may 2 2019 key projects in early 1980s nasa and stsci convened four panels to discuss key projects these were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time which would be explicitly dedicated to each project this guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early in case telescope failed sooner than expected panels identified three such projects 1 a study of nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine properties of intergalactic medium and gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies 2 a medium deep survey using wide field camera to take data whenever one of other instruments was being used and 3 a project to determine hubble constant within ten percent by reducing errors both external and internal in calibration of distance scale important discoveries thumb hubble s stis uv and acs visible light are combined to reveal saturn s southern aurora hubble has helped resolve some long standing problems in astronomy while also raising new questions some results have required new theories to explain them age of universe among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before and thus constrain value of hubble constant measure of rate at which universe is expanding which is also related to its age before launch of hst estimates of hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50 but hubble measurements of cepheid variables in virgo cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of 10 which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since hubble s launch using other techniques preprint available here estimated age is now about 13 7 billion years but before hubble telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years expansion of universe while hubble helped to refine estimates of age of universe it also cast doubt on theories about its future astronomers from high z supernova search team and supernova cosmology project used ground based telescopes and hst to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that far from decelerating under influence of gravity expansion of universe may in fact be accelerating three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded nobel prizes for their discovery cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood most common cause attributed is dark energy thumb right brown spots mark comet shoemaker levy 9 impact sites on jupiter s southern hemisphere imaged by hubble black holes high resolution spectra and images provided by hst have been especially well suited to establishing prevalence of black holes in nuclei of nearby galaxies while it had been hypothesized in early 1960s that black holes would be found at centers of some galaxies and astronomers in 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates work conducted with hubble shows that black holes are probably common to centers of all galaxies hubble programs further established that masses of nuclear black holes and properties of galaxies are closely related legacy of hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes extending visible wavelength images thumb hubble extreme deep field image of space in constellation fornax a unique window on universe enabled by hubble are hubble deep field hubble ultra deep field and hubble extreme deep field images which used hubble s unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths images reveal galaxies billions of light years away and have generated a wealth of scientific papers providing a new window on early universe wide field

as part of candels goods north surveys solar system discoveries hst has also been used to study objects in outer reaches of solar system including dwarf planets pluto and eris collision of comet shoemaker levy 9 with jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers coming just a few months after servicing mission 1 had restored hubble s optical performance hubble images of planet were sharper than any taken since passage of voyager 2 in 1979 and were crucial in studying dynamics of collision of a comet with jupiter an event believed to occur once every few centuries during june and july 2012 us astronomers using hubble discovered a tiny fifth moon orbiting around pluto in march 2015 researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around ganymede one of jupiter s moons revealed that it has a subsurface ocean using hubble to study motion of its aurorae researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress interaction between jupiter s magnetic field and that of ganymede ocean is estimated to be deep trapped beneath a ice crust thumb hubble and alma image of macs j1149 5 2223 supernova reappearance on december 11 2015 hubble captured an image of first ever predicted reappearance of a supernova dubbed refsdal which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is warping supernova s light supernova was previously seen in november 2014 behind galaxy cluster macs j1149 5 2223 as part of hubble s frontier fields program astronomers spotted four separate images of supernova in an arrangement known as an einstein cross light from cluster has taken about five billion years to reach earth though supernova exploded some 10 billion years ago detection of refsdal s reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass especially dark matter is distributed within this galaxy cluster mass and size of milky way in march 2019 observations from hubble and data from european space agency s gaia space observatory were combined to determine that milky way galaxy weighs approximately 1 5 trillion solar units and has a radius of 129 000 light years other discoveries other discoveries made with hubble data include proto planetary disks in orion nebula evidence for presence of extrasolar planets around sun like stars and optical counterparts of still mysterious gamma ray bursts impact on astronomy thumb upright 1 5 alt depiction of progress in detection of early universe evolution of detecting early universe many objective measures show positive impact of hubble data on astronomy over 15 000 papers based on hubble data have been published in peer reviewed journals and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings looking at papers several years after their publication about one third of all astronomy papers have no citations while only 2 of papers based on hubble data have no citations on average a paper based on hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non hubble data of 200 papers published each year that receive most citations about 10 are based on hubble data although hst has clearly helped astronomical research its financial cost has been large a study on relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on hst data generate 15 times as many citations as a ground based telescope such as william herschel telescope hst costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain deciding between building ground versus space based telescopes is complex even before hubble was launched specialized ground based techniques such as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher resolution optical and infrared images than hubble would achieve though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than faintest targets observed by hubble since then advances in adaptive optics have extended high resolution imaging capabilities of ground based telescopes to infrared imaging of faint objects usefulness of adaptive optics versus hst observations depends strongly on particular details of research questions being asked in visible bands adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view whereas hst can conduct high resolution optical imaging over a wide field only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high resolution ground based imaging in contrast hubble can perform high resolution observations of any part of night sky and on objects that are extremely faint impact on aerospace engineering in addition to its scientific results hubble has also made significant contributions to aerospace engineering in particular performance of systems in low earth orbit these insights result from hubble s long lifetime on orbit extensive instrumentation and return of assemblies to earth where they can be studied in detail in particular hubble has contributed to studies of behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing radiation damage to electronics and sensors and long term behavior of multi layer insulation one lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion gyroscopes are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen hubble data thumb hubble precision stellar distance measurement has been extended 10 times further into milky way transmission to earth hubble data was initially stored on spacecraft when launched storage facilities were old fashioned reel to reel tape recorders but these were replaced by solid state data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3a about twice daily hubble space telescope radios data to a satellite in geosynchronous tracking and data relay satellite system which then downlinks science data to one of two 60 foot 18 meter diameter high gain microwave antennas located at white sands test facility in white sands new mexico from there they are sent to space telescope operations control center at goddard space flight center and finally to space telescope science institute for archiving each week hst downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data color images thumb right data analysis of a spectrum reveals chemistry of hidden clouds all images from hubble are monochromatic grayscale taken through a variety of filters each passing specific wavelengths of light and incorporated in each camera color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters this process can also create false color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue archives all hubble data is eventually made available via mikulski archive for space telescopes at stsci and esa data is usually proprietary available only to principal investigator pi and astronomers designated by pi for six months after being taken pi can apply to director of stsci to extend or reduce proprietary period in some circumstances observations made on director s discretionary time are exempt from proprietary period and are released to public immediately calibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away all data in archive is in fits format which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use hubble heritage project processes and releases to public a small selection of most striking images in jpeg and tiff formats pipeline reduction astronomical data taken with ccds must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis stsci has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from archive using best calibration files available this on fly processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as pipeline reduction and is increasingly common at major observatories astronomers may if they wish retrieve calibration files themselves and run pipeline reduction software locally this may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used data analysis hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages stsci maintains custom made space telescope science data analysis system software which contains all programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files as well as many other astronomical image processing tools tailored to requirements of hubble data software runs as a module of a popular astronomical data reduction program

hubble space telescope located at courthouse in marshfield missouri a hometown of telescope namesake edwin hubble it has always been important for space telescope to capture public s imagination given considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs after difficult early years when faulty mirror severely dented hubble s reputation with public first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images several initiatives have helped to keep public informed about hubble activities in united states outreach efforts are coordinated by space telescope science institute stsci office for public outreach which was established in 2000 to ensure that u s taxpayers saw benefits of their investment in space telescope program to that end stsci operates hubblesite org website hubble heritage project operating out of stsci provides public with high quality images of most interesting and striking objects observed heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy and emphasizes aesthetic nature of hubble images heritage project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which for scientific reasons may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full color image since 1999 leading hubble outreach group in europe has been hubble european space agency information centre heic this office was established at space telescope european coordinating facility in munich germany heic s mission is to fulfill hst outreach and education tasks for european space agency work is centered on production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting hubble results and images these are often european in origin and so increase awareness of both esa s hubble share 15 and contribution of european scientists to observatory esa produces educational material including a series called designed to share world class

science institute stsci released an image from carina nebula to commemorate hubble s 25th anniversary in space on april 24 2015 stsci released images of westerlund 2 cluster located about away in constellation carina through its hubble 25 website european space agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website in april 2016 a special celebratory image of bubble nebula was released for hubble s 26th birthday equipment failures gyroscope rotation sensors hst uses gyroscopes to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets three gyroscopes are normally required for operation observations are still possible with two or one but area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult in 2018 plan is to drop into one gyroscope mode if less than three working gyroscopes are operational gyroscopes are part of pointing control system which uses five types of sensors magnetic sensors optical sensors and gyroscopes and two types of actuators reaction wheels and magnetic hubble carries six gyroscopes in total after columbia disaster in 2003 it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible and gyroscope life became a concern again so engineers developed new software for two gyroscope and one gyroscope modes to maximize potential lifetime development was successful and in 2005 it was decided to switch to two gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending lifetime of mission switch to this mode was made in august 2005 leaving hubble with two gyroscopes in use two on backup and two inoperable one more gyroscope failed in 2007 by time of final repair mission in may 2009 during which all six gyroscopes were replaced with two new pairs and one refurbished pair only three gyroscopes were still working engineers determined that gyroscope failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering motor that was initiated by oxygen pressurized air used to deliver thick suspending fluid new gyroscope models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable in 2009 servicing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced and after almost ten years only three gyroscopes failed but only after exceeding average expected run time for design of six gyroscopes replaced in 2009 three were of old design susceptible for flex lead failure and three were of new design with a longer expected lifetime first of old style gyroscopes failed in march 2014 and second in april 2018 on october 5 2018 last of old style gyroscopes failed and one of new style gyroscopes was powered up from standby state however that reserve gyroscope did not immediately perform within operational limits and so observatory was placed into safe mode while scientists attempted to fix problem nasa tweeted on october 22 2018 that rotation rates produced by backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range additional tests to be performed to ensure hubble can return to science operations with this gyro solution that restored backup new style gyroscope to operational range was widely reported as turning it off and on again a running restart of gyroscope was performed but this had no effect and final resolution to failure was more complex failure was attributed to an inconsistency in fluid surrounding float within gyroscope e g an air bubble on october 18 2018 hubble operations team directed spacecraft into a series of maneuvers moving spacecraft in opposite directions in order to mitigate inconsistency only after maneuvers and a subsequent set of maneuvers on october 19 did gyroscope truly operate within its normal range thumb left hubble views fomalhaut system this false color image was taken in october 2004 and july 2006 with advanced camera for surveys instruments and electronics past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones avoiding failure and making new types of science possible without servicing missions all of instruments will eventually fail in august 2004 power system of space telescope imaging spectrograph stis failed rendering instrument inoperable electronics had originally been fully redundant but first set of electronics failed in may 2001 this power supply was fixed during servicing mission 4 in may 2009 similarly advanced camera for surveys acs main camera primary electronics failed in june 2006 and power supply for backup electronics failed on january 27 2007 only instrument s solar blind channel sbc was operable using side 1 electronics a new power supply for wide angle channel was added during sm 4 but quick tests revealed this did not help high resolution channel wide field channel wfc was returned to service by sts 125 in may 2009 but high resolution channel hrc remains offline on january 8 2019 hubble entered a partial safe mode following suspected hardware problems in its most advanced instrument wide field camera 3 instrument nasa later reported that cause of safe mode within instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range on january 15 2019 nasa stated that cause of failure was a software problem engineering data within telemetry circuits were not accurate in addition all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue after resetting telemetry circuits and associated boards instrument began functioning again on january 17 2019 device was returned to normal operation and on same day it completed its first science observations future orbital decay and controlled reentry thumb illustration of soft capture mechanism scm installed on hubble hubble orbits earth in extremely tenuous upper atmosphere and over time its orbit decays due to drag if not it will re enter earth s atmosphere within some decades with exact date depending on how active sun is and its impact on upper atmosphere if hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re entry parts of main mirror and its support structure would probably survive leaving potential for damage or even human fatalities in 2013 deputy project manager james projected that hubble could survive into 2020s based on solar activity and atmospheric drag or lack thereof a natural atmospheric reentry for hubble will occur between 2028 and 2040 in june 2016 nasa extended service contract for hubble until june 2021 nasa s original plan for safely de orbiting hubble was to retrieve it using a space shuttle hubble would then have most likely been displayed in smithsonian institution this is no longer possible since space shuttle fleet has been retired and would have been unlikely in any case due to cost of mission and risk to crew instead nasa considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re entry ultimately in 2009 as part of servicing mission 4 last servicing mission by space shuttle nasa installed soft capture mechanism scm to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission scm together with relative navigation system rns mounted on shuttle to collect data to enable nasa to pursue numerous options for safe de orbit of hubble constitute soft capture and rendezvous system scrs possible commercial service missions trump administration is considering a proposal by sierra nevada corporation to use a manned version of its dream chaser spacecraft to service hubble some time in 2020s both as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in to be launched james webb space telescope successors visible spectrum range 450 475 495 570 590 620 750 nm there is no direct replacement to hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope because near term space telescopes do not duplicate hubble s wavelength coverage near ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths instead concentrating on farther infrared bands these bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low temperature objects objects generally older and farther away in universe these wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from ground justifying expense of a space based telescope large ground based telescopes can image some of same wavelengths as hubble sometimes challenge hst in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics ao have much larger light gathering power and can be upgraded more easily but cannot yet match hubble s excellent resolution over a wide field of view with very dark background of space plans for a hubble successor materialized as next generation space telescope project which culminated in plans for james webb space telescope jwst formal successor of hubble very different from a scaled up hubble it is designed to operate colder and farther away from earth at l2 lagrangian point where thermal and optical interference from earth and moon are lessened it is not engineered to be fully serviceable such as replaceable instruments but design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft a main scientific goal of jwst is to observe most distant objects in universe beyond reach of existing instruments it is expected to detect stars in early universe approximately 280 million years older than stars hst now detects visual representation telescope is an international collaboration between nasa european space agency and canadian space agency since 1996 and is planned for launch on an ariane 5 rocket although jwst is primarily an infrared instrument its coverage extends down to 600 nm wavelength light or roughly orange in visible spectrum a typical human eye can see to about 750 nm wavelength light so there is some overlap with longest visible wavelength bands including orange and red light left thumb hubble and jwst mirrors 4 5 m2 and 25 m2 respectively a complementary telescope looking at even longer wavelengths than hubble or jwst was european space agency s herschel space observatory launched on may 14 2009 like jwst herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch and had a mirror substantially larger than hubble s but observed only in far infrared and submillimeter it needed helium coolant of which it ran out on april 29 2013 selected space telescopes

astronomy august 2008 a conceptualized optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to hst with ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in visible ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths with substantially better resolution than hubble or spitzer space telescope this effort is being planned for 2025 2035 time frame existing ground based telescopes and various proposed extremely large telescopes can exceed hst in terms of sheer light gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors but other factors affect telescopes in some cases they may be able to match or beat hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics ao however ao on large ground based reflectors will not make hubble and other space telescopes obsolete most ao systems sharpen view over a very narrow field lucky cam for example produces crisp images just 10 to 20 wide whereas hubble s cameras produce crisp images across a 2 1 2 150 field furthermore space telescopes can study universe across entire electromagnetic spectrum most of which is blocked by earth s atmosphere finally background sky is darker in space than on ground because air absorbs solar energy
