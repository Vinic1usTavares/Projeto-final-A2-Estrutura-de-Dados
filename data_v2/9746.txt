papal conclave of 1623 was convened on death of pope gregory xv and ended with election of maffeo barberini as pope urban viii it was first conclave to take place after reforms that gregory xv issued in his 1621 bull aeterni patris filius background after his election gregory xv had reformed papal conclave system with his bull aeterni patris filius of 1621 which was intended to streamline conclave process and this was first papal election to follow these reforms following 1605 conclaves papal elections had become standardized despite not being hereditary typical pope during 200 years following paul v s election that year was around seventy and had been a cardinal for a decade after a career as a canon lawyer popes typically came from second tier nobility of rome or papal states conclave fifty four cardinals participated in conclave following death of gregory xv among them were four spanish cardinals and three german cardinals but none from france cardinals were primarily split in factions between those created by popes before pope paul v was elected in 1605 who numbered thirteen those created by paul who numbered thirty two and those created by gregory xv who numbered nine two cardinals who had most influence over conclave were scipione borghese nephew of paul v and ludovico ludovisi nephew of gregory xv ludovisi attempted to increase his influence over conclave by becoming allies with cardinals who originated from regions controlled by habsburgs borghese had supported pietro campori in previous conclave which had elected gregory xv and campori was his preferred candidate during this conclave as well it was anticipated that campori s age of 66 would be a benefit because a spanish memorandum had revealed that they viewed older cardinals as less likely to develop an independent foreign policy as pope because french influence in this election was not expected to be much borghese anticipated that electing campori pope would be easier since french opposition had been main thing preventing it in previous conclave first scrutiny of conclave was significant because it revealed that gregory xv s reform intended to discourage cardinals from voting for their friends in first round had not been successful second scrutiny revealed to borghese that giovanni mellini was candidate from borghese party that had most support among electors ludovisi was opposed to mellini and he spread rumours amongst cardinals that borghese would rather die than see anyone outside of his faction becoming pope these rumours caused other cardinals to lose good will towards borghese coupled with alleged fact that summer heat had begun to exhaust them election of urban viii after candidates from both major factions had been rejected by electors borghese began to look for neutral candidates including maffeo barberini barberini began openly campaigning for his own election which had not been seen in previous conclaves barberini had been friends with maurice of savoy who served as spokesman for cardinals supporting france during conclave he also received support of ludovisi which caused borghese to oppose him borghese had contracted an illness during conclave and in order to leave he agreed to election of barberini and instructed his cardinals to vote for barberini s election in next scrutiny barberini received enough votes for election but there was one ballot missing cardinals disputed what to do for two hours and eventually barberini requested a second scrutiny which he won with fifty out of fifty four cardinals present relative speed of urban s election has been attributed to summer heat that cardinals were forced to endure during process upon his election barberini took name of urban viii barberini had previously served as papal nuncio to france under paul v and had been created a cardinal because of his service there and his election pleased louis xiii of france during paul v s papacy urban was noted in a series of biographies on potential cardinal electors for being a writer and poet symbol of his family was bee and his election was afterwards said by romans to have been foretold by a swarm of bees entering conclave following election eight cardinals died within two weeks but new pope survived despite catching malaria during conclave notes references external links john paul adams csun sede 1623 retrieved 27 november 2018 category 1623 in papal states category 17th century elections in europe category 1623 in politics 1623 category 17th century catholicism category 1623 in europe
