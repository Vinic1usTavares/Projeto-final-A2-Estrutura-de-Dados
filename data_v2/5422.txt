elsewhere to denote a substance that devas demi gods and asuras demons vie for hiltebeitel 1988 p 320 madeleine biardeau is quoted on page iravan is generally known as aravan aravan also spelt as in

hero of epic background to mahabharata infers a date that is after very early vedic period and before first indian empire was to rise in third century b c so somewhere in eighth or ninth century buitenen 1973 pp xxiv xxv it is generally agreed however that unlike vedas which have to be preserved letter perfect epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style earliest surviving components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than earliest external references to epic which may include an allusion in panini s 4th century grammar manual ashtadhyayi 4 2 56 brockington 1998 p 26 it is estimated that sanskrit text probably reached something of a final form by early gupta period about 4th century ce editor of first great critical edition of mahabharata commented it is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape on basis of an archetype and a stemma codicum what then is possible our objective can only be to reconstruct oldest form of text which it is possible to reach on basis of manuscript material available 1933 prolegomena p lxxxvi emphasis is original thumb left upright a

version of mahabharata records iravan s sanskrit name death during 18 day mahabharata war tamil versions discuss aravan s tamil name ritual self sacrifice to kali before war hiltebeitel relates this to south indian glorification of heroic self mutilation and self decapitation before a goddess hiltebeitel 1988 pp 318 1991 p 284 he takes particular note of a scene towards end of a puranic text devi in interpreting old tamil sculptures depicting a warrior king spilling his own blood as in purana in adoration of a goddess of victory in tamil sculptures goddess is korravai who became associated with durga and hence kali he also finds parallels in telugu legend of sacrifice of is described as son of iravan s cousin ghatotkacha in mahabharata another mahabharata character and its variants in rajasthan see also himachal pradesh garhwal kurukshetra bundelkhand and orissa most notable among similarities between aravan and barbarika is boon to witness entire duration of mahabharata war through eyes of severed head despite sacrifice see hiltebeitel 1999 for parallels with barbarika s 1988 pp 317 18 first account of aravan s sacrifice is found in parata venpa earliest surviving tamil

performed as part of cult of draupadi on 18th day of an annual festival april may to please goddess in modern interpretations aravan s head symbolizes not only self sacrifice but also regeneration and continuity because of his ability to see war after his sacrifice hiltebeitel 1988 p 332 for example iramacamippulavar s merkolvilakka kkatai akaravaricai 1963 which narrates tale of aravan ends with conclusion that aravan continues to live on as a folk hero in tamil nadu because he embodies ideal of self sacrifice shulman 1978 p 132 iramacamippulavar merkolvilakka kkatai akaravaricai madras 1963 1 40 44 aravan is considered to be a representation of cost of war he evokes countless innocent reluctantly sent by their mothers to be consumed by insatiable goddess of war indologist david shulman

in nagaloka protected by his mother but was rejected by his maternal uncle because of latter s hatred of arjuna after reaching maturity iravan hoping to be reunited with his father departs for abode of god indra who is also arjuna s father upon meeting his adult son arjuna requests his assistance in kurukshetra war vogel 1995 pp 75 76 thus iravan finally reaches battlefield of kurukshetra to

to protect him alambusha counters this by assuming form of garuda eagle man eternal foe of serpents and devours serpent army ultimately alambusha kills iravan by cutting off his head though iravan is later avenged when ghatotkacha his cousin finally kills alambusha for mani 1975 p 24 for iravan mani 1975 pp 331 32 bhishma parva 90 56 76 tamil traditions selection as sacrificial victim earliest source of tamil traditions regarding aravan is found in peruntevanar s parata venpa a 9th century tamil version of mahabharata hiltebeitel 1995 p 452 one of features of this work is its reference to a rite it calls kalappali sacrifice to battlefield a term found only in tamil versions of mahabharata this is a ritual performed before battle to ensure victory in peruntevanar s narrative just before mahabharata war duryodhana leader of kauravas and opponent of pandavas learns from pandava s expert astrologer that day of new moon indeed very next day would be most auspicious time for a kalappali consequently duryodhana approaches and convinces aravan to be sacrificial victim for kalappali thumb left upright aravan s ritual self sacrifice was offered to goddess kali pictured to ensure her favour and victory in war for his father arjuna and uncles pandavas alt a reddish bronze statue of a four armed topless woman wearing a short pant sari standing on a pedestal she wears a flaming crown and various ornaments she carries in her hands a goad a noose a bowl and a small broken trident god krishna who is a close friend of and advisor to pandavas hears of duryodhana s plan and devises one of his own to ensure that aravan will give himself as a sacrifice on behalf of pandavas rather than kauravas krishna first discusses issue with yudhishthira dharma or dharmaraja eldest of pandavas recommending sacrifice to kali as a part of an puja worship of weapons krishna establishes that there are four candidates most suited to being offered as victim shalya who is on side of kauravas arjuna commander of pandavas aravan and krishna himself from this shortlist krishna finally narrows best choice down to aravan aravan agrees to undergo kalappali on behalf of pandavas but mentions his prior commitment to duryodhana hiltebeitel 1988 pp 322 1991 pp 284 85 later tamil sources provide variants to peruntevanar s version in villiputuralvar s 14th century version krishna first offers himself as sacrificial victim but aravan volunteers to replace him there is no mention of duryodhana in this version of legend makaparatam of villiputuralvar kalappali 1 8 shulman 1978 p 131 in other accounts aravan is sacrificed in order to counteract kauravas sacrifice of a white elephant in traditions of village of in thanjavur district aravan is described as being so strong that he could slay all at once thus preventing any war from happening so krishna prescribes human sacrifice of aravan in order that greater sacrifice of war can take place shulman 1978 p 133 in performances at time of aravan s sacrifice he is often compared to and bhishma characters in mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual fulfilment for sake of their respective fathers yayati and santanu in drama after acquiring aravan s approval krishna approaches aravan s mother ulupi or serpent maiden in tamil for her consent at first she strongly opposes her son s proposed sacrifice but finally relents when aravan appeals to her explaining that he belongs to kali alone finally in all versions of tale krishna tricks gods surya sun and chandra moon to co ordinate their movements so that day of new moon will fall one day earlier current day this allows aravan to make initial sacrifice of flesh on behalf of pandavas only making rest offering on behalf of duryodhana following day yet fulfilling his promise to duryodhana by doing so three boons in parata venpa aravan asks krishna to grant him boon of a heroic death on battlefield at hands of a great hero although parata venpa mentions only one boon overall tamil tradition preserves a total of three distinct boons associated with aravan single boon of parata venpa according to hiltebeitel indicates an early 9th century effort to harmonize tamil tradition of aravan s pre battle sacrifice with original sanskrit account of his death during battle at hands of alambusha in tamil in both kuttantavar and draupadi cults aravan is believed to have been granted a second boon to see entire 18 day war a second boon is indeed found in villiputuralvar s 14th century version of mahabharata in this version aravan is granted boons of watching battle for a few days and of dying gloriously after killing many enemies though villiputuralvar does not actually specify whether aravan s head survives to see complete battle after his bodily death on eighth day hiltebeitel 1995 p 453 thumb upright in folk tradition krishna is believed to have assumed form of mohini pictured and married aravan alt a black stone sculpture of a young topless standing woman wearing a conical crown with a halo and various ornaments around her waist necklaces bangles bracelets earrings anklets as well as sacred thread her arms are broken two small attendants stand with folded hands near her feet third boon is found only in folk rituals this third boon provides for aravan to be married before sacrifice entitling him to right of cremation and funerary offerings bachelors were buried however no woman wanted to marry aravan fearing inevitable doom of widowhood see also sati in kuttantavar cult version krishna solves this dilemma by taking on his female form mohini enchantress marrying aravan and spending that night with him koovagam version additionally relates krishna s mourning as a widow after aravan s sacrifice next day after which he returns to his original masculine form for duration of war pattanaik 2002 p 87 terukuttu performance presents a stylised wedding ceremony followed by mohini s abrupt departure which is taken to signify that marriage is unconsummated hiltebeitel 1988 p 324 another version popular with transsexuals cites reason behind aravan s wish to be coital bliss and tells explicitly about consummation of marriage goldman 1993 p 388 this third marriage boon is not however uniform across all folk traditions in other legends krishna arranges some other pre war marriages in thanjavur marriage of aravan and mohini is unknown instead it depicts aravan as married to daughter of krishna s younger cousin brother hiltebeitel 1991 p 286 hiltebeitel theorizes that both first heroic death and third marriage boons originated with kuttantavar cult while second boon originated with draupadi cult kuttantavar cult both heroic death and marriage ceremony enacted by thirunangais officially eunuchs in tamil nadu whereas in draupadi cult it is clay head of aravan fixed on a and witnessing re enactment of 18 day war that is prominently ritualized additionally draupadi cult texts from thajavur concentrate only on this second boon omitting other two hiltebeitel 1988 p 1991 p 285 pre battle sacrifice is incompatible with first and second boons but cults have their own explanations self sacrifice prior to war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during war and both are incompatible with living to see full duration of war kuttantavar cult resolves first dilemma holding that aravan s body reconfigured itself after sacrifice and that aravan went on to die a heroic death on eighth day of war kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about second boon of aravan s continued observation of war on other hand draupadi cult are not overly concerned about first boon of heroic death they resolve second dilemma regarding aravan s continued observation of war holding that aravan was able to watch entire war through eyes of his severed head a third view harmonizes all boons holding that aravan s body reconstituted after sacrifice he then fought heroically until being decapitated on eighth day observing remainder of war through eyes of his severed head in any case pre battle sacrifice is common element in tamil traditions after aravan requested and was granted his boons he was ready for sacrifice he proceeds to kurukshetra battlefield while yudhishthira is worshipping kali in his hall of weapons aravan removes his epaulettes and chest plate he then cuts his body into 32 pieces one cut for each of his 32 bodily perfections which are offered by yudhishthira to kali in a terukuttu performance this is depicted by covering actor playing aravan with a white cloth from neck down it is also believed that aravan s spirit may possess actor at this point sometimes a chicken is sacrificed on stage in a terukuttu performance to signify sacrifice hiltebeitel 1988 p 326 in villiputuralvar s retelling an elephant is sacrificed to goddess complementing aravan s own self sacrifice aravan after being stripped of his flesh has only his head and skeleton remaining krishna advises him to pray to naga adi shesha his grandfather and father of ulupi adi shesha coils himself around aravan becomes his flesh and restores his body hiltebeitel 1988 p 329 to fulfil second boon krishna orchestrates heroic death by making one of enemy strong enough to defeat mighty aravan krishna selects alambusha then depending on version of story krishna either advises alambusha to assume form of garuda via a heavenly voice or he sends true garuda to assist alambusha at sight of garuda his perennial eagle adversary shesha in fear leaving aravan unprotected and leading ultimately to alambusha beheading weakened aravan hiltebeitel 1988 p 331 aravan to kuttantavar a traditional story local to koovagam describes how aravan came to be known as kuttantavar after war while pandavas are boasting about vanquishing kauravas krishna asks aravan sole witness of entire war who was truly responsible for winning this war aravan replies that he saw two things krishna s discus decapitating enemy and his conch shell collecting their blood this reply is understood to give all credit for victory to krishna hiltebeitel 1995 pp 455 56 aravan s opinion enrages proud and quick tempered bhima whose influence in deciding outcome of battle is covered at great length in mahabharata however before bhima can wound aravan krishna orders aravan s head to be dropped in river where he assumes form of a child and is eventually found by king of chandragiri a city on river bank child cries kuva kuva when picked up by king who therefore names location kuvakkam koovagam king also names child carapalan reed child tradition goes on to relate that carapalan grew up going on to kill demon kuttacuran who had wounded his adopted father in battle draupadi identified in this tradition with supreme goddess blesses carapalan with new name kuttantavar slayer of kuttacuran and grants him a temple in koovagam there are variants within this tradition some versions give credit for finding child to queen of chandragiri others omit mention of king of chandragiri altogether and omit reference to koovagam temple instead they focus on demon kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted to him that he will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water vishnu incarnated as krishna informs gods that aravan will kill this demon with this in mind head of aravan is consigned to river and is transformed into a child called born from water who kills demon hiltebeitel 1995 pp 464 65 worship following and temples hiltebeitel argues that kuttantavar cult might represent original tamil tradition regarding aravan this aravan kuttantavar cult may well be older than draupadi cult and was almost certainly originally independent of it as it still largely is today hiltebeitel 1988 p 320 however it is no longer only tradition that venerates aravan draupadi cult has developed traditions and rituals of its own most kuttantavar devotees reside in tamil nadu districts of cuddalore
