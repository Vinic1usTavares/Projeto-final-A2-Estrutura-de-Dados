battle of nile also known as battle of aboukir bay was a major naval battle fought between british royal navy and navy of french republic at aboukir bay on mediterranean coast off nile delta of egypt from 1st to 3rd of august 1798 battle was climax of a naval campaign that had raged across mediterranean during previous three months as a large french convoy sailed from toulon to alexandria carrying an expeditionary force under general napoleon bonaparte british fleet was led in battle by rear admiral sir horatio nelson they decisively defeated french under vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers bonaparte sought to invade egypt as first step in a campaign against british india part of a greater effort to drive britain out of french revolutionary wars as bonaparte s fleet crossed mediterranean it was pursued by a british force under nelson who had been sent from british fleet in tagus to learn purpose of french expedition and to defeat it he chased french for more than two months on several occasions missing them only by a matter of hours bonaparte was aware of nelson s pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination he was able to capture malta and then land in egypt without interception by british naval forces with french army ashore french fleet anchored in aboukir bay northeast of alexandria commander vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position british fleet arrived off egypt on 1 august and discovered brueys s dispositions and nelson ordered an immediate attack his ships advanced on french line and split into two divisions as they approached one cut across head of line and passed between anchored french and shore while other engaged seaward side of french fleet trapped in a crossfire leading french warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three hour battle while centre succeeded in repelling initial british attack as british reinforcements arrived centre came under renewed assault and at 22 00 french flagship orient exploded rear division of french fleet attempted to break out of bay with brueys dead and his vanguard and centre defeated but only two ships of line and two frigates escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged battle reversed strategic situation between two nations forces in mediterranean and entrenched royal navy in dominant position that it retained for rest of war it also encouraged other european countries to turn against france and was a factor in outbreak of war of second coalition bonaparte s army was trapped in egypt and royal navy dominance off syrian coast contributed significantly to french defeat at siege of acre in 1799 which preceded bonaparte s return to europe nelson had been wounded in battle and he was proclaimed a hero across europe and was subsequently made baron nelson although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards his captains were also highly praised and went on to form nucleus of legendary nelson s band of brothers legend of battle has remained prominent in popular consciousness with perhaps best known representation being felicia hemans 1826 poem casabianca background napoleon bonaparte s victories in northern italy over austrian empire helped secure victory for french in war of first coalition in 1797 and great britain remained only major european power still at war with french republic maffeo p 224 french directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter british opposition including projected invasions of ireland and britain and expansion of french navy to challenge royal navy at sea james p 113 despite significant efforts british control of northern european waters rendered these ambitions impractical in short term padfield p 116 and royal navy remained firmly in control of atlantic ocean however french navy was dominant in mediterranean following withdrawal of british fleet after outbreak of war between britain and spain in 1796 keegan p 36 this allowed bonaparte to propose an invasion of egypt as an alternative to confronting britain directly believing that british would be too distracted by an imminent irish uprising to intervene in mediterranean rose p 141 bonaparte believed that by establishing a permanent presence in egypt nominally part of neutral ottoman empire french would obtain a staging point for future operations against british india possibly in conjunction with tipu sultan of seringapatam that might successfully drive british out of war adkins p 7 campaign would sever chain of communication that connected britain with india an essential part of british empire whose trade generated wealth that britain required to prosecute war successfully maffeo p 230 french directory agreed with bonaparte s plans although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see politically ambitious bonaparte and fiercely loyal veterans of his italian campaigns travel as far from france as possible rodger p 457 during spring of 1798 bonaparte assembled more than 35 000 soldiers in mediterranean france and italy and developed a powerful fleet at toulon he also formed commission des sciences et des arts a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a french colony in egypt cole p 17 napoleon kept destination of expedition top secret most of army s officers did not know of its target and bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until first stage of expedition was complete cole p 11 mediterranean campaign thumb upright rear admiral sir horatio nelson lemuel francis

sicily on 7 june clowes p 353 on 9 june fleet arrived off malta then under ownership of knights of st john of jerusalem ruled by grand master ferdinand von hompesch zu bolheim cole p 8 bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to fortified harbour of valletta when knights refused french general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of maltese islands overrunning defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing gardiner p 21 knights formally surrendered on 12 june and in exchange for substantial financial compensation handed islands and all of their resources over to bonaparte including extensive property of roman catholic church on malta james p 151 within a week bonaparte had resupplied his ships and on 19 june his fleet departed for alexandria in direction of crete leaving 4 000 men at valletta under general claude henri vaubois to ensure french control of islands adkins p 13 while bonaparte was sailing to malta royal navy re entered mediterranean for first time in more than a year alarmed by reports of french preparations on mediterranean coast lord spencer at admiralty sent a message to vice admiral earl st vincent commander of mediterranean fleet based in tagus to despatch a squadron to investigate maffeo p 233 this squadron consisting of three ships of line and three frigates was entrusted to rear admiral sir horatio nelson nelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two spanish ships of line at battle of cape st vincent in february 1797 in july 1797 he lost an arm at battle of santa cruz de tenerife and had been forced to return to britain to recuperate padfield p 109 returning to fleet at tagus in late april 1798 he was ordered to collect squadron stationed at gibraltar and sail for ligurian sea james p 148 on 21 may as nelson s squadron approached toulon it was struck by a fierce gale and nelson s flagship hms vanguard lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on corsican coast keegan p 44 remainder of squadron was scattered ships of line sheltered at san pietro island off sardinia frigates were blown to west and failed to return adkins p 9 on 7 june following hasty repairs to his flagship a fleet consisting of ten ships of line and a fourth rate joined nelson off toulon fleet under command of captain thomas troubridge had been sent by earl st vincent to reinforce nelson with orders that he was to pursue and intercept toulon convoy maffeo p 241 although he now had enough ships to challenge french fleet nelson suffered two great disadvantages he had no intelligence regarding destination of french and no frigates to scout ahead of his force clowes p 354 striking southwards in hope of collecting information about french movements nelson s ships stopped at elba and naples where british ambassador sir william hamilton reported that french fleet had passed sicily headed in direction of malta gardiner p 29 despite pleas from nelson and hamilton king ferdinand of naples refused to lend his frigates to british fleet fearing french reprisals bradford p 176 on 22 june a brig sailing from ragusa brought nelson news that french had sailed eastwards from malta on 16 june mostert p 254 after conferring with his captains admiral decided that french target must be egypt and set off in pursuit keegan p 55 incorrectly believing french to be five days ahead rather than two nelson insisted on a direct route to alexandria without deviation rodger p 459 on evening of 22 june nelson s fleet passed french in darkness overtaking slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target maffeo p 258 making rapid time on a direct route nelson reached alexandria on 28 june and discovered that french were not there james p 154 after a meeting with suspicious ottoman commander sayyid muhammad kurayyim nelson ordered british fleet northwards reaching coast of anatolia on 4 july and turning westwards back towards sicily keegan p 59 nelson had missed french by less than a day scouts of french fleet arrived off alexandria in evening of 29 june gardiner p 26 concerned by his near encounter with nelson bonaparte ordered an immediate invasion his troops coming ashore in a poorly managed amphibious operation in which at least 20 drowned adkins p 17 marching along coast french army stormed alexandria and captured city cole p 22 after which bonaparte led main force of his army inland clowes p 356 he instructed his naval commander vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers to anchor in alexandria harbour but naval surveyors reported that channel into harbour was too shallow and narrow for larger ships of french fleet adkins p 21 as a result french selected an alternative anchorage at aboukir bay northeast of alexandria mostert p 257 nelson s fleet reached syracuse in sicily on 19 july and took on essential supplies james p 155 there admiral wrote letters describing events of previous months it is an old saying devil s children have devil s luck i cannot find or at this moment learn beyond vague conjecture where french fleet are gone to all my ill fortune hitherto has proceeded from want of frigates adkins p 19 meanwhile french were securing egypt by battle of pyramids by 24 july british fleet was resupplied and having determined that french must be somewhere in eastern mediterranean nelson sailed again in direction of morea maffeo p 265 on 28 july at coron nelson finally obtained intelligence describing french attack on egypt and turned south across mediterranean his scouts hms alexander and hms swiftsure sighted french transport fleet at alexandria on afternoon of 1 august clowes p 355 aboukir bay when alexandria harbour had proved inadequate for his fleet brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options bonaparte had ordered fleet to anchor in aboukir bay a shallow and exposed anchorage but had supplemented orders with suggestion that if aboukir bay was too dangerous brueys could sail north to corfu leaving only transports and a handful of lighter warships at alexandria rose p 142 brueys refused in belief that his squadron could provide essential support to french army on shore and called his captains aboard his 120 gun flagship orient to discuss their response should nelson discover fleet in its anchorage despite vocal opposition from contre amiral armand blanquet bradford p 199 who insisted that fleet would be best able to respond in open water rest of captains agreed that anchoring in a line of battle inside bay presented strongest tactic for confronting nelson james p 159 it is possible that bonaparte envisaged aboukir bay as a temporary anchorage on 27 july he expressed expectation that brueys had already transferred his ships to alexandria and three days later he issued orders for fleet to make for corfu in preparation for naval operations against ottoman

mouths of river nile empties into mediterranean maffeo p 268 269 in 1798 bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals which ran into bay from a promontory guarded by aboukir castle a small fort situated on an island among rocks protected shoals clowes p 357 fort was garrisoned by french soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy mortars james p 160 brueys had augmented fort with his bomb vessels and gunboats anchored among rocks to west of island in a position to give support to head of french line further shoals ran unevenly to south of island and extended across bay in a rough semicircle approximately from shore clowes p 358 these shoals were too shallow to permit passage of larger warships and so brueys ordered his thirteen ships of line to form up in a line of battle following northeastern edge of shoals to south of island a position that allowed ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering landings with their starboard batteries gardiner p 31 orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to bow and stern of their neighbours which would effectively turn line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier warner p 66 brueys positioned a second inner line of four frigates approximately west of main line roughly halfway between line and shoal van of french line was led by guerrier positioned southeast of aboukir island and about from edge of shoals that surrounded island line stretched southeast with centre bowed seawards away from shoal french ships were spaced at intervals of and whole line was long clowes p 359 with flagship orient at centre and two large 80 gun ships anchored on either side mostert p 260 rear division of line was under command of contre amiral pierre charles villeneuve in guillaume tell in deploying his ships in this way brueys hoped that british would be forced by shoals to attack his strong centre and rear allowing his van to use prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack british once they were engaged padfield p 120 however he had made a serious misjudgement he had left enough room between guerrier and shoals for an enemy ship to cut across head of french line and proceed between shoals and french ships allowing unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships compounding this error

and break french line gardiner p 13 furthermore not all of french captains had followed brueys orders to attach cables to their neighbours bow and stern which would have prevented such a manoeuvre keegan p 63 problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at bow which allowed ships to swing with wind and widened gaps it also created areas within french line not covered by broadside of any ship british vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage french without reply in addition deployment of brueys fleet prevented rear from effectively supporting van due to prevailing winds clowes p 372 a more pressing problem for brueys was a lack of food and water for fleet bonaparte had unloaded almost all of provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching ships from shore to remedy this brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along coast to requisition food dig wells and collect water constant attacks by bedouin partisans however required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party hence up to a third of fleet s sailors were away from their ships at any one time mostert p 261 brueys wrote a letter describing situation to minister of marine etienne eustache bruix reporting that our crews are weak both in number and quality our rigging in general out of repair and i am sure it requires no little courage to undertake management of a fleet furnished with such tools adkins p 22 battle nelson s arrival thumb battle of nile augt 1st 1798 thomas whitcombe 1816 national maritime museum british fleet bears down on french line alt an engraved print showing a

scouting operations at alexandria and so were to west of main fleet out of sight adkins p 23 troubridge s ship hms culloden was also some distance from main body towing a captured merchant ship at sight of french troubridge abandoned vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin nelson due to need for so many sailors to work onshore brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts which left him unable to react swiftly to sudden appearance of british rodger p 460 as his ships readied for action brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on orient and hastily recalled his shore parties although most had still not returned by start of battle to replace them large numbers of men were taken out of frigates and distributed among ships of line brueys also hoped to lure british fleet onto shoals at aboukir island sending brigs alerte and to act as decoys in shallow waters by 16 00 alexander and swiftsure were also in sight although some distance from main british fleet brueys gave orders to abandon plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail mostert p 265 blanquet protested order on grounds that there were not enough men aboard french ships to both sail ships and man guns warner p 72 nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down to allow british fleet to approach in a more organised formation this convinced brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters british were planning to wait for following day he rescinded his earlier order to sail bradford p 200 brueys may have been hoping that delay would allow him to slip past british during night and thus follow bonaparte s orders not to engage british fleet directly if he could avoid it james p 161 nelson ordered fleet to slow down at 16 00 to allow his ships to rig springs on their anchor cables a system of attaching bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary it also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced risk of coming under raking fire clowes p 360 nelson s plan shaped through discussion with his senior captains during return voyage to alexandria was to advance on french and pass down seaward side of van and centre of french line so that each french ship would face two british ships and massive orient would be fighting against three james p 162 direction of wind meant that french rear division would be unable to join battle easily and would be cut off from front portions of line to ensure that in smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at head of their mizzen mast and hoist an illuminated white ensign which was different enough from french tricolour that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility reducing risk that british ships might fire on one another in darkness james p 166 as his ship was readied for

ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action he sent alerte ahead which passed close to leading british ships and then steered sharply to west over shoal in hope that ships of line might follow and become grounded none of nelson s captains fell for ruse and british fleet continued undeterred at 17 30 nelson hailed one of his two leading ships hms zealous under captain samuel hood which had been racing goliath to be first to fire on french admiral ordered hood to establish safest course into harbour british had no charts of depth or shape of bay except a rough sketch map swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain an inaccurate british atlas on zealous maffeo p 269 and a 35 year old french map aboard goliath adkins p 24 hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test depth of water clowes p 361 and that if you will allow honour of leading you into battle i will keep lead going bradford p 202 shortly afterwards nelson paused to speak with brig hms mutine whose commander lieutenant thomas hardy had seized some maritime pilots from a small alexandrine vessel padfield p 123 as vanguard came to a stop following ships slowed this caused a gap to open up between zealous and goliath and rest of fleet to counter this effect nelson ordered hms theseus under captain ralph miller to pass his flagship and join zealous and

minutes after french opened fire goliath ignoring fire from fort to starboard and from guerrier to port most of which was too high to trouble ship crossed head of french line captain thomas foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between guerrier and shallow water of shoal on his own initiative foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through gap as bow of guerrier came within range goliath opened fire inflicting severe damage with a double shotted raking broadside as british ship turned to port and passed down unprepared port side of guerrier foley s royal marines and a company of austrian grenadiers joined attack firing their muskets warner p 102 foley had intended to anchor alongside french ship and engage it closely but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed guerrier entirely mostert p 266 goliath eventually stopped close to bow of conquerant opening fire on new opponent and using unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with frigate serieuse and bomb vessel hercule which were anchored inshore of battle line foley s attack was followed by hood in zealous who also crossed french line and successfully anchored next to guerrier in space foley had intended engaging lead ship s bow from close range adkins p 25 within five minutes guerrier s foremast had fallen

hastily launching their boats they returned to their vessels captain jean francois timothee trullet of guerrier shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on zealous third british ship into action was hms orion under captain sir james saumarez which rounded engagement at head of battle line and passed between french main line and frigates that lay closer inshore padfield p 124 as he did so frigate serieuse opened fire on orion wounding two men convention in naval warfare of time was that ships of line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage but in firing first french captain claude jean martin had negated rule saumarez waited until frigate was at close range before replying adkins p 26 orion needed just one broadside to reduce frigate to a wreck and martin s disabled ship drifted away over shoal during delay this detour caused two other british ships joined battle theseus which had been disguised as a first rate ship warner p 109

fire had ascended rigging and set vast sails alight nearest british ships swiftsure alexander and orion all stopped firing closed their gunports and began edging away from burning ship in anticipation of detonation of enormous ammunition supplies stored on board in addition they took crews away from guns to form fire parties and to soak sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires likewise french ships tonnant heureux and mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from burning ship keegan p 65 at 22 00 fire reached magazines and orient was destroyed by a massive explosion concussion of blast was powerful enough to rip open seams of nearest ships and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle much of it flying directly over surrounding ships into sea beyond james p 171 falling wreckage started fires on swiftsure alexander and franklin although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing flames despite a secondary explosion on franklin mostert p 271 left thumb battle of nile thomas luny 1834 alt a confused naval battle two battered ships drift in foreground while smoke and flames boil from a third in background smoke rises from a confused melee of battling ships it has never been firmly established how fire on orient broke out but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on poop deck instead of being properly stowed after painting of ship s hull had been completed shortly before battle burning wadding from one of british ships is believed to have floated onto poop deck and ignited paint fire rapidly spread through admiral s cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air alternatively fleet captain honore ganteaume later reported cause as an explosion on quarterdeck preceded by a series of minor fires on main deck among ship s boats adkins p 34 whatever its origin fire spread rapidly through ship s rigging unchecked by fire pumps aboard which had been smashed by british shot adkins p 35 a second blaze then began at bow trapping hundreds of sailors in ship s waist mostert p 270 subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over of seabed and evidence that ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after other hundreds of men dove into sea to escape flames but fewer than 100 survived blast british boats picked up approximately 70 survivors including wounded staff officer leonard bernard motard a few others including ganteaume managed to reach shore on rafts remainder of crew numbering more than 1 000 men were killed including captain casabianca and his son mostert p 269 thumb battle of nile augt 1st 1798 thomas whitcombe 1816 national maritime museum climax of battle as orient explodes for ten minutes after explosion there was no firing sailors from both sides were either too shocked by blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue fight during lull nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from water around remains of orient at 22 10 franklin restarted engagement by firing on swiftsure gardiner p 36 isolated and battered blanquet s ship was soon dismasted and admiral suffering a severe head wound was forced to surrender by combined firepower of swiftsure and defence clowes p 367 more than half of franklin s crew had been killed or wounded by midnight only tonnant remained engaged as commodore aristide aubert du petit thouars continued his fight with majestic and fired on swiftsure when british ship moved within range by 03 00 after more than three hours of close quarter combat majestic had lost its main and mizzen masts while tonnant was a dismasted hulk although captain du petit thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command insisting on having tricolour nailed to mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position propped up on deck in a bucket of wheat under his guidance battered tonnant gradually drifted southwards away from action to join southern division under villeneuve who failed to bring these ships into effective action james p 172 throughout engagement french rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on battling ships ahead only noticeable effect was smashing of rudder by misdirected fire from neighbouring genereux germani p 60 morning as sun rose at 04 00 on 2 august firing broke out once again between french southern division of guillaume tell tonnant genereux and timoleon and battered alexander and majestic clowes p 368 although briefly outmatched british ships were soon joined by goliath and theseus as captain miller manoeuvred his ship into position theseus briefly came under fire from frigate artemise miller turned his ship towards artemise but captain pierre jean standelet struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon frigate miller sent a boat under lieutenant william hoste to take possession of empty vessel but standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and artemise blew up shortly afterwards warner p 111 surviving french ships of line covering their retreat with gunfire gradually pulled to east away from shore at 06 00 zealous pursued and was able to prevent frigate justice from boarding bellerophon which was anchored at southern point of bay undergoing hasty repairs two other french ships still flew tricolour but neither was in a position to either retreat or fight when heureux and mercure had cut their anchor cables to escape exploding orient their crews had panicked and neither captain both of whom were wounded had managed to regain control of his ship as a result both vessels had drifted onto shoal germani p 61 alexander goliath theseus and leander attacked stranded and defenceless ships and both surrendered within minutes distractions provided by heureux mercure and justice allowed villeneuve to bring most of surviving french ships to mouth of bay at 11 00 on dismasted tonnant commodore du petit thouars was now dead from his wounds and thrown overboard at his own request adkins p 30 as ship was unable to make required speed it was driven ashore by its crew timoleon was too far south to escape with villeneuve and in attempting to join survivors had also grounded on shoal force of impact dislodged ship s foremast mostert p 272 remaining

ship off shoal at 02 00 found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than of water an hour emergency repairs to hull and fashioning a replacement rudder from a spare topmast took most of next two days james p 178 on morning of 3 august nelson sent theseus and leander to force surrender of grounded tonnant and timoleon tonnant its decks crowded with 1 600 survivors from other french vessels surrendered as british ships approached while timoleon was set on fire by its remaining crew who then escaped to shore in small boats adkins p 37 timoleon exploded shortly after midday

with some accuracy in immediate aftermath as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded although number of wounded who subsequently died is not known ships that suffered most were bellerophon with 201 casualties and majestic with 193 other than culloden lightest loss was on zealous which had one man killed and seven wounded casualty list included captain westcott five lieutenants and ten junior officers among dead and admiral nelson captains saumarez ball and darby and six lieutenants wounded other than culloden only british ships seriously damaged in their hulls were bellerophon majestic and vanguard bellerophon and majestic were only ships to lose masts majestic main and mizzen and bellerophon all three clowes p 369 french casualties are harder to calculate but were significantly higher estimates of french losses range from 2 000 to 5 000 with a suggested median point of 3 500 which includes more than 1 000 captured wounded and nearly 2 000 killed half of whom died on orient in addition to admiral brueys killed and admiral blanquet wounded four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded french ships suffered severe damage two ships of line and two frigates were destroyed as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew warner p 121 and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again of remaining prizes only three were ever sufficiently repaired

st vincent carried by captain edward berry james p 182 over next few days british landed all but 200 of captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of parole although bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army james p 183 wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board vanguard where nelson regularly entertained them at dinner historian joseph allen recounts that on one occasion nelson whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound offered toothpicks to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a snuff box to an officer whose nose had been torn off causing much embarrassment allen p 213 on 8 august fleet s boats stormed aboukir island which surrendered without a fight landing party removed four of guns and destroyed rest along with fort they were mounted in renaming island nelson s island on 10 august nelson sent lieutenant thomas duval from zealous with messages to government in india duval travelled across

frigates hms emerald under captain thomas moutray waller and hms alcmene under captain george johnstone hope and sloop hms bonne citoyenne under captain robert retalick arrived off alexandria initially british mistook frigate squadron for french warships and swiftsure chased them away they returned following day once error had been realised same day as frigates arrived nelson sent mutine to britain with dispatches under command of lieutenant thomas bladen capel who had replaced hardy after latter s promotion to captain of vanguard on 14 august nelson sent orion majestic bellerophon

to reach mouth of bay finally sailing into open water on 15 august on 16 august british burned and destroyed grounded prize heureux as no longer fit for service and on 18 august also burned guerrier and mercure on 19 august nelson sailed for naples with vanguard culloden and alexander leaving hood in command of zealous goliath swiftsure and recently joined frigates to watch over french activities at alexandria james p 184 first message to reach bonaparte regarding disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 august at his camp on road between and cairo messenger was a staff officer sent by governor of alexandria general jean baptiste kleber and report had been hastily written by admiral ganteaume who had subsequently rejoined villeneuve s ships at sea one account reports that when he was handed message bonaparte read it without emotion before calling messenger to him and demanding further details when messenger had finished french general reportedly announced nous n avons plus de flotte eh bien il faut en ces contrees ou en grands comme les anciens we no longer have a fleet well we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as ancients another story as told by general s secretary claims that bonaparte was almost overcome by news and exclaimed unfortunate brueys what have you done bonaparte later placed much of blame for defeat on wounded admiral blanquet falsely accusing him of surrendering franklin while his ship was undamaged protestations from ganteaume and minister etienne eustache bruix later reduced degree of criticism blanquet faced but he never again served in a command capacity bonaparte s most immediate concern however was with his own officers who began to question wisdom of entire expedition inviting his most senior officers to dinner bonaparte asked them how they were when they replied that they were marvellous bonaparte responded that it was just as well since he would have them shot if they continued fostering mutinies and preaching revolt cole p 111 to quell any uprising among native inhabitants egyptians overheard discussing battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out cole p 112 reaction nelson s first set of dispatches were captured when leander was intercepted and defeated by genereux in a fierce engagement off western shore of crete on 18 august 1798 as a result reports of battle did not reach britain until capel arrived in mutine on 2 october clowes p 373 entering admiralty at 11 15 and personally delivering news to lord spencer warner p 147 who collapsed unconscious when he heard report although nelson had previously been castigated in press for failing to intercept french fleet rumours of battle had begun to arrive in britain from continent in late september and news capel brought was greeted with celebrations right across country maffeo p 277 within four days nelson had been elevated to baron nelson of nile and burnham thorpe a title with which he was privately dissatisfied believing his actions deserved better reward jordan p 219 king george iii addressed houses of parliament on 20 november with words saumarez s convoy of prizes stopped first at malta where saumarez provided assistance to a rebellion on island among maltese population gardiner p 67 it then sailed to gibraltar arriving on 18 october to cheers of garrison saumarez wrote that we can never do justice to warmth of their applause and praises they all bestowed on our squadron on 23 october following transfer of wounded to military hospital and provision of basic supplies convoy sailed on towards lisbon leaving bellerophon and majestic behind for more extensive repairs musteen p 20 peuple souverain also remained at gibraltar ship was deemed too badly damaged for atlantic voyage to britain and so was converted to a guardship under name of hms guerrier remaining prizes underwent basic repairs and then sailed for britain spending some months at tagus and joining with annual merchant convoy from portugal in june 1799 under escort of a squadron commanded by admiral sir alan gardner james p 265 before eventually arriving at plymouth their age and battered state meant that neither conquerant nor aquilon were considered fit for active service in royal navy and both were subsequently hulked although they had been bought into service for ps20 000 equivalent of ps as of each as hms conquerant and hms aboukir to provide a financial reward to crews that had captured them james p 185 similar sums were also paid out for guerrier mercure heureux and peuple souverain while other captured ships were worth considerably more constructed of adriatic oak tonnant had been built in 1792 and franklin and spartiate were less than a year old tonnant and spartiate both of which later fought at battle of trafalgar joined royal navy under their old names while franklin considered to be finest two decked ship in world was renamed hms canopus total value of prizes captured at

his return to naples nelson was greeted with a triumphal procession led by king ferdinand iv and sir william hamilton and was introduced for only third time to sir william s wife emma lady hamilton who fainted violently at meeting adkins p 40 and apparently took several weeks to recover from her injuries bradford p 212 lauded as a hero by neapolitan court nelson was later to dabble in neapolitan politics and become duke of bronte actions for which he was criticised by his superiors and his reputation suffered gardiner p 41 british general john moore who met nelson in naples at this time described him as covered with stars medals and ribbons more like a prince of opera than conqueror of nile padfield p 135 rumours of a battle first appeared in french press as early as 7 august although credible reports did not arrive until 26 august and even these claimed that nelson was dead and bonaparte a british prisoner germani p 56 when news became certain french press insisted that defeat was result both of an overwhelmingly large british force and unspecified traitors among anti government journals in france defeat was blamed on incompetence of french directory and on supposed lingering royalist sentiments in navy germani p 63 villeneuve came under scathing attack on his return to france for his failure to support brueys during battle in his defence he pleaded that wind had been against him and that brueys had not issued orders for him to counterattack british fleet mostert p 275 writing many years later bonaparte commented that if french navy had adopted same tactical principles as british by contrast british press were jubilant many newspapers sought to portray battle as a victory for britain over anarchy and success was used to attack supposedly pro republican whig politicians charles james fox and richard brinsley sheridan germani p 67 there has been extensive historiographical debate over comparative strengths of fleets although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size each containing 13 ships of line cole p 108 however loss of culloden relative sizes of orient and leander and participation in action by two of french frigates and several smaller vessels as well as theoretical strength of french position leads most historians to conclusion that french were marginally more powerful this is accentuated by weight of broadside of several of french ships spartiate franklin orient tonnant and guillaume tell were each significantly larger than any individual british ship in battle however inadequate deployment reduced crews and failure of rear division under villeneuve to meaningfully participate all contributed to french defeat james p 179 effects battle of nile has been called arguably most decisive naval engagement of great age of sail maffeo p 272 and most splendid and glorious success which british navy gained clowes p 371 historian and novelist c s forester writing in 1929 compared nile to great naval actions in history and concluded that it still only stands rivalled by tsu shima as an example of annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force forester p 120 effect on strategic situation in mediterranean was immediate reversing balance of conflict and giving british control at sea that they maintained for remainder of war mostert p 274 destruction of french mediterranean fleet allowed royal navy to return to sea in force as british squadrons set up blockades off french and allied ports in particular british ships cut malta off from france aided by rebellion among native maltese population that forced french garrison to retreat to valletta and shut gates james p 189 ensuing siege of malta lasted for two years before defenders were finally starved into surrender gardiner p 70 in 1799 british ships harassed bonaparte s army as it marched east and north through palestine and played a crucial part in bonaparte s defeat at siege of acre when barges carrying siege train were captured and french storming parties were bombarded by british ships anchored offshore rose p 144 it was during one of these latter engagements that captain miller of theseus was killed in an ammunition explosion james p 294 defeat at acre forced bonaparte to retreat to egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in middle east gardiner p 62 french general returned to france without his army late in year leaving kleber in command of egypt chandler p 226 ottomans with whom bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of egypt was complete were encouraged by battle of nile to go to war against france rodger p 461 this led to a series of campaigns that slowly sapped strength from french army trapped in egypt british victory also encouraged austrian empire and russian empire both of whom were mustering armies as part of a second coalition which declared war on france in 1799 with mediterranean undefended a russian fleet entered ionian sea while austrian armies recaptured much of italian territory lost to bonaparte in previous war gardiner p 14 without their best general and his veterans french suffered a series of defeats and it was not until bonaparte returned to become first consul that france once again held a position of strength on mainland europe maffeo p 275 in 1801 a british expeditionary force defeated demoralised remains of french army in egypt royal navy used its dominance in mediterranean to invade egypt without fear of ambush while anchored off egyptian coast gardiner p 78 in spite of overwhelming british victory in climactic battle campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for france historian edward ingram noted that if nelson had successfully intercepted bonaparte at sea as ordered ensuing battle could have annihilated both french fleet and transports as it was bonaparte was free to continue war in middle east and later to return to europe personally unscathed ingram p 142 potential of a successful engagement at sea to change course of history is underscored by list of french army officers carried aboard convoy who later formed core of generals and marshals under emperor napoleon in addition to bonaparte himself louis alexandre berthier auguste de marmont jean lannes joachim murat louis desaix jean reynier antoine francois andreossy jean junot louis nicolas davout and dumas were all passengers on cramped mediterranean crossing maffeo p 259 legacy battle of nile remains one of royal navy s most famous victories jordan rogers p 216 and has remained prominent in british popular imagination sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons paintings poems and plays germani p 69 one of best known poems about battle is casabianca which was written by felicia dorothea hemans in 1826 and describes a fictional account of death of captain casabianca s son on orient monuments were raised including cleopatra s needle in london muhammad ali of egypt gave monument in 1819 in recognition of battle of 1798 and campaign of 1801 but great britain did not erect it on victoria embankment until 1878 baker p 93 another memorial nile clumps near amesbury consists of stands of beech trees purportedly planted by lord queensbury at behest of lady hamilton and thomas hardy after nelson s death trees form a plan of battle each clump represents position of a british or french ship a similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near alnwick by nelson s agent alexander davison composer joseph haydn had just completed missa in angustiis mass for troubled times after napoleon bonaparte had defeated austrian army in four major battles well received news of france s defeat at nile however resulted in mass gradually acquiring nickname lord nelson mass title became indelible when in 1800 nelson himself visited palais esterhazy accompanied by his mistress lady hamilton and may have heard mass performed deutsch pp 60 62 royal navy commemorated battle with ship names hms aboukir and hms nile and in 1998 commemorated 200th anniversary of battle with a visit to aboukir bay by modern frigate hms somerset whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in battle archaeology although nelson biographer ernle bradford assumed in 1977 that remains of orient are almost certainly unrecoverable bradford p 208 first archaeological investigation into battle began in 1983 when a french survey team under jacques dumas discovered wreck of french flagship franck goddio later took over work leading a major project to explore bay in 1998 he found that material was scattered over an area in diameter in addition to military and nautical equipment goddio recovered a large number of gold and silver coins from countries across mediterranean some from 17th century it is likely that these were part of treasure taken from malta that was lost in explosion aboard orient in 2000 italian archaeologist paolo gallo led an excavation focusing on ancient ruins on nelson s island it uncovered a number of graves that date from battle as well as others buried there during 1801 invasion these graves which included a woman and three children were relocated in 2005 to a cemetery at in alexandria reburial was attended by sailors from modern frigate hms chatham and a band from egyptian navy as well as a descendant of only identified burial
