reticulate whipray or honeycomb stingray himantura uarnak is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae it inhabits coastal and brackish waters across indo pacific region from south africa to taiwan to australia favoring sandy habitats a large species reaching in width reticulate whipray has a diamond shaped pectoral fin disc and an extremely long tail without fin folds both its common and scientific names refer to its ornate dorsal color pattern of many small close set dark spots or reticulations on a lighter background however reticulate whipray is only one of several large spotted stingrays in indo pacific which coupled with variability of its coloration with age and locality has resulted in a great deal of taxonomic confusion often encountered resting on bottom during daytime reticulate whipray is a predator of bottom dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes like other stingrays it is aplacental viviparous with developing embryos nourished at first by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk females bear litters of up to five pups in summer following a gestation period of a year reticulate whipray is fished in southeast asia and parts of indian ocean for meat skin cartilage and other purposes it is highly susceptible to population depletion because of its large size inshore habits and low reproductive rate and is additionally threatened by extensive habitat degradation consequently international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as vulnerable taxonomy and phylogeny in 1775 carsten niebuhr published descriptiones animalium avium piscium insectorum quae in itinere orientali observavit work of his late friend swedish naturalist peter forsskal within forsskal had described raja sephen now commonly known as cowtail stingray with a spotted variant he called uarnak which is arabic name stingrays on red sea shores no type specimen was designated forsskal s account formed basis for two subsequent writings that named spotted ray as a distinct species pierre joseph bonnaterre s raia in 1788 and johann friedrich gmelin s raja uarnak in 1789 although bonnaterre s name was published first and thus would have had precedence later authorities have regarded forsskal s uarnak as earliest available name even though it was not initially part of a binomial consequently modern sources give uarnak as valid specific epithet and either gmelin or forsskal as species authority in 1837 johannes peter muller and friedrich gustav jakob henle included reticulate whipray in newly created genus himantura david starr jordan and barton warren made it type species in 1896 reticulate whipray is closely related to h undulata and h leoparda which share much of its range as well as recently described h previously confused with h leoparda and h australis all five species are very similar in size and shape and their colour patterns may overlap to some extent resulting in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled in 2004 mabel manjaji described uarnak species complex containing h fai h h h leoparda h toshi h uarnak and h undulata plus three more undescribed species reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray leopard stingray longtail stingray and marbled stingray some of these names are shared by other similar species description thumb upright 1 2 left alt a stingray with many small dark spots and a thin black tail reticulate whipray has a dorsal color pattern of many small dark spots pectoral fin disc of reticulate whipray is diamond shaped and wider than long with leading margins almost straight and snout and outer corners angular in juveniles disc is about as wide as long with a more obtuse snout and rounded corners eyes are small and immediately followed by spiracles paired respiratory openings a short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between long thin nostrils mouth is relatively small with a deep concavity at center of lower jaw and shallow furrows at corners extending onto lower jaw a row of 4 5 papillae nipple like structures is found across floor of mouth there are 26 40 upper tooth rows and 27 44 lower tooth rows pelvic fins are small and triangular tail is whip like and extremely thin measuring 3 3 5 times as long as disc when intact and lacks fin folds usually one serrated stinging spine is located on upper surface on tail some distance from base adult rays have a wide band of flattened heart shaped dermal denticles that extend from between eyes to tail spine increasing in density with age along with two large pearl thorns at center of back tail behind spine is covered by small thorns dorsal band of denticles is largely developed by time juveniles are across coloration of reticulate whipray varies substantially with age and locality adults generally have a dorsal pattern of numerous closely spaced dark brown spots or reticulations on a beige to yellow brown background which becomes blackish past spine with lighter bands on sides underside is pale without markings juveniles are yellowish above with tiny densely packed dark spots around seven spots in a line between spiracles and three rows of spots in front of sting this large species has been reported to reach a disc width of a total length of and a weight of distribution and habitat thumb alt a dark spotted stingray swimming over a sandy bottom reticulate whipray frequents areas with fine sediment reticulate whipray occurs widely in indo pacific with a range extending from off eastern south africa to arabian peninsula westward along coast of indian subcontinent to southeast asia and reaching as far as taiwan and ryukyu islands to north and new guinea and northern australia to southeast it has also colonized eastern mediterranean sea through suez canal i e it is a lessepsian migrant and it is now common in south eastern mediterranean this species seems to be common only in australian waters where it occurs from shark bay to brisbane bottom dwelling in nature reticulate whipray is generally encountered over sandy flats near beaches in lagoons and around coral reefs from intertidal zone to offshore waters deep or more in shark bay it frequents intertidal sand flats during warm season and shifts to slightly deeper seagrass patches in cold season this species is tolerant of low salinities and has been known to enter estuaries and mangrove swamps though records from fresh water in southeast asia are unverified and may represent misidentifications its preferred water temperatures are biology and ecology thumb upright 1 2 left alt two spotted stingrays with many other fish splashing in surf two reticulate whiprays and other fish being fed on a beach near darwin australia during day reticulate whipray is generally inactive and spends much time resting motionless on sea floor sometimes buried in sand in shark bay western australia this ray can be found resting singly or in small groups in very shallow water during high tide its lateral line extends to tip of its extremely long tail giving it advance warning of approaching predators such as bottlenose dolphins tursiops and hammerhead sharks sphyrna cowtail stingray sephen prefers to rest with reticulate whipray over others of its own species because whiprays longer tails grant them superior predator detection these mixed species groups often settle into a rosette with their tails pointing radially outward for maximum predator awareness reticulate whipray preys on a variety of benthic and neritic organisms including crabs shrimps mantis shrimps bivalves gastropods worms jellyfish and bony fishes in western indian ocean about two thirds of its diet consists of fishes in particular and anchovies with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of remainder by contrast rays in australian waters are apparently not piscivorous and are known to consume penaeid prawns known parasites of this species include dendromonocotyle macrocephalus m multiparous and m and like other stingrays reticulate whipray is aplacental viviparous developing embryos are initially sustained by yolk which is later supplanted by histotroph uterine milk enriched with proteins and lipids produced by mother females give birth to up to five pups in summer after a year long gestation period off south africa newborns measure across and sexual maturation is attained at a disc width of approximately which corresponds to an age of 4 5 off australia newborns measure across with males reported to mature at across juveniles of this species h leoparda and h undulata differ in birth size disc shape denticle development and amount of spotting and are in fact more distinct from each other than are adults of three species shark bay may serve as a nursery area for young rays human interactions thumb upright 1 2 alt a spotted stingray with a long tail lying on sand with a horn shark in an aquarium a reticulate whipray at palais de la porte doree tropical aquarium in paris reticulate whipray fights strongly on hook and line and is thus popular with recreational anglers who usually release it alive this species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in southeast asia and parts of indian ocean using bottom trawls gillnets and tangle nets beach seines and longlines in particular it is caught in substantial numbers by an indonesian trawl fishery targeting in arafura sea meat skin and cartilage are utilized though this species is not a highly valued food fish it also has applications in chinese medicine and its tail may be sold as a curio international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed reticulate whipray as vulnerable its large size inshore habitat preferences and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing although specific data is lacking significant declines in overall ray catches have been documented within its range including in gulf of thailand arafura sea and off pakistan habitat degradation also threatens this species over 30 of mangroves in indonesia and malaysia have been cleared since 1980 while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll australian waters offer reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure as there it is not targeted commercially and installation of turtle exclusion devices teds have reduced bycatch mortality however there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in australian territory by indonesian vessels reticulate whipray is occasionally offered within home aquarium trade it is best avoided however because of its massive proportions it is also kept in some public aquariums such as aquarium of pacific where it is one of aquarium s largest inhabitants and california academy of sciences aquarium references external links himantura uarnak honeycomb stingray at fishbase himantura uarnak reticulate whipray
