pituitary apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired blood supply of pituitary gland this usually occurs in presence of a tumor of pituitary although in 80 of cases this has not been diagnosed previously most common initial symptom is a sudden headache often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding gland this is often followed by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones predominantly adrenal insufficiency diagnosis is achieved with magnetic resonance imaging and blood tests treatment is by timely correction of hormone deficiencies in many cases surgical decompression is required many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long term hormone supplementation first case of disease was recorded in 1898 signs and symptoms acute symptoms initial symptoms of pituitary apoplexy are related to increased pressure in and around pituitary gland most common symptom in over 95 of cases is a sudden onset headache located behind eyes or around temples it is often associated with nausea and vomiting occasionally presence of blood leads to irritation of lining of brain which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light as well as a decreased level of consciousness this occurs in 24 of cases right thumb alt binocular image with outer halves of each circle removed visual field loss in bitemporal hemianopsia compression of optic chiasm leads to a characteristic pattern of vision loss affecting outer halves of each eye pressure on part of optic nerve known as chiasm which is located above gland leads to loss of vision on outer side of visual field on both sides as this corresponds to areas on retinas supplied by these parts of optic nerve it is encountered in 75 of cases visual acuity is reduced in half and over 60 have a visual field defect visual loss depends on which part of nerve is affected if part of nerve between eye and chiasm is compressed result is vision loss in one eye if part after chiasm is affected visual loss on one side of visual field occurs adjacent to pituitary lies a part of skull base known as cavernous sinus this contains a number of nerves that control eye muscles 70 of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of nerves in half of these cases oculomotor nerve third cranial nerve which controls a number of eye muscles is affected this leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil fourth trochlear and sixth abducens cranial nerves are located in same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision respectively oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to pituitary cavernous sinus also contains carotid artery which supplies blood to brain occasionally compression of artery can lead to one sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke endocrine dysfunction right thumb alt schematic drawing of kidneys and adrenal glands adrenal glands located above kidneys are typically first to be affected in pituitary apoplexy when stimulating hormone acth is not secreted adrenals cease to produce cortisol pituitary gland consists of two parts anterior front and posterior back pituitary both parts release hormones that control numerous other organs in pituitary apoplexy main initial problem is a lack of secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth which stimulates secretion of cortisol by adrenal gland this occurs in 70 of those with pituitary apoplexy a sudden lack of cortisol in body leads to a constellation of symptoms called adrenal crisis or crisis after a complication of addison s disease main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels main problems are low blood pressure particularly on standing low blood sugars which can lead to coma and abdominal pain low blood pressure can be life threatening and requires immediate medical attention hyponatremia an unusually low level of sodium in blood that may cause confusion and seizures is found in 40 of cases this may be caused by low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone adh from posterior pituitary several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in subacute phase 50 have a deficiency in thyroid stimulating hormone tsh leading to of thyroid hormone by thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue weight gain and cold intolerance 75 develop a deficiency to lh and fsh which control reproductive hormone glands this leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle infertility and decreased libido causes almost all cases of pituitary apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma a benign tumor of pituitary gland in 80 patient has been previously unaware of this although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms it was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others but this has not been confirmed in absolute terms only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy in an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors apoplexy occurred in 0 2 annually but risk was higher in tumors larger than 10 mm and tumors that were growing more rapidly in a meta analysis not all these associations achieved statistical significance majority of cases 60 80 are not precipitated by a particular cause a quarter has a history of high blood pressure but this is a common problem in general population and it is not clear whether it significantly increase risk of apoplexy a number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative amongst reported associations are surgery especially coronary artery bypass graft where there are significant fluctuations in blood pressure disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation radiation therapy to pituitary traumatic brain injury pregnancy during which pituitary enlarges and treatment with estrogens hormonal stimulation tests of pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes treatment of pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin with dopamine agonist drugs as well as withdrawal of such treatment has been reported to precipitate apoplexy hemorrhage from a rathke s cleft cyst a remnant of rathke s pouch that normally regresses after embryological development may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from sheehan s syndrome where pituitary undergoes infarction as a result of prolonged very low blood pressure particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth this condition usually occurs in absence of a tumor others regard sheehan s syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy mechanism pituitary gland is located in a recess in skull base known as sella turcica turkish saddle after its shape it is attached to hypothalamus a part of brain by a stalk that also contains blood vessels that supply gland it is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in brain there are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase risk of either infarction insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction or hemorrhage pituitary gland normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through hypothalamus but tumors develop a blood supply from nearby inferior artery that generates a higher blood pressure possibly accounting for risk of bleeding tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure and blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage it has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction infarction followed by hemorrhage into damaged tissue larger tumors are more prone to bleeding and more rapidly growing lesions as evidenced by detection of increased levels of protein pcna may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy after an apoplexy pressure inside sella turcica rises and surrounding structures such as optic nerve and contents of cavernous sinus are compressed raised pressure further impairs blood supply to pituitary hormone producing tissue leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply diagnosis thumb normal pituitary gland on mri t1 sagittal without contrast enhancement arrow points at posterior pituitary intense signal and arrowhead at anterior pituitary it is recommended that magnetic resonance imaging mri scan of pituitary gland is performed if diagnosis is suspected this has a sensitivity of over 90 for detecting pituitary apoplexy it may demonstrate infarction tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply or hemorrhage different mri sequences can be used to establish when apoplexy occurred and predominant form of damage hemorrhage or infarction if mri is not suitable e g due to claustrophobia or presence of metal containing implants a computed tomography ct scan may demonstrate abnormalities in pituitary gland although it is less reliable many pituitary tumors 25 are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on mri scans but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms in some instances lumbar puncture may be required if there is a suspicion that symptoms might be caused by other problems meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage this is examination of cerebrospinal fluid that envelops brain and spinal cord sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into spine in pituitary apoplexy results are typically normal although abnormalities may be detected if blood from pituitary has entered subarachnoid space if there is remaining doubt about possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage sah a magnetic resonance angiogram mri with a contrast agent may be required to identify aneurysms of brain blood vessels most common cause of sah professional guidelines recommend that if pituitary apoplexy is suspected or confirmed minimal blood tests performed should include a complete blood count urea a measure of renal function usually performed together with creatinine electrolytes sodium and potassium liver function tests routine coagulation testing and a hormonal panel including igf 1 growth hormone prolactin luteinizing hormone follicle stimulating hormone thyroid stimulating hormone thyroid hormone and either testosterone in men or estradiol in women visual field testing is recommended as soon as possible after diagnosis as it quantifies severity of any optic nerve involvement and may be required to decide on surgical treatment treatment first priority in suspected or confirmed pituitary apoplexy is stabilization of circulatory system cortisol deficiency can cause severe low blood pressure depending on severity of illness admission to a high dependency unit hdu may be required treatment for acute adrenal insufficiency requires administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult this is followed by administration of hydrocortisone which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol intravenously or into a muscle drug dexamethasone has similar properties but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in brain around area of hemorrhage some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement in this case blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9 00 am as cortisol levels vary over day a level below 550 nmol l indicates a need for replacement decision on whether to surgically decompress pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on severity of visual loss and visual field defects if visual acuity is severely reduced there are large or worsening visual field defects or level of consciousness falls consistently professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed most commonly operations on pituitary gland are performed through surgery in this procedure surgical instruments are passed through nose towards sphenoid bone which is opened to give access to cavity that contains pituitary gland surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery and if surgery is undertaken within a week of onset of symptoms those with relatively mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively with close observation of level of consciousness visual fields and results of routine blood tests if there is any deterioration or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur surgical intervention may still be indicated if apoplexy occurred in a prolactin secreting tumor this may respond to dopamine agonist treatment after recovery people who have had pituitary apoplexy require follow up by an endocrinologist to monitor for long term consequences mri scans are performed 3 6 months after initial episode and subsequently on an annual basis if after surgery some tumor tissue remains this may respond to medication further surgery or radiation therapy with a gamma knife prognosis in larger case series mortality was 1 6 overall in group of patients who were unwell enough to require surgery mortality was 1 9 with no deaths in those who could be treated conservatively after an episode of pituitary apoplexy 80 of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy most common problem is growth hormone deficiency which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength obesity and fatigue 60 80 require hydrocortisone replacement either permanently or when unwell 50 60 need thyroid hormone replacement and 60 80 of men require testosterone supplements finally 10 25 develop diabetes insipidus inability to retain fluid in kidneys due to a lack of pituitary antidiuretic hormone this may be treated with drug desmopressin which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth epidemiology pituitary apoplexy is rare even in people with a known pituitary tumor only 0 6 10 experience apoplexy risk is higher in larger tumors based on extrapolations from existing data one would expect 18 cases of pituitary apoplexy per one million people every year actual figure is probably lower average age at onset is 50 cases have reported in people between 15 and 90 years old men are affected more commonly than women with a male to female ratio of 1 6 majority of underlying tumors are null cell or tumors which do not produce excessive amounts of hormones this might explain why tumor has often gone undetected prior to an episode of apoplexy history first case description of pituitary apoplexy has been attributed to american neurologist pearce bailey in 1898 this was followed in 1905 by a further report from german physician surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925 before introduction of steroid replacement mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50 name of condition was coined in 1950 in a case series by physicians from boston city hospital and harvard medical school term apoplexy was applied as it referred to both necrosis and bleeding into pituitary tumors references external links category pituitary disorders
