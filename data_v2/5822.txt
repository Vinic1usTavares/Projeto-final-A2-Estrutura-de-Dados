3rd division was an infantry division of australian army existing during various periods between 1916 and 1991 it is considered longest serving australian army division it was first formed during world war i as an infantry division of australian imperial force and saw service on western front in france and belgium during this time it fought major battles at messines broodseinde ridge passchendaele amiens and st quentin canal after war division was demobilised in 1919 before being re raised in 1921 as part of citizen forces based in central victoria throughout 1920s and 1930s division s establishment fluctuated due to effects of great depression and a general apathy towards military matters during world war ii division was mobilised for war in december 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in australia before being deployed to new guinea in 1943 where they took part in salamaua lae campaign against japanese in 1943 1944 before returning to australia for rest and reorganisation in late 1944 they were sent to bougainville to take part in their final campaign of war there they undertook a series of advances across island before war came to an end in august 1945 following end of hostilities division was disbanded in december 1945 as part of demobilisation process but was it later re raised in 1948 as part of citizens military force it subsequently served through cold war as a reserve formation until 1991 when division was disbanded for a final time as australian army was restructured and focus of australian field force operations shifted from divisional level to brigades history world war i formation and training in early 1916 following unsuccessful gallipoli campaign decision was made to expand size of australian imperial force aif at time there were two divisions in egypt 1st and 2nd and of these one of them 1st was split up to provide a cadre upon which to raise 4th and 5th divisions around this time decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in australia was also made and as a result 3rd division was officially raised on 2 february 1916 upon formation division drew its personnel from all australian states and consisted of three four battalion infantry brigades 9th 10th and 11th and a number of supporting elements including engineers artillery and medical personnel only rudimentary initial training was undertaken before elements of division began embarkation process in may and june 1916 as they were moved to united kingdom where individual sub units concentrated for first time received arms and other equipment and began task of undertaking further training at lark hill on salisbury plain in july division s artillery component was formed consisting of three batteries of 18 pounders and one 4 5 inch howitzer battery process of raising and training took some time and consequently division was not transferred to france until mid november 1916 prior to this however division endured proposals to break it up to provide reinforcements to other four australian divisions that were already in france although these threats passed in early september 1916 following losses around pozieres almost 3 000 men from 3rd division were transferred throughout october it seemed likely that further drafts would be siphoned away from division however this did not occur and in early november two divisional exercises were undertaken finally on 21 november 1916 3rd division crossed english channel and arrived in france under command of major general john monash division was assigned to ii anzac corps for next two years they would take part in most of major battles that australians fought on western front initially they were deployed around armentieres in a quiet sector of line where they gained their first experiences of trench warfare conducting patrols into no man s land and minor raids on german trenches opposite them during winter months early engagements 1917 by january 1917 3rd division s artillery had been reorganised so that it consisted of two field artillery brigades each of which consisted of three six gun 18 pounder batteries and twelve 4 5 inch howitzers these brigades were 7th consisting of 25th 26th 27th and 107th batteries and 8th 29th 30th 31st and 108th batteries in april 1917 division was moved to messines ridge section of line in belgium taking up a position on extreme right of ii anzac corps with new zealand division to its left it was here in early june 1917 that division undertook its first major engagement of war when it was committed to fighting during battle of messines monash tasked 9th and 10th brigades to provide assault force for 3rd division s part of operation while 11th brigade was to act as divisional reserve as division s assault units began their approach march towards line of departure late on evening of 6 june german artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered march breaking up assaulting units as men became lost suffering over 2 000 casualties before battle even began many of division s assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men nevertheless they arrived on time and at appointed hour after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions assault began exploding mines had destroyed a large part of german line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by division s lead battalions 33rd 34th 38th and 39th and by 5 am division had gained crest of messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter attack in engagements that followed division largely played only a supporting role following this division s next major engagement came on 4 october 1917 when it took part in battle of broodseinde ridge this time 9th brigade was held back in reserve while 10th and 11th brigades led division forward attacking on left of australian 2nd division and right of new zealand division early on morning of scheduled start of attack german artillery opened up on division s eight assaulting infantry battalions as they stood to in open ready to step off conserving their artillery for main attack supporting allied artillery only provided limited counter battery fire and division suffered heavily as they were forced to endure an hour long barrage before zero hour came at 6 am as 37th and 43rd battalions led advance towards german lines supported by small teams of mortarmen and machine gunners germans launched their own attack however australian assault had taken them by surprise and after some initial resistance german assault troops began to fall back or surrender as follow on battalions exploited ground gained in initial assault advance continued and by 9 15 am 3rd division had carried ridge and begun to dig in having advanced a counterattack late in day on 11th brigade s position was turned back sealing a stunning success for 3rd division nevertheless division s casualties were high with over 1 800 men killed or wounded for his actions during attack walter a lewis gunner from 3rd pioneer battalion who was attached to 37th battalion for anti aircraft duties received victoria cross after he personally led assault on a number of german positions they held line for a further three days before being withdrawn for rest and reorganisation on 10 october 1917 division returned to front and began to make preparations to assault passchendaele ridge an advance of over heavy rain however had turned battlefield into a thick muddy morass and as a result transportation and resupply efforts were hampered as were attempts to reposition supporting artillery and as a consequence when attack went in at 5 25 am on 12 october 9th and 10th brigades had only limited fire support with only a fraction of guns required and limited ammunition artillery that was supposed to provide a creeping barrage behind which infantry were to advance could only provide a thin bombardment nevertheless mud was so thick that infantry were unable to keep up with barrage and unable to maintain required rate of advance they eventually they fell behind barrage and lost any cover that it might otherwise have provided upon reaching bellevue spur assaulting infantry caught in open upon barbed wire in front of german positions suffered heavily at hands of german artillery that was able to fire without answer from british batteries that had run out of ammunition nevertheless 10th brigade managed to reach its first objective as did 9th which even pushed on to its second however as they began to receive enfilade fire from their left flank where new zealand division s attack had ground to a halt germans began massing for a counterattack and australian positions quickly became untenable on division s right flank another gap had begun to develop as they lost contact with australian 4th division and as a result order to retire was passed as they returned to start line assault units were relieved by 11th brigade which had formed divisional reserve by end of day division had lost almost 3 200 men killed or wounded they played no further offensive role in battle and were eventually removed from line on 22 october as canadians took over from them fighting around passchendaele proved to be division s last offensive actions for 1917 and they spent winter months in rear training or undertaking defensive duties in reasonably quiet sectors of line as they were reformed and brought back up to strength around this time also five australian divisions on western front were reorganised into a unified command structure under australian corps german spring offensive 1918 in march 1918 germans launched their spring offensive near saint quentin and as allied line collapsed german forces advanced swiftly into somme valley believing that another attack would be directed against forces in flanders sector in an effort to reinforce british forces there allied commanders recalled 3rd division was recalled from its quiet sector around armentieres and sent it to ypres attack came however at somme and so on 24 march division was transferred south to help stem advance and defend approaches towards important railhead at amiens temporarily placed under command of british vii corps division took up position to east of amiens in between ancre and somme rivers lacking any reserves and possessing only limited artillery support division s engineers prepared bridges over rivers for detonation from 27 march onwards minor actions were fought along line as german advance began to reach australians on 30 march during first battle of morlancourt a serious attempt at penetrating line around laurette was held and broken up by 11th brigade with german losses being assessed at around one and a half brigades or roughly between 3 000 and 4 000 men meanwhile 9th brigade was detached from division and sent south where it participated in a counter attack around villers bretonneux on 6 april further attempts were made and in confusion charges that had been placed on bridge were fired and it was dropped into somme canal nevertheless attempt was beaten off by 10th brigade following this australians were able to begin taking initiative and throughout may they began to slowly recapture some of ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of peaceful penetration operations including second battle of morlancourt in june 1918 3rd division s commander monash was promoted to take over command of australian corps and as a result major general john gellibrand took over as divisional commander battle of amiens 1918 thumb right 108th howitzer battery in action around bray august 1918 on 8 august 1918 allies launched their hundred days offensive around amiens and 3rd division was tasked with leading australian corps part in attack by this stage divisional artillery consisted of three field brigades and under cover of a heavy artillery bombardment provided by nine field brigades that were organised in three supporting sub groups and supported by tanks and gas attack began at 4 20 am weight of allied fire support was intense as over 2 000 artillery pieces opened up on german defences assaulting infantry battalions were each assigned a frontage of about which they assaulted with two companies forward and two in support thick smoke meant that attackers found it difficult to maintain their spacing and some of supporting armour was also delayed nevertheless attack proved successful as australians overwhelmed german defenders and by end of day division had achieved all of its objectives throughout rest of august they continued offensive operations even launching daylight raids upon german positions on 22 august they attacked once more advancing through village of bray capturing a number of german prisoners after a brief lull in fighting they continued advance again on 25 august capturing at end of week before taking allaines on 2 september throughout september germans began to withdraw back towards hindenburg line and 3rd division took part in operations undertaken to follow them up and harass rearguard casualties during this phase had been high however and as a result division s pioneers were used as infantry and even led advance towards on 6 september as operations continued throughout month casualties amongst australian corps became critical and decision was made to disband some of 3rd division s battalions and use them to reinforce remaining units this decision saw reduction of strength of division s infantry brigades from four battalions to three bringing australians into line with british who had made a similar decision earlier in war nevertheless decision was not popular amongst soldiers and when 42nd battalion received order to disband attempt was rejected by its personnel and order disobeyed as a result proposed reorganisation was postponed until after division s final offensive actions were fought in early october 1918 these came around st quentin canal when division attacked beaurevoir line in concert with american troops from us 27th division who would lead assault in attack went awry however when lead assault units failed to adequately clear forward positions and subsequently when 3rd division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through american positions they had to complete mopping up process before they could advance nevertheless by nightfall on 1 october division had captured northern end of tunnel that ran under canal on 2 october majority of 3rd division was removed from line for rest and reorganisation although a number of its artillery batteries would continue to support operations of ii american corps until they were withdrawn following this they continued to participate in fighting in support of british 6th division 27th battery fired division s last shot of war on 4 november at nevertheless division was out of line when news of armistice came on 11 november 1918 following end of hostilities demobilisation process began and as men were repatriated back to australia division was eventually disbanded on 28 may 1919 inter war years following end of war aif was disbanded and focus of australia s military forces was units of citizens force between 1918 and 1921 as demobilisation process was completed this force existed in a state of flux however in 1921 planning for post war army was finally completed on 1 may 1921 3rd division was re raised in victoria as part of 3rd military district upon formation it consisted of three four battalion brigades 4th brigade 10th brigade and 15th brigade and various supporting units including artillery engineers signals transport and medical at this time existing infantry battalions of citizens force were redesignated to perpetuate numerical designations of aif and although an attempt was made to allocate these designations based on regional considerations ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when 3rd division was re established only two of its component battalions 37th and 39th battalions had previously been assigned to division with a peacetime establishment of about 16 000 personnel 18 400 upon mobilisation division was brought up to strength through compulsory training scheme initially system worked well and a number of division s subunits reported being above establishment however this did not last long in 1922 washington naval treaty was signed and theoretically alleviated australia s security concerns about japanese expansion in pacific as a result army s budget was halved and as scope of compulsory training scheme was scaled back authorised strength of each infantry battalion was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks division s artillery was also reduced with one field battery in each artillery brigade being disbanded at this time as a result of subsequent reorganisation 3rd division s artillery consisted of three artillery brigades 2nd 4th and 8th in 1929 compulsory training scheme was suspended following election of scullin labor government in its place a new system was introduced whereby citizens force would be maintained on a part time voluntary basis only it was also renamed militia at this time decision to suspend compulsory training coupled with economic downturn of great depression meant that manpower of many militia units dropped considerably and as a result a number of units were amalgamated as a part of this process division was reduced from 12 infantry battalions to nine as six battalions were merged to form new amalgamated units 29th 22nd 37th 52nd and 57th 60th battalions to a large extent however these were hollow structures and by 1931 3rd division s overall establishment was just 4 505 men all ranks throughout 1930s number of active personnel remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited after 1936 however army attempted to improve conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate training program while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns nevertheless it was not until 1938 as tensions grew in europe and prospect of war became more likely that an attempt was made to expand establishment of militia at this time an effort was made to determine readiness of militia to expand if mobilised during continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938 each component unit was assessed with mixed results following year 1939 saw further expansion and by end of april of that year division s posted strength had grown to 9 589 personnel as a part of this expansion divisional artillery was expanded by re raising of batteries that had been disbanded in 1922 world war ii home duties on 3 september 1939 australia found itself once again at war after attempts at finding a diplomatic solution to german invasion of poland had failed following outbreak of world war ii mobilisation began slowly as government called up a force of about 8 000 militia personnel to undertake security duties in days following declaration of war a short time later decision was made to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service known as second australian imperial force 2nd aif this was necessary due to provisions of defence act 1903 which precluded deploying militia outside of australian territory and as a result government decided to use militia to provide a small cadre upon which 2nd aif would be raised as well as to provide training to conscripts as part of compulsory training scheme which was re established in early 1940 nevertheless during this time large numbers of officers and senior non commissioned officers from 3rd division volunteered for service with 2nd aif and many units lost a large amount of their experienced personnel at this time throughout 1940 41 militia were called up in cohorts for periods of continuous training and 3rd division still consisting of 4th 10th and 15th brigades undertook a series of training camps around seymour victoria in march 1941 division s artillery was reorganised to bring it in line with british organisational system with each artillery brigade being converted to a field regiment numerical designations stayed same however and by late 1941 division had completed its transition this saw its infantry brigades once again reduced from four battalions to three while various supporting elements were inserted at brigade level however training at this time was still rudimentary and limited mainly to individual skills and division s establishment was recorded as being only half of its authorised wartime establishment there was also a shortage of modern equipment with japan s entry into war following attacks on pearl harbor and malaya it became more likely that division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas and division was mobilised for war in early january 1942 major general stanley savige an experienced officer who had commanded 17th brigade in combat against germans in middle east earlier in war took over command of division savige set about task of preparing division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in aif units a comprehensive training program was established and in april 1942 division was assigned to australian i corps and to enable divisional exercises to begin 3rd division moved to victoria to toughen men up savige decided that they would march on foot to new camp thumb right alt a black and white photograph of soldiers marching up a creek soldiers have their rifles slung and are knee deep in muddy water men from 61st battalion patrol along mosigetta river on bougainville in march 1945 following month they were relocated once more this time to queensland where they undertook training exercises and defensive duties along coast between brisbane and tweed heads on new south wales border at this time army began to rectify deficiencies in division s equipment lists and battalions began receiving new machine guns motor transport and bren carriers as situation in new guinea grew worse decision was made to reorganise 3rd division and throughout august four battalions were amalgamated 37th 52nd 58th and 59th in september 10th brigade was disbanded and its battalions reallocated to 4th and 15th brigades in october 29th and 46th battalions were also amalgamated leaving division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades new guinea 1943 1944 in early 1943 division was despatched to new guinea with 15th brigade being sent to port moresby and 4th brigade going to milne bay at this point 4th brigade was reassigned to 5th division it would later be replaced within division by 29th brigade division s stay in port moresby was brief and in april it began moving to wau where they subsumed units assigned to kanga force including 17th brigade a 2nd aif formation and began operations as part of salamaua lae campaign initially operations were limited to area immediately surrounding bulolo but as division became established headquarters was shifted to tambu bay and brigades were pushed out towards mubo and komiatum and ridges while defensive patrols were undertaken through wampit valley around and airstrips and towards markham river stretched across a front of over in june division was reinforced by us 162nd infantry regiment following this division took on primary responsibility for allied operations in new guinea eventually lae fell in september and soon afterwards its elements were moved back to port moresby before being sent to support 7th division s campaign in markham and ramu valleys and advance on madang in august 1944 3rd division s brigades were withdrawn back to australia for leave and reorganisation after this preparations began for division s next campaign around this time 3rd division adopted jungle divisional establishment and was reorganised around three infantry brigades 7th 15th and 29th brigades it was also assigned to australian ii corps bougainville 1944 1945 in late 1944 it was decided that australians would take over responsibility from americans for operations against japanese on bougainville from november december 1944 3rd division along with two independent brigades 11th and 23rd began to relieve units of us xiv corps that were to be transferred elsewhere in pacific allied intelligence of japanese strengths on island varied at time although it was believed that there were around 17 500 japanese on bougainville although this was later proved to be grossly incorrect nevertheless allies believed that japanese formations in area despite being under strength were still capable of carrying out effective combat operations as a result it was decided that ii corps would go on offensive to clear japanese from island and a three pronged campaign was planned in northern central and southern sectors of island division was supported by a number of artillery units including 2nd and 4th field regiments and 2nd mountain battery and various anti aircraft units later also u heavy battery with four 155 mm howitzers was transferred from lae as was 2 11th field regiment to provide organic fire support during advance decision was made at this time to place divisional artillery assets directly underneath subunits they were supporting at outset division s allocation of engineers consisted of only two field companies 5th and 11th however over course of campaign others arrived including 10th 15th and 7th which was last to arrive in june 1945 ultimately division had almost 1 600 engineers across five field companies and various supporting plant park and other units this represented one of largest engineer contingents within an australian division during war initially division was deployed without armoured support however in december 1944 b squadron 2 4th armoured regiment equipped with matilda ii tanks arrived and subsequently took part in operations on island attached to elements of division 7th brigade supported by 2nd field regiment was first to commence operations as 9th battalion launched a surprise attack in central sector of island upon a japanese outpost at little george hill on 25 november following month battalion seized control of artillery hill while 29th brigade began patrolling operations in southern sector thumb right troops from 3rd division cross hongorai river alongside matilda tanks from 2 4th armoured regiment in may 1945 following capture of pearl ridge by 25th battalion focus of 3rd division s operations on bougainville was shifted on northern and southern sectors 11th brigade independent of 3rd division assumed control of drive to north while 3rd division concentrated on drive south towards buin where main japanese force was concentrated rotating his brigades division s commander major general william bridgeford advanced south from torokina towards river after crossing it japanese launched a significant counterattack around slater s knoll which was eventually beaten off in early april in april 1945 15th brigade took over from 7th brigade and resumed advance on hongorai and mivo rivers in early july 29th brigade relieved 15th and continued advance and as they attempted to cross mivo japanese launched a ferocious counter attack upon 15th battalion which was turned back by desperate defence following this advance came to a halt as torrential rain turned axis of advance into a sea of mud and many of bridges upon which australian supply system was dependent were washed away as situation became worse briefly even patrolling operations had to be stopped these patrols were resumed however in late july and into august as isolated pockets of japanese began to attack 3rd division s supply lines and support units as preparations were made to resume advance dropping of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and japan s subsequent unconditional surrender brought fighting on bougainville to an end and a cease fire came into effect following end of hostilities demobilisation process began and eventually 3rd division was disbanded on 4 december 1945 during division s campaign in bougainville one of its soldiers reg earned victoria cross for his actions during fighting around slater s knoll some personnel from division later served in 67th infantry battalion undertaking occupation duties as part of british commonwealth occupation force in japan cold war in 1948 with demobilisation of australia s wartime army complete decision was made to re raise part time forces of militia albeit with new name of citizens military force cmf and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions an armoured brigade and various corps level support units during this time 3rd division was re raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades 4th 6th and 9th brigades it was once again based in central victoria although subunits were also based in south australia and tasmania once again division s component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during two world wars service in post war cmf was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve readiness of australian military during korean war 3rd division was not deployed during this time however and although national service was instituted service in korea was undertaken on a voluntary basis and conscription was used only as a means to expand cmf and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary nevertheless resulting influx of manpower revitalised cmf to point that during 1950s division experienced a remarkable level of manning and resources that saw many units achieve full strength with full equipment allocations on 23 march 1958 a divisional parade was conducted at puckapunyal bringing together all of division s victorian based units in a concentration of force not seen in division since 1916 following year division conducted a live fire exercise at puckapunyal based upon 4th brigade and involving over 3 500 men tanks artillery aircraft and various supporting arms despite success demonstrated by exercise it would be last time that division mounted something similar national service scheme was modified to limit size of each yearly intake of trainees and size of cmf was reduced by over 30 000 men in an effort to free up regular personnel to raise 1st brigade 1957 reforms however did not achieve efficiencies required to free up regular personnel to meet strategic requirements to maintain a regular field force that was ready to respond to exigencies of cold war as a result in 1959 decision was made to suspend national service as it was realised that further changes were required to expand size of regular army further changes came with introduction of pentropic divisional establishment into australian army this saw reduction of army to just two divisions 1st and 3rd divisions and as a part of this division was reorganised into five battalion plus sized battle groups and resulted in removal of brigade level formations and disbandment and amalgamation of a number of smaller regionally based infantry battalions into larger units that were part of state based regiments with an authorised peacetime establishment of 13 621 personnel 3rd division included formations in five different military command districts including queensland new south wales and western australia as well as those in south australia tasmania and victoria main infantry components at this time were 2nd battalion royal queensland regiment 1st battalion royal victoria regiment rvr 2nd battalion rvr 1st battalion royal south australia regiment and 1st battalion royal western australia regiment australian army s experiment with pentropic establishment did not last long however as it created a number of planning issues including lack of interoperability with other western allies none of whom used it as a result it was abandoned in late 1964 and into early 1965 and 3rd division was once again reorganised resulting changes saw establishment of brigade level formations briefly known as task forces however due to other planning considerations only one was raised for 3rd division at this time 4th task force consisting of four infantry battalions 1 2 5 and 6 rvr thumb left australian and us troops taking part in exercise kangaroo 89 in northern australia at same time australian government announced that national service scheme would be implemented once again however instead of focusing upon expanding cmf scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in australian regular army ara units with a view to service overseas in vietnam and malaysia this highlighted changing focus of australia s military planning towards regular forces however it had a negative impact upon division as essentially it was forced to compete with ara for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in cmf to defer their service in ara units these were negligible and arguably of limited quality government s decision not to deploy cmf units to these conflicts meant that many of division s experienced personnel chose to transfer to ara units to gain operational experience although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering cmf officers opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ara unit serving in vietnam and a number of 3rd division officers took up this opportunity a few even saw combat when national service scheme was ended following election of whitlam government in late 1972 3rd division lost a large number of personnel at this time division s artillery assets included two artillery field regiments a medium regiment and a divisional locating battery and although on paper division was a large combined arms formation in reality many of its units were hollow and inadequately equipped and in decades following this division and indeed cmf in general underwent a period of uncertainty as government attempted to solve issues that organisation faced most pressing of which was question of its role and strategic relevance as well as those concerning conditions of service centralisation of training and access to equipment in 1976 division s combat strength had dropped to extent that it was really only a brigade group formation possessing only two infantry battalions 1 and 2 rvr as well as two field artillery regiments a medium regiment and a locating battery as a result in february division s headquarters were merged with 4th task force s headquarters as 3rd division was redesignated as 3rd division field force group at same time position of formation commander was downgraded to rank of brigadier rather than major general this remained case until april 1984 when divisional headquarters was re established in late 1980s division was given task of vital asset protection under defence of australia doctrine and division undertook a number of exercises in north of australia including kangaroo 89 in which more than 3 000 of its personnel took part nevertheless in june 1991 following a force structure review 3rd division was finally removed from australian army s order of battle and its remaining units were transferred to command of 4th brigade commanding officers following is a list of 3rd division s commanding officers from to rank name
