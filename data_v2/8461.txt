hms indefatigable was lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for royal navy during first decade of 20th century when first world war began indefatigable was serving with 2nd battlecruiser squadron bcs in mediterranean where she unsuccessfully pursued battlecruiser and light cruiser of german imperial navy as they fled toward ottoman empire ship bombarded ottoman fortifications defending dardanelles on 3 november 1914 then following a refit in malta returned to united kingdom in february where she rejoined 2nd bcs indefatigable was sunk on 31 may 1916 during battle of jutland largest naval battle of war part of vice admiral sir david beatty s battlecruiser fleet she was hit several times in first minutes of run to south opening phase of battlecruiser action shells from german battlecruiser caused an explosion ripping a hole in her hull and a second explosion hurled large pieces of ship 200 feet 60 m in air only three of crew of 1 019 survived design and description thumb left 250px starboard elevation and deck plan as depicted in brasseys naval annual 1915 note plan is of invincible class battlecruisers indefatigable class had a third superstructure element with p q turrets more widely spaced no battlecruisers were ordered after three ships in 1905 until indefatigable became lone battlecruiser of 1908 1909 naval programme a new liberal government had taken power in january 1906 and demanded reductions in naval spending and admiralty submitted a reduced programme requesting dreadnoughts but no battlecruisers cabinet rejected this proposal in favour of two outmoded armoured cruisers but finally acceded to a request for one battlecruiser instead after admiralty pointed out need to match recently published german naval construction plan and to maintain heavy gun and armour industries indefatigables outline design was prepared in march 1908 and final design slightly larger than invincible with a revised protection arrangement and additional length amidships to allow her two middle turrets to fire on either broadside was approved in november 1908 a larger design with more armour and better underwater protection was rejected as too expensive roberts pp 26 28 indefatigable had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load ship normally displaced and at deep load she had a crew of 737 officers and ratings roberts pp 29 43 44 ship was powered by two sets of parsons direct drive steam turbines each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 31 coal burning babcock wilcox boilers turbines were rated at and were intended to give ship a maximum speed of during her sea trials on 10 april 1911 indefatigable reached a top speed of from after her propellers were replaced roberts pp 76 77 80 she carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of gardiner gray p 26 indefatigable class had a main armament of eight breech loading bl mark x guns mounted in four hydraulically powered twin gun turrets two turrets were mounted fore and aft on centreline identified as a and x respectively other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally p was forward and to port of centre funnel while q was situated starboard and aft p and q turrets had some limited ability to fire to opposite side their secondary armament consisted of sixteen bl mark vii guns positioned in superstructure roberts pp 81 84 they mounted two submerged torpedo tubes one on each side aft of x barbette and twelve torpedoes were carried campbell 1978 p 14 indefatigables were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered end barbettes their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with thickest portions protecting steering gear in stern turret faces were thick and turrets were supported by barbettes of same thickness roberts p 112 indefatigable was unique among british battlecruisers in having an armoured spotting and signal tower behind conning tower protected by of armour however spotting tower was of limited use as its view was obscured by conning tower in front of it and legs of foremast and superstructure behind it brooks pp 42 43 during a pre war refit a rangefinder was added to rear of a turret roof and this turret was equipped to control entire main armament as an emergency backup for normal fire control positions roberts pp 90 91 wartime modifications indefatigable received a single qf 3 inch 20 cwt cwt is abbreviation for hundredweight 20 cwt referring to weight of gun anti aircraft gun on a high angle mark ii mount in march 1915 it was provided with 500 rounds all of her 4 inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in november 1915 to better protect gun crews from weather and enemy action although two aft guns were removed at same time campbell 1978 p 13 she received a fire control director between mid 1915 and may 1916 that centralised fire control under director officer who now fired guns turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from director to align their guns on target this greatly increased accuracy since ship s roll no longer dispersed shells as each turret fired on its own also fire control director could more easily spot fall of shells roberts pp 92 93 service early career indefatigable was laid down at devonport dockyard plymouth on 23 february 1909 she was launched on 28 october 1909 and was completed on 24 february 1911 roberts p 41 upon commissioning indefatigable served in 1st cruiser squadron which in january 1913 was renamed 1st battlecruiser squadron bcs in december 1913 she transferred to mediterranean where she joined 2nd battlecruiser squadron roberts p 122 pursuit of goeben and breslau indefatigable accompanied by battlecruiser and under command of admiral sir berkeley milne encountered german battlecruiser goeben and light cruiser breslau on morning of 4 august 1914 which were headed east after a cursory bombardment of french algerian port of philippeville britain and germany were not yet at war so milne turned to shadow germans as they headed back to messina to re coal all three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers but goeben and breslau were able to break contact and reached messina by morning of 5th by this time germany had invaded belgium and war had been declared but an admiralty order to respect italian neutrality and stay more than from italian coast precluded entering strait of messina from which they could have observed port directly therefore milne stationed and indefatigable at northern exit of strait expecting germans to break out to west where they could attack french troop transports he stationed light cruiser at southern exit and sent indomitable to coal at bizerte where she was ready for action in western mediterranean massie p 39 germans sortied from messina on 6 august and headed east toward constantinople trailed by gloucester milne still expecting rear admiral wilhelm souchon to turn west kept battlecruisers at malta until shortly after midnight on 8 august when he set sail at a leisurely for cape matapan where goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier at 14 30 times used in this article are in ut which is one hour behind cet which is often used in german works he received an incorrect message from admiralty stating that britain was at war with austria hungary war would not actually be declared until 12 august and order was countermanded four hours later but milne gave up hunt for goeben following his standing orders to guard adriatic against an austrian break out attempt on 9 august milne was given clear orders to chase goeben which had passed cape matapan on 7th steering north east massie pp 45 46 milne still did not believe that souchon was heading for dardanelles and so he resolved to guard exit from aegean unaware that goeben did not intend to come out on 3 november 1914 winston churchill then first lord of admiralty ordered first british attack on dardanelles following commencement of hostilities between ottoman turkey and russia attack was carried out by indomitable and indefatigable as well as french pre dreadnought battleships and intention of attack was to test fortifications and measure turkish response results were deceptively encouraging in a twenty minute bombardment a single shell struck magazine of fort at sedd el bahr at tip of gallipoli peninsula displacing but not destroying 10 guns and killing 86 turkish soldiers most significant consequence was that attention of turks was drawn to strengthening their defences and they set about expanding mine field carlyon p 47 this attack actually took place before britain s formal declaration of war on 6 november against ottoman empire indefatigable remained in mediterranean until she was relieved by inflexible on 24 january 1915 and proceeded to malta for a refit she then sailed to england on 14 february and joined 2nd bcs upon her arrival ship conducted uneventful patrols of north sea for next year and a half she was temporary flagship of 2nd bcs during april may 1916 while her half sister was under repair after colliding with indefatigables other half sister burt p 103 battle of jutland right thumb upright 2 2 diagram of battle of jutland showing major movements on 31 may 1916 2nd bcs consisted of new

fleet into north sea british were able to decode german radio messages and left their bases before germans put to sea admiral franz von hipper s battlecruisers spotted battlecruiser fleet to their west at 15 20 but beatty s ships did not spot germans to their east until 15 30 two minutes later he ordered a course change to east south east to position himself astride german s line of retreat and called his ships crews to action stations he also ordered 2nd bcs which had been leading to fall in astern of 1st bcs hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard away from british to assume a south easterly course and to reduce speed to to allow three light cruisers of 2nd scouting group to catch up with this turn hipper was falling back on high seas fleet then about behind him around this time beatty altered course to east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off hipper tarrant pp 69 71 75 this began what was to be called run to south as beatty changed course to steer east south east at 15 45 paralleling hipper s course now that range closed to under germans opened fire first at 15 48 followed by british british ships were still in process of making their turn as only two leading ships and had steadied on their course when germans opened fire british formation was echeloned to right with indefatigable in rear and furthest to west and new zealand ahead of her and slightly further east german fire was accurate from beginning but british overestimated range as german ships blended into haze indefatigable aimed at and new zealand targeted while remaining unengaged herself by 15 54 range was down to and beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up range at 15 57 thumb indefatigable sinking after being struck by shells from von der tann thumb left hms indefatigable blowing up after being struck by shells from von der tann around 16 00 indefatigable was hit around rear turret by two or three shells from von der tann she fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards stern and listing to port her magazines exploded at 16 03 after more hits one on forecastle and another on forward turret smoke and flames gushed from forward part of ship and large pieces were thrown into air tarrant pp 80 85 it has been thought that most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low order explosion in x magazine that blew out her bottom and severed steering control shafts followed by explosion of her forward magazines from second volley roberts p 116 more recent archaeological evidence shows that ship was actually blown in half within opening minutes of engagement with von der tann which fired only fifty two shells at indefatigable before fore part of ship also exploded mccartney 2017b p317 329 of her crew of 1 019 only three survived while still in water two survivors found indefatigable s captain c f sowerby who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued two survivors able seaman frederick arthur gordon elliott and leading signalman charles farmer were rescued by german torpedo boat campbell 1998 p 61 a third survivor signalman john bowyer was picked up by another unknown german ship he was incorrectly reported as a crew member from in times on 24 june 1916 indefatigable today indefatigable along with other jutland wrecks was belatedly declared a protected place under protection of military remains act 1986 to discourage further damage to resting place of 1 016 men mount indefatigable in canadian rockies was named after battlecruiser in 1917 wreck was identified in 2001 when it was found to have been heavily salvaged sometime in past mccartney pp 196 204 most recent survey of wreck by nautical archaeologist innes mccartney revealed that initial hits on ship by von der tann caused x turret magazine to detonate blowing off a portion of ship from forward of turret to stern supersonic shock wave such an explosion generated was probably reason for very heavy loss of life on board fore part of ship simply drifted on under its own momentum still under fire until it foundered two halves of wreck are separated on seabed by a linear distance of over stern portion had not previously been discovered mccartney 2017b pp 317 329 notes citations references external links maritimequest hms indefatigable photo gallery battle of jutland crew lists
