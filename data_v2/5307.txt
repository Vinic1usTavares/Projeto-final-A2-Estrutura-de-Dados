follow up album charmbracelet 2002 album focused on incorporating several inspirational ballads and re capturing carey s audience from 1990s however critics took notice of carey s different vocals as glitter was an unsuccessful mixture of covers and dance music charmbracelet incorporated slower contemporary melodies in his review of album stephen thomas erlewine criticized album s content describing carey s voice as in tatters he wrote whenever she sings there s a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout record she cannot coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity defying vocal runs her voice is damaged and there s not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting though fueled by strong media attention regarding carey s return to music as well as her new deal with island records album failed to deliver type of success she had been accustomed to throughout 1990s and only managed sales of five million copies globally after album s release and its succeeding tour carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project eventually titled emancipation of mimi her tenth studio effort by november 2004 carey had already

in style of her successors such as usher by way of jermaine dupri on shake it off via legendary traxster on one and only and neptunes on to floor however cinquemani praised carey for channeling a predecessor instead of one of her successors such as channeling prince on mine again and joy ride describing outcome sublime cinquemani also wrote that mine again and another track from album called i
