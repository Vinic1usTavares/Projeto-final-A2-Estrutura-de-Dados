noble gases historically also inert gases sometimes referred to as make up a group of chemical elements with similar properties under standard conditions they are all odorless colorless monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity six naturally occurring noble gases are helium he neon ne argon ar krypton kr xenon xe and radioactive radon rn oganesson og is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break trend due to relativistic effects its chemistry has not yet been investigated for first six periods of periodic table noble gases are exactly members of group 18 noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted for example argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent hot tungsten filament from oxidizing also helium is used in breathing gas by deep sea divers to prevent oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide toxicity properties of noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be full giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together differing by less than that is they are liquids over only a small temperature range neon argon krypton and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in natural gas using cryogenic gas separation techniques and radon is usually isolated from radioactive decay of dissolved radium thorium or uranium compounds noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting welding and space exploration a helium oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep sea divers at depths of seawater over after risks caused by flammability of hydrogen became apparent it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons history noble gas is translated from german noun first used in 1898 by hugo erdmann to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity name makes an analogy to term noble metals which also have low reactivity noble gases have also been referred to as inert gases but this label is deprecated as many noble gas compounds are now known rare gases is another term that was used but this is also inaccurate because argon forms a fairly considerable part 0 94 by

lockyer find yellow prominences to give a very decided bright line not far from d but hitherto not identified with any terrestrial flame it seems to indicate a new substance which they propose to call helium no chemical analysis was possible at time but helium was later found to be a noble gas before them in 1784 english chemist and physicist henry cavendish had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than nitrogen a century later in 1895 lord rayleigh discovered that samples of nitrogen from air were of a different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions along with scottish scientist william ramsay at university college london lord rayleigh theorized that nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element argon from greek word idle or lazy with this discovery they realized an entire class of gases was missing from periodic table during his search for argon ramsay also managed to isolate helium for first time while heating cleveite a mineral in 1902 having accepted evidence for elements helium and argon dmitri mendeleev included these noble gases as group 0 in his arrangement of elements which would later become periodic table ramsay continued his search for these gases using method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components in 1898 he discovered elements krypton neon and xenon and named them after greek words hidden new and stranger respectively radon was first identified in 1898 by friedrich ernst dorn and was named radium emanation but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics were found to be similar to those of other noble gases rayleigh and ramsay received 1904 nobel prizes in physics and in chemistry respectively for their discovery of noble gases in words of j e then president of royal swedish academy of sciences discovery of an entirely new group of elements of which no single representative had been known with any certainty is something utterly unique in history of chemistry being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance discovery of noble gases aided in development of a general understanding of atomic structure in 1895 french chemist henri moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine most electronegative element and argon one of noble gases but failed scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until end of 20th century but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure learning from these experiments danish physicist niels bohr proposed in 1913 that electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding nucleus and that for all noble gases except helium outermost shell always contains eight electrons in 1916 gilbert n lewis formulated octet rule which concluded an octet of electrons in outer shell was most stable arrangement for any atom this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell in 1962 neil bartlett discovered first chemical compound of a noble gas xenon compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after in 1962 for radon radon difluoride which was identified by radiotracer techniques and in 1963 for krypton krypton difluoride first stable compound of argon was reported in 2000 when argon fluorohydride harf was formed at a temperature of in december 1998 scientists at joint institute for nuclear research working in dubna russia bombarded plutonium pu with calcium ca to produce a single atom of element 114 flerovium fl preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element may be first superheavy element to show abnormal noble gas like properties even though it is a member of group 14 on periodic table in october 2006 scientists from joint institute for nuclear research and lawrence livermore national

data page noble gases have weak interatomic force and consequently have very low melting and boiling points they are all monatomic gases under standard conditions including elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements its boiling point at 1 atm is lower than those of any other known substance it is only element known to exhibit superfluidity it is only element that cannot be solidified by cooling under standard conditions a pressure of must be applied at a temperature of to convert it to a solid noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes radon has no stable isotopes its longest lived isotope has a half life of 3 8 days and decays to form helium and polonium which ultimately decays to lead melting and boiling points generally increase going down group left thumb upright 1 3 this is a plot of ionization potential versus atomic number noble gases which are labeled have largest ionization potential for each period alt a graph of ionization energy vs atomic number showing sharp peaks for noble gas atoms noble gas atoms like atoms in most groups increase steadily in atomic radius from one period to next due to increasing number of electrons size of atom is related to several properties for example ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because valence electrons in larger noble gases are farther away from nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by atom noble gases have largest ionization potential among elements of each period which reflects stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity some of heavier noble gases however have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules it was insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of oxygen molecule that led bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions that is they have a negative electron affinity macroscopic physical properties of noble gases are dominated by weak van der waals forces between atoms attractive force increases with size of atom as a result of increase in polarizability and decrease in ionization potential this results in systematic group trends as one goes down group 18 atomic radius and with it interatomic forces increases resulting in an increasing melting point boiling point enthalpy of vaporization and solubility increase in density is due to increase in atomic mass noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard conditions but their deviations from ideal gas law provided important clues for study of intermolecular interactions lennard jones potential often used to model intermolecular interactions was deduced in 1924 by john lennard jones from experimental data on argon before development of quantum mechanics provided tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because noble gases are monatomic and atoms spherical which means that interaction between atoms is independent of direction or isotropic chemical properties thumb neon like all noble gases has a full valence shell noble gases have eight electrons in their outermost shell except in case of helium which has two alt an atomic shell diagram with neon core 2 electrons in inner shell and 8 in outer shell noble gases are colorless odorless tasteless and nonflammable under standard conditions they were once labeled group 0 in periodic table because it was believed they had a valence of zero meaning their atoms cannot combine with those of other elements to form compounds however it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds causing this label to fall into disuse configuration like other groups members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration especially outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior z element no of electrons shell 2 helium 2 10 neon 2 8 18 argon 2 8 8 36 krypton 2 8 18 8 54 xenon 2 8 18 18 8 86 radon 2 8 18 32 18 8 noble gases have full valence electron shells valence electrons are outermost electrons of an atom and are normally only electrons that participate in chemical bonding atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons however heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases as a result of a full shell noble gases can be used in conjunction with electron configuration notation to form noble gas notation to do this nearest noble gas that precedes element in question is written first and then electron configuration is continued from that point forward for example electron notation of phosphorus is 1s2 2s2 3s2 3p3 while noble gas notation is ne 3s2 3p3 this more compact notation makes it easier to identify elements and is shorter than writing out full notation of atomic orbitals noble gases cross boundary between blocks helium is an s element whereas rest of members are p elements which is unusual among iupac groups most if not cannot decide on exact composition of group 3 which include elements from f block in some proposals their inclusion would make group 3 second cross block group other iupac groups contain elements from one block each compounds thumb left structure of one of first noble gas compounds to be discovered alt a model of planar chemical molecule with a blue center atom xe symmetrically bonded to four peripheral atoms fluorine noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity consequently only a few hundred noble gas compounds have been formed neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed although some helium containing ions exist and there is some theoretical evidence for a few neutral helium containing ones while xenon krypton and argon have shown only minor reactivity reactivity follows order ne he ar kr xe rn in 1933 linus pauling predicted that heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and oxygen he predicted existence of krypton hexafluoride and xenon hexafluoride speculated that might exist as an unstable compound and suggested that acid could form perxenate salts these predictions were shown to be generally accurate except that is now thought to be both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable xenon compounds are most numerous of noble gas compounds that have been formed most of them have xenon atom in oxidation state of 2 4 6 or 8 bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen as in xenon difluoride xenon tetrafluoride xenon hexafluoride xenon tetroxide and sodium perxenate xenon reacts with fluorine to form numerous xenon fluorides according to following equations xe f2 xe xe xef6 some of these compounds have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents in particular is commercially available and can be used as a fluorinating agent as of 2007 about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified including compounds containing xenon bonded to carbon and xenon bonded to nitrogen chlorine gold mercury and xenon itself compounds of xenon bound to boron hydrogen bromine iodine beryllium sulphur titanium copper and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices or in supersonic noble gas jets in theory radon is more reactive than xenon and therefore should form chemical bonds more easily than xenon does however due to high radioactivity and short half life of radon isotopes only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice krypton is less reactive than xenon but several compounds have been reported with krypton in oxidation state of 2 krypton difluoride is most notable and easily characterized under extreme conditions krypton reacts with fluorine to form krf2 according to following equation kr f2 krf2 compounds in which krypton forms a single bond to nitrogen and oxygen have also been characterized but are only stable below and respectively krypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals hydrogen chlorine carbon as well as some late transition metals copper silver gold have also been observed but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices or in supersonic noble gas jets similar conditions were used to obtain first few compounds of argon in 2000 such as argon fluorohydride harf and some bound to late transition metals copper silver and gold as of 2007 no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known noble gases including helium can form stable molecular ions in gas phase simplest is helium hydride molecular ion heh discovered in 1925 because it is composed of two most abundant elements in universe hydrogen and helium it is believed to occur naturally in interstellar medium although it has not been detected yet in addition to these ions there are many known neutral excimers of noble gases these are compounds such as arf and krf that are stable only when in an excited electronic state some of them find application in excimer lasers in addition to compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond noble gases also form non covalent compounds clathrates first described in 1949 consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances essential condition for their formation is that guest noble gas atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in cavities of host crystal lattice for instance argon krypton and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained neon argon krypton and xenon also form clathrate hydrates where noble gas is trapped in ice thumb an endohedral fullerene compound containing a noble gas atom alt a skeletal structure of buckminsterfullerene with an extra atom in its center noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds in which noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule in 1993 it was discovered that when a spherical molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms is exposed to noble gases at high pressure complexes such as can be formed notation indicates he is contained inside but not covalently bound to it as of 2008 endohedral complexes with helium neon argon krypton and xenon have been created these compounds have found use in study of structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of nuclear magnetic resonance of noble gas atom 300px thumb left bonding in according to 3 center 4 electron bond model alt schematic illustration of bonding and antibonding orbitals see text noble gas compounds such as xenon difluoride are considered to be hypervalent because they violate octet rule bonding in such compounds can be explained using a three center four electron bond model this model first proposed in 1951 considers bonding of three collinear atoms for example bonding in is described by a set of three molecular orbitals mos derived from p orbitals on each atom bonding results from combination of a filled p orbital from xe with one half filled p orbital from each f atom resulting in a filled bonding orbital a filled non bonding orbital and an empty antibonding orbital highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on two terminal atoms this represents a localization of charge that is facilitated by high electronegativity of fluorine of heavier noble gases krypton and xenon are well established chemistry of lighter ones argon and helium is still at an early stage while a neon compound is yet to be identified occurrence and production abundances of noble gases in universe decrease as their atomic numbers increase helium is most common element in universe after hydrogen with a mass fraction of about 24 most of helium in universe was formed during big bang nucleosynthesis but amount of helium is steadily increasing due to fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis and to a very slight degree alpha decay of heavy elements abundances on earth follow different trends for example helium is only third most abundant noble gas in atmosphere reason is that there is no primordial helium in atmosphere due to small mass of atom helium cannot be retained by earth s gravitational field helium on earth comes from alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in earth s crust and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits abundance of argon on other hand is increased as a result of beta decay of potassium 40 also found in earth s crust to form argon 40 which is most abundant isotope of argon on earth despite being relatively rare in solar system this process is basis for potassium argon dating method xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in atmosphere in what has been called missing xenon problem one theory is that missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside earth s crust after discovery of xenon dioxide research showed that xe can substitute for si in quartz radon is formed in lithosphere by alpha decay of radium it can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated due to its high radioactivity radon presents a significant health hazard it is implicated in an estimated 21 000 lung cancer deaths per year in united states alone

use helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas which can contain up to 7 helium neon argon krypton and xenon are obtained from air using methods of liquefaction of gases to convert elements to a liquid state and fractional distillation to separate mixtures into component parts helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas and radon is isolated from radioactive decay of radium compounds prices of noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance with argon being cheapest and xenon most expensive as an example adjacent table lists 2004 prices in united states for laboratory quantities of each gas applications thumb left liquid helium is used to cool superconducting magnets in modern mri scanners alt a large solid cylinder with a hole in its center and a rail attached to its side noble gases have very low boiling and melting points which makes them useful as cryogenic refrigerants in particular liquid helium which boils at is used for superconducting magnets such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance liquid neon although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40 times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen helium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen due its low solubility in fluids especially in lipids gases are absorbed by blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis due to its reduced solubility little helium is taken into cell membranes and when helium is used to replace part of breathing mixtures such as in trimix or heliox a decrease in narcotic effect of gas at depth is obtained helium s reduced solubility offers further advantages for condition known as decompression sickness or bends reduced amount of dissolved gas in body means that fewer gas bubbles form during decrease in pressure of ascent another noble gas argon is considered best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors thumb right goodyear blimp alt cigar shaped blimp with good year written on its side since hindenburg disaster in 1937 helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons due to its lightness and incombustibility despite an 8 6 decrease in buoyancy in many applications noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere argon is used in synthesis of air sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen solid argon is also used for study of very unstable compounds such as reactive intermediates by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures helium is used as carrier medium in gas chromatography as a filler gas for thermometers and in devices for measuring radiation such as geiger counter and bubble chamber helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and surrounding base metal from atmosphere during welding and cutting as well as in other metallurgical processes and in production of silicon for semiconductor industry thumb left 15 000 watt xenon short arc lamp used in imax projectors alt elongated glass sphere with two metal rod electrodes inside facing each other one electrode is blunt and another is sharpened noble gases are commonly used in lighting because of their lack of chemical reactivity argon mixed with nitrogen is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs krypton is used in high performance light bulbs which have higher color temperatures and greater efficiency because it reduces rate of evaporation of filament more than argon halogen lamps in particular use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of iodine or bromine noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside gas discharge lamps such as neon lights these lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors which add various hues to orange red color of neon xenon is commonly used in xenon arc lamps which due to their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles daylight find application in film projectors and as automobile headlamps noble gases are used in excimer lasers which are based on short lived electronically excited molecules known as excimers excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as or or more commonly noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as arf krf or these lasers produce ultraviolet light which due to its short wavelength 193 nm for arf and 248 nm for krf allows for high precision imaging excimer lasers have many industrial medical and scientific applications they are used for and which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture and for laser surgery including laser angioplasty and eye surgery some noble gases have direct application in medicine helium is sometimes used to improve ease of breathing of asthma sufferers xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids which makes it more potent than usual nitrous oxide and because it is readily eliminated from body resulting in faster recovery xenon finds application in medical imaging of lungs through mri radon which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts is used in radiotherapy noble gases particularly xenon are predominantly used in ion engines due to their inertness since ion engines are not driven by chemical reactions chemically inert fuels are desired to prevent unwanted
