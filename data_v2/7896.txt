he was dreaded and avoided borias 11 38 earlier travels had exposed gericault to victims of insanity and plague and while researching meduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to

1818 to july 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in faubourg du being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out he and his 18 year old assistant louis alexis jamar slept in a small room adjacent to studio occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion jamar walked off after two days gericault persuaded him to return in his

his intense industry he painted directly on white canvas without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort except for firmly traced contours and yet solidity of work was none worse for it i was

to art historian richard muther there is still a strong debt to classicism in work fact that majority of figures are almost naked he wrote arose from a desire to avoid costumes muther observes that there is still something academic in figures which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation disease and struggle with death influence of jacques louis david can be seen in painting s scale
