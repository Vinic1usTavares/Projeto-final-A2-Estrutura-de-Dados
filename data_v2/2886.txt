storyline calling it silly television columnist alan sepinwall for star ledger wrote that jack taking on larry braverman persona gave baldwin a chance to play a delightfully goofy strain of those

a well used plot device as baldwin made it believable tv guide s matt mitovich was positive about reunion calling it a nice episode jeff labrecque for entertainment weekly enjoyed episode and said that reunion was first episode of season that i think show benefited from refocused attention on its core characters reunion plot was so strong and carrie finale so inspired that i hope viewership

scored many of show s biggest laughs he said that he found second plot a little underwhelming though i thought there was a neat meta textual element to it but wrote that it scored some nice shots at vapid narcissism of actors but it promised more than it could deliver rick porter of zap2it said that despite super capital a list guest stars that guest starred at beginning of season reunion got back to show s core cast and show gave us probably best episode of season time contributor james poniewozik opined that this episode was pretty good and funny in most of usual 30 rock ways not all reviews were positive jeremy medina of paste wrote that reunion was essentially unremarkable especially in its portrayal of liz medina disliked that tina fey s liz was portrayed in unlikable light and after insulting her former classmates at high school reunion it seemed a bit uncharacteristic and unflattering to her character references external links category 30 rock season 3 episodes category
