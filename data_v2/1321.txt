said later if truth be known i didn t want to be there anyway i wasn t prepared to be in band if people were being like that to each other noel rejoined oasis a few weeks later but band s management and handlers were worried with an album s worth of songs already demoed felt that they should record as soon as possible their manager marcus russell said in 2007 that in retrospect we went in studio too quickly smart move would have been to take rest of year off but at time it seemed like right thing to do if you re a band and you ve got a dozen songs you think are great why not go and do it in 2006 noel agreed that band should have separated for a year or two instead of going into studio however morris later wrote it was a mistake on everyone s part management very much included that we didn t record be here now in summer of 1996 it would have been a much different album happy probably he described mustique demos as last good recordings i did with noel and said his relationship soured following knebworth concert recording and production alt thumb part of be here now was recorded at abbey road studios recording began on 7 october 1996 at emi s abbey road studios in london be

was under heavy tabloid focus at time and on 9 november 1996 was arrested and cautioned for cocaine possession at q awards a media frenzy ensued and band s management made decision to move to a studio less readily accessible to paparazzi sun showbiz editor dominic mohan recalled we had quite a few oasis contacts on payroll i don t know whether any were drug dealers but there was always a few dodgy characters about oasis s official photographer jill furmanovsky felt media s focus and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in flat upstairs from her they thought i had band hiding in my flat in paranoia oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle according to johnny hopkins publicist of oasis s label creation records people were being edged out of circle around oasis people who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous hopkins likened situation to a medieval court complete with kings courtiers and jesters and said once you re in that situation you lose sight of reality on 11 november 1996 oasis relocated to rural ridge farm studios in surrey though they reconvened with more energy early recordings were compromised by drug intake of all involved morris recalled that in first week someone tried to score an ounce of weed but instead got an ounce of cocaine which kind of summed it up noel was not present during any of liam s vocal track recordings morris thought that new material was weak but when he voiced his opinion to noel he was cut down so i just carried on drugs up my nose morris had initially wanted to just transfer mustique demo recordings and overdub drums vocals and rhythm guitar but 8 track mixer he had employed required him to bounce tracks for overdubs leaving him unable to remove drum machine from recordings noel wanting to make album as dense and colossal feeling as possible layered multiple guitar tracks on several songs in many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts in an effort to create a sonic volume creation s owner alan mcgee visited studio during mixing stage he said i used to go down to studio and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point owen was out of control and he was one in charge of it music was just fucking loud morris responded alan mcgee was head of record company why didn t he do something about out of control record producer obviously one not in control was head of record company he said that he and band had been dealing with personal difficulties day and night before mcgee visited studio music as with oasis previous two albums songs

i did was run my elbows across keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed sutcliffe phil of course me and liam had a row about it q september 1997 album s production is dominated by top end high frequency tones and according to uncuts paul lester its use of treble is reminiscent of both late 1980s creation records bands such as my bloody valentine and stooges famously under produced raw power vocal melodies continue noel s preference for massed rank sing alongs although paul du noyer concedes that not all are of pub trashing idiot kind of previous releases at time of release qs phil sutcliffe summarised lyrics of be here now as a mixture of hookline optimism a swarm of beatles and other 60s references a gruff love song to meg and further tangled expressions of his inability unwillingness to express profound emotions lyrics were elsewhere described as running gamut from insightful to insipid although du noyer admitted that noel is to go by his lyrics something of a closet philosopher and often romantic to point of big girl s while tracks don t go away and girl in dirty shirt were described as unabashedly sentimental du noyer went on to observe that there is compassion and sensitivity in these tracks that is not work of oafs du noyer conceded that noel often tied himself up in cosmic knots but had written words that sound simple and true and are therefore poetic without trying to be lester read song titles such as stand by me and don t go away as a series of demands both to members of his private life and his public audience du noyer praised liam s vocal contributions and described his northern punk whine as most distinctive individual style of our time lester alluded to liam as noel s mouthpiece although he qualified that liam is voice of every working class boy with half a yen to break out and make it big release promotion when alan mcgee creation s publicist johnny hopkins and marketing executive emma greengrass first heard be here now at noel gallagher s house each had their doubts about its artistic value but kept their doubts to themselves one creation employee recalled a lot of nodding of heads a lot of slapping of backs cavanagh 2000 p 518 mcgee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first i heard it in studio and i remember saying we ll only sell seven million copies i thought it was too confrontational however in an interview with music press a few days later he predicted album would sell twenty million copies mcgee s hyperbole alarmed both oasis and their management company ignition and both immediately excluded him from involvement in release campaign ignition s strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with album s release fearful of dangers of over hype and bootlegging their aim was to present record as a regular everyday collection of tunes to this end they planned a modest marketing budget to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and tv advertising according to greengrass we want to keep it low key we want to keep control of whole mad thing cavanagh 2000 p 519 however extent that ignition were willing to go to control access to album generated more hype than could normally have been expected and served to alienate members of both print and broadcast media as well as most creation staff members when d you know what i mean was planned as first single ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure however three stations broke embargo and ignition panicked according to greengrass we d been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something and our plot was blown shit it s a nightmare cavanagh 2000 p 521 bbc radio 1 received a cd containing three songs ten days before album s release on condition that disc jockey steve lamacq talked over tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners day after lamacq previewed album on his show he received a phone call from ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn t speak enough over songs lamacq said i had to go on air next night and say sorry but we re not getting any more tracks it was just absurd harris 2004 p 336 according to creation s head of marketing john andrews campaign made people despise oasis within creation you had this oasis camp that was like i m sorry you re not allowed come into office between following hours you re not allowed mention word oasis it was like a fascist state one employee recalled an incident when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought sun had tapped them when hopkins began to circulate cassette copies of album to music press a few weeks later he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that cassette recipient according to select journalist mark perry not discuss album with anyone including your partner at home it basically said don t talk to your girlfriend about it when you re at home in bed cavanagh 2000 p 520 mail on sunday wrote of russell he has a mind like a steel trap and organisational skills of winston churchill reflecting in 1999 greengrass admitted in retrospect a lot of things we did were ridiculous we sit in oasis meetings today and we re like it s on internet it s in camden market whatever i think we ve learned our lesson cavanagh 2000 p 523 according to perry it seemed particularly once you heard album that this was cocaine grandeur of just most ludicrous degree i remember listening to all around world and laughing actually quite because it seemed so ridiculous you
