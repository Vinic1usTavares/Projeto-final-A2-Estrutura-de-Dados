roland tr 808 rhythm composer commonly known as 808 is a drum machine manufactured by roland corporation between 1980 and 1983 it was one of first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns unlike its nearest competitor at time more expensive linn lm 1 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than playing samples launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure after building approximately 12 000 units roland discontinued 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock it was succeeded by tr 909 in 1983 over course of 1980s 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on used market ease of use and idiosyncratic sounds particularly its deep booming bass drum it became a cornerstone of emerging electronic dance and hip hop genres popularized by early hits such as sexual healing by marvin gaye and planet rock by afrika bambaataa and soulsonic force 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine its particularly popularity in hip hop has made it one of most influential inventions in popular music comparable to fender stratocaster s impact on rock its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines and it has inspired numerous clones development in late 1960s hammond organ company hired american musician and engineer don lewis to demonstrate its products including an electronic organ with a built in drum machine designed by japanese company ace tone at time drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs they did not allow users to program rhythms but had preset patterns such as bossa nova lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified himself decades before popularization of instrument hacking via circuit bending he made extensive modifications to ace tone drum machine creating his own rhythms and wiring device through his organ s expression pedal to accent percussion lewis was approached by ace tone president and founder kakehashi who wanted to know how he had achieved sounds using machine kakehashi had designed in 1972 kakehashi formed roland corporation and hired lewis to help design drum machines by late 1970s microprocessors were appearing in instruments such as roland mc 8 and kakehashi realized they could be used to program drum machines in 1978 roland released cr 78 first drum machine with which users could write save and replay their own patterns with its next machine tr 808 roland aimed to develop a drum machine for professional market expecting that it would mainly be used to create demos concept was to build a drum synthesizer with which users could edit parameters such as tuning decay and level and build sounds into sequences though engineers aimed to emulate real percussion prohibitive cost of memory drove them to design sound generating hardware instead of using samples prerecorded sounds kakehashi deliberately purchased faulty transistors that created machine s distinctive sizzling sound chief engineer makoto credited design of analog voice circuits to mr nakamura and software to mr matsuoka sounds and features 808 produces sounds in imitation of acoustic percussion bass drum snare toms conga claves handclap maraca cowbell cymbal and hi hat open and closed rather than playing samples machine generates sounds using analog synthesis tr in tr 808 stands for transistor rhythm users can program up to 32 patterns using step sequencer chain up to 768 measures and place accents on individual beats a feature introduced with cr 78 users can also set tempo and time signature including unusual signatures such as and 808 was first drum machine with which users could program a percussion track from beginning to end complete with breaks and rolls contemporary keyboard volume 7 issues 1 6 1981 roland tr 808 will undoubtedly become standard for rhythm machines of future because it does what no rhythm machine of past has ever done not only does tr 808 allow programming of individual rhythm patterns it can also program entire percussion track of a song from beginning to end complete with breaks rolls literally anything you can think of it includes volume knobs for each voice numerous audio outputs and a din sync port a precursor to midi to synchronize with other devices through digital control bus interface which was considered groundbreaking its three trigger outputs can synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment 808 s sounds do not resemble real percussion and have been described as and hypnotic robotic spacey toy like and futuristic fact described them as a combination of synth tones and white noise more akin to bursts coming from bbc radiophonic workshop than a proper rhythm section machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound built from a sine oscillator low pass filter and voltage controlled amplifier bass drum decay control allows users to lengthen sound creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over time possibly not by design according to new yorker less a product of engineering than a force of nature this bass rolling subsonic boom has come to be what people mean when they refer to an 808 release 808 launched in 1980 with a list price of roland marketed it as an affordable alternative to linn lm 1 manufactured by linn electronics which used samples of real drum kits 808 sounded simplistic and synthetic by comparison electronic music had yet to become mainstream and many musicians and producers wanted realistic sounding drum machines many reports state that one review dismissed machine as sounding like marching anteaters though this was likely referring to machines that predated it contemporary keyboard wrote a positive review predicting that it would become standard for rhythm machines of future despite some early adopters 808 was a commercial failure and fewer than 12 000 units were sold roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made it impossible to restock faulty transistors essential to its design legacy though 808 was commercially unsuccessful it has had a lasting influence on popular music and was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine roland credits first use in a live performance to japanese electronic group yellow magic orchestra with 1000 knives in 1980 first records to feature 808 were released in 1981 yellow magic orchestra s bgm and monitors nobody told me in 1982 american r b artist marvin gaye released first hit single that featured 808 sexual healing gaye was drawn to instrument because he could use it to create music without other musicians or producers alt afrika bambaataa and dj yutaka djing in 2004 thumb in 1982 afrika bambaataa left and soulsonic force released planet rock one of first hit singles to use 808 left by time roland discontinued 808 in 1983 it had become common on used market often selling for under 100 its ease of use affordability and idiosyncratic sound earned it a cult following among underground musicians and producers and it became a cornerstone of developing electronic and hip hop genres in 1982 afrika bambaataa and soulsonic force released their single planet rock which made extensive use of 808 to create strange futuristic percussion that became hugely popular on dancefloors track informed development of electronic and hip hop and subgenres including miami bass and detroit techno and popularized 808 as a fundamental element of futuristic sound according to slate planet rock didn t so much put 808 on map so much as reorient an entire world of post disco dance music around it 808 was subsequently used by hip hop acts including run dmc ll cool j and public enemy it has been described as hip hop s equivalent to fender stratocaster guitar which dramatically influenced development of rock music 808 bass drum in particular became so essential that hank shocklee of bomb squad production group declared that it s not hip hop without that sound new yorker wrote that trembling feeling of 808 bass drum booming down boulevards in oakland bronx and detroit are part of america s cultural dna even after 808 fell out of use by east coast hip hop producers in 1990s it remained a staple of southern hip hop 808 s limited pattern storage encouraged artists to push its limits according to slate those eight bar units became veritable playgrounds for invention and creativity artists manipulated bass drum to produce new sounds such as on 1984 single set it off in which producer strafe used it to imitate sound of an underground nuclear test producer rick rubin popularized technique of lengthening bass drum decay and tuning it to different pitches to create basslines on their 1986 track paul revere beastie boys reversed a recording of an 808 to produce backwards sounding percussion 808 also saw extensive use beyond hip hop such as on whitney houston s 1987 pop hit i wanna dance with somebody who loves me in 1984 talking heads concert film stop making sense singer david byrne performs psycho killer on acoustic guitar accompanied by an 808 stumbling against its gunshot like sounds songwriter phil collins found machine useful for looping rhythms for long periods since human drummers would be tempted to add variations and fills chris norris of new yorker wrote that introduction of roland s magic box was indisputably big bang of pop s great age of disruption from 1983 to 1986 808 s defiantly inorganic timbres sketched out domain of a new world of music in united kingdom 808 was popularized by electronic group 808 state who took their name from machine and used it extensively 808 state s graham massey said roland gear began to be a kind of esperanto in music whole world began to be less separated through this technology and there was a classiness to it you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment with rise of rave culture a precursor to acid house 808 became a staple sound on british radio left thumb 808 continues to be used in popular music rapper kanye west front used it on every track on his 2008 album 808s heartbreak alt rapper kanye west working in a studio rapper kanye west used 808 on every track on his 2008 album 808s heartbreak which slate described as an explicit love letter to device other artists who have used 808 include damon albarn diplo fatboy slim david guetta and new order it has been referenced in lyrics by artists including beastie boys outkast kelis ti lil wayne britney spears beyonce r kelly and robbie williams its bass drum has been used as a metaphor for a heartbeat in songs by artists including madonna rihanna and kesha 808 is one of most influential inventions in popular music in 2019 wrote that it is probably most used drum machine in last 40 years samples of its sounds are common in music software and it has inspired numerous unlicensed clones flavorwire wrote that 808 has become so ubiquitous over years that its beats are almost a language of their own you know sounds even if you have no idea what a drum machine is and as such you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts new yorker wrote in 2015 that 808 was bedrock of modern urban youth culture soundtrack particularly in trap music and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that embraces and street music from past according to slate it was instrumental in pop music s shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to thinking in terms of sequences discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum successors alt thumb tr 08 a miniaturized 808 reissue 808 was followed in 1983 by tr 909 first roland drum machine to use samples like 808 909 was influential on popular music influencing genres such as techno house and acid in 1990s roland included samples of 808 in its successful devices in 2014 roland announced tr 8 drum machine which recreates 808 and 909 through a combination of modeling and sampling it was followed in 2017 by tr 08 a miniaturized 808 featuring an led display midi and usb connections expanded sequencer control and a built in speaker roland released first official software
