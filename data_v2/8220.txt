gateway protection programme is a scheme operated by british government in partnership with united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr and co funded by european union eu offering a legal route for a quota of unhcr identified refugees to be resettled in united kingdom following a proposal by british home secretary david blunkett in october 2001 legal basis was established by nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 and programme itself launched in march 2004 since its inception programme has enjoyed broad support from uk s main political parties gateway protection programme initially had a quota of 500 refugees per year which was later increased to 750 but actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than quota permitted liberian congolese sudanese burmese ethiopian mauritanian iraqi bhutanese eritrean palestinian and somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under programme refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in england and scotland of 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012 eight are in north west region of england and three in yorkshire and humberside evaluations of programme have praised it as having a positive impact on reception of refugees by local communities but have also noted difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment in 2020 british government plans to merge gateway protection programme with uk s other resettlement programmes to create a new single resettlement scheme programme details programme is uk s quota refugee resettlement

protection programme is not first british refugee resettlement programme other informal resettlement programmes include mandate refugee scheme and uk has also participated in ten or more plan former is for so called mandate refugees who have been granted refugee status by unhcr in third countries to qualify for scheme refugees must have close ties to uk and it must also be demonstrated that uk is most appropriate country for their resettlement ten or more plan established by unhcr in 1973 and administered in uk by british red cross is for refugees requiring medical attention not available in their current location during 1990s 2 620 refugees were settled in uk through these two programmes in 2003 uk s ten or more plan had a resettlement goal of 10 people and mandate refugee scheme 300 refugees have also been resettled through specific programmes following emergencies for example 42 000 ugandan asians expelled from uganda during 1972 74 22 500 vietnamese during 1979 92 over 2 500 bosnians in 1990s and over 4 000 in 1999 a new resettlement programme was proposed by british home secretary david blunkett in october 2001 having been hinted at by previous home secretary jack straw in a speech to european conference on asylum in lisbon in june 2000 legal basis for programme s funding was established by section 59 of nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 this act was passed by house of commons by 362 votes to 74 in june 2002 and by house of lords at ninth attempt following concern about introduction of measures allowing for detention of asylum seekers in rural areas in

2016 750 804 2017 750 813 total 8 456 gateway protection programme was subsequently established in march 2004 with first refugees arriving in uk on 19 march initially programme quota was set at 500 per year british government has faced criticism from academics and practitioners over small number of refugees it has resettled in comparison with other developed states for example in 2001 countries with largest quota schemes were united states 80 000 refugees canada 11 000 and australia 10 000 initially david blunkett had intended to raise quota to 1 000 in second year of programme s operation but local councils reluctance to participate in scheme meant that it was slow to take off it has been argued that their reluctance showed that hostile attitudes towards asylum seekers had carried over to affect most genuinely needy refugees quota remained at 500 per year until 2008 09 financial year when it was increased to 750 refugees per year number of refugees resettled under scheme is small in comparison to number of asylum seekers offered protection in uk for example in 2013 17 647 initial decisions on asylum claims were made by home office of which 5 734 32 5 per cent determined applicant to be a refugee and granted them asylum 53 0 3 per cent granted humanitarian protection and 540 3 1 per cent granted discretionary leave 11 105 applications 62 9 per cent were refused worldwide there were 51 2 million forcibly displaced people at end of 2013 16 7 million of whom were refugees programme has been supported by main british political parties at national level since its inception and there has also been support from councillors from each of main parties at local authority level on occasion of tenth anniversary of scheme in 2014 refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded particularly in light of syrian refugee crisis in early 2014 amnesty international and refugee council campaigned for government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to syrian refugees above and beyond gateway quota of 750 per year to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees from rest of world anniversary of programme was also occasion of further criticism of 750 quota with some commentators arguing that this is mean spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with refugee resettlement programmes of states including united states canada and australia others such as academic jonathan darling have been more skeptical about expanding scheme for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on ability of people to claim asylum in uk he argues that we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota based scheme at expense of a more progressive asylum system furthermore he argues that hospitality of scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of compassionate repression with unhcr home office and local authorities all involved in sorting decision and consideration over which individuals are exceptional cases to exclusion of others in september 2015 in context of european migrant crisis labour party leadership candidate yvette cooper called for an increase in number of refugees resettled in uk to 10 000 prime minister david cameron subsequently announced that uk would resettle 20 000 refugees from camps in countries bordering syria over period to 2020 under vulnerable persons resettlement scheme which was established in early 2014 and is distinct from but modelled on gateway protection programme on 17 june 2019 british home secretary sajid javid announced that from 2020 a new resettlement scheme would be introduced bringing vulnerable persons resettlement scheme vulnerable children s resettlement scheme and gateway protection programme into a single programme with an initial quota of 5 000 people government stated that new programme will be simpler to operate and provide greater consistency in way that uk

uganda burmese including karen mon pa o and rohingya people from thailand ethiopians from kenya and from senegal provision was made for 1 000 iraqi refugees to be resettled in uk between 1 april 2008 and end of march 2010 in 2008 236 iraqis were resettled and as of 18 may a further 212 had been resettled in 2009 however in may 2009 programme was shut down for those iraqis resettling due to having worked in support of british occupying forces and therefore at risk for reprisals this decision was criticised as premature and mean spirited by some members of parliament nonetheless other iraqis continue to be resettled under gateway protection programme and between 2004 and 2017 a total of 1 640 iraqis were resettled as part of programme other nationalities of refugees resettled under scheme include bhutanese palestinians sierra and somalis resettlement locations in march 2009 out of 434 local authorities in uk 15 were participating in programme by 2012 a total of 18 local authorities had participated in a review of scheme academics duncan sim and laughlin note that it is clear that as with asylum seekers dispersed by uk borders agency under home office dispersal policy most refugees have been resettled away from london and south east england a policy which may lead to separation of extended families of 18 local authorities eight are in north west england and three in yorkshire and humberside first refugees resettled under programme were housed in sheffield which was first city to join scheme and which had branded itself uk s first city of sanctuary others have been housed in cities and towns including bradford brighton and hove bromley colchester hull middlesbrough motherwell norwich and manchester area including bolton bury oldham rochdale salford stockport and tameside sheffield bolton and hull have received largest numbers accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under programme between 2004 and 2012 large proportion of refugees who have been resettled in north west england has been attributed partly to strong leadership on migration issues in greater manchester in 2007 north lanarkshire council won creating integrated communities category in uk housing awards for its involvement in gateway protection programme research with congolese refugees settled with north lanarkshire council in motherwell has found that majority want to stay in town and that they view it positively both as a location in its own right and in comparison with other resettlement locations in april 2007 bolton museum held an exhibition of photos of sudanese refugees resettled in town under programme a film titled moving to mars was made about two ethnic karen families resettled from burma to sheffield under gateway protection programme film opened sheffield international documentary festival in november 2009 and was aired on television channel more4 on 2 february 2010 one ethnic karen refugee resettled with his family in sheffield in 2006 heh signed a professional contract to play football for sheffield united f c in march 2015 on 17 july 2009 three congolese men resettled in norwich under programme were killed in a car crash on a1 road home office released a promotional video in october 2009 that highlighted success of programme in resettling first 15 congolese families in norwich in 2006 in 2011 home office stopped using norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in yorkshire and lancashire reportedly to disappointment of local council evaluations resettlement has been presented as a means of uk fulfilling its obligations towards displaced people in context of hostile public attitudes towards asylum seekers research has shown that members of british public are generally well disposed to providing protection to genuine refugees but are sceptical about validity of asylum seekers claims a report published in 2005 states that some participating agencies have been reluctant to pursue a proactive media strategy due to local political considerations and issues relating to dispersal of asylum seekers however in february 2006 parliamentary under secretary of state for home department andy burnham when asked about how programme fitted in with community cohesion strategies stated in house of commons that early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of attacks on notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years in bolton and sheffield in particular towns have rallied around individuals who have come to them programme has been a positive experience for receiving community and of course for vulnerable individuals who have benefited from protection that those towns have offered a report into experience of refugees resettled in brighton and hove under scheme between october 2006 and october 2007 was published by sussex centre for migration research at university of sussex in december 2007 report found that refugees had struggled to gain employment and english language skills another evaluation report undertaken for home office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs in february 2009 home office published a report evaluating effectiveness of gateway protection programme research it was based upon focused on refugees integration into british society in 18 months following their resettlement research found that refugees showed signs of integration including formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring english language skills were particular concerns younger refugees and children had made most progress no specific language lessons are provided under gateway protection programme instead gateway refugees who require help with their english language skills are provided with access to mainstream english for speakers of other languages esol courses which are run by a range of state voluntary and community based organisations however international catholic migration commission europe reports that in sheffield it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to esol classes because demand has generally exceeded supply a situation also noted by an evaluation of scheme s operation in motherwell undertaken in 2013 motherwell evaluation found that most of male refugees were in employment but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills majority of women were not in work reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision a number of programme evaluations have found that many resettled refugees have been victims of verbal or physical attacks in uk home office s 2009 evaluation notes that between one quarter and half of each of four groups of liberian and congolese refugees resettled under programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment an evaluation undertaken by academics at sheffield hallam university for home office in 2011 found that one fifth of refugees surveyed for evaluation who had been in uk for a year had been victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in uk and just over a fifth had been attacked in second six months of their resettlement many of victims of this abuse had not reported it to authorities and authors of evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between perceptions of refugee and service providers who generally suggested that community relations were good verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in 2013 motherwell
