mass by tabloids crowley s ashes were sent to karl germer in us who buried them in his garden in hampton new jersey beliefs and thought upright thumb alt symbol of thelema aleister crowley s rendition of hexagram symbol of thelema crowley s belief system thelema has been described by scholars as a religion and more specifically as both a new religious movement and as a magico religious doctrine it has also been characterised as a form of esotericism and modern paganism although holding book of law which was composed in 1904 as its central text thelema took shape as a complete system in years after 1904 in his autobiography crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to bring oriental wisdom to europe and to restore paganism in a purer form although what he meant by paganism was unclear crowley s thought was not always cohesive and was influenced by a variety of sources ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like hindu yoga and buddhism scientific naturalism and various currents within western esotericism among them ceremonial magic alchemy astrology rosicrucianism kabbalah and tarot he was steeped in esoteric teachings he had learned from hermetic order of golden dawn although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than golden dawn had done crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from south asian religious traditions like yoga and tantra into his thelemic system believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between western and eastern spiritual systems historian alex owen noted that crowley adhered to modus operandi of decadent movement throughout his life crowley believed that twentieth century marked humanity s entry to aeon of horus a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny he believed that this aeon follows on from aeon of osiris in which paternalistic religions like christianity islam and buddhism dominated world and that this in turn had followed aeon of isis which had been and dominated by goddess worship he believed that thelema was proper religion of aeon of horus and also deemed himself to be prophet of this new aeon thelema revolves around idea that human beings each have their own true will that they should discover and pursue and that this exists in harmony with cosmic will that pervades universe crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one s true will to be great work or attaining of knowledge and conversation of holy guardian angel his favoured method of doing so was through performance of abramelin operation a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th century grimoire moral code of do what thou wilt is believed by thelemites to be religion s ethical law although historian of religion marco pasi noted that this was not anarchistic or libertarian in structure as crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism magick and theology crowley believed in objective existence of magic which he chose to spell magick an older archaic spelling of word he provided various different definitions of this term over his career in his book magick in theory and practice crowley defined magick as science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will he also told his disciple karl germer that magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours mysticism is raising of oneself to their level crowley saw magick as a third way between religion and science giving equinox subtitle of method of science aim of religion within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and scientific method and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments more scientific record is better his understanding of magic was also influenced by work of anthropologist james frazer in particular view that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework unlike frazer however crowley did not see magic as a survival from past that required eradication but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit new age of science in crowley s alternative schema old systems of magic had to decline per frazer s framework so that science and magic could synthesize into magick which would simultaneously accept existence of supernatural and an experimental method crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick adopting an instrumentalist interpretation of magic science and technology sexuality played an important role in crowley s ideas about magick and his practice of it and has been described as being central to thelema he outlined three forms of sex magick autoerotic homosexual and heterosexual and argued that such acts could be used to focus magician s will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success for crowley sex was treated as a sacrament with consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a eucharist this was often manifested as cakes of light a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids gnostic mass is central religious ceremony within thelema crowley s theological beliefs were not clear historian ronald hutton noted that some of crowley s writings could be used to argue that he was an atheist while some support idea that he was a and others would bolster idea that he was a mystical monotheist on basis of teachings in book of law crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from ancient egyptian pantheon nuit and ra hoor khuit in 1928 he made claim that all true deities were derived from this trinity jason josephson storm has argued that crowley built on 19th century attempts to link early christianity to paganism such as frazer s golden bough to synthesize christian theology and neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional christianity both during his life and after it crowley has been widely described as a satanist usually by detractors crowley stated he did not consider himself a satanist nor did he worship satan as he did not accept christian world view in which satan was believed to exist he nevertheless used satanic imagery for instance by describing himself as beast 666 and referring to whore of babylon in his work while in later life he sent cards to his friends in his writings crowley occasionally identified aiwass as satan and designated him as our lord god devil at one occasion scholar of religion gordan djurdjevic stated that crowley was emphatically not a satanist if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such crowley nevertheless expressed anti christian sentiment stating that he hated christianity as socialists hate soap an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among plymouth brethren he was also accused of advocating human sacrifice largely because of a passage in book 4 in which he stated that a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is most satisfactory victim and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year this was a tongue in cheek reference to ejaculation something not realised by his critics thus reflecting their own ignorance and prejudice toward crowley personal life crowley considered himself to be one of outstanding figures of his time historian ronald hutton stated that in crowley s youth he was a self indulgent and flamboyant young man who set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms while being shielded from an outraged public opinion by his inherited wealth hutton also described crowley as having both an unappeasable desire to take control of any organisation that he belonged to and a tendency to quarrel savagely with those who challenged him crowley biographer martin booth asserted that crowley was self confident brash eccentric egotistic highly intelligent arrogant witty wealthy and when it suited him cruel similarly richard spence noted that crowley was capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty biographer lawrence sutin noted that crowley exhibited courage skill dauntless energy and remarkable focus of will while at same time showing a blind arrogance petty fits of bile and contempt for abilities of his fellow men thelemite lon milo duquette noted that crowley was by no means perfect and often alienated those who loved him dearest political views crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality with john symonds noting that he was in revolt against moral and religious values of his time crowley s political thought was studied by academic marco pasi who noted that for crowley socio political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones he was neither on political left nor right but perhaps best categorised as a conservative revolutionary despite not being affiliated with german based conservative revolutionary movement pasi described crowley s affinity to extreme ideologies of nazism and marxism leninism which aimed to violently overturn society what crowley liked about nazism and communism or at least what made him curious about them was anti christian position and revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements in their subversive powers he saw possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions and creation of a void that thelema subsequently would be able to fill crowley described democracy as an imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness and commented that book of law proclaimed that there is master and there is slave noble and serf lone wolf and herd in this attitude he was influenced by work of friedrich nietzsche and by social darwinism although he had contempt for most of british aristocracy he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as laird boleskine once describing his ideology as aristocratic communism views on race and gender crowley was bisexual and exhibited a sexual preference for women with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered in early part of his life in particular he had an attraction toward exotic women and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions kaczynski stated that when he loved he did so with his whole being but passion was typically short lived even in later life crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers largely due to his charisma during homosexual anal intercourse he usually played passive role which booth believed appealed to his masochistic side crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation commenting that a person must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion or medieval morality or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise on other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude he opposed abortion on moral grounds believing that no woman following her true will would ever desire one biographer lawrence sutin stated that blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in crowley s writings sutin thought crowley a spoiled scion of a wealthy victorian family who embodied many of worst john bull racial and social prejudices of his upper class contemporaries noting that he embodied contradiction that writhed within many western intellectuals of time deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society coupled with a fascination with people of colour crowley insulted his close jewish friend victor neuburg using anti semitic slurs and he had mixed opinions about jews as a group although he praised their sublime poetry and stated that they exhibited imagination romance loyalty probity and humanity he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some jews to exhibit avarice servility falseness cunning and rest he was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups for instance he thought that chinese people exhibited a spiritual superiority to english and praised muslims for exhibiting manliness straightforwardness subtlety and self respect crowley also exhibited a general misogyny that booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother sutin noted that crowley largely accepted notion implicitly embodied in victorian sexology of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility crowley described women as moral inferiors who had to be treated with firmness kindness and justice legacy and influence crowley has remained an influential figure both amongst occultists and in popular culture particularly that of britain but also of other parts of world in 2002 a bbc poll placed crowley seventy third in a list of 100 greatest britons richard cavendish has written of him that in native talent penetrating intelligence and determination aleister crowley was best equipped magician to emerge since seventeenth century scholar of esotericism egil described him as one of most well known figures in modern occultism scholar of esotericism wouter hanegraaff asserted that crowley was an extreme representation of dark side of occult adding that he was most notorious occultist magician of twentieth century philosopher john moore opined that crowley stood out as a modern master when compared with other prominent occult figures like george gurdjieff p d ouspensky rudolf steiner or helena blavatsky also describing him as a living embodiment of oswald spengler s faustian man biographer tobias churton considered crowley a pioneer of consciousness research hutton noted that crowley had an important place in history of modern western responses to oriental spiritual traditions while sutin thought that he had made distinctly original contributions to study of yoga in west thelema continued to develop and spread following crowley s death in 1969 o t o was reactivated in california under leadership of grady louis mcmurtry in 1985 its right to title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group society ordo templi orientis led by brazilian thelemite marcelo ramos motta another american thelemite is filmmaker kenneth anger who had been influenced by crowley s writings from a young age in united kingdom kenneth grant propagated a tradition known as typhonian thelema through his organisation typhonian o t o later renamed typhonian order also in britain an occultist known as amado crowley claimed to be crowley s son this has been refuted by academic investigation amado argued that thelema was a false religion created by crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings which amado claimed to be propagating several western esoteric traditions other than thelema were also influenced by crowley with djurdjevic observing that crowley s influence on twentieth century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous gerald gardner founder of gardnerian wicca made use of much of crowley s published material when composing gardnerian ritual liturgy and australian witch rosaleen norton was also heavily influenced by crowley s ideas more widely crowley became a dominant figure in modern pagan community l ron hubbard american founder of scientology was involved in thelema in early 1940s with jack parsons and it has been argued that crowley s ideas influenced some of hubbard s work scholars of religion asbjorn james r lewis and jesper petersen noted that despite fact that crowley was not a satanist he in many ways embodies pre satanist esoteric discourse on satan and satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy with his image and ought becoming an important influence on later development of religious satanism for instance two prominent figures in religious satanism anton lavey and michael aquino were influenced by crowley s work crowley also had a wider influence in british popular culture after his time in cefalu which had brought him to public attention in britain various literary crowleys appeared characters in fiction based upon him one of earliest was character of poet shelley in john buchan s 1926 novel dancing floor in his novel devil rides out writer dennis wheatley used crowley as a partial basis for character of damien a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic occultist dion fortune used crowley as a basis for characters in her books secrets of doctor taverner 1926 and winged bull 1935 he was included as one of figures on cover art of beatles album sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band 1967 and his motto of do what thou wilt was inscribed on vinyl of led zeppelin s album led zeppelin iii 1970 led
