dangerous with a gun and had participated in gunfights and shootouts gunman was a more common term used for these individuals in 19th and early 20th century today term gunslinger is more or less used to denote someone who is quick on draw with a pistol but can also refer to riflemen and shotgun messengers gunfighter is also one of most popular characters in western genre and has appeared in associated films video games and literature gunfighter could be a lawman outlaw cowboy or shooting exhibitionist but was more commonly a hired gun who made a living with his weapons in old west origin of term term gun slinger was used in western film drag harlan 1920 terms gunslinger and showdown were unknown in wild west gunslinger or gun slinger word was soon adopted by other western writers such as zane grey and became common usage in his introduction to shootist 1976 author swarthout says gunslinger and gunfighter are modern terms and more authentic terms for period would have been gunman shootist or bad man sometimes written as badman swarthout seems to have been correct about gunslinger but term gunfighter existed in several newspapers in 1870s and as such term existed in 19th century rosa 1969 vi bat masterson used term gunfighter in newspaper articles which he wrote about lawmen and outlaws whom he had known however joseph rosa noted that even though masterson used term gunfighter he preferred term when discussing these individuals rosa 1969 vii clay allison 1841 1887 a notorious new mexico and texas gunman and cattleman originated term shootist chuck parsons clay allison portrait of a shootist texas pioneer 1983 usage often term has been applied to men who would hire out for contract killings or at a ranch embroiled in a range war where they would earn fighting wages others like billy kid were notorious bandits and still others were lawmen like pat garrett and wyatt earp a gunfighter could be an outlaw a robber or murderer who took advantage of wilderness of frontier to hide from genteel society and to make periodic raids on it gunfighter could also be an agent of state a lone avenger but more often a sheriff whose duty was to face outlaw and bring him to justice or to personally administer it there were also a few historical cowboys who were actual gunfighters such as outlaw cowboy gang who participated in bloody skeleton canyon massacre depiction in culture right thumb gunslinger from great train robbery gunslingers frequently appear as stock characters in western movies and novels along with cowboys often hero of a western meets his opposite double a mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy western gunslinger heroes are portrayed as local lawmen or enforcement officers ranchers army officers cowboys territorial marshals nomadic loners or skilled fast draw artists they are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle courageous moral tough solid and self sufficient maverick characters often with trusty sidekicks possessing an independent and honorable attitude but often characterized as slow talking september 11 2014 they are depicted as similar to a knight errant wandering from place to place with no particular direction often facing curious and hostile enemies while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own commonly against lawlessness with an expert display of his physical skills roping gun play horse handling pioneering abilities etc in films gunslinger often possesses a nearly superhuman speed and skill with revolver twirling pistols lightning draws and trick shots are standard fare for gunmen of big screen in real world however gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress but to kill september 22 2014 another classic bit of cinema that is largely a myth is showdown at high noon where two well matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel these duels did occasionally happen as in case of luke short jim courtright duel but gunfights were typically more spontaneous a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon and no one knew who actually won fight for several minutes until air finally cleared of smoke gunfights could be won by simple distraction or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury when a gunman did square off it rarely was with another gunfighter gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth and it was uncommon for two well known gunslingers to face off gunslinger s reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed in western films and books young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with hopes of building a reputation but this rarely happened in real life a strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation in days of old west tales tended to grow with repeated telling and a single fight might grow into a career making reputation for instance gunfight at o k corral made legends of wyatt earp and outlaw cowboy gang but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict some gunslingers such as bat masterson actively engaged in self promotion johnny ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians fact and fiction thumb right gunfighters fighting off an indian attack most gunfights are portrayed in films or books as having two men square off waiting for one to make first move this was rarely case often a gunfight was spur of moment with one drawing his pistol and other reacting often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover o neal 1979 p 3 in popular folklore men who held noteworthy reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with same reputation on contrary in cases where two men held a similar reputation both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible they rarely took undue risks and usually weighed their options before confronting another well known gunman this respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well known gunmen matched up against one another but rather one notable gunman against a lesser known opponent or opponents these fights were usually close up and personal with a number of shots blasted from pistols often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild much of time it would be difficult to tell who had won gunfight for several minutes as black powder smoke from pistols cleared air how famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man many well known gunfighters were so feared by public because of their reputation that when they were killed they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a blaze of glory others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness mythology and folklore often exaggerate skills of famous gunfighters most of these historical figures were not known to be capable of trick shooting nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision such tropes that are frequently seen in westerns include shooting center of a coin stylistic pistol twirling glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent bullet through hat being an example shooting an opponent s belt buckle thus dropping his pants a bullet cutting hangman s rope or shooting guns out of opponents hands typically as an alternative to killing last was debunked by mythbusters as an impossibility as bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill ed mcgivern dispelled myth of inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning revolver ed mcgivern s book of fast and fancy revolver shooting skyhorse publishing inc 2007 pp 101 103 in western movies characters gun belts are often worn low on hip and outer thigh with holster cut away around pistol s trigger and grip for a smooth fast draw this type of holster is a hollywood anachronism fast draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh long before holsters were steel lined they were soft and supple for comfortable all day wear a gunfighter would use tie downs to keep his pistol from catching on holster while drawing most of time gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and june 7 2012 wild bill hickok popularized butt forward holster type which worked better on horseback other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen cowboys and lawmen because of their and effectiveness on horseback winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters dubbed gun that won west it was widely used during settlement of american frontier shotguns were also a popular weapon for express messengers and guards especially those on stagecoaches and trains who were in charge of overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment quick draw and hip shooting was a rare skill in west september 20 2011 and only a handful of historically known gunslingers were known to be fast such as luke short john wesley hardin and wild bill hickok shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers and is also a standard for them of era to carry two guns and fire capt jonathan r davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight while jesse james himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights gunfighters king fisher john wesley hardin ben thompson billy kid wild bill hickok and pat garrett all died as a result of ambush killed by men who feared them because of their reputation

tom horn were executed famed gunman clay allison died in a wagon accident gunmen wyatt earp bat masterson bass reeves commodore perry owens and luke short all died of natural causes living out their lives on reputation and avoiding conflict in secluded retirement gunfighter and lawman frank eaton known as pistol pete lived into old age and gained further fame before his death at age 97 by becoming mascot for oklahoma a m college now oklahoma state university rare are gunfighters who like william sidney cap light died accidentally by their own hand famous gunfights image of a wild west filled with countless gunfights was a myth generated primarily by dime novel authors in late 19th century an estimate of 20 000 men in american west were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900 and over 21 586 total casualties during american indian wars from 1850 to 1890 most notable and well known took place in states territories of arizona new mexico kansas oklahoma and texas november 21 2011 actual gunfights in old west were very rare very few and far between but when gunfights did occur cause for each varied some were simply result of heat of moment while others were longstanding feuds or between bandits and lawmen lawless violence such as range wars like lincoln county war and clashes with indians were also a cause some of these shootouts became famous while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving to prevent gunfights from happening many cities in american frontier such as dodge city and tombstone put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in area gunfight at ok corral is a famous example of a real life western shootout between earp brothers together with doc holliday and clanton mclaury gang it lasted only 30 seconds contrary to many movie adaptations gunfight itself did not actually happen in corral but in a vacant lot outside of it shooting started when billy clanton and frank mclaury cocked their pistols both parties simultaneously drew their guns which added to confusion of who fired first it is not known who fired first shot but wyatt s bullet was first to hit tearing through frank mclaury s belly and sending mclaury s own shot wild through wyatt s billy clanton fired at virgil but his shot also went astray when he was hit with morgan s shot through his ribcage billy claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight ike clanton panicked as well and ran towards wyatt pleading for his life go to fighting or get away wyatt yelled and watched ike desert his brother billy and run doc instantly

frontier university of california press march 23 1987 pp 99 100 living on reputation most old west men who were labeled as being gunfighters did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for if any at all they were often labeled as such due to one particular instance which developed from rumors into them having been involved in many more events than they actually were often their reputation was as much self promotion as anything else such was case of bat masterson wyatt earp with his brothers morgan and virgil along with doc holliday killed three outlaw cowboys in gunfight at o k corral in tombstone arizona territory he has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime but prof bill o neal cites just five incidents in his encyclopedia of western gunfighters earp expressed his dismay about controversy that followed him his entire life he wrote in a letter to john hays hammond on may 21 1925 that notoriety had been bane of my life after his brother virgil was maimed in an ambush and morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants men suspected of involvement were provided alibis by fellow cowboys and released without trial wyatt and his brother warren set out on a vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless western hero he is often viewed as central character and hero of gunfight at o k corral at least in part because he was only one who was not wounded or killed in fact his brother tombstone marshal and deputy u s marshal virgil earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a union soldier in civil war and in law enforcement as a sheriff constable and marshal as city marshal virgil made decision to disarm cowboys in tombstone and requested wyatt s assistance but because wyatt outlived virgil and due to a creative biography wyatt earp frontier marshal published two years after wyatt s death wyatt became famous and subject of various movies television shows biographies and works of fiction there are no records to support reputation that johnny ringo developed of documented instances where ringo killed men they were unarmed and there is no evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight others deserved reputation associated with them jim courtright and dallas stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians metz leon claire 1979 dallas stoudenmire el paso marshal norman university of oklahoma press 162 p clay allison and ben

gunmen like scott cooley are all but unknown when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be in other cases certain gunfighters were possibly confused over time with being someone else with a similar name most well known of butch cassidy s wild bunch gang sundance kid was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime and no gunfights some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another wild bunch member kid curry who was without a doubt most dangerous member of gang having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself hence it is sundance kid who is better known outlaw or lawman it is often difficult to separate lawmen of old west from outlaws of old west in many cases term gunfighter was applied to constables despite idealistic portrayals in television movies and even in history books very few lawmen gunfighters could claim their law enforcement role as their only source of employment unlike contemporary peace officers these lawmen generally pursued other occupations often earning money as gamblers business owners or outlaws as was case with curly bill brocius who while always referred to as an outlaw served as a deputy sheriff under sheriff johnny behan many shootouts involving lawmen were caused by disputes arising from these alternative occupations rather than lawman s attempts to enforce law p 117 tom horn historically cited as an assassin served both as a deputy sheriff and as a pinkerton detective a job in which he shot at least three people as a killer for hire ben thompson best known as a gunfighter and gambler was a very successful chief of police in austin texas king fisher had great success as a county sheriff in texas doc holliday and billy kid both wore badges as lawmen at least once p 31 big steve long served as deputy marshal for laramie wyoming while entire time committing murders and forced theft of land deeds a town with a substantial violent crime rate would often turn to a known gunman as their town marshal chief or sheriff in hopes that gunman could stem violence and bring order known gunmen lawmen were generally effective and in time violence would subside usually after gunman lawman had been involved in several shooting incidents eventually leading to a substantial and well earned fear that kept everyone in line rosa 1969 p 7 8 at times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars although sanctioned by law enforcement officials gunmen were not always actually deputized sometimes however just to make things official they would go through formality of a case in point service of jesse evans gang and outlaw jesse evans himself as agents for murphy dolan faction during lincoln county war while technically working as lawmen they were little more than hired guns usually when a gunman was hired by a town as town marshal they received full support of townspeople until order was restored at which point town would tactfully indicate it was time for a change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce law a good example was 1882 decision by el paso texas town council to dismiss town marshal dallas stoudenmire he entered council hall and dared councilors to try to take his guns or his job at which point they immediately changed their mind saying he could keep his job he resigned on his own a couple of days later legacy modern gunslinger thumb right upright a cowboy
