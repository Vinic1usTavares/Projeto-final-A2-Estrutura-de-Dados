genre work consisted of two episodes of television series wonder woman as well as a single episode of buck rodgers he was better known for his work on soap operas such as general hospital and another world he pitched stories for star trek animated series on basis that show targeted an adult audience similar to star trek original series and not children he knew it was going to be broadcast on saturday mornings but would be unhampered by restrictions on live action television he later said that was one of reasons why i took it because i m not an animated writer i had written a couple of animated shows through years and it was like pulling teeth he explained that he wrote script for survivor as if it was a live action story it was originally known as chameleon title was eventually changed in order to preserve plot point as a surprise for viewer he had known producer d c fontana for several years and pitched his story directly to her in turn she relayed it to franchise creator gene roddenberry who called schmerer back for a meeting together they re wrote story during meeting to make it fit within 30 minute long animated episode schmerer explained that roddenberry appreciated idea of an alien pretending to be other characters and that animated series could easily show shapeshifter undergo various changes in episode design of vendorian had been described by schmerer in script but was changed to squid like design by animators a change that schmerer described as neat and clever in original outline vendorian didn t assume role of kirk added by roddenberry schmerer did not agree with change roddenberry and schmerer argued about point with roddenberry saying that kirk was star of series while schmerer wanted it to be different as he was concerned that its plot would appear too similar to events of whom gods destroy where garth of changes his appearance to become kirk casting ted knight did uncredited voice acting for character carter winston reception and home media release survivor was first broadcast on nbc on october 13 1973 edward gross senior editor of cinescape magazine rates survivor as an above average episode that definitely has feeling of a live action star trek show altman gross 1998 p 231 marc altman compared it to other similarly themed episodes such as man trap which featured a shape changing alien and a lost love and said shape changing alien is a familiar genre and trekkian trope romantic twist in which vendorian spy betrays his romulan masters for love is a nice surprise altman gross 1998 p 230 michelle erica green in her review for treknation found that voice work was distracting due to similarity between william shatner s and ted knight s voices as well as having nichelle nichols voice a different character she also thought that alien looked silly and felt that plot had been reused from man trap in 2012 chris cummins listed eight best episodes of animated series for website topless robot he
