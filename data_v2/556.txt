posted online on 4 april 2005 gunnerkrigg court archive and was originally updated two days per week comic began updating three days per week on 25 december 2006 end of seventh chapter in may 2006 marked end of first book see author s comment on chapter 7 page 23 in which he identifies that chapter at end of first book bonus page 7 last page in that chapter was posted on 22 may 2006 which siddell published through lulu com in 2007 that book is no longer in print in august 2008 tom siddell explained that comic had a standard comic book format which was useful when he had sufficient pages to print a hard copy first fourteen chapters of webcomic were printed as first archaia studios press edition of 296 pages bound in a hardcover collection titled orientation in 2012 he announced that he had quit his regular job to work on comic full time in addition to books and merchandising comic is supported through crowdfunding by since july 2014 format gunnerkrigg court webcomic is told in a series of episodic chapters such that each while forming part of overall storyline also functions individually as a stand alone story arc each of chapters individually is sort of a self contained thing so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn t be like you had no idea what was going on themes and topics of chapters vary widely as one reviewer describes you are also not subjected to 400 plus pages of intricate plot movement while there is an overall story arc there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes or small moments that build main characters each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more bonus pages which are not integral to main storyline but often offer ancillary details about world of gunnerkrigg court or about minor characters chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty each page is drawn in traditional a4 210 x 297 mm page all my pages are made in traditional page format form start p 15 and divided arbitrarily into frames see for example chapter 19 page 14 and chapter 6 page 5 for examples of different styles at bottom of most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page in which readers may comment on and discuss that day s comic influences siddell has stated that he enjoyed reading alfred hitchcock three investigators as a child and that it has heavily influenced literary style of his comic his artistic style is influenced by many artists among which he cites as his favorites jamie hewlett yukito kishiro and mike mignola as well as manga nausicaa of valley of wind and dragon ball one notable feature of comic is blending of mythological elements from many different cultural traditions especially from british isles and native american mythology comic contains characters such as black dog and mallt y nos of welsh mythology for example as well as from cahuilla and coyote a legend shared by many native american cultures there are also characters based on old french folklore such as reynard and ysengrin siddell attributes this style to his experience as a child i moved about a lot when i was younger and had opportunity to grow up hearing stories from different parts of world and i ve always been fascinated by them in addition to mythology siddell makes heavy use of alchemical themes for example main character is named antimony after a toxic chemical element woodruff please note that there is an element named same as lead character antimony it is metal deathly toxic like arsenic and one of its poisoning symptoms is depression alchemical symbol for antimony looks like an upside down version of symbol for female as well there is more but i m pretty convinced that name of main character was no accident p 12 and many pages feature artistic depictions of alchemical symbols see for example chapter 5 page 12 symbol for antimony appears frequently in gunnerkrigg court character antimony wears a necklace shaped like that symbol character reynardine has symbol imprinted on his wolf body and symbol is used to mark end of a chapter artwork of gunnerkrigg court has been described as stylized with simple character designs what he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony at least one reviewer on other hand has noticed that backgrounds in contrast to characters are often very elaborate his characters are really simple and some of his backgrounds are really complicated comic has also been described as having a rich look in spite of its limited color palette i love his use of color too in particular because he never has more than like ten colors on average page but it looks really really rich and siddell himself has stated that he first developed idea for comic using only a limited number of colors siddell i did another sketch right after that of same girl and wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup pieces of artwork that siddell has posted at end of each printed book entitled treatise and second treatise demonstrate many such of siddell s artistic and storytelling motifs they integrate alchemical symbols mythological figures nature and technology synopsis right thumb second treatise an image by tom siddell that shows characters antimony r and kat l and exemplifies siddell s artistic styles and narrative motifs setting gunnerkrigg court is set in a boarding school in a country that resembles united kingdom identifiable from grey skies and mandatory uniforms comic contains other clues about setting such as house system that is described at end of first chapter this system is similar to that used by many uk schools including one author attended siddell i used to be in north same class carver is in and other house names at court are same as they were in my old school p 6 siddell has even stated that school in which gunnerkrigg court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school siddell school side of court is very much based on my secondary school right down to names of houses and various other aspects p 11 gunnerkrigg court fictional place around which story revolves is a mysterious and vast establishment that many characters suspect hides much more than just a school see chapter 8 page 27 antimony this isn t just a school is it and chapter 19 page 8 of gunnerkrigg court school appears to actively recruit many talented or extraordinary students characters zimmy and gamma for example were approached before opening of main story by mysterious men who offered to take them to school see siddell tom chapter 11 page 11 gunnerkrigg court as story progresses it is soon revealed that school is inhabited by a wide variety of both supernatural creatures many of which become characters involved in story s plot and ultra modern technology this place of higher learning has robots that run around alongside body snatching demons forest gods and odd mythical creature one character explains that court was founded on a union between technological and etheric design another describes it as man s endeavor to become god court is built on edge of a wide chasm on other side of which lies gillitie wood which is inhabited by etheric or magical creatures at time when main story takes place two sides exist in a kind of truce with court as realm of science and technology and wood realm of nature and etheric technological world of gunnerkrigg court and mystical world of gillitie woods co exist uneasily jones there was a great division which saw court and wood separated nature on one side technology on other coyote with my mighty paw i scored earth and so court and forest were divided denizens of gillitie wood do not allow technology in wood reynardine people of forest will be wanting answers they detest all forms of technology why do you think there is such a divide between court and that damned place and rules of court forbid students from leaving school grounds plot story of gunnerkrigg court involves several different ongoing plot arcs main story is that of protagonist antimony carver and her deepening involvement in intrigues between gunnerkrigg court and gillitie wood forest outside gunnerkrigg court she is accompanied throughout storyline by her friend and classmate katerina donlan and her companion reynardine a demon living within her stuffed animal as story progresses antimony and her companions also slowly learn more about their surroundings relationship between gunnerkrigg court and gillitie wood and beings they encounter story begins when antimony builds a robot to transport a mysterious shadow into gillitie wood forest outside gunnerkrigg court antimony as i was forbidden from setting foot off school grounds i could not walk shadow 2 to gillitie wood myself there was only one sensible resolution to this problem i must construct a robotic walking device which will provide you with transit across bridge several chapters later in comic and apparently several months later in story s timeline robot reappears on bridge outside gunnerkrigg court being controlled by a malevolent creature from gillitie wood it pushes antimony off bridge when she goes out to it antimony spends a night at banks of river below bridge and encounters a ghost before she is rescued by kat and taken back to school her brief time outside gunnerkrigg court though sets off a dispute between gunnerkrigg court and gillitie wood not long after antimony s return court is visited by coyote a god from gillitie wood and general ysengrin being who caused robot to attack antimony at bridge they express anger over robot s visit to forest and over damage antimony caused when she left court ysengrin this was recently found on our side of annan waters mrs donlan it s one of those birds ysengrin it had been there several months by time i discovered it it had already rooted itself into shore and caused considerable damage to cliff face headmaster where do you wish to begin general ysengrin perhaps with death of one of our people at hands of sir eglamore no less during time that robot is gone antimony meets a creature called reynardine who tries to take over her body but by accident instead becomes trapped in body of a stuffed animal she carries and becomes subject to her command because of her relationship with reynardine and events with coyote and ysengrin antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium one of individuals who moderate disputes between wood and court and communicates with etheric beings jones usually individuals who can remain unbiased and objective are chosen as mediums in interests of diplomacy they undertake a role when need arises and she decides to return to woods to speak with coyote when antimony visits coyote she learns that in past coyote had travelled across sea to find renard called later reynardine and ysengrin and make them into powerful being s like himself antimony why were you looking for renard in first place why bring him here coyote i sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself he had given ysengrin power over trees and given reynardine power to take bodies but bodies that reynardine took always died after he left for some reason when renard had ability to take bodies any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up and ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without help of coyote s tree armor reynardine had been in love with antimony s mother surma coyote i wouldn t be surprised if he cared very deeply about you antimony you see renard fell desperately in love with surma and had used his power to steal a young man s body and woo surma man died however and reynardine was imprisoned in gunnerkrigg court until events surrounding his first meeting with antimony coyote reynardine soon runs away he steals body of a young man and disappears into court looking to woo fiery surma we heard he was captured tricked and i did not see him again until last summer in addition to this plotline story includes several additional plot arcs interspersed with main story one concerns two girls from court zimmy and gamma who communicate with one another telepathically zimmy sees hallucinations of monsters which her etheric abilities turn into reality which she relies on gamma to dispel zimmy yer gonna have ta take gamma s place gettin ridda these guys in one chapter antimony and another student jack also become trapped briefly in zimmy s hallucinatory world and escape after they find gamma there another storyline revolves around kat s attempts to repair antimony s robot which had been temporarily taken control of when it pushed her off bridge during which time they discover a set of highly complex robots that antimony speculates are related in some way to ghost she encountered at river main characters antimony carver protagonist of gunnerkrigg court eventually revealed to have fire elemental ancestry she came to school after her mother s death has a way with etheric or magical beings that inhabit court and gillitie wood jones you have a special empathy with etheric beings as you saw when we met coyote she is able to see and communicate with guides mort you mean you could see guides just like that spirits that lead humans into afterlife antimony kat do you remember i told you about psychopomps kat uh those guys who escort dead dudes to afterlife acts as a medium between gillitie wood and court as her mother did before her antimony yes lessons in mediation sound interesting jones very good we will begin today katerina kat donlan antimony s closest friend daughter of two teachers at court mr and mrs donlan whereas antimony has close contacts with supernatural kat is gifted in formal sciences robots in court started to regard her as an angel and later creator kat is in a relationship with fellow student paz reynardine or interchangeably renard a fox spirit that can take others bodies referred to as a demon on behalf of court by eglamore eglamore reynardine is never to be trusted he is a demon that steals bodies of his victims he is now trapped in body of antimony s doll and is subject to her command reynardine this stupid toy is hers so now i can t do anything without her permission in addition to inhabiting antimony s doll he may also take form of a white wolf he is very protective of antimony kat that was pretty cute how you got all defensive about annie before which one character claims is because reynardine had once been in love with antimony s mother which he later admits reynardine is a cousin and former companion of coyote s but has been confined to gunnerkrigg court because he killed and possessed a young man in past led by coyote into belief that this would win him antimony s mother affection which in turn made him fall in love with her acting under orders from court who feared him as coyote s successor coyote won t you come back to forest with us dearest cousin reynardine you know how i feel about that besides i broke their laws remember i couldn t leave even if i wanted to antimony but why is reynardine being held at court coyote why he killed that young man of course however it is suggested in various conversations that he remains there not because of men s laws but actually for bond he has formed with annie sir james jimmy jims eglamore instructor for physical education classes and protector of court he shares his name with a knight from a northumbrian folk song francis james child english and scottish popular ballads v 1 p 209 dover publications new york 1965 and some characters have referred to him as a dragon slayer antimony who is he dragon slayer shackle from his prison binds my leg eglamore formal attire you know how it is antimony for a dragon slayer eglamore haha well that s just an official title he also was in same class at court as annie and kat s parents he made an appearance in webcomic sandra and woo zeta zimmy a student at court zimmy claims that she never sleeps zimmy gamma tries to stay awake as long as i do but i don t sleep antimony you don t sleep zimmy never she frequently travels to a nightmare like world recreated from scenes in her past and sometimes other characters accidentally end up there as well she has fangs and a black substance obscuring her eyes and rain seems to have calming effects on her along with revealing for a short time that her eyes are red zimmy stuff happens when i m around you see sometimes i see things that ain t supposed to be there when it gets bad things start to change like for real gamma zimmy s girlfriend gamma is able to calm zimmy when she is seeing things or in dream world blocking static as is antimony to a lesser extent zimmy gamma helps me put things straight it s like turning on a radio all she has to do is be near me an static gets pushed out kinda works with you though not as good as gamma but it helps noticed that when we first met she and zimmy share a telepathic link speaks only polish and communicates with others by allowing zimmy to translate for her shadow 2 a second shadow that began to follow antimony when she first came to court kat and annie have taught him how to speak english kat we could probably teach him english real fast in recent chapters shadow 2 has become 3 dimensional but retains all of his shape shifting abilities robot an anthropomorphic robot antimony built he is a model s13 with s standing for seraph antimony what does s stand for robot seraph as i recall his original body though simple in appearance was of a highly complex design kat these old models are so complex i can t figure them out one thing s for sure these things don t use or hydraulics or anything like that some kind of reaction memory polymer he was later destroyed by mr eglamore replacement bodies have included a robotic mouse he is seemingly in some sort of relationship with shadow 2 he has developed into a driving force in robots belief that kat is in fact an angel general ysengrin a creature who lives in gillitie wood he is a wolf but was given a suit of roots and boughs by coyote covering his body up to neck usually in a humanoid shape though he can alter it at will through his power over trees of forest ysengrin you should admire this body lord coyote has gifted me with renard now very trees of gillitie are under my command he appears to leave it sometimes for example to eat coyote a god who lives in wood he is also known as trickster although jones claims that he never lies and therein lies danger currently dead he fused with ysengrin to become loup jones instructor in charge of training mediums some characters think she is romantically involved with mr eglamore antimony i think there might be something going on between him and ms jones she is incredibly strong sinks like a rock when she is in water and does not seem to show any emotion leading some to believe that she was a robot despite fact that gunnerkrigg court robots are anything but emotionless and that she herself denied theory coyote calls her wandering eye when he encounters her and accuses her of stealing name jones implying also that she has done this before with other names something jones does not deny it was revealed she has existed since formation
