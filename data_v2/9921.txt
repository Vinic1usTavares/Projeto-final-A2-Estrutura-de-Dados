whitechapel in east end of london between august and november 1888 authorities are not agreed on exact number of ripper s victims and at least eleven whitechapel murders between april 1888 and february 1891 were included in same extensive police investigation all crimes remain unsolved claims that bury could have been ripper began to appear in newspapers shortly after bury s arrest like bury ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths evans and skinner p 207 and bury lived in bow near whitechapel from october 1887 to january 1889 which placed him fairly near whitechapel murders at appropriate time woods and baddeley p 253 dundee advertiser of 12 february claimed that burys neighbours were startled and alarmed at idea that one whom in their terror they associated with whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst quoted in beadle p 277 and macpherson p 31 new york times of same day connected bury directly to atrocities and reported theory that william had murdered ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt quoted in beadle p 278 a story picked up and repeated by dundee courier following day quoted in macpherson p 33

ripper beadle p 241 macpherson p 21 bury denied any connection despite making a full confession to his wife s murder nevertheless executioner james berry promoted idea that bury was ripper evans and skinner p 208 berry did not include bury or ripper in his memoirs my experiences as an executioner macpherson p 186 but ernest a parr a journalist in suffolk town of newmarket wrote to secretary of state for scotland on 28 march 1908 that berry told me explicitly that bury was known to have been jack ripper quoted by evans and skinner p 208 and macpherson pp 186 187 in 1920s norman hastings built on berry s hypothesis proposing bury as ripper weekly news 26 october 1929 quoted in beadle pp 281 311 and 100 years after ripper murders william beadle and dundee librarian euan macpherson published books and articles popularising bury as a ripper suspect e g beadle william 1995 jack ripper anatomy of a myth quoted in woods and baddeley p 253 macpherson euan january 1988 jack ripper in dundee scots magazine quoted in richard whittington egan s foreword in macpherson p 11 they highlighted that canonical five whitechapel murders ended in november 1888 which roughly coincided with bury

beadle p 248 woods and baddeley p 253 and macpherson supposed this was written by bury as a form of confession macpherson p 32 william took ellen s rings and ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim annie chapman beadle p 264 bury was persistently violent to his wife threatened her with a knife and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to whitechapel murderer macpherson pp 188 189 in a conversation with her neighbours marjory smith who ran shop above burys prince s street flat in dundee asked them what sort of work was this you whitechapel folk have been about letting jack ripper kill so many people bury did not answer her but ellen replied jack ripper is quiet now she reportedly told another neighbour jack ripper is taking a rest macpherson p 74 beadle and macpherson argued that ellen s comments might indicate that she had knowledge of ripper s whereabouts e g macpherson p 75 others contend that bury only imitated ripper citing differences between their crimes beadle p 262 ellen bury was strangled with a rope and sustained comparatively few knife wounds compared to ripper s victims whose throats were cut prior to sustaining deep abdominal slashes ellen bury s throat was not cut and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen e g beadle p 260 macpherson pp 172 173 identity of whitechapel murderer is unknown and over one hundred suspects in addition to bury have been proposed whiteway ken 2004 a guide to literature of jack ripper canadian law library review vol 29 pp 219 229eddleston pp 195 244 while some ripper writers consider bury a more likely culprit than many of other suspects e g eddleston pp 200 202 other writers dismiss theory because as happens all too frequently in this field theorizing appears to
