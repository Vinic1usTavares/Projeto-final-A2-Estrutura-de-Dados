people thumb 300px right him performing at helsinki ice hall on 27 december 2017 tour was generally well received by critics eve smallman of nottingham post said that him truly went out with a bang overall atmosphere of shows was described as celebratory exciting yet solemn by billboard s katy kroll guardian s graeme virtue concluded his review by stating that in an era saturated with cash in reunions it is refreshing to see a band devil sign off on their own eccentric terms pasi of ilta sanomat commented how him never became journeymen whose only fuel for touring was just nostalgia noting how their show at helsinki ice hall featured a band with more fury and character than most performers ever jussi of helsingin sanomat touted band s show at tuska meeting all expectations henri praised band s stage presence and overall performance at tuska he described valo s performance as possibly best man has ever sounded loudwire s graham hartmann touted valo as sounding perfect entire night at band s show in new york rest of band also received praise with uotila of etela suomen sanomat noting how all members got their respective moments to shine singling out linde lindstrom s solo in wicked game as a particular highlight while tour was mostly well received billboard s katy kroll noted technical difficulties hindering band s show in new york and nita makkonen of ilta sanomat gave a less favorable review for band s appearance at miljoona rock describing band s performance as lacking atmosphere and valo as looking bored visa of mtv uutiset felt similarly likening valo s performance at helsinki ice hall to a karaoke night and stating that at ice hall we saw a him that won t be missed in slightest zach of dead press gave band s show in manchester a mixed review noting how band seemed to be going through motions and ultimately called show mostly a yawn orgy and unfortunately a bittersweet farewell ticket sales for tour s final five dates caused some controversy tickets for helldone shows were named specific to buyer and attendees were required to show matching identification upon entry to venue this caused some controversy among concertgoers because if several tickets had been purchased to a large party and buyer was unable to attend other ticket holders were not allowed entrance to venue ticket offices did not provide option of changing name only allowing resale of tickets back to seller this policy was taken in order to reduce scalping with organizer commenting him has always been surrounded by a ticket scam mentality and that s why this policy has been in effect for
