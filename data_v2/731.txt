production thumb pop rock singer mark mcgrath was one of several guest stars for episode a a r m was written by executive producer brent forrester marking his eleventh writing credit for series his first since earlier season episode work bus it was directed by regular office editor david rogers marking his ninth directing credit and first since earlier season episode junior salesman episode was originally supposed to air as a half hour episode but nbc later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot unlike previous episodes that were expanded like moving on and livin dream a a r m counts as two produced episodes this episode guest stars aaron rodgers clay aiken mark mcgrath santigold and jessica st clair in order to get them show reached out to a small group of celebrities that producers thought would be good both aiken and santigold accepted baumgartner then asked rodgers who was a friend and he accepted mcgrath later became available and he was chosen as well angela s son phillip was played by twins vince and evan edwards child that filmed scene in which phillip picked beet was only supposed to point to beet in end child said beet which rogers called amazing voice of documentarian that responds to jim is that of episode director david rogers rogers also voiced same character in season opener new guys originally showrunner and series creator greg daniels had re recorded line in new guys but ended up liking rogers voice better he asked him to reprise role in a a r m to preserve continuity jules designed portraits of dwight and mose as well as dwight s propaganda picture he had previously created pam s watercolor of dunder mifflin that hung on walls all of dances moves were choreographed by mary ann kellogg who had choreographed many of series dance heavy episodes obstacle course in warehouse was crafted by rogers and forrester with input from show s art department wilson also helped since he eventually was one who ran through it it was his idea to have course terminate on a raised palette of boxes originally course was supposed to be in parking lot but rogers moved it feeling that warehouse was more organic and that heat would have been detrimental to finished product idea to have jim finally give pam his card had been considered in writers room for some time but only during a a r m did writers feel it was right time card and envelope was same one used for christmas party almost seven years prior in fact card contained a genuine message that krasinski wrote for fischer rogers admitted that pam and jim video was inspired by a number of fan videos that exist on internet reason that open your eyes by snow patrol plays over video is that claire scanlon series editor felt that it was similar in style to sing by travis which played in second season episode client episode contained several scenes that were reminiscent of past episodes of series shot in which jim and dwight survey office was filmed to be similar to a scene that featured dwight and michael in third season installment gay witch hunt in addition dwight pulling angela over was filmed in a way that recalled sixth season episode delivery although scene wherein jim gives advice to dwight was shot in a similar manner to jim s farewell to michael in seventh season episode goodbye michael it was not intentionally supposed to look like it according to rogers in addition obstacle course was not a direct reference to second season episode office olympics although rogers understood that there were similarities cultural references jim references both michael j fox and 1985 film back to future during his nonsense conference room meeting dwight realizes that phillip is his son after child looks at a small scale replica of battlestar galactica fictional ship from science fiction series of same name in same way that dwight does dwight s test to see if phillip is his son has been compared to a similar scene in 1997 film kundun in which tibetan monks practice a similar ritual to win over kevin angela and oscar pretend that baby phillip presented him with an itunes gift card darryl and rest of office dance to song boogie wonderland by

close to non documentary viewing portion of series m giant of television without pity was pleased with episode and awarded it an a grade first for series since goodbye michael almost two seasons ago jenna mullins of e online wrote that episode was full of emotional moments that seemed like love letters to fans who have watched show since pilot mullins also praised scenes between jim and pam noting that we collapsed in tears because couple we ve been rooting for can still find ways to make us cry nick campbell of tv com felt that episode was a decent if uneven penultimate episode that gave us one last look at this quirky group of people in their office environment he was largely happy with return of fun loving version of jim noting that pam mentioned that she loves goofy jim and i have to admit i love goofy jim myself campbell felt that episode dabbled in fan service but that it was expected and needed for show to have a successful ending roth cornet of ign awarded episode an 8 5 out of 10 denoting a great episode she wrote that interplay between jim dwight and pam has been core of series since michael scott s departure and it was good to see trio front and center once again as office comes to a close furthermore cornet was happy with dwight s proposal and dance party that signaled darryl s leaving calling latter a slice of bliss erik adams of a v club gave episode a b he said that what benefits aarm most is a back to basics jim and dwight storyline that illustrated growth that characters have experienced in last nine years he wrote that there were many tender moments in episode such as dwight and jim s confrontation pam and jim s reaffirmation of love and dwight s proposal to angela he concluded that it s that blend of new beginnings and closing circles that makes aarm an effective second to last chapter of office dan forcella of tv fanatic awarded episode four and a half stars out of five and wrote that episode didn t disappoint he called scene in which pam was watching docu created montage just as jim was giving dwight love advice most emotionally rewarding moment on office since michael scott s goodbye many critics were extremely pleased with call back to teapot and jim s note from christmas party adams felt that scene before reveal of note was properly executed and that note made it even better sepinwall called it a fabulous payoff for longtime fans cornet called sequence effective rick porter of zap2it wrote that it was a nice move on part of writers for not letting us know what jim wrote on card from christmas party because it has to be pretty epic conversely most critics gave andy s plot a negative review sepinwall called entire plot campbell referred to it as a mediocre story that stood in stark contrast to emotional timbre of rest of episode cornet called scenes just as disconnected from core of show as that character has for some time now porter wrote that show never quite got a handle on what to do with character this season and his subplot in a a r m was culmination of this issue references external links a a r m at nbc com category 2013 american television episodes category office american season 9 episodes category
