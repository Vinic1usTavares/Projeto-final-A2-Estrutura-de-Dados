halfway to sanity is 10th studio album by american punk band ramones and their last album to feature drummer richie ramone it was produced by daniel rey and released on september 15 1987 by sire records recording sessions began that april at intergalactic studios in new york city with band recording instruments before vocals in order to learn songs more quickly it fared well on charts outside united states but peaked at no 172 on billboard 200 band members disagreed on many things rey described them as impatient band toured world following album s release but certain show dates were cancelled after richie left band because he did not feel he was getting paid enough band hired blondie drummer clem burke who took pseudonym elvis ramone for two shows until marky ramone returned genres varied significantly throughout album with some songs showing influence of hard rock heavy metal music and crossover thrash while also containing songs with a bubblegum pop feel additionally joey is heard singing a duet with blondie vocalist debbie harry on go lil camaro go this resulted in mixed critical reviews nevertheless stephen thomas erlewine later wrote album was last time band still sounded like they mattered halfway to sanity marked final time dee dee ramone s bass playing would be featured on a ramones album he appeared on their next album brain drain as a songwriter and vocalist but several session bassists were employed in his place recording and production prior to producing album daniel rey had opened for ramones in late 1970s as a member of shrapnel he had worked with lead singer joey ramone and lead guitarist johnny ramone separately when writing songs for too tough to die melnick meyer 2007 p xxi i was producing a lot of young bands in my basement rey explained johnny heard one and said it s better than our last record he knew that he could get me cheap and i was only person who got along with johnny and joey at same time drummer richie ramone however did not get along with rey saying that two would butt heads often due to fact that he only liked writing songs with one other person richie has explained that this may have indeed been reason why he never cowrote any songs on album with joey saying that rey always came with package tour manager monte melnick on other hand said rey eventually befriended all band members recording sessions for halfway to sanity began in early 1987 at intergalactic studios in new york city described by rey as a dingy place in midtown drums guitars and bass were all recorded earlier in afternoon while vocal track was always recorded later in evening rey explained that they did this because it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal so they did joey however wanted to work out how to phrase his singing and was not a fan of this method of recording johnny insisted that no one involved with album would listen to rey not letting him make decisions he needed to as album s producer johnny said joey and richie made it hard for producer because they wanted to remix or change tracks richie however said that johnny along with their manager gary kurfirst made album process difficult by keeping band to a tight budget he explained that he himself wanted music to be more radio friendly and promote it more so they might have a hit album but johnny and kurfirst did not think it would make a difference richie would later recall why would you not want an album to be as successful as it could be gary kurfirst seemed to want to keep ramones an underground band i guess his thinking was he d profit more band s publicist ida langsam agreed that they and their record company all felt need to keep a strict budget on recording production and promotion of ramones music she pointed out that just because much of their album process was done cut rate it did not mean that their performance on album was not done well but rather they were trying to find people who could do things more cheaply along with cheaper places to record such as intergalactic studios where they had also recorded their previous album animal boy langsam went on to say that ramones were never afforded respect a band of their caliber should have insisting that other bands who were much less worthy were more respected everybody thought of them as local band she continued everybody s friends when are you going to break when are you going to get big when are you going to reach stardom rey claimed that band was very impatient during album process and noted that members especially johnny and joey weren t getting along john was fast in studio recalls george tabb who was recording with his band false prophets at intergalactic studios at same time as ramones recorded halfway to sanity he called it as humorous because john would be going enough enough it sounds right and joey artist would go i gotta do my vocals i gotta do my vocals and drummer s going but my drums johnny was like fuck it it s ramones it is what it is and comes out like that and he was right it was ramones he was a good businessman about it cover art and photography george dubose who had also done photography for band s previous three releases subterranean jungle too tough to die and animal boy also shot this one front cover s picture was taken in chinatown in an old stairwell where they had dubose s cousin and his cousin s friend who are credited as husky bros on halfway to sanity liner notes block off crowd while photo session was in place dubose and other crew members set up red lighting and a fog machine after dubose s camera went through three reels of film johnny insisted that was enough to which dubose replied that record company was paying him a lot of money for shoot so they should make it worthwhile session however only lasted 10 to 15 minutes and was done in a poorly lit area which johnny said was pretty good not to make us look old and it was getting harder and harder back cover photograph features green tombstones in a jewish cemetery dubose s photos for inner sleeve depict peking ducks hanging in window of a restaurant with glaze dripping off their tails tour and personnel changes to promote album band played a handful of gigs in south america in february 1987 during spring and summer of 1987 they toured united states at an east hampton new york concert on august 12 richie left band due to financial conflicts band members believed it also had to do with his love life joey would later state i felt screwed me and richie were friends he was more than just drummer but he was out for himself he said he would do new york shows for 500 a night i m sure he felt he had us by balls as our album was coming out dubose also explained that richie quit right before a gig and wasn t very professional richie felt that he was not being paid enough for all he was doing with band and reportedly left to take a higher paying job as a caddy johnny took matters into his own hands asking around to see if they could find a replacement drummer at least for remainder of tour clem burke of blondie filled in for richie for two shows performing under alias of elvis ramone dates were august 28 in providence rhode island and august 29 in trenton new jersey johnny deemed whole situation a disaster because of burke s drumming style commenting double time on hi hat was totally alien to him burke was criticized for playing durango 95 s fills incorrectly and for introduction on rock n roll radio forcing johnny and dee dee to improvise on stage he also was reportedly unable to maintain faster tempo of songs freak of nature and gimme gimme shock treatment because of this marky ramone who was band s drummer before richie and after original drummer tommy ramone was asked to return he had been fired after subterranean jungle partially for his style but mostly because of his alcoholism once he was sober however he began playing in richie stotts s heavy metal band king flux as well as his own band m 80 within week marky was touring with band again first show marky played was on september 4 in oyster bay long island during a sold out paris concert fans who were not able to get in to see performance began to throw stones at venue and were consequently tear gassed by police it was also common to see moshing and stage diving at their shows but band members discouraged this type of behavior they hated it and they tried to stop it as much as possible artist arturo vega recalled but it would happen kids are really resourceful once lawsuits started coming in a lot of clubs tried to ban it too sometimes security made it difficult for them you know once we were in tijuana and of course in tijuana who cares they were jumping from a balcony that was at least 20 feet 6 m high jumping into crowd it was too much it was great band was banned from playing at boston college on grounds that they promoted rowdiness destructiveness and drug use in response university s program council organized an anti censorship protest rally in marsh plaza at rally joey announced we re here to uphold honor of students and ramones and pointed out that their performances never incited violence ramones 1988 tour would have roughly a hundred gigs in united states finland japan england and elsewhere while touring in puerto rico band performed for around 2 000 surfers at world surfing championships these shows were dubbed ramones non stop world tour by fans musical style and lyrics album s opening track i wanna live features heavy feedback and a musical style closer to hard rock than punk described by author dave thompson as similar to contemporary romantic melodies song was written by dee dee who quoted lyrics as i load my pistol fine german steel years later in a photo session with ken hinchey and mike vought as he loaded a gun song runs 2 minutes 39 seconds and despite that brevity was called too long by music journalist everett true both next track bop til you drop and fifth track go lil camaro go were described by true as dire fun saying it sounded as if they ve been tossed off in a couple seconds and probably were and that joey sang with a drink ravaged voice thompson wrote that go lil camaro go a duet with blondie s debbie harry had a style similar to bubblegum pop track three garden in serenity incorporates elements used in crossover thrash next track is weasel face written by dee dee and johnny regarding a fan who had a real weasel face johnny recalled he came to all our gigs in south he followed us around i think he was from mississippi side a concludes with richie s i know better which along with go lil camaro go was described by allmusic reviewer stephen thomas erlewine as having a solid hook joey wrote opening track for side b death of me as well as a real cool time which true said was a tribute to summer beach parties and new york cat clubs and compared melody line to who s kids are alright album s longest song is track 11 bye bye baby at 4 minutes 33 seconds it was described as a tear jerking piece by true and was influenced by 50s early 60s girl group pop he wrote that it features a beautiful chiming guitar sound that stands out like a sore thumb compared to other songs on album because joey sings instead of shouting song was deemed phil spector ish in weg publication s digital audio and compact disc review it also describes album s final track worm man as having a hardcore punk thrashing style and true said song was similar to work of black flag reception halfway to sanity received mixed reviews from critics when it was released in september 1987 new york post praised it as another well produced album by ramones and billboard said sire should have released go lil camaro go as a single however in united kingdom album received virtually no attention from professional critics ramones fanzine writer mark bannister explained that critics there thought album didn t sound right without some more of joey s songs to balance out dee dee s there was no equilibrium stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave album one and a half out of five stars saying that although it remains similar to animal boy in that it features use of heavy guitars but it was in erlewine s view much sharper record only because it did not overlook band s trashy pop roots he pointed out that ramones musical style was inconsistent going on to say that band could have gone about their second decade of music making more gracefully but concluded by saying that although it was not as strong as 1983 s subterranean jungle or 1984 s too tough to die it was last release where band actually sounded like they mattered in a brief review music critic robert christgau gave album a c writing that he felt pained to say it but with richie or whoever on lam
