joseph francis shea september 5 1925 february 14 1999 was an american aerospace engineer and nasa manager born in new york city borough of bronx he was educated at university of michigan receiving a ph d in engineering mechanics in 1955 after working for bell labs on radio inertial guidance system of titan i intercontinental ballistic missile he was hired by nasa in 1961 as deputy director of nasa s office of manned space flight and later as head of apollo spacecraft program office shea played a key role in shaping course of apollo program helping to lead nasa to decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting all up testing of saturn v rocket while sometimes causing controversy within agency shea was remembered by his former colleague george mueller as one of greatest systems engineers of our time mueller joseph f shea in memorial tributes national academy of engineering volume 10 p 211 deeply involved in investigation of 1967 apollo 1 fire shea suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of stress that he suffered he was removed from his position and left nasa shortly afterwards from 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at raytheon in lexington massachusetts and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit while shea served as a consultant for nasa on redesign of international space station in 1993 he was forced to resign from position due to health issues early life and education shea was born september 5 1925 and grew up in bronx eldest son in a working class irish catholic family his father worked as a mechanic on new york city subway as a child shea had no interest in engineering he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete he attended a catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen murray and cox apollo p 121 on graduating in 1943 shea enlisted in u s navy and enrolled in a program that would put him through college he began his studies at dartmouth college later moving to mit and finally to university of michigan where he would remain until he earned his doctorate in 1955 in 1946 he was commissioned as an ensign in navy and received a bachelor of science degree in mathematics shea went on to earn a msc 1950 and a ph d 1955 in engineering mechanics from university of michigan while obtaining his doctorate shea found time to teach at university and to hold down a job at bell labs murray and cox apollo p 121 mueller joseph f shea in memorial tributes national academy of engineering volume 10 p 211 systems engineer after receiving his doctorate shea took a position at bell labs in whippany new jersey there he first worked as systems engineer on radio guidance system of titan i intercontinental ballistic missile icbm and then as development and program manager on inertial guidance system of titan ii icbm mueller joseph f shea in memorial tributes national academy of engineering volume 10 p 212 shea s specialty was systems engineering a new type of engineering developed in 1950s that focused on management and integration of large scale projects turning work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole he played a significant role in titan i project as george mueller writes h e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for successful development of this pioneering guidance system in addition to shea s technical abilities it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people known for his quick intellect he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings murray and cox apollo p 122 during critical days of titan project shea moved into plant sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed murray and cox apollo p 123 having brought in project on time and on budget shea established a reputation in aerospace community in 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with space technology laboratories a division of trw inc where he continued to work on ballistic missile systems nasa career in december 1961 nasa invited shea to interview for position of deputy director of office of manned space flight omsf d brainerd holmes director of omsf had been searching for a deputy who could offer expertise in systems engineering someone with technical abilities to supervise apollo program as a whole shea was recommended by one of holmes advisors who had worked with him at bell labs murray and cox apollo pp 120 1 although shea had worked at space technology labs for less than a year he was captivated by challenge offered by nasa position i could see they needed good people in space program he later said and i was kind of cocky in those days lunar orbit rendezvous when shea was hired by nasa president john f kennedy s commitment to landing men on moon was still only seven months old and many of major decisions that shaped apollo program were yet to be made foremost among these was mode that nasa would use to land on moon when shea first began to consider issue in 1962 most nasa engineers and wernher von braun director of marshall space flight either an approach called direct ascent where apollo spacecraft would land on moon and return to earth as one unit or earth orbit rendezvous where spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around earth however dissenters such as john houbolt a langley engineer favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky lunar orbit rendezvous in which two spacecraft would be used a command service module csm would remain in orbit around moon while a lunar module would land on moon and return to dock with csm in lunar orbit then be discarded hansen enchanted rendezvous passim thumb left lunar orbit rendezvous decision is announced at a nasa press conference in july 1962 joe shea is at far right in november 1961 john houbolt had sent a paper advocating lunar orbit rendezvous lor to robert seamans deputy administrator of nasa as shea remembered seamans gave a copy of houbolt s letter to brainerd holmes director of omsf holmes put letter on my desk and said figure it out shea oral history pdf august 26 1998 johnson space center oral history project p 1 shea became involved in lunar orbit rendezvous decision as a result of this letter while he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous shea prided himself according to space historians murray and cox on going wherever data took him murray and cox apollo p 124 in this case data took him to nasa s langley research center in hampton virginia where he met with john houbolt and with space task group and became convinced that lor was an option worth considering hansen enchanted rendezvous p 23 shea s task now became to shepherd nasa to a firm decision on issue this task was complicated by fact that he had to build consensus between nasa s different notably manned spacecraft center in houston headed by robert gilruth and marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama headed by wernher von braun relations between centers were not good and it was a major milestone in progress of apollo program when von braun and his team finally came to accept superiority of lor concept nasa announced its decision at a press conference on july 11 1962 only six months after shea had joined nasa space historian james hansen concludes that shea played a major role in supporting houbolt s ideas and making decision in favor of lor while his former colleague george mueller writes that it is a tribute to joe s logic and leadership that he was able to build a consensus within centers at a time when they were autonomous mueller quoted in rosen apollo 11 remembered aerospace america november 1994 p b7 during his time at omsf shea helped to resolve many of other inevitable engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during development of apollo spacecraft in may 1963 he formed a panel review board bringing together representatives of many committees that aimed to coordinate work between nasa centers under shea s leadership this coordination became far more efficient brooks grimwood and swenson chariots for apollo pp 122 3 program manager in october 1963 shea became new manager of apollo spacecraft program office aspo in houston although technically a demotion this new position gave shea responsibility for managing design and construction of apollo command and lunar modules of particular concern to shea was performance of north american aviation contractor responsible for command module as he later recounted i do not have a high opinion of north american and their motives in early days their first program manager was a first class jerk there were spots of good guys but it was just an ineffective organization they had no discipline no concept of change control murray and cox apollo p 170 it was shea s responsibility to bring that engineering discipline to north american and to nasa s management of its contractors his systems management experience served him well in his new post in coming years any change to design of apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from shea himself murray and cox apollo p 174 he kept control of program using a management tool that he devised for himself a notebook more than a hundred pages in length that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made presented with notebook on thursday evenings shea would study and annotate it over weekend and return to work with new questions instructions and decisions this idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever expanding program murray and cox apollo pp 172 3 shea s relationship with engineers at north american was a difficult one while shea blamed north american s management for continuing difficulties in development of command module project leader harrison storms felt that nasa itself was far from blameless it had delayed in making key design decisions and persisted in making significant changes to design once construction had begun while shea did his part in attempting to control change requests storms felt that shea did not understand or sympathize with inevitable problems involved in day to day work of manufacturing gray angle of attack pp 184 188 thumb shea at an engineering meeting during apollo program shea was a controversial figure even at manned spacecraft center not having been at langley with space task group he was considered an outsider by men such as flight director chris kraft who recalled that animosity between my people and shea s was intense kraft flight p 251 relations between shea and other nasa centers were even more uneasy as deputy director of omsf shea had sought to extend authority of nasa headquarters over fiercely independent nasa centers this was particularly problematic when it came to marshall space flight center which had developed its own culture under wernher von braun von braun s philosophy of engineering differed from shea s taking a consensual rather than top down approach as one historian recounts von braun felt that shea had bitten off too much work and was going to wreck centers engineering capabilities sato local engineering and systems engineering technology and culture july 2005 p 576 friction between shea and marshall which had begun when shea was at omsf continued after he moved to his new position he became deeply involved in supporting george mueller s effort to impose idea of all up testing of saturn v rocket on unwilling engineers at marshall von braun s approach to engineering was a conservative one emphasizing incremental testing of components but tight schedule of apollo program did not allow for this slow and careful process what mueller and shea proposed was to test saturn v as one unit on its very first flight and marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963 murray and cox apollo pp 158 162 when later asked how he and mueller had managed to sell idea to von braun shea responded that we just told him that s way it s going to be finally shea oral history pdf august 26 1998 johnson space center oral history project p 7 shea s role in resolving differences within nasa and between nasa and its contractors placed him in a position where criticism was inevitable however even shea s critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills everyone who knew shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer gray angle of attack p 188 murray and cox apollo p 121 and his time as manager at aspo only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on titan project of shea s work in mid 1960s murray and cox write that these were joe shea s glory days and whatever swirl of opinions about this gifted enigmatic man he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward murray and cox apollo p 178 shea s work also won wider attention bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to wernher von braun or chris kraft kraft had appeared on cover of time in 1965 time planned to offer shea same honor in february 1967 month in which first manned apollo mission was scheduled to occur murray and cox apollo p 186 apollo 1 fire background problems with apollo command module continued through testing phase review meeting for first spacecraft intended for a manned mission took place on august 19 1966 one issue of concern was amount of velcro in cabin a potential fire hazard in pure oxygen atmosphere of spacecraft if there were to be a spark as shea later recounted and so issue was brought up at acceptance of spacecraft a long drawn out discussion i got a little annoyed and i said look there s no way there s going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there s a spark or astronauts bring cigarettes aboard we re not going to let them smoke well i then issued orders at that meeting go clean up spacecraft be sure that all fire rules are obeyed shea oral history pdf november 23 1998 johnson space center oral history project p 16 although spacecraft passed its review crew finished meeting by presenting shea with a picture of three of them seated around a model of capsule heads bowed in prayer inscription was simple it isn t that we don t trust you joe but this time we ve decided to go over your head murray and cox apollo p 184 thumb left apollo 1 astronauts presented this picture to joe shea as a joke before fire on january 25 1967 apollo 1 crew began a series of countdown tests in spacecraft on pad at cape kennedy although shea had ordered his staff to direct north american to take action on issue of flammable materials in cabin he had not supervised issue directly and little if any action had been taken murray and cox apollo p 185 during pad testing spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems including broken and static filled communications wally schirra backup commander for mission suggested to shea that shea should go through countdown test in spacecraft with crew in order to experience first hand issues that they were facing although he seriously considered idea it proved to be unworkable because of difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for shea hatch would have to be left open in order to run extra wires out and leaving hatch open would make it impossible to run emergency egress test that had been scheduled for end of day on 27th gray angle of attack pp 226 7 as shea later told press joining crew for test would have been highly irregular 2 space aides decided not to join apollo test new york times february 12 1967 p 32 a plugs out spacecraft test simulating launch countdown took place on january 27 while shea was in florida for beginning of test he decided to leave before it concluded he arrived back at his office in houston at about 5 30 p m cst murray and cox apollo p 188 at 5 31 p m cst 6 31 p m est a massive fire broke out in apollo command module unable to escape three astronauts inside spacecraft gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were killed investigation thumb interior of apollo 1 capsule after fire immediately after fire shea and his aspo colleagues at houston boarded a nasa plane to kennedy space center they landed at about 1 00 a m only five hours after fire had broken out at a meeting that morning with robert gilruth george mueller and george low shea helped to determine individuals who would be on nasa review board looking into causes of fire additionally he persuaded george mueller head of nasa s office of manned space flight to allow him to act as mueller s deputy in florida supervising progress of investigation murray and cox apollo pp 206 11 named to advisory group chosen to support review board ertel and newkirk apollo spacecraft vol iv p 70 shea threw himself into investigation working eighty hour weeks gray angle of attack p 238 although precise source of ignition was never found it soon became clear that an electrical short somewhere in command module had started fire probably sparked by a chafed wire what was less clear was where to apportion responsibility nasa engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by north american aviation murray and cox apollo pp 214 15 by contrast north american executives blamed nasa management for its decision over their objections to pressurize command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space in which almost any velcro with which cabin was instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark gray angle of attack p 245 whatever precise distribution of responsibility shea remained haunted by feeling that he personally was responsible for deaths of three astronauts for years after fire he displayed portrait given to him by apollo 1 crew in front hallway of his own home murray and cox apollo p 225 breakdown pressure of investigation took a psychological toll on shea he had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope murray and cox apollo pp 213 14 shea was not only nasa employee who found aftermath of fire difficult to handle robert seamans wrote that key people from houston would fly up to washington to testify and literally sob all way on plane seamans aiming at targets p 139 and a man who worked under shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket o toole thomas schefter jim bumpy road that led man to moon washington post july 15 1979 p e1 a few weeks after fire shea s colleagues began to notice that he too was behaving erratically chris kraft whose father had suffered from schizophrenia later related shea s behavior in one meeting joe shea got up and started calmly with a report on state of investigation but within a minute he was rambling and in another thirty seconds he was incoherent i looked at him and saw my father in grip of dementia praecox it was horrifying and fascinating at same time kraft flight p 275 nasa administrator james webb became increasingly worried about shea s mental state specifically he was concerned that shea might not be able to deal with hostile questioning that he would receive from congressional inquiry into apollo 1 fire senator walter mondale had accused nasa engineers of criminal negligence with regard to design and construction of apollo command module and it was expected that shea would be in firing line in march webb sent robert seamans and charles berry nasa s head physician to speak with shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence this would they hoped protect him from being called to testify a press release had already been prepared but shea refused threatening to resign rather than take leave as a compromise he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness yet this approach to removing shea from his position was also unsuccessful murray and cox apollo pp 217 19 as one of his friends later recounted psychiatrists came back saying he s so smart he s so intelligent here joe was ready to kill himself but he could still outsmart psychiatrists murray and cox apollo p 219 reassignment shea s superiors were finally forced to take a more direct approach on april 7 it was announced that shea would be moving to nasa headquarters in washington d c where he would serve as george mueller s deputy at office of manned space flight he was replaced as chief of apollo spacecraft program office by george low ertel and newkirk apollo spacecraft vol iv p 119 while shea had already acted as mueller s de facto deputy in florida during investigation reality of this permanent posting was very different when shea s reassignment was announced one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to time magazine in which he said that if joe stays in washington it ll be a promotion if he leaves in three or four months you ll know this move amounted to being fired how soon moon time april 14 1967 shea accepted reassignment reluctantly feeling that it was as if nasa was trying to hide me from congress for what i might have said shea oral history pdf november 23 1998 johnson space center oral history project p 18 once in job he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he considered to be a non job later commenting that i don t understand why after everything i had done for program i was only one that was removed that s end of program for me shea oral history pdf november 23 1998 johnson space center oral history project p 17 only six months after fire and some two months after taking his new position shea left nasa in order to become a vice president at polaroid corporation in waltham massachusetts he was never called to testify before congressional inquiry into fire post nasa career in 1968 shea took a position at raytheon in lexington massachusetts he would remain with company until his retirement in 1990 serving as senior vice president for engineering from 1981 through 1990 after leaving raytheon shea became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit in february 1993 nasa administrator daniel goldin appointed shea to chairmanship of a technical review board convened to oversee redesign of troubled international space station project sawyer nasa picks manager to cut expenditures on space station washington post february 27 1993 p a2 however shea was hospitalized shortly after his appointment by april he was well enough to attend a meeting where design team formally presented preliminary results of its studies but his behavior at meeting again called his capacities into question as washington post reported shea made a rambling sometimes barely audible two hour presentation that left many of those present speculating about his ability to do job a longtime friend said that s not real joe shea he is normally incisive and well organized on day following meeting shea offered his resignation becoming instead a special advisor to daniel goldin nasa reported that he had resigned due to health reasons however scientist offered a different interpretation quoting sources who speculated that bluntness of his speech including criticisms of goldin may have been controversial in nasa circles president to space station vol 7 issue 10 p 3 shea died on february 14 1999 at his home in weston massachusetts he was survived by his wife carol six daughters and one son mueller joseph f
