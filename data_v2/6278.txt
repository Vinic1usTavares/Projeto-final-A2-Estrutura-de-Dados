pericles aspasia is protagonist in taylor caldwell s novel glory and lightning 1974 doubleday company accuracy of historical sources main problem remains as jona lendering points out aspasia of miletus at livius org that most of things we know about aspasia are based on mere hypothesis thucydides does not mention her our only sources are untrustworthy representations and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy who did not care at all about aspasia as a historical character therefore in figure of aspasia we get a range of contradictory portrayals she is either a good wife like or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like thargelia j e taylor jewish women philosophers of first century alexandria 187 this is reason modern scholars express their scepticism about historicity of aspasia s life according to wallace for us aspasia herself possesses and can possess almost no historical reality hence madeleine m henry professor of classics at iowa
