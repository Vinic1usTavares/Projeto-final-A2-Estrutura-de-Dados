gazelle class was a group of ten light cruisers built for imperial german navy at turn of 20th century they were first modern light cruiser design of imperial navy and set basic pattern for all future light cruisers in imperial service design of gazelle class attempted to merge fleet scout with colonial cruiser they were armed with a main battery of ten guns and a pair of torpedo tubes and were capable of a speed of all ten ships served with fleet when they were first commissioned and several served on foreign stations in decade before outbreak of world war i most were used as coastal defense ships early in war was sunk at battle of heligoland bight in august 1914 was torpedoed in baltic by a british submarine in november 1915 and was sunk at battle of jutland in may 1916 rest survived war to see service with reichsmarine with exception of which was broken up in 1920 was sold to yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed dalmacija and rest of cruisers were withdrawn from service by end of 1920s and used for secondary duties or broken up for scrap medusa and arcona were converted into anti aircraft ships in 1940 and were scuttled at end of world war ii dalmacija was captured twice during war first by italians who renamed her cattaro and then by germans who restored original name of niobe she ran aground in december 1943 and was subsequently destroyed by british motor torpedo boats was only member to survive war intact as a barracks ship and she remained in service until 1954 when she was broken up for scrap design gazelle class was first modern light cruiser design of imperial navy design for gazelle class followed several intermediate types including of unprotected cruisers and unique vessels and they were intended to fulfill requirements for a fleet scout and an overseas cruiser design was somewhat smaller than contemporary light cruisers but ships were nevertheless sturdy and powerfully armed for period these characteristics evenly balanced requirements for two roles envisioned for class according to historian eric osborne t he light cruisers of gazelle class established a trend for future ships of this general design they carried little or no armor chief asset being speed indeed all future light cruisers built by imperial navy generally followed same pattern with few fundamental changes general characteristics ships of gazelle class were long at waterline and long overall first seven ships had a beam of and last three were slightly wider at they had a draft of forward and aft they were designed to displace at a normal loading and at full combat load their displacement rose to ships hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames outer hull wall consisted of wooden planks covered with a layer of muntz metal to prevent fouling muntz metal extended up to a meter above waterline hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments and it had a double bottom that extended for 40 percent of length of keel for last three ships their double bottom was lengthened to 46 percent of hull all ten ships were crank and rolled severely they were also wet in a head sea after their modernizations they tended to suffer from lee helm nevertheless ships turned tightly and were very maneuverable in a hard turn their speed fell up to 65 percent they had a transverse metacentric height of gazelle class required a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men though for last three ships number of enlisted men rose to 256 they carried a number of boats including one picket boat one pinnace two cutters two yawls and one dinghy machinery their propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines manufactured by dockyards that built ships gazelles engines were designed to give for a top speed of while rest of ships engines were rated at for engines were powered by eight coal fired water tube boilers of various manufacture divided into two boiler rooms first three ships carried of coal which gave them a range of at next four vessels carried slightly more at which allowed them to cruise to approximately same range at higher speed of last three ships carried of coal which substantially increased their cruising radius to at 12 knots ships were equipped with three electricity generators that provided a total of 110 kilowatts at 110 volts armament and armor ships were armed with ten 10 5 cm sk l 40 guns in single mounts two were placed side by side forward on forecastle six were located amidships three on either side and two were placed side by side aft guns could engage targets out to they were supplied with 1 000 rounds of ammunition for 100 shells per gun though allotment for last three ships increased to 1 500 rounds or 150 per gun they were also equipped with torpedo tubes gazelle had three tubes with eight torpedoes one was submerged in hull in bow and two were mounted in deck launchers on broadside rest of class only had two 45 cm tubes with five torpedoes and these were submerged in ships hulls on broadside ships were protected by an armored deck that was thick with thick sloping armor on side armor consisted of two layers of steel with a single layer of krupp steel gazelle class cruisers were also equipped with cork cofferdams to increase buoyancy conning tower had thick sides with a 20 mm thick roof guns were protected by thick shields construction thumb undine at her launching ten ships of gazelle class were built between 1897 and 1904 at various german dockyards including private firms and government shipyards namebuilderlaid kiel 1897 31 march 1898 15

commissioning most of them served with fleet reconnaissance force though several served on foreign stations as well gazelle served abroad in 1902 1904 thetis in 1902 1906 niobe in 1906 1909 and arcona in 1907 1910 nymphe was also used as a training ship for naval cadets in addition to her fleet scout role and undine served as a gunnery training ship due to their age gazelles had been placed in reserve by 1914 but after outbreak of world war i in august 1914 they were mobilized for active service most were initially used as coastal defense vessels in baltic but frauenlob and ariadne remained in service with fleet they both saw action at battle of heligoland bight on 28 august 1914 frauenlob engaged and badly damaged british cruiser while ariadne was sunk by several battlecruisers frauenlob soldiered on in fleet reconnaissance forces until battle of jutland on 31 may 1916 when she was torpedoed and sunk by in a ferocious night battle with loss of almost her entire crew in baltic undine was torpedoed and sunk by british submarine on 7 november 1915 thumb left niobe in yugoslavian service 1941 seven surviving ships were withdrawn from front line service in 1916 and disarmed with exception of medusa which retained six of her guns and thetis which was rearmed with nine 10 5 cm u boat guns for use as a gunnery training ship remaining seven cruisers survived war and went on to serve in new reichsmarine except for gazelle which was broken up for scrap in 1920 ships remained in service throughout 1920s but were all withdrawn by early 1930s niobe was sold to yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed dalmacija while nymphe and thetis were scrapped in early 1930s arcona medusa and amazone were used as barracks hulks for rest of 1930s after outbreak of world war ii medusa and arcona were converted into floating anti aircraft batteries and defended german ports from 1940 to end of war when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 may 1945 amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through end of war dalmacija was captured by italians after invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 renamed cattaro and pressed into service with italian navy she was then captured by germans after italian surrender in september 1943 and returned to her original name niobe ship ran aground in adriatic in december 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of british motor torpedo boats niobe medusa and arcona were broken up for scrap in late 1940s but amazone lingered on as a barracks ship until 1954 when she too was sold for scrapping footnotes references category cruiser
