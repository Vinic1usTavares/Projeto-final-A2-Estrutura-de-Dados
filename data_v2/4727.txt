jean francois champollion champollion le jeune 23 december march 1832 was a french scholar philologist and orientalist known primarily as decipherer of egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding figure in field of egyptology a child prodigy in philology he gave his first public paper on decipherment of demotic in 1806 and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles and spoke coptic and arabic fluently during early 19th century french culture experienced a period of egyptomania brought on by napoleon s discoveries in egypt during his campaign there 1798 1801 which also brought to light trilingual rosetta stone scholars debated age of egyptian civilization and function and nature of hieroglyphic script which language if any it recorded and degree to which signs were phonetic representing speech sounds or ideographic recording semantic concepts directly many thought that script was only used for sacred and ritual functions and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas and did not record historical information significance of champollion s decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong and made it possible to begin to retrieve many kinds of information recorded by ancient egyptians champollion lived in a period of political turmoil in france which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways during napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription but his napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by subsequent royalist regime his own actions sometimes brash and reckless did not help his case his relations with important political and scientific figures of time such as joseph fourier and silvestre de sacy helped him although in some periods he lived exiled from scientific community in 1820 champollion embarked in earnest on project of decipherment of hieroglyphic script soon overshadowing achievements of british polymath thomas young who had made first advances in decipherment before 1819 in 1822 champollion published his first breakthrough in decipherment of rosetta hieroglyphs showing that egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs first such script discovered in 1824 he published a precis in which he detailed a decipherment of hieroglyphic script demonstrating values of its phonetic and ideographic signs in 1829 he traveled to egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had never before been studied and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions home again he was given a professorship in egyptology but only lectured a few times before his health ruined by hardships of egyptian journey forced him to give up teaching he died in paris in 1832 41 years old his grammar of ancient egyptian was published posthumously during his life as well as long after his death intense discussions over merits of his decipherment were carried out among egyptologists some faulted him for not having given sufficient credit to early discoveries of young accusing him of plagiarism and others long disputed accuracy of his decipherments but subsequent findings and confirmations of his readings by scholars building on his results gradually led to general acceptance of his work although some still argue that he should have acknowledged contributions of young his decipherment is now universally accepted and has been basis for all further developments in field consequently he is regarded as founder and father of egyptology biography

seven children two of whom had died prior he was raised in humble circumstances his father jacques champollion was a book trader from near grenoble who had settled in small town of figeac in department of lot his father was a notorious drunk and his mother jeanne francoise seems to have been largely an absent figure in life of young champollion who was mostly raised by his older brother jacques joseph one biographer andrew robinson even speculated that champollion was not in fact son of jacques champollion s wife but result of an extramarital affair towards end of march 1801 jean francois left figeac for grenoble which he reached on 27 march and where jacques joseph lived in a two room flat on rue neuve jacques joseph was then working as an assistant in import export company chatel champollion and rif yet taught his brother to read and supported his education his brother also may have been part of source of champollion s interest in egypt since as a young man he wanted to join napoleon s egyptian expedition and often regretted not being able to go often known as younger brother of better known jacques joseph jean francois was often called champollion le jeune young later when his brother became more famous of two jacques added town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as champollion figeac in contrast to his brother champollion although studious and largely self educated jacques did not have jean francois genius for language however he was talented at earning a living and supported jean francois for most of his life given difficulty of task of educating his brother while earning a living jacques joseph decided to send his younger brother to well regarded school of abbe dussert in november 1802 where champollion would stay until summer of 1804 during this period his gift for languages first became evident he started out learning latin and greek but quickly progressed to hebrew and other semitic languages such as ethiopic arabic syriac and chaldean it was while a student here that he took up interest in ancient egypt likely encouraged in this direction by dussert and his brother both orientalists at age 11 he came to attention of prefect of grenoble joseph fourier who had accompanied napoleon bonaparte on egyptian expedition which had discovered rosetta stone an accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist fourier had been entrusted by napoleon with publication of results of expedition in monumental series of publications titled description de l egypte one biographer has stated that fourier invited 11 year old champollion to his home and showed him his collection of ancient egyptian artefacts and documents champollion was enthralled and upon seeing hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible he declared that he would be one to succeed in reading them whether or not report of this visit is true fourier did go on to become one of champollion s most important allies and supporters and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in ancient egypt from 1804 champollion studied at a lycee in grenoble but hated its strict curriculum which only allowed him to study oriental languages one day per week and he begged his brother to move him to a different school nonetheless at lycee he took up study of coptic which would become his main linguistic interest for years to come and prove crucial in his approach to decipherment of hieroglyphs he had a chance to practice his coptic when he met dom raphael de monachis a former coptic christian monk and arabic translator to napoleon who visited grenoble in 1805 by 1806 jacques joseph was making preparations to bring his younger brother to paris to study at university jean francois had by then already developed a strong interest for ancient egypt as he wrote in a letter to his parents dated to january 1806 i want to make a profound and continuous study of this ancient nation enthusiasm brought me by study of their monuments their power and knowledge filling me with admiration all of this will grow further as i acquire new notions of all people that i prefer i shall say that none is as important to my heart as egyptians to continue his studies champollion wanted to go to paris grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages his brother thus stayed in paris from august to september that same year so as to seek his admission in a specialized school before leaving however champollion presented on 1 september 1807 his essay on geographical description of egypt before conquest of cambyses before academy of grenoble whose members were so impressed that they admitted him to academy six months later from 1807 to 1809 champollion studied in paris under silvestre de sacy first frenchman to attempt to read rosetta stone and with orientalist louis mathieu and with raphael de monachis who was now in paris here he perfected his arabic and persian in addition to languages that he had already acquired he was so immersed in his studies that he took up habit of dressing in arab clothing and calling himself al arab translation of le jeune he divided his time between college of france special school of oriental languages national library where his brother was a librarian and commission of egypt institution in charge of publishing findings of egyptian expedition in 1808 he first began studying rosetta stone working from a copy made by abbe de working independently he was able to confirm some of readings of demotic previously made by johan david akerblad in 1802 finally identifying coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on rosetta stone in 1810 he returned to grenoble to take up a seat as joint professor of ancient history at newly reopened grenoble university his salary as an assistant professor at grenoble was fixed at 750 francs a quarter of salary received by full professors never well off and struggling to make ends meet he also suffered since youth from chronically bad health including gout and tinnitus his health first began to deteriorate during his time in paris where dank climate and unsanitary environment did not agree with him political trouble during napoleonic wars thumb right bonaparte devant le sphinx bonaparte before sphinx by jean leon gerome napoleon bonaparte

desert during napoleonic wars champollion was a young bachelor and thus liable to compulsory military service which would have put him in great danger due to extremely high mortality of soldiers in napoleon s armies through assistance of his brother and prefect of grenoble joseph fourier who was also an egyptologist he successfully avoided draft by arguing that his work on deciphering egyptian script was too important to interrupt first skeptical of napoleonic regime after fall of napoleon in 1813 and institution of royalist regime under louis xviii champollion came to consider napoleonic state lesser of two evils anonymously he composed and circulated songs ridiculing and criticizing royal regime songs that became highly popular among people of grenoble in 1815 napoleon bonaparte escaped from his exile on elba and landed with an army at cote d azur and marched directly on grenoble where he was received as a liberator here he met with champollion whose many requests for exemption from draft he remembered and he asked him how his important work was progressing champollion replied that he had just finished his coptic grammar and dictionary napoleon requested that he send manuscripts to paris for publication his brother jacques joined napoleonic cause putting both of brothers in danger at end of hundred days when napoleon was finally defeated grenoble being last city to resist royalist advances in spite of risk to themselves having been put under royalist surveillance champollion brothers nonetheless aided napoleonic general drouet d erlon who had been sentenced to death for his participation in battle of waterloo giving him shelter and helping him escape to munich brothers were condemned to internal exile in figeac and champollion was removed from his university post in grenoble and faculty closed under new royalist regime champollion brothers invested much of their time and efforts in establishing lancaster schools in an effort to provide general population with education this was considered a revolutionary undertaking by ultra royalists who did not believe that education should be made accessible for lower classes in 1821 champollion even led an uprising in which he and a band of stormed citadel and hoisted tricolore instead of bourbon royalist flag he was charged with treason and went into hiding but was eventually pardoned family life thumb right alt painting of a woman with a girl on her lap both wear robes portrait of rosine and zoraide champollion champollion first declared his love for pauline in 1807 pauline was zoe s sister and thus his sister in law his love was not reciprocated so champollion instead had an affair with a married woman named louise deschamps that lasted until around 1809 in 1811 louise remarried and pauline died in 1813 it was around this time that champollion met rosine blanc 1794 1871 whom he married in 1818 after four years of engagement they had one daughter zoraide champollion 1824 89 rosine was daughter of a well to do family of at first her father did not approve of match since champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed originally jacques joseph was opposed to his brother s marriage too finding rosine too dull witted and he did not attend wedding but later he grew fond of his sister in law although a happy family man especially adoring his daughter champollion was frequently away for months or even years at a time as he was traveling to paris to italy and to egypt while his family remained in zoe and jacques joseph s property in vif near grenoble while in livorno champollion developed an infatuation with an italian poet angelica palli she presented an ode to champollion s work at a celebration in his honor and two exchanged letters over period 1826 1829 revealing poor state of champollion s marriage yet an affair never developed deciphering egyptian hieroglyphs thumb alt a page containing three columns of characters first column depicting characters in greek and second and third columns showing their equivalents in demotic and in hieroglyphs respectively champollion s table of hieroglyphic phonetic characters with their demotic and coptic equivalents lettre a m dacier 1822 egyptian hieroglyphs had been well known to scholars of ancient world for centuries but few had made any attempts to understand them many based their speculations about script in writings of who considered symbols to be ideographic not representing any specific spoken language athanasius kircher for example had stated that hieroglyphs were symbols that cannot be translated by words but expressed only by marks characters and figures meaning that script was in essence impossible to ever decipher others considered that use of hieroglyphs in egyptian society was limited to religious sphere and that they represented esoteric concepts within a universe of religious meaning that was now lost but kircher had been first to suggest that modern coptic was a degenerate form of language found in egyptian demotic script and he had correctly suggested phonetic value of one hieroglyph that of mu coptic word for water with onslaught of egyptomania in france in early 19th century scholars began approaching question of hieroglyphs with renewed interest but still without a basic idea about whether script was phonetic or ideographic and whether texts represented profane topics or sacred mysticism this early work was mostly speculative with no methodology for how to corroborate suggested readings first methodological advances were joseph de discovery that cartouches identified names of rulers and george zoega s compilation of a catalogue of hieroglyphs and discovery that direction of reading depended on direction in which glyphs were facing early studies champollion s interest in egyptian history and hieroglyphic script developed at an early age at age of sixteen he gave a lecture before grenoble academy in which he argued that language spoken by ancient egyptians in which they wrote hieroglyphic texts was closely related to coptic this view proved crucial in becoming able to read texts and correctness of his proposed relation between coptic and ancient egyptian has been confirmed by history this enabled him to propose that demotic script represented coptic language already in 1806 he wrote to his brother about his decision to become one to decipher egyptian script in 1808 champollion received a scare when french archeologist alexandre lenoir published first of his four volumes on nouvelles explications des making young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed but he was relieved to find that lenoir still operated under assumption that hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language this experience made him even more determined to be first to decipher language and he began dedicating himself even more to study of coptic writing in 1809 to his brother i give myself up entirely to coptic i wish to know egyptian like my french because on that language will be based my great work on egyptian papyri that same year he was appointed to his first academic post in history and politics at university of grenoble in 1811 champollion was embroiled in controversy as etienne marc quatremere like champollion a student of silvestre de sacy published his memoires et historiques sur l egypte sur quelques contrees champollion saw himself forced to publish as a stand alone paper introduction to his work in progress l egypte sous les pharaons ou recherches sur la geographie la langue les ecritures et l histoire de l egypte avant l invasion de 1814 because of similarities in topic matter and fact that champollion s work was published after quatremere s allegations arose that champollion had plagiarized work of quatremere even silvestre de sacy mentor of both authors considered possibility to champollion s great chagrin rivalry with thomas young thumb right thomas young made substantial contributions to several fields apart from egyptology including optics physics music and medicine during his rivalry some of his supporters blamed him for not dedicating himself fully to study of hieroglyphs alt engraving of a young man with curly hair a high white collar and black jacket british polymath thomas young was one of first to attempt decipherment of egyptian hieroglyphs basing his own work on investigations of swedish diplomat johan david akerblad young and champollion first became aware of each other s work in 1814 when champollion wrote to royal society of which young was secretary requesting better transcriptions of rosetta stone to young s irritation arrogantly implying that he would be able to quickly decipher script if he only had better copies young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on rosetta text using akerblad s decipherments in 1815 young replied in negative arguing that french transcriptions were equally good as british ones and added that i do not doubt that collective efforts of savants such as m akerblad and yourself monsieur who have so much deepened study of coptic language might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with greek translation this was first champollion had heard of young s research and realizing that he also had a competitor in london was not to champollion s liking in his work on rosetta stone young proceeded mathematically without identifying language of text for example comparing number of times a word appeared in greek text with egyptian text he was able to point out which glyphs spelled word king but he was unable to read word using akerblad s decipherment of demotic letters p and t he realized that there were phonetic elements in writing of name ptolemy he correctly read signs for p t m i and s but rejected several other signs as inessential and misread others due to lack of a systematic approach young called demotic script enchorial and resented champollion s term demotic considering it bad form that he had invented a new name for it instead of using young s young corresponded with sacy now no longer champollion s mentor but his rival who advised young not to share his work with champollion and described champollion as a charlatan consequently for several years young kept key texts from champollion and shared little of his data and notes when champollion submitted his coptic grammar and dictionary for publication in 1815 it was blocked by silvestre de sacy who in addition to his personal animosity and envy towards champollion also resented his napoleonic affinities during his exile in figeac champollion spent his time revising grammar and doing local archeological work being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research in 1817 champollion read a review of his egypte sous les pharaons published by an anonymous englishman which was largely favorable and encouraged champollion to return to his former research champollion s biographers have suggested that review was written by young who often published anonymously but robinson who wrote biographies of both young and champollion considers it unlikely since young elsewhere had been highly critical of that particular work soon champollion returned to grenoble to seek employment again at university which was in process of reopening faculty of philosophy and letters he succeeded obtaining a chair in history and geography and used his time to visit egyptian collections in italian museums nonetheless most of his time in following years was consumed by his teaching work meanwhile young kept working on rosetta stone and in 1819 he published a major article on egypt in encyclopaedia britannica claiming that he had discovered principle behind script he had correctly identified only a small number of phonetic values for glyphs but also made some eighty approximations of correspondences between hieroglyphic and demotic young had also correctly identified several and grammatical principle of distinguishing correctly between singular dual and plural forms of nouns young nonetheless considered hieroglyphic linear or cursive hieroglyphs which he called hieratic and a third script which he called or enchorial to belong to different historical periods and to represent different evolutionary stages of script with increasing he failed to distinguish between hieratic and demotic considering them a single script young was also able to identify correctly hieroglyphic form of name of ptolemy v whose name had been identified by akerblad in demotic script only nonetheless he only assigned correct phonetic values to some of signs in name incorrectly dismissing one glyph one for o as unnecessary and assigning partially correct values to signs for m l and s he also read name of berenice but here only managed to correctly identify letter n young was furthermore convinced that only in late period had some foreign names been written entirely in phonetic signs whereas he believed that native egyptian names and all texts from earlier period were written in ideographic signs several scholars have suggested that young s true contribution to egyptology was his decipherment of demotic script in which he made first major advances correctly identifying it as being composed of both ideographic and phonetic signs nevertheless for some reason young never considered that same might be case with hieroglyphs later british egyptologist sir peter le page renouf summed up young s method he worked mechanically like schoolboy who finding in a translation that arma virumque means arms and man reads arma arms virum and que man he is sometimes right but very much oftener wrong and no one is able to distinguish between his right and his wrong results until right method has been discovered nonetheless at time it was clear that young s work superseded everything champollion had by then published on script breakthrough thumb right champollion s comparison of his own decipherment of letters in name ptolemy with that of young middle column alt scan of page of a book with three columns on left hieroglyphs in middle corresponding letters as identified by young and on right those identified by champollion although dismissive of young s work even before he had read it champollion obtained a copy of encyclopedia article even though he was suffering from failing health and chicanery of ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job it motivated him to return in earnest to study of hieroglyphs when he was eventually removed from his professorship by royalist faction he finally had time to work on it exclusively while he awaited trial for treason he produced a short manuscript de l des anciens egyptiens in which he argued that hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing young had already anonymously published an argument to same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal but champollion having been cut off from academia had probably not read it in addition champollion made fatal error of claiming that hieratic script was entirely ideographic champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying copies and destroying them these errors were finally corrected later that year when champollion correctly identified hieratic script as being based on hieroglyphic script but used exclusively on papyrus whereas hieroglyphic script was used on stone and demotic used by people previously it had been questioned whether three scripts even represented same language and hieroglyphic had been considered a purely ideographic script whereas hieratic and demotic were considered alphabetic young in 1815 had been first to suggest that demotic was not alphabetic but rather a mixture of imitations of hieroglyphics and alphabetic signs champollion on other hand correctly considered scripts to coincide almost entirely being in essence different formal versions of same script in same year he identified hieroglyphic script on rosetta stone as being written in a mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs just as young had argued for demotic he reasoned that if script was entirely ideographic hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in greek text but there were in fact fewer suggesting that script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs this realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from idea that different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types this realization gave him a distinct advantage names of rulers using fact that it was known that names of rulers appeared in cartouches he focused on reading names of rulers as young had initially tried champollion managed to isolate a number of sound values for signs by comparing greek and hieroglyphic versions of names of ptolemy and cleopatra correcting young s readings in several instances in 1822 champollion received transcriptions of text on recently discovered philae obelisk which enabled him to double check his readings of names ptolemy and cleopatra from rosetta stone name cleopatra had already been identified on philae obelisk by william john bankes who scribbled identification in margin of plate though without any actual reading of individual glyphs young and others would later use fact that cleopatra cartouche had been identified by bankes to claim that champollion had plagiarized his work it remains unknown whether champollion saw bankes margin note identifying cartouche or whether he identified it by himself all in all using this method he managed to determine phonetic value of 12 signs a ai e k l m o p r s and t by applying these to decipherment of further sounds he soon read dozens of other names astronomer jean baptiste published a proposed decipherment of controversial dendera zodiac arguing that small stars following certain signs referred to constellations champollion published a response in revue encyclopedique demonstrating that they were in fact grammatical signs which he called signs of type today called determinatives young had identified first determinative divine female but champollion now identified several others he presented progress before academy where it was well received and even his former mentor turned archenemy de sacy praised it warmly leading to a reconciliation between two main breakthrough in his decipherment was when he was also able to read verb mis related to birth by comparing coptic verb for birth with phonetic signs ms and appearance of references to birthday celebrations in greek text it was on 14 september 1822 while comparing his readings to a set of new texts from abu simbel that he made realization running down street to find his brother he yelled je mon affaire i ve got it but collapsed from excitement champollion subsequently spent short period from 14 to 22 september writing up his results while name thutmose had also been identified but not read by young who realized that first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing thoth champollion was able to read phonetic spelling of second part of word and check it against mentioning of births in rosetta stone champollion read name thutmose as consisting of logogram thoth represented by ibis and two phonetic signs m and s in reality however second sign was ms not simple m giving actual reading thoth ms s champollion never realized that some phonetic signs included two consonants this finally confirmed to champollion that ancient texts as well as recent ones used same writing system and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles letter to dacier a week later on 27 september 1822 he published some of his findings in his lettre a m dacier addressed to bon joseph dacier secretary of paris academie des inscriptions et belles lettres handwritten letter was originally addressed to de sacy but champollion crossed out letter of his mentor turned adversary substituting name of dacier who had faithfully supported his efforts champollion read letter before assembled academie all his main rivals and supporters were present at reading including young who happened to be visiting paris this was first meeting between two presentation did not go into details regarding script and in fact was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions although he must have been already certain of this champollion merely suggested that script was phonetic already from earliest available texts which would mean that egyptians had developed writing independently of other civilizations around mediterranean paper also still contained confusions regarding relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic scholars have speculated that there had simply not been sufficient time between his breakthrough and collapse to fully incorporate discovery into his thinking but paper presented many new phonetic readings of names of rulers demonstrating clearly that he had made a major advance in deciphering phonetic script and it finally settled question of dating of dendera zodiac by reading cartouche that had been erroneously read as arsinoe by young in its correct reading autocrator emperor in greek he was congratulated by amazed audience including de sacy and young young and champollion became acquainted over next days champollion sharing many of his notes with young and inviting him to visit at his house and two parted on friendly terms reactions to decipherment at first young was appreciative of champollion s success writing in a letter to his friend that if he champollion did borrow an english key lock was so dreadfully rusty that no common arm would have had strength enough to turn it you will easily believe that were i ever so much victim of bad passions i should feel nothing but exultation at mr champollion s success my life seems indeed to be lengthened by accession of a junior coadjutor in my researches and of a person too who is so much more versed in different dialects of egyptian language than myself nonetheless relation between them quickly deteriorated as young began to feel that he was being denied due credit for his own first steps in decipherment also because of tense political climate between england and france in aftermath of napoleonic wars there was little inclination to accept champollion s decipherments as valid among english when young later read published copy of lettre he was offended that he himself was mentioned only twice and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering name berenice young was further disheartened because champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided platform from which decipherment had finally been reached he grew increasingly angry with champollion and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication when by a stroke of luck a greek translation of a well known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year he did not share that important finding with champollion in an anonymous review of lettre young attributed discovery of hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de sacy and described champollion s decipherments merely as an extension of akerblad and young s work champollion recognized that young was author and sent him a rebuttal of review while maintaining charade of anonymous review furthermore young in his 1823 an account of some recent discoveries in literature and egyptian antiquities including author s original alphabet as extended by mr champollion he complained that however mr champollion may have arrived at his conclusions i admit them with greatest pleasure and gratitude not by any means as superseding my system but as fully confirming and extending it p 146 in france champollion s success also produced enemies edme francois jomard was chief among them and he spared no occasion to belittle champollion s achievements behind his back pointing out that champollion had never been to egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from young s work jomard had been insulted by champollion s demonstration of young age of dendera zodiac which he had himself proposed was as old as 15 000 years this exact finding had also brought champollion in good graces of catholic church which had been antagonized by claims that egyptian civilization might be older than church sanctioned chronology according to which earth was only 6 000 years old precis young s claims that new decipherments were merely a corroboration of his own method meant that champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear degree to which his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in young s work he realized that he would have to make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment whereas young had merely deciphered a few words over next year he published a series of booklets about egyptian gods including some decipherments of their names building on his progress champollion now began to study other texts in addition to rosetta stone studying a series of much older inscriptions from abu simbel during 1822 he succeeded in identifying names of pharaohs ramesses and thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts with help of a new acquaintance duke de blacas in 1824 champollion finally published precis du systeme des anciens egyptiens dedicated to and funded by king louis xviii here he presented first correct translation of hieroglyphs and key to egyptian grammatical system in precis champollion referred to young s 1819 claim of having deciphered script when he wrote that this task was exactly what champollion set out to accomplish in precis and entire framing of argument was as a rebuttal to m le docteur young and translation in his 1819 article which champollion brushed off as a conjectural translation in introduction champollion described his argument in points that his alphabet in sense of phonetic readings could be employed to read inscriptions from all of periods of egyptian history that discovery of phonetic alphabet is true key to understanding entire hieroglyphic system that ancient egyptians used system in all of periods of egyptian history to represent sounds of their spoken language phonetically that all of hieroglyphic texts are composed almost entirely of phonetic signs that he had discovered champollion never admitted any debt to young s work although in 1828 a year before his death young was appointed to french academy of sciences with champollion s support precis which comprised over 450 ancient egyptian words and hieroglyphics groupings cemented champollion as having main claim to decipherment of hieroglyphs in 1825 his former teacher and enemy silvestre de sacy reviewed his work positively stating that it was already well beyond need for confirmation in same year henry salt put champollion s decipherment to test successfully using it to read further inscriptions he published a corroboration of champollion s system in which he also criticized champollion for not acknowledging his dependence on young s work with his work on precis champollion realized that in order to advance further he needed more texts and transcriptions of better quality this caused him to spend next years visiting collections and monuments in italy where he realized that many of transcriptions from which he had been working had been inaccurate hindering decipherment he made a point of making his own copies of as many texts as possible during his time in italy he met pope who congratulated him on having done a great service to church by which he was referring to counter arguments he had provided against challengers to biblical chronology champollion was ambivalent but pope s support helped him in his efforts to secure funds for an expedition curator of egyptian antiquities in louvre thumb upright 1 2 first room of egyptian collection in louvre as it was in 1863 very similar to champollion s original design after his groundbreaking discoveries in 1822 champollion made acquaintance of pierre louis jean casimir duc de blacas an antiquary who became his patron and managed to gain him favor of king thanks to this in 1824 he traveled to turin to inspect a collection of egyptian materials assembled by bernardino drovetti which king charles x had purchased cataloguing it in turin and rome he realized necessity of seeing egyptian monuments first hand and began to make plans for an expedition to egypt while collaborating with tuscan scholars and archduke leopold in 1824 he became a correspondent of royal institute of netherlands following his successes and after several months of negotiations and talks by jacques joseph while he was still in italy champollion was finally appointed curator of egyptian collections of musee du louvre in a decree of charles x dated to 15 may 1826 two champollion brothers organised egyptian collection in four rooms on first floor of south side of cour carree visitors entered this section of louvre via a first room devoted to funerary world of egyptians second room presented artefacts relating to civilian life in ancient egypt while third and fourth rooms were devoted to more artefacts pertaining to mortuary activities and divinities to accompany these extensive works champollion organised egyptian collection methodologically into well defined series and pushed his work to point of choosing appearance of stands and pedestals champollion s work in louvre as well as his and his brother s efforts to acquire a larger collection of egyptian artefacts had a profound impact on louvre museum

traditional egyptian dress in 1827 rosellini who had first met champollion during his 1826 stay in florence went to paris for a year in order to improve his knowledge of method of champollion s system of decipherment two philologists decided to organize an expedition to egypt to confirm validity of discovery headed by champollion and assisted by rosellini his first disciple and great friend mission was known as franco tuscan expedition and was made possible by support of grand duke of tuscany leopold ii and charles x champollion and his second in command rossellini were joined on expedition by charles lenormant representing french government and a team of eleven frenchmen including egyptologist and artist nestor l hote and italians including artist giuseppe angelelli in preparation for expedition champollion wrote french consul general bernardino drovetti for advice on how to secure permission from egyptian khedive and ottoman viceroy muhammad ali of egypt drovetti had initiated his own business of exporting plundered egyptian antiques and did not want champollion meddling in his affairs he sent a letter discouraging expedition stating that political situation was too unstable for expedition to be advisable letter reached jacques joseph champollion a few weeks before expedition was scheduled to leave but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after expedition had left on 21 july 1828 expedition boarded ship at toulon and set sail for egypt and they arrived in alexandria on 18 august here champollion met with drovetti who continued to warn about political situation but assured champollion that pasha would give his permission for expedition to proceed champollion and lenormant met with pasha on 24 august and he immediately gave his permission however after more than a week of waiting for permissions champollion suspected that drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to french consulate complaint worked and soon pasha provided expedition with a large river boat expedition bought a small boat for five persons champollion named them isis and athyr after egyptian goddesses on 19 september they arrived in cairo where they stayed until 1 october when they left for desert sites of memphis saqqara and giza while examining texts in tombs at saqqara in october champollion realized that hieroglyphic word for hour included hieroglyph representing a star which served no phonetic function in word he wrote in his journal that star glyph was determinative of all divisions of time champollion probably coined this term replacing his phrase signs of type while in egypt as it had not appeared in 1828 edition of precis champollion also saw sphinx and lamented that inscription on its chest was covered by more sand than they would be able to remove in a week arriving in dendera on 16 november champollion was excited to see zodiac that he had deciphered in paris here he realized that glyph that he had deciphered as autocrator and which convinced him that inscription was of recent date was in fact not found on monument itself it had seemingly been invented by jomard s copyist champollion nonetheless realized that late date was still correct based on other evidence after a day at dendera expedition continued on to thebes champollion was particularly captured by array of important monuments and inscriptions at thebes and decided to spend as much time there as possible on way back north south of thebes isis sprang a leak and nearly sank having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing boat they continued south to aswan where boats had to be left since they could not make it across first cataract they traveled by small boats and camelback to elephantine and philae at philae champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by hard trip and he also received letters from his wife and brother both sent many months earlier champollion attributed their delay to drovetti s ill will they arrived at abu simbel on 26 november site had been visited by bankes and belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively but sand that they had cleared from entrance had now returned on 1 january 1829 they reached wadi halfa and returned north that day champollion composed a letter to m dacier stating that i am proud now having followed course of nile from its mouth to second cataract to have right to announce to you that there is nothing to modify in our letter on alphabet of hieroglyphs our alphabet is good even though champollion was appalled by rampant looting of ancient artefacts and destruction of monuments expedition also contributed to destruction most notably while studying valley of kings he damaged kv17 tomb of seti i by removing a wall panel of 2 26 x 1 05 m in a corridor english explorers attempted to dissuade destruction of tomb but champollion persisted stating that he had permission of muhammad ali pasha champollion also carved his name into a pillar at karnak in a letter to pasha he recommended that tourism excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled champollion s suggestions may have led to muhammad ali s 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering construction of a museum in which to house ancient artifacts on way back they stayed again at thebes from march to september making many new drawings and paintings of monuments there here at valley of kings expedition moved into tomb of ramesses iv of 20th dynasty where air was cooler they also located tomb of ramesses great but it was badly looted it was here that champollion first received news of young s campaign to vindicate himself as decipherer of hieroglyphs and to discredit champollion s decipherments he received this news only a few days after young s death in london expedition arrived back in cairo in late september 1829 where expedition bought 10 000 francs worth of antiquities a budget extended to them by minister rochefoucauld arriving in alexandria they were notified that french boat that would take them back was delayed and they had to stay here two months until sixth of december on their return to alexandria khedive muhammad ali pasha offered two obelisks standing at entrance of luxor temple to france in 1829 but only one was transported to paris where it now stands on place de la concorde champollion and pasha spoke often and on pasha s request champollion wrote an outline of history of egypt here champollion had no choice but to challenge short biblical chronology arguing that egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before islam two also spoke about social reforms champollion championing education of lower classes a point on which two did not agree returning to marseille on cote d azur members of expedition had to spend a month in quarantine on ship before being able to continue on towards paris expedition led to a posthumously published

after his return from second expedition to egypt champollion was appointed to chair of egyptian history and archaeology at college de france a chair which had been specially created for him by a decree of louis philippe i dated to 12 march 1831 he only gave three lectures before his illness forced him to give up teaching exhausted by his labors during and after his scientific expedition to egypt champollion died of an apoplectic attack stroke in paris on 4 march 1832 at age of 41 his body was buried in pere lachaise cemetery on his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife and a

on 23 december 1790 died at paris on 4 march 1832 certain portions of champollion s works were edited by jacques and published posthumously his grammar and dictionary of ancient egyptian had been left almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838 before his death he had told his brother hold it carefully i hope that it will be my calling card for posterity it contained his entire theory and method including classifications of signs and their decipherments and also a grammar including how to decline nouns and conjugate verbs but it was marred by still tentative nature of many readings and champollion s conviction that hieroglyphs could be read directly in coptic whereas in fact they represented a much older stage of language which differs in many ways from coptic jacques s son aime louis 1812 94 wrote a biography of two brothers and he and his sister zoe champollion were both interviewed by hermine whose major biography of champollion was published in 1906 champollion s decipherment remained controversial even after his death brothers alexander and wilhelm von humboldt famously championed his decipherment as did silvestre de sacy but others such as gustav julius klaproth and edme francois jomard sided with young and refused to consider champollion to be more than a talented imitator of young even after posthumous publication of his grammar in england sir george lewis still maintained 40 years after decipherment that since egyptian language was extinct it was a priori impossible to decipher hieroglyphs in a reply to lewis scathing critique reginald poole an egyptologist defended champollion s method describing it as method of interpreting hieroglyphics originated by dr young and developed by champollion also sir peter le page renouf defended champollion s method although he was less deferential to young building on champollion s grammar his student karl richard lepsius continued to develop decipherment realizing in contrast to champollion that vowels were not written lepsius became most important champion of champollion s work in 1866 decree of canopus discovered by lepsius was successfully deciphered using champollion s method
