accepted i hope world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation essjay had responded at time with a statement on his wikipedia page in part reading reaction from within wikipedia community to essjay jordan identity discrepancy was sharp voluminous and mixed while most editors denounced at least some of his actions responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing jordan of fraud as controversy unfolded wikipedia community began a review of essjay s previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made people have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments said michael snow a wikipedia administrator and founder of wikipedia community newspaper signpost those will get looked at again for instance essjay had recommended sources such as catholicism for dummies a book granted nihil and imprimatur by roman catholic church essjay defended his use of book by telling fellow wikipedia editors in a disagreement over editing of article imprimatur this is a text i often require for my students and i would hang my own ph d on it s sic credibility in another case a discussion of liturgical use of psalms he cited personal experience from abbey of gethsemani where i was a monk jimmy wales proposed a credential verification system on wikipedia following essjay controversy but proposal was rejected wales was reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes i don t think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in wikipedia but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address wales added he insisted that wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished we always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle wales commented however he also warned that it s always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate however florence chair of wikimedia foundation was not supportive of his credential proposal saying i think what matters is quality of content which we can improve by enforcing policies such as cite your source not quality of credentials showed by an editor a formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would need to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by wikipedia community wp cred like all previous such proposals as a follow up to his initial comments to new yorker wales wrote this apology to magazine which appeared in its march 19 2007 issue wales expressed his regret that essjay had made a series of very bad judgments he also commented that he hoped wikipedia would improve as a result of controversy wikipedia commenters upright thumb journalist and wikipedia critic andrew orlowski andrew orlowski a frequent wikipedia critic and writer for register a british technology news and opinion website criticized jimmy wales for hiring essjay at venture capital funded wikia and for appointing him to wikipedia arbitration committee after essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false orlowski added that essjay s actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within wikipedia others to comment negatively included zdnet writer mitch ratcliffe who asked why lying about one s background qualifies a person to work for a company like wikia which proposes to help communities to record accurate information and asked for additional details such as when he fired jordan and reasons for firing as well as when he endorsed jordan in public statements larry sanger co founder of wikipedia who left project in 2002 called essjay s response a defiant non apology and elsewhere characterized essjay s actions as identity fraud other comments businessweek commented on proposals for credential verification sadly not everyone who posts to wikipedia is concerned with ten commandments some are concerned with revenge some with self aggrandizement some just have nothing better to do we live in an age of fake ids fake money fake e mails fake urls fake ip addresses and fake votes however article argued that wikipedia could not become a net police of reliability on internet steve journalist maclean s stated that controversy could damage wikipedia s future as a media business operation observing that wikipedia s model was supposedly built upon trust and credibility cassandra jardine a daily telegraph contributor opined that essjay was hooked on wiki crack devotees jargon for thrill of seeing your efforts debated she further observed that essjay has provided a reminder that any given entry could have been written by someone as ignorant as ourselves on other hand no one has taken issue with his edits only his assumed persona so perhaps real lesson of this democratic medium is that college drop outs might be as authoritative as professors andrew keen author cult of amateur described controversy as an example of ignoring expert guidance in favor of dictatorship of idiots alex beam columnist boston globe criticized essjay affair as being part of what he characterizes as problems of crowdsourcing and wisdom of crowds stating also that crowd accepts authority unquestioningly who would you rather have write your encyclopedia entries bertrand russell t h huxley and benedetto croce who wrote for britannica or essjay academics following media coverage of essjay controversy a number of academics noted damage to credibility of wikipedia on march 2 2007 a report in chronicle of higher education commented incident is clearly damaging to wikipedia s credibility especially with professors who will now note that one of site s most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud ross brann a professor of judeo islamic studies at cornell university in ithaca stated that wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review saying they could make up your life if they wanted to brann also said that wikipedia has no place in university and he believed essjay incident would do nothing to change unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about online encyclopedia nicola pratt a lecturer in international relations at university of east anglia in england stated ethos of wikipedia is that anyone can contribute regardless of status what s relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers not whether they are professors or not and fact student essjay was exposed shows it works in 2009 a lengthy article was published by national council of
