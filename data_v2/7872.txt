sealyham terrier is a rare welsh breed of small to medium sized terrier that originated in wales as a working dog it is principally a white bodied rough coated breed developed in mid to late 19th century by captain john edwardes at sealyham house pembrokeshire following first world war it surged in popularity and was associated with hollywood stars and members of british royal family its numbers have dropped significantly since then with breed listed as a vulnerable native breed by kennel club an all time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in united kingdom this decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds and sealyham s reduced usefulness as a working dog this breed is equally suitable as a family dog or a working terrier given right training it is affected by few breed specific breed disorders with only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy a dna test is now readily available to identify dogs who carry gene that causes lens luxation and breeding programs can be adjusted history thumb left sealyham house where captain john edwardes originally developed sealyham terrier breed

spectator until he died in october 2018 harry parsons founder of working sealyham terrier club has stated that to sustain a breed you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year kennel club has blamed decline of breed on availability of designer dogs and newer breeds such as shih tzu and banning of tail docking which has reduced their ability as working dogs paul formerly of kennel club s vulnerable breeds committee explains traditionally soon after sealyhams were born their tails were docked by half their length because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes meaning that they required short strong tails for owner to be able to pull them out as of 2010 breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by american kennel club by 2017 breed ranked 150 out of 190 breeds registered by american kennel club appearance thumb right upright a close up of face of a sealyham terrier thumb right upright an adult sealyham terrier not in show trim sealyhams measurements vary by breed standard according to particular countries kennel club breed standard states that height of a sealyham terrier should not exceed measured at withers or at top of shoulder blade ideal weight for a sealyham is for females or for males they have a white double coat which requires regular brushing with a wire comb in order to prevent matting it has a dense undercoat while outer coat is wiry and weather resistant markings on face can be in a variety of colours including lemon black brown blue and badger which is a mix of brown and black heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on coat are discouraged sealyhams are low to ground and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping in order to keep coat from becoming too soft however if they are not shown sealyhams can be clipped and this is often preferred grooming approach for pets as with many terriers sealyhams have essentially non shedding coats temperament thumb left upright a sealyham terrier in woods although happy in company of others they are fine if left alone sealyham terriers are suited for both town and country they can be strong willed occasionally vocal and boisterous but also full of personality and affectionate while they make for loyal family companions they can be trained to be working dogs making them excellent mousers or ratters they can also be taught as puppies to get along with other animals including cats and birds harry parsons described his sealyhams thus they make great companions and way they bond with their owners is almost magical i keep six indoors and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting they will know and are out of door in a millisecond if you train them they ll retrieve they ll do anything to please you health this is a hardy breed with few breed specific health problems main hereditary problem highlighted by american sealyham terrier club is an eye condition called lens luxation for which there are dna tests genetic testing can now readily determine if condition will be passed on and most breeders test both parents before breeding lens luxation is a condition in which lens slips out of position in eyeball due to weakening of fibers that holds it in place this in turn blocks flow of fluids in eye leading to a painful increase in intra ocular pressure glaucoma and often irreparable optic nerve damage leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness as of november 2011 kennel club has not highlighted any specific concerns regarding breed s health to conformation show judges due to low numbers of breed two of most prevalent problems facing breed today is popular sire effect and general problem of
