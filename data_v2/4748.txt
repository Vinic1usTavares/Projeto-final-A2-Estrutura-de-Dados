one of first settlers and founders of town of duxbury massachusetts wentworth 3 a defining characteristic of standish s military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes against indians in nemasket raid and conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited courage and skill as a soldier but he also demonstrated a brutality that angered indians and disturbed more moderate members of colony philbrick 153 156 one of standish s last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was botched penobscot

mee my great grandfather being a or younger brother from house of standish of standish places named by standish are all in lancashire england with exception of isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire possibly in vicinity of chorley where a branch of standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace aside from standish s will earliest source describing standish s family and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new england s memorial published in 1669 that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from house of standish in his younger time he went over into low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with

concerning standish s early military career in holland low countries to which morton referred at time dutch republic was embroiled in eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland philbrick 25 but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenant s commission in english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland winsor history of town of duxbury 97 jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and isle of man among other places and who led english troops in holland at time when standish was there standish apparently came to holland around 1603 and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during siege of sluis in 1604 in which vere s english troops were involved subsequent twelve years truce 1609 1621 between spain and dutch republic might have ended standish s service jenks 38 he was certainly still in holland in 1620 and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters stratton 19 at that time he was using title of captain when considering candidates for this important position puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of founders of english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped american coast they approached him to return to new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator philbrick 59

passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to new world mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as

his life and by necessity worked closely with standish two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences two worked well together in managing colony and responding to dangers as they arose philbrick 114 defense of plymouth colony by february 1621 colonists had sighted indians several times but there had been no communication men of colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february 17 1621 consisting of all able bodied men electing standish as their commander leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified decision by democratic process men of plymouth colony continued to re elect him to that position for remainder of his life as captain of militia he regularly drilled his men in use of pikes and muskets philbrick 89 contact with indians came in march 1621 through an english speaking abenaki who arranged for pilgrims to meet with massasoit sachem of nearby pokanoket tribe on march 22 plymouth colony s governor john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between pokanokets and colonists and requiring two parties to defend one another in times of need philbrick 99 governor carver died same year and responsibility of upholding treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with complex task of reacting to threats against both pilgrims and pokanokets from tribes such as massachusetts and narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining

in pokanoket village of nemasket now site of middleborough massachusetts about west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to english as and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to pilgrims ensuring survival of colony hobbamock was another influential ally a high ranking advisor to massasoit and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among indians when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth schmidt 105 bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to plymouth pokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august 14 1621 standish led a group of 10 men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and two men were close for remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of

narragansett bay in rhode island and were one of more powerful tribes in region bradford sent back snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated jenks 151 standish took threat seriously and urged that colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or 0 8 km long

were still only 50 men to work on task despite challenges settlers constructed palisade per standish s recommendations in just three months finishing in march 1622 standish divided militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending village in event of attack philbrick 129 wessagusset a more serious threat came from massachusett tribe to north and was precipitated by arrival of a new group of english colonists in april 1622 vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth men chose a site on shore of fore river in weymouth massachusetts about north of plymouth and they called their colony wessagusset settlers of poorly managed colony infuriated massachusett

wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by massachusetts that settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation philbrick 147 bradford called a public meeting at which pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill leaders of plot jenks 174 mission had a personal aspect for standish one of warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish philbrick 149 standish arrived at wessagusset and found that many of colonists had gone to live with massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of group threatening wessagusset he came to settlement with wituwamat and other warriors day after standish s arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares jenks 175 later in day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage philbrick 151 next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagusset s one room houses pecksuot brought wituwamat wituwamat s adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in house on an arranged signal they shut door of house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with man s own knife wituwamat and third warrior were also killed standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death then went outside walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of massachusett tribe they

head jenks 178 leaders of plot to destroy settlements had been killed and threat removed but action had unexpected consequences settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after incident which standish had been trying to protect most of settlers departed for an english fishing post on island attack also caused widespread panic among indian tribes throughout region villages were abandoned and pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time philbrick 154 pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality jenks 179 bradford too was uncomfortable

encouraged behavior that pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe sabbath and sold weapons to indians philbrick 163 bradford

had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack men from plymouth but merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish

established a trading post in 1613 on penobscot river in castine maine english forces captured settlement in 1628 and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for pilgrims for seven years however french mounted a small expedition in 1635 and easily reclaimed settlement jenks 224 bradford ordered standish to take action determined that post be reclaimed in plymouth colony s name this was a significantly larger proposition than small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish task he chartered ship good hope captained by a man named girling standish s plan appears to have been to bring good hope within cannon range of trading post and to bombard french into surrendering unfortunately girling ordered bombardment before ship was within range and quickly spent all gunpowder on board standish gave up effort by this time neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of colony in boston for help in reclaiming trading post but bay colony refused incident was indicative of rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in 1691 two were merged
