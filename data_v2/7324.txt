analysis thumb right episode uses four seasons by vivaldi pictured to mark changing seasons and david s changing mental state diddle diddle dumpling with david s obsessive search for shoe s owner offered a macabre reimagining of cinderella for sean o grady of independent journalist andrew billen on other hand said that episode did not present shoe as an allusion to cinderella or so that viewers might wait to hear other shoe drop instead shoe is presented as lonesome aberration and on at least one occasion is actively anthropomorphised by david comedy critic bruce dessau identified stories of men who marry their vw golfs or women who fancy eiffel tower as something he initially thought an inspiration and noted good life as a potential influence for david and louise s lifestyle however episode diverged strongly from what he had expected as david s obsession did not involve romantic love and episode as a whole was low on humour diddle diddle dumpling is a relatively simple episode described by one critic as really just a quiet character study of a man losing his grip episode uses vivaldi s four seasons to mark passage of time which is also portrayed by changing colour palettes score and setting convey david s emotional and mental fragility with a contrast drawn between chaotic music and controlled cinematography seasons too convey david s mental state first decline then autumnal calm then collapse episode s closing scene is according to several critics ambiguous as it is unclear whether david has visited violence on ted or on sally similarly nature of louise s relationships with both ted and chris is open to interpretation one critic noted little moment of louise s interaction with chris and questioned whether david might believe louise to be having an affair with ted family s home has a sterile feeling and features a large number of objects in symmetrical pairs this mise en scene reflects david s psychosis and what he and louise have lost in death of sally s twin brother relatedly shots of unoccupied rooms create a sense of emptiness while final shot of ted shows him as a half person critics identified direction as hitchcockian while tandy characterised it as bergmanesque number 9 of diddle diddle dumpling was not family home but shoe which was size 9 despite taking place in a small number of rooms or just outside episode does not have feeling of claustrophobia that is present in some other episodes diddle diddle dumpling represented a sharp change of tone from previous episode of inside no 9 empty orchestra for mark butler of i episode s melancholic mood uneasy domestic setting and allusions to mental illness link it to tom gerri an episode from inside no 9 first series reception diddle diddle dumpling was very well received by critics some of whom characterised it as an improvement on weaker empty orchestra dessau identified it as a terrific instalment while o grady discussed it as a key example of how high quality television continues to survive in 21st century as part of a renaissance in british comedy it was for him comparable with best of shearsmith and pemberton s previous work billen similarly characterised it as one of best episodes of inside no 9 for freelance critic dan owen diddle diddle dumpling was a characteristically rich and rewarding experience for patrick smith of daily telegraph it was a delicious slice of macabre humour and for hannah j davies of theguardian com it was excellent even if not strongest episode of series mark butler of inews co uk said that episode managed to weave a genuinely gripping and powerful half hour of tv from a seemingly bizarre and banal set up a testament to inside no 9 ongoing mastery of mood julie mcdowall of national called it a brilliantly slow creeping and sinister episode similarly victoria segal and helen stewart of sunday times praised way that episode builds up an atmosphere of creeping dread but were critical of slightly tasteless conclusion to which episode dribbles in sister paper times however billen praised conclusion saying it brought with it a tide of distress on website of times hugo rifkind characterised ending as somewhat anticlimatic suggesting that best mysteries are never solved also writing for times chris bennion praised near genius premise calling episode a witty glimpse of midlife inadequacy that became darker as it progressed butler identified device of shifting seasons as a clever and striking touch characterising episode as moving from laugh out loud humour to profoundly uncomfortable interactions with a hard to swallow and disquieting conclusion morales s direction received high praise as did performances of hawes baynton and especially shearsmith bennion though suggested that hawes and baynton were somewhat underused references external links diddle diddle dumpling at bbc programmes diddle diddle dumpling at british comedy guide category 2017 british television episodes category
