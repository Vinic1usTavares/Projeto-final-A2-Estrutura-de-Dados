appear in supporting roles film is loosely inspired by work of raymond chandler joel coen stated we wanted to do a chandler kind of story how it moves episodically and deals with characters trying to unravel a mystery as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that s ultimately unimportant original score was composed by carter burwell a longtime collaborator of coen brothers big lebowski was a

and dude encounters film s cowboy narrator who tells audience that maude is pregnant with a little lebowski and hopes that dude and walter will win their upcoming bowling tournament cast jeff bridges as jeffrey dude lebowski bridges had heard or was told by coen brothers that they had written a screenplay for him john goodman as walter sobchak a vietnam veteran and bowling partner and friend of dude walter was based in part on screenwriter and director john milius julianne moore as maude lebowski jeffrey big lebowski s daughter a feminist and an avant garde artist steve buscemi as theodore donald donny kerabatsos a bowling partner and friend of dude walter s repeated response shut fuck up donny is a reference to fargo in which buscemi s character was constantly talking and interrupting conversations when he is not paying attention to story david huddleston as jeffrey big lebowski a millionaire philanthropist for whom dude is mistaken philip seymour hoffman as brandt jeffrey big lebowski s executive assistant tara reid as bunny lebowski jeffrey big lebowski s blonde 20s something trophy wife and former porn video performer log jammin for jackie treehorn productions according to reid charlize theron also tried out for role philip moon as woo a jackie treehorn thug mark pellegrino as blond treehorn thug peter stormare torsten and flea as uli kunkel karl franz and kieffer german nihilists uli originated on set of fargo between ethan coen and stormare who often spoke in a mock german accent jimmie dale gilmore as smokey a hippie bowler in league whom walter threatens at gunpoint over an attempt to mark his frame an eight despite letting his foot move over alley line jack kehler as marty dude s landlord who is also a performance artist john turturro as jesus quintana coen brothers let turturro come up with a lot of his own ideas for character like towel shining bowling ball and scene where he dances backward from his bowling alley line which he says was inspired by muhammad ali david thewlis as knox harrington an avant garde videographer friend of maude lebowski sam elliott as stranger a smooth talking urban cowboy who also serves as narrator of film ben gazzara as big time porn video producer jackie treehorn to whom bunny lebowski owes money jon polito as da fino a private dick who mistakes dude for a brother shamus hired by bunny s family to return her to them leon as malibu police chief aimee mann as nihilist woman franz s girlfriend who donates her amputated green nail polished little toe proof of bunny lebowski s kidnapping production development dude is mostly inspired by jeff dowd an american film producer and political activist coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature blood simple dowd had been a member of seattle seven liked to drink white russians and was known as dude dude was also partly based on a friend of coen brothers peter exline now a member of faculty at usc s school of cinematic arts a vietnam war veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that tied room together exline knew barry sonnenfeld from new york university and sonnenfeld introduced exline to coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for blood simple exline became friends with coens and in 1989 told them all kinds of stories from his own life including ones about his actor writer friend lewis abernathy one of inspirations for walter a fellow vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car as in film exline s car was impounded by los angeles police department and abernathy found an 8th grader s homework under passenger seat exline also belonged to an amateur softball league but coens changed it to bowling in film because it s a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation coens met filmmaker john milius when they were in los angeles making barton fink and incorporated his love of guns and military into character of walter john milius introduced coen brothers to one of his best friends jim ganzer who would have been another source of inferences to create jeff bridges character also known as dude ganzer and his gang typical malibu surfers served as inspiration as well for milius s film big wednesday sam bleakley j s callahan surfing tropical beats alison hodge 2012 p 133 according to julianne moore character of maude was based on artist carolee schneemann who worked naked from a swing and on yoko ono character of jesus quintana was inspired in part by a performance coens had seen john turturro give in 1988 at public theater in a play called mi puta vida in which he played a pederast type character so we thought let s make turturro a pederast it ll be something he can really run with joel said in an interview film s overall structure was influenced by detective fiction of raymond chandler ethan said we wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling like a modern raymond chandler story and that s why it had to be set in los angeles we wanted to have a narrative flow a story that moves like a chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes use of stranger s voice over also came from chandler as joel remarked he is a little bit of an audience substitute in movie adaptation of chandler it s main character that speaks off screen but we didn t want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes it s as if someone was commenting on plot from an all seeing point of view and at same time rediscovering old earthiness of a mark twain significance of bowling culture was according to joel important in reflecting that period at end of fifties and beginning of sixties that suited retro side of movie slightly anachronistic which sent us back to a not so far away era but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless screenplay coen brothers wrote big lebowski around same time as barton fink when coen brothers wanted to make it john goodman was filming episodes for roseanne television program and jeff bridges was making walter hill film wild bill coens decided to make fargo in meantime according to ethan movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between dude and walter which sprang from scenes between barton fink and charlie meadows in barton fink they also came up with idea of setting film in contemporary l a because people who inspired story lived in area when pete exline told them about homework in a incident coens thought that that was very raymond chandler and decided to integrate elements of author s fiction into their script joel coen cites robert altman s long goodbye as a primary influence on their film in sense that big lebowski is just kind of informed by chandler around edges when they started writing script coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it this is a normal writing process for them because they often encounter a problem at a certain stage we pass to another project then we come back to first script that way we ve already accumulated pieces for several future movies in order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition they added an effete art world hanger on known as knox harrington late in screenwriting process in original script dude s car was a chrysler lebaron as dowd had once owned but that car was not big enough to fit john goodman so coens changed it to a ford torino pre production polygram and working title films who had funded fargo backed big lebowski with a budget of 15 million in casting film joel remarked we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with and some parts without knowing who s going to play role in big lebowski we did write for john goodman and steve buscemi but we didn t know who was getting jeff bridges role in preparation for his role bridges met dowd but actually drew on myself a lot from back in sixties and seventies i lived in a little place like that and did drugs although i think i was a little more creative than dude actor went into his own closet with film s wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought dude might wear he wore his character s clothes home because most of them were his own actor also adopted same physicality as dowd including slouching and his ample belly originally goodman wanted a different kind of beard for walter but coen brothers insisted on gladiator or what they called chin strap and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut for film s look coens wanted to avoid usual retro 1960s cliches like lava lamps day glo posters and grateful dead music and for it to be consistent with whole bowling thing we wanted to keep movie pretty bright and poppy joel said in an interview for example star motif featured predominantly throughout film started with film s production designer richard heinrichs design for bowling alley according to joel he came up with idea of just laying free form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free form star thing on interior this carried over to film s dream sequences both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point in first dream sequence dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into overhead nightscape of l a second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars remembers heinrichs for jackie treehorn s malibu beach house he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture coen brothers told heinrichs that they wanted treehorn s beach party to be inca themed with a very hollywood looking party in which young oiled down fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks so there s a very sacrificial quality to it cinematographer roger deakins discussed look of film with coens during pre production they told him that they wanted some parts of film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts like dream sequences to have a very stylized look bill and jacqui landrum did all of choreography for film for his dance sequence jack kehler went through three three hour rehearsals coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose modest mussorgsky s pictures at an exhibition at each rehearsal he went through each phase of piece principal photography actual filming took place over an eleven week period with location shooting in and around los angeles including all of bowling sequences at hollywood star lanes for three weeks and dude s busby berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar according to joel only time they ever directed bridges was when he would come over at beginning of each scene and ask do you think dude burned one on way over i d reply yes usually so jeff would go over in corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot julianne moore was sent script while working on lost world jurassic park she worked only two weeks on film early and late during production that went from january to april 1997 while sam elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech architecture scenes in jackie treehorn s house were shot in sheats goldstein residence designed by john lautner and built in 1963 in hollywood hills deakins described look of fantasy scenes as being very crisp monochromatic and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus however with dude s apartment deakins said it s kind of seedy and light s pretty nasty with a grittier look visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed night scenes instead of adopting usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look he used an orange sodium light effect coen brothers shot a lot of film with wide angle lens because according to joel it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic to achieve point of view of a rolling bowling ball coen brothers mounted a camera on something like a barbecue spit according to ethan and then it along lane challenge for them was figuring out relative speeds of forward motion and rotating motion cgi was used to create vantage point of thumb hole in bowling ball soundtrack original score was composed by carter burwell a veteran of all coen brothers films while coens were writing screenplay they had kenny rogers just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in gipsy kings cover of hotel california and several creedence clearwater revival songs in mind they asked t bone burnett who would later work with coens on o brother where art thou and inside llewyn davis to pick songs for soundtrack of film they knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but as joel remembers t bone even came up with some far out henry mancini and yma sumac burnett was able to secure songs by kenny rogers and gipsy kings and also added tracks by captain beefheart moondog and bob dylan s man in me from new morning however he had a tough time securing rights to townes van zandt s cover of rolling stones dead flowers which plays over film s closing credits former stones manager allen klein owned rights to song and wanted 150 000 for it burnett convinced klein to watch an early cut of film and remembers it got to part where dude says i hate fuckin eagles man klein stands up and says that s it you can have song that was beautiful burnett was going to be credited on film as music supervisor but asked his credit to be music archivist because he hated notion of being a supervisor i wouldn t want anyone to think of me as management for joel original music as with other elements of movie had to echo retro sounds of sixties and early seventies music defines each character for example tumbling by bob nolan was chosen for stranger at time coens wrote screenplay as was by henry mancini for jackie treehorn german nihilists are accompanied by techno pop and jeff bridges by creedence so there s a musical signature for each of them remarked ethan in an interview character uli kunkel was in german electronic band autobahn a homage to band kraftwerk album cover of their record bed of nails is a parody of kraftwerk album cover for man machine and group name autobahn shares name of a kraftwerk song and album in lyrics phrase we believe in nothing is repeated with electronic distortion this is a reference to autobahn s nihilism in film reception box office big lebowski received its world premiere at 1998 sundance film festival on january 18 1998 at 1 300 capacity eccles theater it was also screened at 48th berlin

an 83 approval rating based on 98 reviews with an average rating of 7 36 10 website s critics consensus reads typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from coen brothers brought to life with strong performances from goodman and bridges metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned film a score of 71 out of 100 based on 23 critics indicating generally favorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale many critics and audiences have likened film to a modern western while many others dispute this or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices peter howell in his review for toronto star wrote it s hard to believe that this is work of a team that won an oscar last year for original screenplay of fargo there s a large amount of profanity in movie which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps howell revised his opinion in a later review and in 2011 stated that it may just be my favourite coen bros film todd mccarthy in variety magazine wrote one of film s indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack which mixes carter burwell s original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers usa today gave film three out of four stars and felt that dude was too passive a hero to sustain interest but that there was enough startling brilliance here to suggest that just like dude those pants coens will abide in his review for washington post desson howe praised coens and their inspired absurdist taste for weird peculiar americana but a sort of neo americana that is entirely invented coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre no one does it like them and it almost goes without saying no one does it better janet maslin praised bridges performance in her review for new york times mr bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out to lunch character played with fine comic flair andrew sarris in his review for new york observer wrote result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward craftsmanship involved i doubt that there ll be anything else like it rest of this year in a five star review for empire magazine ian nathan wrote for those who delight in coens divinely abstract take on reality this is pure nirvana and in a perfect world all movies would be made by coen brothers roger ebert gave film three stars out of four describing it as weirdly engaging in a 2010 review ebert gave big lebowski four stars out of four and added film to his great movies list however jonathan rosenbaum wrote in chicago reader to be sure big lebowski is packed with show offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining but insofar as it represents a moral position and coens relative styling of their figures invariably does it s an elitist one elevating salt of earth types like bridges and goodman over everyone else in movie dave kehr in his review for daily news criticized film s premise as a tired idea and it produces an episodic film guardian criticized film as a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random film is infuriating and will win no prizes but it does have some terrific jokes legacy since its original release big lebowski has become a cult classic ardent fans of film call themselves achievers steve wrote about film s emerging cult status in july 2002 he first realized that film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at new
