pine island glacier pig is a large ice stream and fastest melting glacier in antarctica responsible for about 25 of antarctica s ice loss glacier ice streams flow west northwest along south side of hudson mountains into pine island bay amundsen sea antarctica it was mapped by united states geological survey usgs from surveys and united states navy usn air photos 1960 66 and named by advisory committee on antarctic names us in association with pine island bay area drained by pine island glacier comprises about 10 of west antarctic ice sheet satellite measurements have shown that pine island glacier basin has a greater net contribution of ice to sea than any other ice drainage basin in world and this has increased due to recent acceleration of ice stream ice stream is extremely remote with nearest continually occupied research station at rothera nearly away area is not claimed by any nations and antarctic treaty prohibits any new claims while it is in force ice sheet drainage thumb floating ice shelf at downstream end of pine island glacier crack shows start of a large iceberg calving antarctic ice sheet is largest mass of ice on earth containing a volume of water equivalent to of global sea level ice sheet forms from snow which falls onto continent and compacts under its own weight ice then moves under its own weight toward edges of continent most of this transport to sea is by ice streams faster moving channels of ice surrounded by slower moving ice walls and outlet glaciers antarctic ice sheet consists of large relatively stable east antarctic ice sheet and a smaller less stable west antarctic ice sheet west antarctic ice sheet is drained into sea by several large ice streams most of which flow into either ross ice shelf or filchner ronne ice shelf pine island and thwaites glaciers are two major west antarctic ice streams which do not flow into a large ice shelf they are part of an area called amundsen sea embayment a total area of 10 percent of west antarctic ice sheet drains out to sea via pine island glacier this area is known as pine island glacier drainage basin weak underbelly of west antarctic ice sheet pine island and thwaites glaciers are two of antarctica s five largest ice streams scientists have found that flow of these ice streams has accelerated in recent years and suggested that if they were to melt global sea levels would rise by destabilising entire west antarctic ice sheet and perhaps sections of east antarctic ice sheet in 1981 terry hughes proposed that region around pine island bay may be a weak underbelly of west antarctic ice sheet this is based on fact that unlike majority of large west antarctic ice streams those flowing into amundsen sea are not protected from ocean by large floating ice shelves also although surface of glacier is above sea level base lies below sea level and slopes downward inland this suggests that there is no geological barrier to stop a retreat of ice once it has started acceleration and thinning pine island glacier began to retreat in 1940s speed of pine island glacier increased by 73 percent from 1974 to end of 2007 with an 8 percent increase over last 16 months of this period alone this speed up has meant that by end of 2007 pine island glacier system had a negative mass balance of 46 gigatonnes per year which is equivalent to per year global sea level rise in other words much more water was being put into sea by pig than was being replaced by snowfall measurements along centre of ice stream by gps demonstrated that this acceleration is still high nearly inland at around 4 percent over 2007 it has been suggested that this recent acceleration could have been triggered by warm ocean waters at end of pig where it has a floating section ice shelf approximately long it has also been shown that pig underwent rapid thinning during holocene and that this process may continue for centuries after it is initiated as ice stream accelerates it is also getting steeper rate of thinning within central trunk has quadrupled from 1995 to 2006 if current rate of acceleration were to continue main trunk of glacier could be afloat within 100 years subglacial volcano in january 2008 british antarctic survey bas scientists reported that 2 200 years ago a volcano erupted under antarctic ice sheet this was biggest antarctic eruption in last 10 000 years volcano is situated in hudson mountains close to pine island glacier eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash and tephra over surface of ice sheet this ash was then buried under snow and ice date of eruption was estimated from depth of burial of ash this method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores presence of volcano raises possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed or may contribute in future to increases in flow of glacier in 2018 it was found that there is a substantial volcanic heat source beneath pine island glacier approximately half as large as active grimsvotn volcano on iceland same year a study was published concluding that bedrock below wais was uplifted at a higher rate than previously thought authors suggested this could eventually help to stabilize ice sheet history of fieldwork on ice thumb right seismic surveying on pine island glacier thumb birth of an iceberg thumb this animation shows a drill site location on pine island ice shelf along with velocity colored ocean flows due to remoteness of pine island glacier most of information available on ice stream comes from airborne or satellite based measurements first expedition to visit ice stream was a united states over snow traverse which spent around a week in area of pig during january 1961 they dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness one of scientists on this traverse was charles r bentley who said we didn t know we were crossing a glacier at time pig is around wide at point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from surrounding ice this expedition was called ellsworth highland traverse then in 2004 2005 field season a team of nine using a british antarctic survey bas twin otter aircraft equipped with ice penetrating radar completed an aerial survey of pig and its adjacent ice sheet team of seven british and two americans flew 30 km grid patterns over pig until january 5 mapping sub glacial terrain of an area roughly size of nevada due to remoteness of pig and logistical difficulties of caching enough fuel for 04 05 expedition and future project s bas used resources of united states antarctic program usap and their ski equipped aircraft after many weeks of weather delays first four men arrived from mcmurdo station on 9 november 2004 and began to establish camp and build a for remaining members of team arrived from rothera research station 10 days later in a twin otter because of unusually good weather in area that season survey completed flying their grids by mid january and began flying 15 km grids of thwaites glacier for a usap expedition who had been experiencing unusually poor weather in their area that year flying over antarctica s pine island glacier on october 14 2011 in a dc 8 research plane scientists participating in nasa s mission discovered a massive crack running about across glacier s floating tongue rift is wide on average and deep another team from british antarctic survey arrived at ice stream on 8 december 2006 for first of two field seasons in second field season they spent three months there from november 2007 to february 2008 work on glacier included radar measurements and seismic surveys in january 2008 bob bindschadler of nasa landed on floating ice shelf of pig first ever landing on this ice shelf for a reconnaissance mission to investigate feasibility of drilling through around of ice to lower instruments into ocean cavity below it was decided that small crevasse free area was too hard for further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed therefore two global positioning system gps units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to pig in 2011 2012 field season after five weeks of delays camp staff was finally able to establish main camp just before new year destination uncertain blogspot com following week bindschadler and his team were able to arrive due to additional weather delays helicopters were not able to arrive by nsf drop dead date and field season was cancelled pigiceshelf nasa gov limited science was still accomplished by team thanks to a series of flights by kba back onto glacier conditions had changed drastically since last twin otter flights http pigiceshelf nasa gov index php page blogs british antarctic survey deployed a small team of four during 2011 12 summer field season to carry out a series of seismic and radar surveys on pig they also installed a series of overwintering gps stations during season a separate bas team travelled to field party s location and installed an overwintering autonomous station this was followed by a radar traverse upstream using this survey linked previous radar lines from sea first ship to reach pine island glacier s ice shelf in pine island bay was uss uscgc glacier in 1985 this ship was an icebreaker operated by u s coast guard mission known as deep freeze had scientists on board who took sediment samples from ocean floor during summer field season over two months from january to february 2009 researchers aboard u s antarctic program research vessel nathaniel b palmer reached ice shelf this was second time that palmer had successfully made it up to glacier first time being in 1994 in collaboration with british scientists used a robotic submarine to explore glacier carved channels on continental shelf as well as cavity below ice shelf and glacier submarine known as autosub 3 was developed and built at national oceanography centre in uk it completed six successful missions travelling a total of under ice shelf autosub is able to map base of ice shelf as well as ocean floor and take various measurements and samples of water on way success of autosub 3 was particularly notable because its predecessor autosub 2 was lost beneath ice shelf on only its second such mission see also list of antarctic ice streams list of glaciers in antarctic references
