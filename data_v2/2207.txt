basically a good idea for a film that never gets off ground siskel added i don t know what film is about it s so totally confused and taking things from different parts on one hand if it wants to say something about a child s eye view of war you got a movie made by john boorman called hope and glory that was just released that is much better and much more daring in showing whimsy that children s

society is reflected in his hero worship of japanese aviators based at airfield adjoining camp i think it s true that japanese were pretty brutal with chinese so i don t have any particularly sentimental view of them ballard recalled but small boys tend to find their heroes where they can one thing there was no doubt about and that was that japanese were extremely brave one had very complicated views about patriotism and loyalty to one s own nation jim is constantly identifying himself first with japanese then when americans start flying over in their mustangs and b 29s he s very drawn to american apocalyptic wartime setting and climactic moment when jim sees distant white flash of atomic bombing of nagasaki gave spielberg powerful visual metaphors to draw a parallel story between death of this boy s innocence and death of innocence of entire world mcbride 1997 p 393 spielberg reflected he was attracted to idea that this was a death of innocence not an attenuation of childhood which by my own admission and everybody s impression of me is what my life has been this was opposite of peter pan this was a boy who had grown up too quickly other topics that spielberg previously dealt with and are presented in empire of sun include a child being separated from his parents sugarland express e t extra terrestrial close encounters of third kind and poltergeist and
