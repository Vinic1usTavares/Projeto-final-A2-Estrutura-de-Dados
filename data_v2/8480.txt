hidden complexities and non linear results 1997 asian financial crisis is used to illustrate a system in which professed experts had confidence in but internal and external factors compounded upon each other to create a sudden unexpected drop delusion of control or assumption that experts were in control led to overconfidence in an economic system that was not well understood homer dixon finds that experts are just as susceptible to as non experts and that they have boundless capacity for hindsight rationalization of unexpected movements as older problems are solved more complexities are being introduced like adding additional parts to an engine interaction of these new parts or niches create emergent properties like time saving office devices e g email mobile computers etc make communication more efficient but also expand network of contacts and increase amount of time spent on such duties homer dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity however this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy
