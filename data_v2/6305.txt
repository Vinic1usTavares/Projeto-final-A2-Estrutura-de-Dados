any page from www net webcomic derives its name from one of propaganda broadcasts by wallace breen in half life 2 in which he is reading a letter supposedly written by a citizen signed sincerely a concerned citizen and begins his response with thank you for writing concerned throughout comic main character gordon frohman sends several similar letters to dr breen livingston s intention being to suggest that frohman was author of letter read by breen in half life 2 name frohman is derived from last name of gordon freeman protagonist of half life series according to credits on comic s website

stated by livingston in several interviews his relation with valve developer company of half life 2 was a good one company being pleased to have a comic based on their game according to livingston valve also intended to collaborate with him to produce printed copies of concerned however this was never finalized as resolution of comics was too low for printing livingston has said that comic will not continue through half life 2 episode one first of an episodic series following half life 2 as game doesn t really lend itself to type of comic he wants to do synopsis background in half life 2 player takes on role of dr gordon freeman throughout game player follows story of a dark dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by combine a mysterious alien enemy in contrast concerned follows same general path through story established by half life 2 but instead follows adventures of gordon frohman a hapless lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in city 17 a few weeks before freeman frohman is incredibly naive and unlike other citizens seems to enjoy living under rule of totalitarian administrator dr breen and combine he holds an insane reverence for latter even going to point of having a plush doll of a combine soldier plot early phases of comic have frohman excitedly arriving in city 17 eventually he takes a job at combine s headquarters citadel under a combine elite named mr henderson as most of his human colleagues become combine soldiers he realizes that henderson has no immediate intention to do same for him citing his incompetence demanding to become one with combine frohman willingly sets off to nova prospekt an alien security and detention installation for invasive surgery to convert him meanwhile he selects ravenholm as a residence where he can commute to and from city 17 but lacks proper transport with which to get there after a failed attempt to reach ravenholm using dr isaac kleiner s teleporter leaves him stuck in a counter strike source server for a week he seeks ravenholm by foot instead traveling through city 17 s canals frohman arrives badly injured and dazed at black mesa east headquarters of human resistance where he is welcomed as a helper his stay there is cut short because he causes trouble in base and also irritatingly overuses gravity gun he is fooled into leaving base and finally heads toward and reaches ravenholm on frohman s arrival ravenholm is depicted as a peaceful bright and cheerful place devoid of any combine elements but terrorized by father grigori after adjusting gordon becomes accustomed to town but unintentionally discloses town s location to dr breen who immediately orders his forces to bomb shit out of them town is fired on with headcrabs killing many and turning others into zombies frohman himself is attacked by a headcrab and turns into a zombie too yet retains his free will and after a while his headcrab dies of malnutrition which is attributed to his lack of intelligence with father grigori s help frohman escapes ravenholm now zombie infested nightmare seen when freeman visits it in game and presses on to nova prospekt after surviving several more hazards he reaches coast here after passing final resistance base and an antlion infested beach frohman encounters an antlion guard which is killed by a an alien race helping humans in game this allows frohman to retrieve bugbait from dead creature with which he can control antlions frohman accompanied by several bugbait controlled antlions eventually reaches nova prospekt only to be turned away as he does not have an appointment he gives up and returns to city 17 in following strip as gordon freeman finally arrives in city linking comic s time frame with start of half life 2 he is then drafted into resistance after failing to disrupt its operations and unintentionally signals start of resistance s uprising after one of his antlions accidentally kills a combine police officer during fighting he accompanies freeman himself and mingles with resistance members aids combine in capture of alyx vance one of freeman s allies and reunites with norman frohman his long lost assassin twin brother only to promptly witness his death at hands of a strider a large tripodal assault synth following this gordon returns to citadel unwillingly aiding freeman in his journey up citadel and influencing plot of game as freeman is pursuing dr breen to his teleporter frohman is about to kill freeman but he pauses to come up with perfect one liner for occasion causing him to run out of time dr breen s teleporter explodes and frohman is flung off citadel peak by explosion dr breen also survives having fallen from citadel onto a pile of dead combine soldiers however frohman falls right onto breen killing him gordon himself is only seriously injured baffled by his ability to survive he realizes through a flashback that he has been under buddha mode a cheat code which prevents his health points from dropping below one throughout comic s duration frohman inadvertently turns off mode and even spoils an opportunity to be rescued by a group of vortigaunts as both gordon freeman and alyx vance are at start of episode one in end frohman dies unceremoniously while survivors of city 17 uprising find him dead themes 300px thumb protagonist of comic asks how it is possible for him to pick up objects without using his hands a reference to player s hands not being visible in half life 2 when holding anything other than weapons livingston stated that comic was a good way of pointing out several shortcomings of video games and first person shooters in particular he emphasized presence of various objects throughout levels of games which were intended to aid player but would have little chance of being found in real world in a similar manner much of comic s dark humor is derived from its contrasts with half life 2 in a depressing dark vision of a conquered humanity s future gordon freeman becomes a hero and savior similarly named gordon frohman on other hand is just an average person improbably cheerful to point of stupidity and somewhat naive as to what is actually going on around him for instance frohman fails to realize that his return addressed letters to doctor breen reveal his location and so result in that location being invaded bombed or otherwise compromised comic contains many references to events and objects in game in one comic frohman makes a clerical error that causes combine to order far too many explosive barrels thus suggesting an explanation for barrels ubiquity throughout city 17 and beyond in another he writes a letter to dr breen asking why using his flashlight reduces his ability to run a reference to half life 2 s flashlight and sprint functions using same power source in a further strip town of ravenholm becomes headcrab infested ghost town seen in half life 2 after frohman writes to breen expressing his happiness with being there giving away ravenholm s location indeed frohman causes intentionally or accidentally many of disastrous circumstances that gordon freeman runs across he accidentally gives breen idea of headcrab shells while on a radio and sets up all of traps in ravenholm himself in an attempt to catch father grigori it is also revealed that at black mesa research facility frohman causes resonance cascade that allows for alien forces to invade in half life by accidentally delivering a wedge of cheese instead of intended test sample to test chamber where cascade half life decay however indicates that dr gina cross is responsible for this task livingston admitted he did not play decay and thus was not aware of its storyline he also stated that comic takes place in pc version of half life continuity and since half life decay was never published for pc it does not affect comic reception comic has had positive reception from both public and editors of various gaming magazines globe and mail stated comic stands out from most other comics consisting of game screenshots by virtue of quality of its writing and presentation online magazine com said that concerned is one of funnier online gaming comics and

caught attention of reviewers outside united states and united kingdom romanian magazine level said comic is a recommendation to every fan of game and anyone looking for a good daily laugh comic s popularity as well as fact that livingston stated he does not intend to continue comic through half life 2 episode one led to appearance of an unofficial sequel to concerned entitled concerned 2 a
