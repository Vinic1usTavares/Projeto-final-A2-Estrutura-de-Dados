rich flavor and a reasonable price combination of these qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product it was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible including children a candy bar was developed with a dark cocoa flavored cookie pieces mixed with japanese style rice and finally coated with dark milk chocolate cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides however top of bar presents an uneven surface even with chocolate coating when it came to a name for product it was decided that keyword should be color black which would allude to dark chocolate flavor this is in keeping with other marketing trends in japan where color black is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate such as popular meiji black chocolate bar to give product some impact with consumers it was decided to name it after japanese god of thunder raijin although name of product uses english words black thunder pronounced or transliterated as outer
