brooklyn moses was also critical of several aspects of earlier park plans and then current layout created under benninger including placement of bathhouse and seawall too close to shore and lack of parking spaces according to moses location of bathhouse and bulkhead left a minimal portion of beach during high tide and limited future expansion of beach lack of parking meanwhile limited utilization of bathhouse which could accommodate more people than lot could fit cars under moses s plan large parking lot would facilitate traffic from belt parkway and marine parkway bridge 1934 plan was not implemented due to opposition from local communities among reasons for resistance were fears of bringing in individuals from other parts of city to rockaways and possibility of riis park out competing privately owned beaches and resorts leading to declines in property values in 1936 moses released what would be final plan for jacob riis park designed by clarke loyd and parks department
