s debut adventure game pendulo had announced plans for another adventure title before igors release art director rafael latiegui said that it was very clear to us that we were going to make more games in genre because co founder miguel angel ramos had left team after its first project company s three remaining core members latiegui felipe gomez pinilla and ramon hernaez gathered to brainstorm their second game trio sought to diverge from design process used in igor whose whole production latiegui later called absolutely amateurish central idea upon which hernaez pinilla and latiegui agreed was to make a classic adventure game including a high level of interactivity a visual look akin to animated films a comedic tone and a lack of player death hernaez and latiegui disliked trends in graphic adventure games at time especially what hernaez saw as an overreliance on cutscenes pendulo wanted to run away from anything like an interactive movie according to pinilla for plot team conceived a story about movie monsters from golden age of hollywood set around 1940s and 1950s pinilla said that designers had idea of going against all preconceived notions in public mind about such characters pendulo s co founders developed hollywood monsters script full time for between three and six months this process was collaborative pinilla noted that three leads held equal weight in decision making script ultimately detailed all of puzzles dialogue characters areas and objects set to appear in game pendulo opted for a very open non linear design that emphasized player freedom according to latiegui he pinilla and hernaez also purposely increased difficulty of hollywood monsters puzzles compared to those in igor they saw their first title as overly short and easy and hoped to remedy these issues in their next game hernaez cited then new project s large size as another aspect of its increased difficulty team estimated an average playtime of around 100 hours for hollywood monsters according to pc mania production pendulo began developing hollywood monsters with same game engine used by igor objective uikokahonia a project coded in pascal however team s concerns with engine quality led to two full rewrites of hollywood monsters underlying technology during production after finishing igor pendulo upgraded that title s codebase for use in developer s future projects this new version employed protected mode and offered support for voice overs enhanced scrolling a screen resolution and other features nevertheless competing adventure games began to outpace pendulo s older code according to ramon hernaez in response team chose to rewrite engine again which resulted in final version used in hollywood monsters engine that ultimately shipped with game built to support svga and a resolution of 640x480 was coded from ground up in c in 1997 felipe gomez pinilla summarized that quite a lot of time had been dedicated to engine development for hollywood monsters as with engine and game design pendulo started from scratch in creation of hollywood monsters animated graphics according to pinilla company began production of visuals by concepting environments and key objects while seeking an art style that suited team s goals meristations jordi espunya reported that pendulo settled on a stylistic direction inspired by spanish comics in particular their use of and satirical imagery all backgrounds characters and other art assets were designed on paper first then realized digitally developer hired graphic artists and background painters to fill out art staff as production ramped up including voice cast roughly 40 people contributed to hollywood monsters most of them outside contractors hernaez said that managing large number of contributors was most important change to pendulo s development process since igor which had involved six people hollywood monsters backgrounds took roughly one year to complete as art team worked on backgrounds it added unplanned visual red herrings for game s puzzles rafael latiegui noted that pendulo was amused by idea of getting people a little dizzy with some false trail s thumb left spanish new wave band la union pictured in 2015 contributed theme song to hollywood monsters during development hollywood monsters publisher dinamic multimedia suggested a plan to hire a well known band to compose music for game pendulo was uncertain at first about whom to contact but ultimately settled on spanish new wave group la union according to latiegui team thought that la union could do a good job and that their style fit game very well dinamic subsequently worked with la union s record label to secure a deal and band composed main theme for hollywood monsters enigmas latiegui said in late 1997 that collaboration had gone smoothly and that la union had got ten along very well with team in 2002 la union similarly recalled that working on hollywood monsters had been a very fun experience and reported that it was pleased with results of collaboration in retrospect pendulo labeled hollywood monsters a difficult project team found it to be a significantly greater challenge than igor had been and reported that resources were tight during production it ultimately required a long production cycle of around two and a half years pinilla told game 40 that development would have gone faster with more contributors but that it was impossible to have more people spain s game development industry had collapsed after golden age of spanish software in 8 bit era francisco delgado of micromania cited hollywood monsters as one of few spanish made games under production in 1997 while latiegui was hopeful that spain s fortunes were turning around hernaez remarked that we are still quite far from countries like england france or united states according to espunya there was a consensus in 1997 that spanish adventure game development had no future although he saw hollywood monsters as a hopeful sign distribution and sales dinamic multimedia first published hollywood monsters in spain during december 1997 it launched at a low price point of 2 995 pesetas eur18 made possible via inexpensive packaging and use of a file to replace much of manual while there were doubts in spain about sales potential of graphic adventure titles at time rafael latiegui noted that his company believed hollywood monsters low cost and high quality would spread game via word of mouth plan ultimately worked and title became a hit spanish retailer centro mail still reported hollywood monsters as its fourth best selling computer game during first half of may 1998 it continued to hold in store s top 10 consistently through may june july and first half of august title s 1998 italian release was similarly popular according to latiegui and dinamic debuted a second edition of game in spain during may 1999 david navarro of marcaplayer wrote that hollywood monsters performance in southern europe was a success comparable to best in genre around time of game s launch in spain latiegui told meristation that game development in his country is not profitable unless it can be amortized beyond our borders although igor objective uikokahonia had failed to break into international market pendulo had intended hollywood monsters from start to reach a global audience felipe gomez pinilla noted that newer game had been developed with english as its primary language spanish language dub was still in production by october 1997 however because of a lack of interest from publishers pendulo was unable to secure a release for hollywood monsters in united states in 2000 latiegui explained that game was released in worst moment in time for adventure games and companies didn t want to risk their money ultimately pendulo launched hollywood monsters only in spain and italy which continued company s lack of global market success in february 2002 hollywood monsters was announced as part of el mundos 2002 los mejores videojuegos del mundo mvm collection games that newspaper included with its sunday edition as optional purchases for eur5 each paper had incorporated igor into a similar promotion during 1998 because dinamic multimedia had gone bankrupt since debut of hollywood monsters pendulo partnered with fx interactive for re release which came in a special case with a set of stickers

publisher 2002 mvm collection was a success combined sales of its 10 games including hollywood monsters reached one million units fx subsequently brought game back to store shelves as part of its budget priced premium line in mid 2002 following year spain s gamelive pc reported that hollywood monsters was still sell ing well six years after its launch according to hobbyconsolas lifetime sales

that spanish games were coming of age latter compared it to successful pc futbol in this regard and highlighted hollywood monsters technical superiority over domestic competitors like similarly david

maniac mansion hollywood monsters won 1997 best spanish game award from radio program game 40 as voted by listeners hosts guillem caballe and manuel martin vivaldi likewise named it their favorite spanish game of 1997 former host joked that his choice was based entirely on scene in which ron ashman kicks a girl holding daisies into a river discussing visuals in hollywood monsters bono and melguizo offered praise while garcia wrote that game s presentation is simply magnificent reviewer for solo juegos similarly complimented graphics in hollywood monsters despite outdated neglected interface and echoed garcia s and melguizo s approval of voice acting conversely jordi espunya of meristation called voices uneven and cited several terrible performances among good ones and he argued that graphics although above average were inferior to those of foreign titles like curse of monkey island regarding puzzles cesar otero of meristation later said that they cause d schisms among adventurers with those who defend ed their madness and those who condemn ed absurdity of their solutions while garcia found hollywood monsters puzzles logical and melguizo praised their tight difficulty espunya called them frustrating and recommended game primarily to genre veterans as a result solo reviewer fell in between while highlighting game s length and many sensible puzzles writer felt that certain moments are not as logical as game promises in 2003 just adventures michal sided with espunya on puzzles and found hollywood monsters visuals adequate but its sound quality low he summarized game as well done though not excellent legacy writing for hobbyconsolas clara castano ruiz stated that hollywood monsters became a benchmark for development of graphic adventures in spain game proceeded to maintain a longstanding reputation in country and has retrospectively been labeled a classic by spanish outlets such as vandal 3djuegos defconplay and meristation in 2001 gamelive pc

spain editor guillermo del palacio named scene between ron ashman and girl with daisies one of 13 mythical moments recognizable to adventure game fans meristations cesar otero recalled it as one of most disgraceful moments of humor in history but nevertheless still amusing as a greater commercial and critical success than igor objective uikokahonia hollywood monsters marked a turning point for pendulo studios it has been cited by publications such as pc actual 3djuegos defconplay vandal and meristation as title that put pendulo on map francisco delgado of micromania wrote in 2011 that hollywood monsters was game that really brought fame and mass market to developer while xan pita of el mundo remarked thanks to this game pendulo made a good dent in industry a writer for meristation named hollywood monsters beginning of pendulo s signature cartoon visual style which it proceeded to carry throughout rest of its work pendulo went on to become an important spanish game developer particularly in adventure genre it followed hollywood monsters with runaway trilogy runaway a road adventure runaway 2 dream of turtle and runaway a twist of fate which brought company international success in 2011 marcaplayer dubbed pendulo masters of graphic adventure likewise ruiz wrote in 2017 that pendulo had become synonymous with graphic adventures in spain and one of country s most important studios successor in early 1998 rafael latiegui left open possibility of a hollywood monsters sequel if first game s sales and reception were strong enough he told meristation that we have a lot of ideas left over that were not possible to put in hollywood monsters because of time constraints pendulo studios soon began working on a second hollywood monsters but project changed shape to become runaway a road adventure which started to form as an idea in summer 1998 nevertheless latiegui said during runaways development that pendulo was still considering hollywood monsters 2 in 2001 he remarked that pendulo had produced a very fun script for sequel that was full of familiar characters and others to get to know with great humor and a great pre design it remained a tentative project at that time later in year pendulo encountered serious financial trouble due to 2001 bankruptcy of publisher dinamic multimedia which hampered runaways initial launch in spain most of pendulo s staff was laid off following dinamic s closure and pendulo discontinued all game development thereafter developer spent a year trying to obtain rights to release runaway internationally pendulo managed to hold out and make runaway a hit across europe which stabilized company team then continued runaway series in part because of first entry s success according to latiegui vast majority of those laid off returned for runaway 2 however fan requests for a sequel to hollywood monsters were ongoing throughout creation of runaway trilogy latiegui said of situation to each new game that we have been making reaction of spanish public has been same when is next hollywood monsters this pressure from fans became a key motivation for team to return to hollywood monsters concept in april 2010 pendulo and publisher focus home interactive announced next big thing commentators from adventure gamers and jeux video noted project s close similarity to hollywood monsters and in april 2011 game was retitled hollywood monsters 2 in spain at start pendulo conceived next big thing as a high definition remake of hollywood monsters but it increasingly drifted from this framework over time designer and writer josue monchan came to conclusion that original game s puzzle design and nonlinear structure did not hold up to modern standards as a result pendulo created something that is not a second part nor a remake latiegui explained rather team borrowed heavily from hollywood monsters and attempted to take its ideas in new directions sue bergman and ron ashman were removed in favor of new protagonists reporters dan murray and liz allaire of quill as with hollywood monsters next big thing takes place in a fantasy version of hollywood where monsters act in films story explores film industry s shift away from monster movies which threatens to leave their casts out of work pendulo tried to imbue game with a feminist outlook monchan called hollywood monsters a bit male chauvinist
