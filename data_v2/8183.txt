verses throughout song while very different than anything carey had ever recorded track was described as street hip hop music with a booming bass second song from butterfly my all spent one week atop charts carey described song as having a lush sound and intense styling solely written by carey and walter afanasieff my all featured guitar arpeggios which were synthetically created with clever use of sampling and playing keyboard notes as a result song was well received being called a slinky slow jam r b sound that fit mariah like a glove new material since carey intended 1 s to serve as a sign of gratitude to her fans album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums first was a cover of rainy davis sweetheart 1987 performed as a duet with co producer and rapper jermaine

songs i used to listen to when i was in school it s a really cute record young girls ll like it way i liked it when i was growing up another new song featured on 1 s was when you believe which carey

about moses if we were ever going to come together on any kind of record this is definitely right one and really coolest thing to me is that after all of drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry she was just really cool and we had a really good time in studio we had fun and so if nothing else it was a good experience and diva ism whatever song was co written by stephen schwartz and babyface who also produced song carey had previously collaborated with babyface on her albums music box 1993 and daydream 1995 babyface expressed how he went through more than one version of song and

characterised it as a very big ballad but in an inspirational way and denied speculation that there had been past rivalry or animosity between her and houston prior to its recording i never even really talked to her until this we never had any issues between us media and everybody made it an issue carey co wrote and co produced song whenever you call with longtime collaborator walter afanasieff for her album butterfly however in order to change song s tempo and format carey decided to re do song as a duet with brian mcknight because she felt it was one of best songs on butterfly

needs sharpening she ll hang with wu tang clan if you re big in r b charts like brian mcknight she ll be in there like a heat seeking parasite she don t give a fuck she destroys competition by sucking them dry and spitting them out mariah carey is she who must be bought at all costs be very afraid in a review for carey s 2001 album greatest hits sal cinquemani of slant magazine felt album was

who make a habit of hitting it big during holiday shopping season are wise indeed as sales traditionally skyrocket this year is no exception journalist and author marc shapiro in his biography of carey attributed album s high sales to presence of new songs writing consensus among music press was that mariah s insistence on including new material made all difference in increasing sales figures

regular element in nearly all future greatest hits albums as such packages go 1 s was a solid retrospective of mariah s chart hits but because these songs were radio including a favorite album track
