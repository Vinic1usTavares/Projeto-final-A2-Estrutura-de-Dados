originally scheduled to run in boston legal time slot for just four weeks but after receiving high ratings remained in time slot for remainder of season abc entertainment president steve mcpherson commented on scheduling decision ultimately we decided that without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in season we d continue to let grey s build on its tremendous momentum through may prior to broadcast it was announced that show s title would change from grey s anatomy to complications although ultimately this did not come to pass francie executive vice president for development at abc entertainment commented on show s conception i think there was a need for this kind of show on our air specifically a medical show and shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we re at right now medical shows are hard and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different but where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows she found a way to slow it down so you get to know characters there s definitely a strong female appeal to it rhimes explained that she had found idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one cast nine actors had star billing in show s first season series creator shonda rhimes wanted a diverse cast and so created characters without pre specified races determined not to have a show in which all extras are white except lone janitor she has created what new york times has called one of most colorful backgrounds in television rhimes used a blind casting technique which resulted in several roles going to actors of different racial backgrounds than first envisioned isaiah washington eventually cast as preston burke was originally

grey s anatomy a winner reviews by new york daily news and newsday can be found on dvd s back cover whereas newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating you simply can t stop watching walter chaw from film freak central said show was so odious so repugnant that it s impossible not to have predicted its newly minted role as most popular program in land washington post s tom shales was critical of early series finding it reminiscent of er and commenting that show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different he called rhimes script for pilot episode nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn writing that overall it s a new show only in sense that dr frankenstein s monster was a new man kate aurthur for new york times deemed show a hybrid of ally mcbeal sex and city and er writing of news that it had become highest rated midseason drama in 12 years that when you parse its ratings grey s anatomy underscores one of real lessons of current season men will watch shows with a female lead that goes against conventional wisdom which dictates that it s easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men review stream gave positive reviews regarding pilot episode a hard day s night due to undeniable chemistry between ellen pompeo and patrick dempsey from series first scene regarding miranda bailey s appearance in pilot com stated she s such a small woman but wait until she speaks com however had a mixed perspectives on pilot noting that storylines were similar to fellow abc series desperate housewives but also brilliantly written extremely well acted and directed to near perfection ign gave a positive review stating show isn t derivative and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor characters resemble real people who are fragile and yes fallible and added this facile description does little justice to show s tightly wound plotting character subtleties or masterful acting it speaks to intangible nature of what differentiates wheat from chaff so to speak in network television sandra oh won best supporting actress series miniseries or television film at 63rd
