freddie robdal from 1960 his uncanny resemblance to rodney confirmed that he and not reg was rodney s biological father a lot of groundwork for this had been both laid and explored in episode frog s legacy 1987 christmas day hour long special in episode rodney goes to ask about his father to which albert diplomatically replies they re rumours rodney that s all rumours proposed prequel was to be titled once upon a time in peckham it would see young versions of del boycie denzil and trigger and sullivan said joanie will be a key character and during film will give birth to rodney however prequel was shelved and spin off green green grass was developed to follow secondary characters boycie marlene and their son tyler as they escape london mafia and attempt to live in shropshire countryside it was reported in january 2009 that prequel was being considered again following success of green green grass in april 2009 sullivan told mail on sunday that he had started writing

speaking to western mail he described it as essentially a love story between joan and freddie and he said that lyndhurst told me he thinks it s best thing he s ever done speaking about casting of lyndhurst he said he would make a marvellous villain which is something people will never have seen him do on tv before speaking about continuing story gwenlan said that production was run on idea it ll be turned into a series this one lays groundwork and john sullivan has enough for about two more series on 13 september 2010 while promoting third series of inbetweeners on bbc radio 5 live james buckley confirmed that rock chips would return for two more specials one for christmas 2010 and other for easter 2011 bbc orders two rock chips specials john sullivan died on 23 april 2011 five days before final episode was broadcast locations nags head pub used in pilot episode is a de furbished version of existing pelton arms pub in greenwich which maintains only fools and horses look style and feel prefabricated excalibur estate in catford was used as a location in opening episode john sullivan s comments sullivan said when production was announced that it would give us a bit of an insight into why del and rodney turned out way they did in a period before beatles and mary quant made london coolest place on planet when staple diet was rock salmon and chips and flicks offer only hint of glamour expanding further on basis for prequel he said most important person in flat in only fools and horses was never ever seen it was spirit of del s and rodney s beloved mother joan who had passed away 17 years before and throughout run of series del constantly referred to her and past events within trotter family but much of his historical information was at best contradictory and outright lies we were left with a situation where only person who really knew what had happened was an unreliable witness so i decided to return to those misty days of 1960 to meet all those characters we d only ever heard about nicholas lyndhurst s comments in an interview in press pack for production lyndhurst described freddie robdal as a villain charming but nasty and comparing him to rodney said that they re from two entirely different suitcases as far as i m concerned i didn t want to bring into it anything that i d already done with rodney and fortunately there wasn t any opportunity to do so they re like chalk and cheese speaking about 19 day filming schedule and not great budget he also told michael deacon of daily telegraph that i was very pleased it was made at all there were people who said i don t think we re going to do this and we had to wait months to get green light we thought well we haven t got budget we want we haven t got schedule we want so we re going to have to make it as brilliant as we can it was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget and it didn t get that episodes title directed by written by original airdate duration uk viewers million reception overnight figures estimated rock chips was seen by 7 4 million viewers with a 28 audience share winning slot against itv s wild at heart and dancing on ice results show it was second most watched programme of day behind first dancing on ice programme of evening final figures showed it was seen by 8 42 million viewers on bbc one and 279 000 on bbc hd sam wollaston for guardian said he was missing interplay between rodney and del boy from original and that only fun in drama was recognising nods working out who s who and how it all fits into place otherwise it s pretty lame daily mirror s jim shelley didn t find storyline interesting or convincing finding lyndhurst s performance as freddie laughable and saying it was bizarre that storyline virtually abandoned its main character young del boy and its best actor engaging james buckley from inbetweeners who played him in independent tom sutcliffe said that narrative s focus was blurred and pacing weirdly off quite a lot of time you were well ahead of drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you benji wilson from daily telegraph also wasn t impressed saying viewer would have been disappointed if they tuned in wanting to be entertained enthused or anything in between and that it was an ocean going stinker however scotsman s paul whitelaw said that despite a disjointed plot and it being overstretched at 90 minutes it was actually pretty good not great not perfect but a watchable production from which everyone emerged with their dignity intact he said that buckley delivered a charming performance in what was effectively a supporting role wisely choosing to suggest del s familiar mannerisms without opting for outright impersonation he carried off a difficult task with modest elan writing for stage harry venning found performances top notch and praised script as first class saying comic moments were of highest quality and beautifully crafted into narrative andrew billen from times described bright s portrayal of joan as winsome said lyndhurst produced a detailed performance and that rock chips was better than sequel that preceded it keith watson in metro also praised performances of buckley and bright saying they deserved a show all to themselves although he found period detail squeaky clean and unconvincing he closed his review by saying somehow it made me care about trotters in a way decades of only fools and horses never came close to home media pilot of rock chips was released on region 2 dvd on 5 april 2010 christmas special five gold rings was released on dvd on 28 march
