usually with a skirt was a recognized fashion discussed in magazines as severely masculine look doan 114 117 and passim women such as gluck troubridge and brooks used variations of masculine mode not to pass as men but as a signal a way of making their sexuality visible to others at time these paintings were made however it was a code that only a select few knew how to read langer 45 and elliott 74 to a mainstream audience women in these paintings probably just looked fashionable gluck an english artist whom brooks painted around 1923 was noted in contemporary press as much for her style of dress as for her art she pushed masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions which was not considered acceptable in 1920s articles about her presented her cross dressing as an artistic eccentricity or as a sign that she was ultra modern doan 117 119 brooks portrait shows gluck in a starched white shirt a silk tie and a long black belted coat that she designed and had

get close enough to look at her she s not passively inviting your approach she s deciding whether you re worth bothering with cotter 2000 literary portraits of brooks in 1925 brooks had solo exhibitions in paris london and new york there is no evidence to substantiate claim that brooks ceased painting after 1925 while in new york during 30s she produced portraits of carl van vechten in 1936 muriel draper in 1938 that we know of we know that she purchased paints in wwii when she and natalie were trapped in florence as researchers we know from photographs that there are lost works by brooks still to be rediscovered after that year she produced only four more paintings including portraits of carl van vechten in 1936 and muriel draper in 1938 chadwick 36 moreover brooks did complete

critics have mistakenly said brooks was influenced by aubrey beardsley s illustrations a claim brooks herself refutes in her 1968 audio interview imagery of 1930s drawings continues brooks s experiments in surreal that she began as a teenager in late 1880s her use of premeditated drawings as a route to subconscious has been compared to automatic drawings by surrealists of 1920s but brooks s work predates surrealists such as andre masson by decades macavoy called her first surrealist most widely observed influence on brooks s painting is that of james mcneill whistler whose subdued palette probably inspired her to adopt a monotone color scheme with accents of tinted pigments because through this technique she could suggest a classical restraint and create tensions that were modulated by shape texture and variations of shading throughout her canvases she may have been introduced to whistler s work by art collector charles lang freer whom she met on capri around 1899 and who bought one of her early works secrest 135 136 brooks said she wondered at magic subtlety of whistler s tones but thought his symphonies lacked corresponding subtlety of expression secrest 186 one 1920 portrait may take its composition from a painting by whistler while poses are almost identical brooks removes little girl and all details of whistler s domestic scene leaving only borgatti and her piano an image of an artist completely focused on her art chadwick 32 legacy and modern criticism brooks s realistic style may have led many art critics to dismiss her and by 1960s her work was largely forgotten secrest 311 312 revival of figurative painting since 1980s and new interest in exploration of gender and sexuality through art have led to a reassessment of her work she is now seen

photographs by transsexual artist loren cameron see melanie taylor s peter a young english girl visualizing transgender masculinities critics have described her portraits of 1920s as a sly celebration of gender bending as a kind of heroic act and as creating first visible sapphic stars in history of modernism brooks s portraits starting with her 1914 self portrait extending through cross of france have been interpreted as creating new images of strong women portraits of 1920s in particular cross dressed and otherwise portray their subjects as powerful self confident and fearless chadwick 27 32 one critic compared them to faces on mount rushmore o sullivan 2000 brooks seems to have seen her portraits in this light according to a memoir by natalie barney one woman complained upon seeing her portrait you haven t beautified me to which brooks replied i have ennobled you natalie barney aventures de l esprit quoted in jay 30 yet brooks did not always ennoble her subjects inherited wealth freed her from need to sell her paintings she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not and her wit when unleashed could be devastating a striking example is her 1914 15 portrait of elsie de
