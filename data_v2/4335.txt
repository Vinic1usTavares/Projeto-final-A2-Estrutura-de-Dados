david benioff and d b weiss some material in this episode is taken from jon xiii chapter in a dance with dragons some elements in episode are also based on sixth novel in a song of ice and fire series winds of winter which author george r r martin had hoped to have completed before sixth season began airing filming right thumb upright actress emilia clarke portrays daenerys targaryen in series book of stranger was directed by daniel sackheim he joined series as a director in sixth season he also directed previous episode oathbreaker in an interview sackheim commented on jon and sansa reunion stating sometimes as a director you re just looking at what s in front of you and not taking into account bigger picture and epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons and have never had scenes together and were both really looking forward to it reuniting only note i gave them during scene was hold yourself back as much as it s joyous to see each other you re equally as scared you don t know what to expect operative word was fear fear of unknown in a way it added to emotional resonance of scene for final scene with daenerys targaryen emerging from great fire of temple of dosh khaleen filming took place in two different locations with close ups of emilia clarke taking place on a closed set in belfast and large scale set shots taking place in spain in an interview clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served plot after episode aired clarke made a point to indicate that it was not a body double in final scene of episode stating i d like to remind people last time i took my clothes off was season 3 that was awhile ago it s now season 6 but this is all me all proud all strong i m just feeling genuinely happy i said yes that ain t no body double she continued taking off my clothes is not easiest thing but with magic of effects i don t have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it i m in control of it series co creator and executive producer weiss praised clarke s portrayal in scene saying emilia absolutely crushed it it s one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in spain half in belfast but largely due to her performance it works brilliantly sackheim director of episode noted in an interview with interior there was only one way for her to play it which is bemused she s keeper of secret she knows how to extricate herself from this i thought ease with which she delivered lines was necessary for audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy sequence outside was all about claiming throne or reclaiming throne sackheim also stated we wanted to clearly distinguish everything we ve seen from end of last season and beginning of this one reception
