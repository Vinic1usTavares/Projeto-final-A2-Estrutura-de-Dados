thumbnail first issue of ms magazine examined feminist economics in a piece by jane o reilly feminist economics is critical study of economics and economies with a focus on gender aware and inclusive economic inquiry and policy analysis feminist economic researchers include academics activists policy theorists and practitioners much feminist economic research focuses on topics that have been neglected in field such as care work intimate partner violence or on economic theories which could be improved through better incorporation of gendered effects and interactions such as between paid and unpaid sectors of economies other feminist scholars have engaged in new forms of data collection and measurement such as gender empowerment measure gem and more gender aware theories such as capabilities approach feminist economics is oriented towards goal of enhancing well being of children women and men in local national and transnational communities feminist economists call attention to social constructions of traditional economics questioning extent to which it is positive and objective and showing how its models and methods are biased by an exclusive attention to masculine associated topics and a one sided favoring of masculine associated assumptions and methods while economics traditionally focused on markets and masculine associated ideas of autonomy abstraction and logic feminist economists call for a fuller exploration of economic life including such culturally feminine topics such as family economics and examining importance of connections concreteness and emotion in explaining economic phenomena many scholars including ester boserup marianne ferber julie a nelson marilyn waring nancy folbre diane elson and ailsa mckay have contributed to feminist economics waring s 1988 book if women counted is often regarded as founding document of discipline by 1990s feminist economics had become sufficiently recognised as an established subfield within economics to generate book and article publication opportunities for its practitioners origins and history early on feminist ethicists economists political scientists and systems scientists argued that women s traditional work e g child raising caring for sick elders and occupations e g nursing teaching are systematically undervalued with respect to that of men for example jane jacobs thesis of guardian ethic and its contrast to trader ethic sought to explain undervaluing of guardianship activity including child protecting nurturing and healing tasks that were traditionally assigned to women written in 1969 and later published in houseworker s handbook betsy warrior s housework slavery or a labor of love and source of leisure time presents a cogent argument that production and reproduction of domestic labor performed by women constitutes foundation of all economic transactions and survival although and not included in gdp radical feminism a documentary reader by barbara a crow housework slavery or a labor of love p 530 nyu press 2000 according to warrior economics as it s presented today lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out very foundation of economic life that foundation is built on women s labor first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer and first commodity which is mother s milk and which sustains every new consumer laborer secondly women s labor entails environmentally necessary cleaning cooking to make raw materials consumable negotiating to maintain social stability and nurturing which prepares for market and maintains each laborer this constitutes women s continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in work force without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve http www org images bh modest herstory of warrior 8 2013 pdf warrior also notes that unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms drugs and human trafficking political graft religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men which further invalidates gdp figures houseworker s handbook slavery or a labor of love and source of leisure time 1972 even in underground economies where women predominate numerically like trafficking in humans prostitution and domestic servitude only a tiny fraction of pimp s revenue filters down to women and children he deploys usually amount spent on them is merely for maintenance of their lives and in case of those prostituted some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to pimp s clients for instance focusing on just us according to a government sponsored report by urban institute in 2014 a street prostitute in dallas may make as little as 5 per sex act but pimps can take in 33 000 a week in atlanta where sex business brings in an estimated 290 million per year warrior believes that only an inclusive facts based economic analysis will provide a reliable bases for future planning for environmental and reproductive population needs in 1970 ester boserup published woman s role in economic development and provided first systematic examination of gendered effects of agricultural transformation industrialization and other structural changes this evidence illuminated negative outcomes that these changes had for women this work among others laid basis for broad claim that women and men weather storm of macroeconomic shocks neoliberal policies and forces of globalization in different ways pdf version moreover measures such as employment equity were implemented in developed nations in 1970s to 1990s but these were not entirely successful in removing wage gaps even in nations with strong equity traditions thumb marilyn waring author of if women counted 1988 in 1988 marilyn waring published if women counted a new feminist economics a groundbreaking and systematic critique of system of national accounts international standard of measuring economic growth and ways in which women s unpaid work as well as value of nature have been excluded from what counts as productive in economy in foreword to 2014 anthology counting on marilyn waring julie a nelson wrote marilyn waring s work woke people up she showed exactly how unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems and damage this causes her book encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways both numerical and otherwise of valuing preserving and rewarding work of care that sustains our lives by pointing to a similar neglect of natural environment she also issued a wake up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time in recent decades field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more supported by formation of committee on status of women in economics profession in 1972 gender based critiques of traditional economics appeared in 1970s and 80s subsequent emergence of development alternatives with women for a new era dawn and 1992 founding of international association for feminist economics iaffe along with its journal feminist economics in 1994 encouraged rapid growth of feminist economics as in other disciplines initial emphasis of feminist economists was to critique established theory methodology and policy approaches critique began in microeconomics of household and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis broadened focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods feminist economics shares many of its perspectives with ecological economics and more applied field of green economy including focus on sustainability nature justice and care values critiques of traditional economics although there is no definitive list of principles of feminist economics feminist economists offer a variety of critiques of standard approaches in economics for example prominent feminist economist paula england provided one of earliest feminist critiques of traditional economics as she challenged claims that that interpersonal utility comparisons are impossible that tastes are exogenous and unchanging that actors are selfish and that household heads act altruistically this list is not exhaustive but does represent some of central feminist economic critiques of traditional economics out of wide variety of such viewpoints and critiques normativity many feminists call attention to value judgments in economic analysis this idea is contrary to typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners for example geoff schneider and jean shackelford suggest that issues that economists choose to study kinds of questions they ask and type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors some of them ideological in character similarly diana strassmann comments all economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming basis of definition in this way narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics therefore economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative regardless of how it is labeled feminist economists call attention to value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science free trade a central principle of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency many feminist economists question this claim diane elson caren grown and nilufer cagatay explore role that gender inequalities play in international trade and how such trade gender inequality itself they and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve for example they may highlight that in africa specialization in cultivation of a single cash crop for export in many countries made those countries extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations weather patterns and pests feminist economists may also consider specific gendered effects of trade decisions for instance in countries such as kenya men generally controlled earnings from cash crops while women were still expected to provide food and clothing for household their traditional role in african family along with labor to produce cash crops thus women suffered significantly from transition away from subsistence food production towards specialization and trade similarly since women often lack economic power as business owners they are more likely to be hired as cheap labor often involving them in exploitative situations exclusion of non market activity feminist economics call attention to importance of non market activities such as childcare and domestic work to economic development this stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as non economic phenomena including such labor in economic accounts removes substantial gender bias because women disproportionately perform those tasks when that labor is unaccounted for in economic models much work done by women is ignored literally devaluing their effort thumb a colombian domestic worker neighborhood friends and family sharing household and childcare responsibilities is an example of non market activity performed outside of traditional labor market more specifically for example nancy folbre examines role of children as public goods and how non market labor of parents contributes to development of human capital as a public service in this sense children are positive which is under invested according to traditional analysis folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non market activities marilyn waring described how exclusion of non market activities in national accounting systems relied on deliberate choice and design of international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non market activities in some countries such as norway which had included unpaid household work in gdp in first half of 20th century it was left out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with new international standard ailsa mckay argues for a basic income as a tool for promoting gender neutral social citizenship rights partially to address these concerns omission of power relations feminist economics often assert that power relations exist within economy and therefore must be assessed in economic models in ways that they previously have been overlooked for example in neoclassical texts sale of labor is viewed as a mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties no mention is made of power inequities in exchange which tend to give employer power over employee these power relations often favor men and there is never any mention made of particular difficulties that confront women in workplace consequently understanding power and patriarchy helps us to analyze how male dominated economic institutions actually function and why women are often at a disadvantage in workplace feminist economists often extend these criticisms to many aspects of social world arguing that power relations are an endemic and important feature of society omission of gender and race feminist economics argue that gender and race must be considered in economic analysis amartya sen argues that systematically inferior position of women inside and outside household in many societies points to necessity of treating gender as a force of its own in development analysis he goes on to say that experiences of men and women even within same household are often so different that examining economics without gender can be misleading economic models can often be improved by explicitly considering gender race class and caste julie describes their importance not only did gender and racial ethnic differences and inequality precede capitalism they have been built into it in key ways in other words every aspect of our capitalist economy is gendered and racialized a theory and practice that ignores this is inherently flawed feminist economist zein says racial and gender differences should be examined since both have traditionally been ignored and thus are equally described as feminist difference july 2002 issue of feminist economics journal was dedicated to issues of gender color caste and class exaggeration of gender differences in other cases gender differences have been exaggerated potentially encouraging unjustified stereotyping in recent a nelson 2015 are women really more risk averse than men a re analysis of literature using expanded methods journal of economic surveys 29 3 566 585 doi 10 1111 joes 2014 power of stereotyping and confirmation bias to overwhelm accurate assessment case of economics gender and risk aversion journal of economic methodology 21 3 211 231 doi 10 1080 2014 and 2015 not so strong evidence for gender differences in risk taking feminist economics doi oi 10 1080 13545701 2015 julie a nelson has shown how idea that women are more risk averse than men a now popular assertion from behavioral economics actually rests on extremely thin empirical evidence conducting meta analyses of recent studies she demonstrates that while statistically significant differences in measures of mean risk aversion are sometimes found substantive size of these group level differences tend to be small on order of a fraction of a standard deviation and many other studies fail to find a statistically significant difference at all yet studies that fail to find difference are less likely to be published or highlighted in addition claims that men and women have different preferences such as for risk competition or altruism often tend to be misinterpreted as categorical that is as applying to all women and all men as individuals in fact small differences in average behavior such as are found in some studies are generally accompanied by large overlaps in men s and women s distributions that is both men and women can generally be found in most risk averse or competitive or altruistic groups as well as in least homo economicus neoclassical economic model of a person is called homo economicus describing a person who interacts in society without being influenced by society because his mode of interaction is through an ideal market in which prices are only necessary considerations in this view people are considered rational actors who engage in marginal analysis to make many or all of their decisions feminist economists argue that people are more complex than such models and call for a more holistic vision of an economic actor which includes group interactions and actions motivated by factors other than greed feminist economics holds that such a reformation provides a better description of actual experiences of both men and women in market arguing that mainstream economics role of individualism competition and selfishness of all actors instead feminist economists like nancy folbre show that cooperation also plays a role in economy feminist economists also point out that agency is not available to everyone such as children sick and frail elderly responsibilities for their care can compromise agency of caregivers as well this is a critical departure from homo economicus model moreover feminist economists critique focus of neoclassical economics on monetary rewards nancy folbre notes legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women this includes occupational segregation resulting in unequal pay for women feminist research in these areas contradicts neoclassical description of labor markets in which occupations are chosen freely by individuals acting alone and out of their own free will feminist economics also includes study of norms relevant to economics challenging traditional view that material incentives will reliably provide goods we want and need consumer sovereignty which does not hold true for many people institutional economics is one means by which feminist economists improve upon homo economicus model this theory examines role of institutions and evolutionary social processes in shaping economic behavior emphasizing complexity of human motives and importance of culture and relations of power this provides a more holistic view of economic actor than homo economicus work of george akerlof and janet yellen on efficiency wages based on notions of fairness provides an example of a feminist model of economic actors in their work agents are not or isolated but instead act in concert and with fairness are capable of experiencing jealousy and are interested in personal relationships this work is based on empirical sociology and psychology and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces limited methodology economics is often thought of as study of how society manages its scarce resources and as such is limited to mathematical inquiry traditional economists often say such an approach assures objectivity and separates economics from softer fields such as sociology and political science feminist economists argue on contrary that a mathematical conception of economics limited to scarce resources is a holdover from early years of science and cartesian philosophy and limits economic analysis so feminist economists often call for more diverse data collection and broader economic models economic pedagogy feminist economists suggest that both content and teaching style of economics courses would benefit from certain changes some recommend including experimental learning laboratory sessions individual research and more chances to do economics some want more dialogue between instructors and students many feminist economists are urgently interested in how course content influences demographic composition of future economists suggesting that classroom climate affects some students perceptions of their own ability 2000s financial crisis and ailsa mckay argue that financial crisis of 2007 08 and response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within economics profession and call for a reshaping of both economy economic theory and economics profession they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point socially responsible sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as planet major areas of inquiry economic epistemology feminist critiques of economics include that economics like any science is socially constructed feminist economists show that social constructs act to privilege male identified western and heterosexual interpretations of economics they generally incorporate feminist theory and frameworks to show how traditional economics communities signal expectations regarding appropriate participants to exclusion of outsiders such criticisms extend to theories methodologies and research areas of economics in order to show that accounts of economic life are deeply influenced by biased histories social structures norms cultural practices interpersonal interactions and politics feminist economists often make a critical distinction that masculine bias in economics is primarily a result of gender not sex in other words when feminist economists highlight biases of mainstream economics they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity separation logical consistency individual accomplishment mathematics abstraction and lack of emotion but not on gender of authorities and subjects however over representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern economic history thumb right women s weekly earnings as a percentage of men s in u s by age 1979 2005 feminist economists say that mainstream economics has been disproportionately developed by european descended heterosexual middle and upper middle class men and that this has led to suppression of life experiences of full diversity of world s people especially women children and those in non traditional families additionally feminist economists claim that historical bases of economics are inherently exclusionary to women michele pujol points to five specific historical assumptions about woman that arose became embedded in formulation of economics and continue to be used to maintain that women are different from masculinized norms and exclude them these include ideas that all women are married or if not yet they will be and all women will have children all women are economically dependent on a male relative all women are and should be housewives due to their reproductive capacities women are unproductive in industrial workforce women are irrational unfit economic agents and cannot be trusted to make right economic decisions feminist economists also examine early economic thinkers interaction or lack of interaction with gender and women s issues showing examples of women s historical engagement with economic thought for example edith kuiper discusses adam smith s engagement with feminist discourse on role of women in eighteenth century france and england she finds that through his writings smith typically supported status quo on women s issues and lost sight of division of labor in family and contribution of women s economic work in response she points to mary collier s works such as woman s labour 1739 to help understand smith s contemporaneous experiences of women and fill in such gaps engendering macroeconomic theories thumb percentage gap between median men s and women s wages for full time workers by oecd country 2006 in u k most significant factors associated with remaining gender pay gap are part time work education size of firm a person is employed in and occupational segregation women are under represented in managerial and high paying professional occupations central to feminist economics is an effort to alter theoretical modeling of economy to reduce gender bias and inequity feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows fiscal austerity deregulation and privatization monetary policy international trade and more in general these modifications take three main forms gender disaggregation addition of gender based macroeconomic variables and creation of a two sector system gender disaggregation this method of economic analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how men and women differ in their consumption investment or saving behavior gender disaggregation strategies justify separation of macroeconomic variables by gender korkut and nilufer cagatay show how feminization of labor stimulates investment while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings this model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate in labor force more instead of devoting their time to housework gendered macroeconomic variables thumb u s women s weekly earnings employment and percentage of men s earnings by industry 2009 this approach demonstrates effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models bernard walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that population and labor are determined that fails to account for fact that inputs are produced through caring labor which is disproportionately performed by women stephen et al use a neoclassical growth model to show that women s education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity more robust than that of men s education in both of these cases economists highlight and address gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models outcomes two sector system two sector system approach models economy as two separate systems one involving standard macroeconomic variables while other includes gender specific variables william darity developed a two sector approach for low income farm based economies darity shows that subsistence farming depended on labor of women while production of income depended on labor of both men and women in cash crop activities this model shows that when men control production and income they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash crop production causing increases in cash crops come at expense of subsistence production well being many feminist economists argue economics should be focused less on mechanisms like income or theories such as utilitarianism and more on well being a multidimensional concept including income health education empowerment and social status they argue that economic success can not be measured only by goods or gross domestic product but must also be measured by human well being aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well being because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered leading feminist economists to study health longevity access to property education and related factors bina agarwal and pradeep panda illustrate that a woman s property status such as owning a house or land directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence while employment makes little difference they argue that such immovable property increases women s self esteem economic security and strengthens their fall back positions enhancing their options and bargaining clout they show that property ownership is an important contributor to women s economic well being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence in order to measure well being more generally amartya sen sakiko fukuda parr and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to gross domestic product such as human development index other models of interest to feminist economists include labor theory of value which was most thoroughly developed in das capital by karl marx that model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living this refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives human capabilities approach feminist economists amartya sen and martha nussbaum created human capabilities approach as an alternative way to assess economic success rooted in ideas of welfare economics and focused on individual s potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value unlike traditional economic measures of success focused on gdp utility income assets or other monetary measures capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do this approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes and draws attention to cultural social and material dynamics of well being martha nussbaum expanded on model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life health bodily integrity thought and more in recent years capabilities approach has influenced creation of new models including un s human development index hdi household bargaining central to feminist economics is a different approach to family and household in classical economics those units are typically described as amicable and homogeneous gary becker and new home economists introduced study of family to traditional economics which usually assumes family is a single altruistic unit among which money is distributed equally others have concluded that an optimal distribution of commodities and provisions takes place within family as a result of which they view families in same manner as individuals these models according to feminist economists endorsed traditional expectations about sexes and applied individualistic rational choice models to explain home behavior feminist economists modify these assumptions to account for exploitative sexual and gender relations single parent families same sex relationships familial relations with children and consequences of reproduction specifically feminist economists move beyond unitary household models and game theory to show diversity of household experiences for example bina agarwal and others have critiqued mainstream model and helped provide a better understanding of intra household bargaining power agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families amartya sen shows how social norms that devalue women s unpaid work in household often disadvantage women in intra household bargaining these feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks care economy feminist economists join un and others in acknowledging care work as a kind of work which includes all tasks involving caregiving as central to economic development and human well being feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work they argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores value of household unpaid work feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work so measures of economic success should include unpaid work they have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work sabine o hara argues that care is basis for all economic activity and market economies concluding that everything needs care not only people but animals and things she highlights sustaining nature of care services offered outwith formal economy eisler claims we need economic system that gives visibility to most essential human work that is caring for people and caring for nature measuring gdp only includes productive work and leaves out live sustaining activities of three sectors household economy natural economy and volunteer community economy in those sectors most of care work is done by changing existing economic indicators in a way that they would measure also contribution of mentioned three sectors we can get accurate reflection of reality she names proposed indicators social wealth indicators according to her those indicators will show enormous return on investment roi in caring for people and nature psychological studies have shown when people feel good and they feel good when they feel cared for they are more productive and more creative example case study in general positive feelings flourish quality of human capital rises most nations not only fail to support care work that is still predominantly done by women but we live in world with gendered system of values everything that is associated with women or femininity is devalued or even marginalised we need to leave behind gender double standard that caring only then we can shift from domination to partnership and create a new economic model that eisler proposes in her book real wealth of nations creating a caring economics contributions of people and of nature present real wealth of society and our economic policies and practices must support caring for both she claims feminist economists have also highlighted power and inequality issues within families and households for example randy shows that responsibility for care work influences time poverty experienced by single mothers in united states similarly sarah gammage examines effects of unpaid care work performed by women in guatemala work of equality studies department at university college dublin such as that of sara has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households while much care work is performed in home it may also be done for pay as such feminist economics examine its implications including increasing involvement of women in paid care work potential for exploitation and effects on lives of care workers systemic study of ways women s work is measured or not measured at all have been undertaken by marilyn waring see if women counted and others in 1980s and 1990s these studies began to justify different means of determining value some of which influenced theory of social capital and individual capital that emerged in late 1990s and along with ecological economics influenced modern human development theory see also entry on gender and social capital unpaid work unpaid work can include domestic work care work subsistence work unpaid market labor and voluntary work there is no clear consensus on definition of these categories but broadly speaking these kinds of work can be seen as contributing to reproduction of society domestic work is maintenance of home and is usually universally recognizable e g doing laundry care work is looking after a relative or friend who needs support because of age physical or learning disability or illness including mental illness this also includes raising children care work also involves close personal or emotional interaction also included in this category is self care in which leisure time and activities are included subsistence work is work done in order to meet basic needs such as collecting water but does not have market values assigned to it although some of these efforts are categorized as productive activities according to latest revision of international system of national accounts sna they are poorly measured by most surveys unpaid market work is direct contributions of unpaid family members to market work that officially belongs to another member of household voluntary work is usually work done for non household members but in return for little to no remuneration system of national accounts each country measures its economic output according to system of national accounts sna sponsored mainly by united nations un but implemented mainly by other organizations such as european commission international monetary fund imf organisation for economic co operation and development oecd and world bank sna recognizes that unpaid work is an area of interest but unpaid household services are excluded from its production boundary feminist economists have criticized sna for this exclusion because by leaving out unpaid work basic and necessary labor is ignored even accounting measures intended to recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring unpaid work two such examples are gender related development index gdi and gender empowerment measure gem neither of which include much unpaid work so feminist economics calls for a more comprehensive index which includes participation in unpaid work in more recent years there has been increasing attention to this issue such as recognition of unpaid work within sna reports and a commitment by un to measurement and valuation of unpaid work emphasizing care work done by women this goal was restated at 1995 un fourth world conference on women in beijing measurement of unpaid work method most widely used to measure unpaid work is gathering information on time use which has been implemented by at least 20 developing countries and more are underway as of 2006 time use measurement involves collecting data on how much time men and women spend on a daily weekly or monthly basis on certain activities that fall under categories of unpaid work techniques to gather this data include surveys in depth interviews diaries and participant observation proponents of time use diaries believe that this method generate s more detailed information and tend s to capture greater variation than predetermined questions however others argue that participant observation where researcher spends lengthy periods of time in households helping out and observing labor process generates more accurate information because researcher can ascertain whether or not those studied are accurately reporting what activities they perform accuracy first problem of measuring unpaid work is issue of collecting accurate information this is always a concern in research studies but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work time use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities because demands of subsistence production in those countries are great and may not take into account multitasking for example a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in same location so child is in her care while she is performing other work usually such indirect care should be included as it is in many time use studies but it is not always and as a result some studies may undervalue amount of certain types of unpaid work participant observation has been criticized for being so time consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households and thus limited in amount of information it can be used to gather all data gathering involves difficulties with potential inaccuracy of research subjects reports for instance when people doing domestic labor have no reason to pay close attention to amount of time tasks take they may often underestimate time spent in familiar activities measuring time can also be problematic because slowest and most inefficient workers appear to carry greatest workload time use in assessing childcare is criticized as easily ing gender differences in workload men and women may both put in same amount of time being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown many men are more likely to babysit their children while doing something for themselves such as watching tv men s standards of care may be limited to ensuring children are not hurt dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until mother returns a paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in studies it is usually those women with heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies in general measurement of time causes some of most demanding aspects of unpaid work to be unexplored and premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women s unpaid work goes unchallenged surveys have also been criticized for lacking depth and complexity as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances comparability a second problem is difficulty of comparisons across cultures comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature in depth surveys may be only way to get necessary information desired but they make it difficult to perform cross cultural comparisons lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work existing vocabularies do not easily convey new appreciations people still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres working mothers are usually assumed to be in paid labor force despite feminist assertions that every mother is a working mother there are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles housewife home manager homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment complexity a third problem is complexity of domestic labor and issues of separating unpaid work categories time use studies now take multitasking issues into account separating primary and secondary activities however not all studies do this and even those that do may not take into account fact that frequently several tasks are done simultaneously that tasks overlap and that boundaries between work and relationships are often unclear how does a woman determine her primary activity when she is preparing dinner while putting laundry away making coffee for her spouse having coffee and chatting with him and attending to children some activities may not even be considered work such as playing with a child this has been categorized as developmental care work and so may not be included in a study s responses as mentioned above child supervision indirect care work may not be construed as an activity at all which suggests that activity based surveys should be supplemented by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities as otherwise such activities can be in past time use studies tended to measure only primary activities and respondents doing two or more things at once were asked to indicate which was more important this has been changing in more recent years valuation of time feminist economists point out three main ways of determining value of unpaid work opportunity cost method replacement cost method and input output cost method opportunity cost method uses wage a person would earn in market to see how much value their labor time has this method extrapolates from opportunity cost idea in mainstream economics second method of valuation uses replacement costs in simple terms this is done by measuring amount of money a third party would make for doing same work if it was part of market in other words value of a person cleaning house in an hour is same as hourly wage for a maid within this method there are two approaches first is a generalist replacement cost method which examines if it would be possible for example to take wage of a general domestic worker who could perform a variety of tasks including childcare second approach is specialist replacement cost method which aims to distinguish between different household tasks and choose replacements accordingly third method is input output cost method this looks at both costs of inputs and includes any value added by household for instance value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking what it could cost to purchase a similar meal output in market then subtracting cost of capital goods utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal this remainder represents value of other factors of production primarily labor these types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for inputs in dinner example ingredients and production of meal and compares those with market equivalents difficulty establishing monetary levels one criticism of time valuation concerns choice of monetary levels how should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced another issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products some feminist economists take issue with using market system to determine values for a variety of reasons it may lead to conclusion that market provides perfect substitutes for non market work wage produced in market for services may not accurately reflect actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production and wages used in valuation methods come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities and so will not accurately value unpaid work a related argument is that market accepts existing sex gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic with this basic assumption underlying their calculations valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women s subordination criticisms of opportunity cost criticisms are leveled against each method of valuation opportunity cost method depends on lost earnings of worker so that a toilet cleaned by a lawyer has much greater value than one cleaned by a janitor which means that value varies too drastically there are also issues with uniformity of this method not just across multiple individuals but also for a single person it may not be uniform across entire day or across days of week there is also issue of whether any enjoyment of activity should be deducted from opportunity cost estimate difficulties with replacement cost replacement cost method also has its critics what types of jobs should be used as substitutes for example should childcare activities be calculated using wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists this relates to problem of depressed wages in female dominated industries and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to undervaluing of unpaid work some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable for example value of time that a college educated parent spends reading aloud to a child should be ascertained by asking how much it would cost to hire a college educated worker to do same not by an average housekeeper s wage difficulties with input output methods critiques against input output methods include difficulty of identifying and measuring household outputs and issues of variation of households and these effects findings and economic effects of unpaid work in 2011 a wide ranging study was conducted to determine amount of unpaid household work engaged in by residents of different countries this study incorporating results of time use surveys from 26 oecd countries found that in each country average hours spent per day on unpaid household work was between about 2 to 4 hours per day as domestic work is widely seen as women s work majority of it is performed by women even for women who also participate in labor force one study found that when adding time spent on unpaid household work to time spent engaging in paid work married mothers accumulate 84 hours of work per week compared to 79 hours per week for unmarried mothers and 72 hours per week for all fathers whether married or not efforts to calculate true economic value of unpaid work which is not included in measures such as gross domestic product have shown that this value is enormous in united states it has been estimated to be between 20 50 meaning that true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year for other countries percentage of gdp may be even higher such as united kingdom where is may be as high as 70 because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society formal economy research into causes and consequences of occupational segregation gender pay gap and glass ceiling have been a significant part of feminist economics while conventional neoclassical economic theories of 1960s and 1970s explained these as result of free choices made by women and men who simply had different abilities or preferences feminist economists pointed out important roles played by stereotyping sexism patriarchal beliefs and institutions sexual harassment and discrimination e g see also male female income disparity in united states rationales for and effects of anti discrimination laws adopted in many industrial countries beginning in 1970s has also been studied bergmann barbara in defense of affirmative action new york basic books 1996 women moved in large numbers into previous male bastions especially professions like medicine and law during last decades of 20th century gender pay gap remains and is shrinking more slowly feminist economists such as marilyn power ellen and deborah m have examined gender pay gap and found that wage setting procedures are not primarily driven by market forces but instead by power of actors cultural understandings of value of work and what constitutes a proper living and social gender norms consequently they assert that economic models must take these typically exogenous variables into account while overt employment discrimination by sex remains a concern of feminist economists in recent years more attention has been paid to discrimination against caregivers those women and some men who give hands on care to children or sick or elderly friends or relatives because many business and government policies were designed to accommodate ideal worker that is traditional male worker who had no such responsibilities rather than caregiver workers inefficient and inequitable treatment has resulted globalization feminist economists work on globalization is diverse and multifaceted but much of it is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies of ways in which globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes often country case studies are used for these data some feminist economists focus on policies involving development of globalization for example lourdes beneria argues that economic development in global south depends in large part on improved reproductive rights gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance and policies that are sensitive to proportion of women in informal economy book review additionally discusses impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements drawing on fieldwork from bangladesh she argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in informal economy alternatively suzanne bergeron for example raises examples of studies that illustrate multifaceted effects of globalization on women including rosa s study of sri lankan malaysian and philippine workers in free trade zones as an example of local resistance to globalization women there use their wages to create women s centers aimed at providing legal and medical services libraries and cooperative housing to local community members such efforts bergeron highlights allow women chance to take control of economic conditions increase their sense of individualism and alter pace and direction of globalization itself in other cases feminist economists work on removing gender biases from theoretical bases of globalization itself suzanne bergeron for example focuses on typical theories of globalization as rapid integration of world into one economic space through flow of goods capital and money in order to show how they exclude some women and disadvantaged she argues that traditional understandings of globalization over emphasize power of global capital flows uniformity of globalization experiences across all populations and technical and abstract economic processes and therefore depict political economy of globalization inappropriately she highlights alternative views of globalization created by feminists first she describes how feminists may de emphasize idea of market as a natural and unstoppable force instead depicting process of globalization as and movable by individual economic actors including women she also explains that concept of globalization itself is gender biased because its depiction as dominant unified and intentional is inherently masculinized and misleading she suggests that feminists critique such narratives by showing how a global economy is highly complex de centered and unclear degrowth and ecological economics feminist and ecological economics so far have not engaged with one another much

growth paradigm perpetuates existing gender and environmental injustices and seek to mitigate it with a degrowth work sharing proposal scholars in paradigm of degrowth point out that contemporary economic imaginary considers time as a scarce resource to be allocated efficiently while in domestic and care sector time use depends on rhythm of life d alisa et al 2014 degrowth a vocabulary for a new era new york ny routledge joan tronto 1993 moral boundaries a political argument for an ethic of care new york ny routledge divides care process in four phases caring about taking care of care giving and care receiving these acquire different meanings when used describing actions of males and females degrowth proposes to put care at center of society thus calling for a radical rethinking of human relations it should be pointed out that degrowth is a concept that originated in global north and is mainly directed towards a reduction of economic and therefore material throughput of affluent societies environmental injustices linked to gender injustices are embedded in green growth due to its inability to dematerialize production processes and these injustices are perpetuated through green growth narrative and through its consequences ecological processes as well as caring activities are similarly systematically devalued by dominating industrial and economic paradigms this can be explained by arbitrary boundary between monetized and maintaining that remains largely unchallenged degrowth presents itself as an alternative to this dualistic view if designed in a gender sensitive way that society around care could have potential to alleviate environmental injustices while promoting greater gender equality methodology interdisciplinary data collection many feminist economists challenge perception that only objective often presumed to be quantitative data are valid instead they say economists should enrich their analysis by using data sets generated from other disciplines or through increased use of qualitative methods additionally many feminist economists propose utilizing non traditional data collection strategies such as utilizing growth accounting frameworks conducting empirical tests of economic theories developing country case studies and pursuing research at conceptual and empirical levels interdisciplinary data collection looks at systems from a specific moral position and viewpoint instead of attempting perspective of a neutral observer intention is not to create a more subjective methodology but to counter biases in existing methodologies by recognizing that all explanations for world phenomena arise from socially influenced viewpoints feminist economists say too many theories claim to present universal principles but actually present a masculine viewpoint in guise of a view from nowhere so more varied sources of data collection are needed to mediate those issues ethical judgment feminist economists depart from traditional economics in that they say ethical judgments are a valid inescapable and in fact desirable part of economic analysis for example lourdes beneria argues that judgments about policies leading to greater well being should be central to economic analysis similarly says better understanding of care work would allow us to shift our priorities from making money or making stuff to making livable lives and enriching networks of care and relationship which should be central to economics country case studies often feminist economists use country level or smaller case studies focused on developing and often understudied countries or populations for example michael and leslie c gray examine how gendered social norms are central to understanding agricultural activities in burkina faso cristina carrasco and arantxa rodriquez examine care economy in spain to suggest that women s entrance into labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities such studies show importance of local social norms government policies and cultural situations feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor to be included in economics alternative measures of success feminist economists call for a shift in how economic success is measured these changes include an increased focus on a policy s ability to bring society toward social justice and improve people s lives through specific goals including distributive fairness equity universal provisioning of needs elimination of poverty freedom from discrimination and protection of human capabilities human development index hdi 400px thumb right world map by of human development index in 2011 feminist economists often support use of human development index as a composite statistic in order to assess countries by their overall level of human development as opposed to other measures hdi takes into account a broad array of measures beyond monetary considerations including life expectancy literacy education and standards of living for all countries worldwide gender related development index gdi gender related development index gdi was introduced in 1995 in human development report written by united nations development program in order to add a gender sensitive dimension to human development index gdi takes into account not only average or general level of well being and wealth within a given country but also how this wealth and well being is distributed between different groups within society especially between genders available from with full text ipswich ma accessed september 26 2011 however feminist economists do not universally agree on use of gdi and some offer improvements to it social institutions and gender index sigi social institutions and gender index sigi is a recently developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions societal practices and legal norms and how these factors largely frame gender norms within a society by combining these sources of inequality sigi is able to penalize high levels of inequality in each of applicable dimensions allowing for only partial compensation by gaps between remaining dimensions and highly inequitable one through its analysis of institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries sigi has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women even when other factors such as religion and region of world are controlled for sigi rankings largely mirror those of hdi with countries such as portugal and argentina leading pack while countries like afghanistan and sudan are significantly behind organizations feminist economics continues to become more widely recognized and reputed as evidenced by numerous organizations dedicated to it or widely influenced by its principles international association for feminist economics formed in 1992 international association for feminist economics iaffe is independent of american economic association aea and seeks to challenge masculine biases in neoclassical economics while majority of members are economists it is open not only to female and male economists but to academics from other fields as well as activists who are not academics and currently has over 600 members in 64 countries although its founding members were mostly based in us a majority of iaffe s current members are based outside of us in 1997 iaffe gained non governmental organization status in united nations feminist economics journal feminist economics edited by diana strassmann of rice university and of university of utah is a peer reviewed

as an explicit goal of their political measures seeking greater economic and general gender equality feminist economics is also often linked with welfare economics or labour economics since it emphasizes child welfare and value of labour in itself as opposed to traditional focus exclusively on production for a marketplace graduate programs a small but growing number of graduate programs
