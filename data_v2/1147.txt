protagonist wields four different styles of weapons throughout game sword spear axe and bazooka almost all swords axes and spears have four versions repeated use of them can increase their skill levels to a maximum of three unlocking a new charged attack with each level range and power of each type of weapon increases more it is used for instance spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across screen while swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around boy s vicinity most swords axes and spears can cut through vegetation while some weapons are required to break rocks

of money certain goods such as rice spices and tapestries can be bought using local currency but others must be exchanged for other goods most vendors only specialize in one type of good and some rare items require an extensive amount of trading to obtain alchemy a unique element of secret of evermore is its magic system to cast magic boy must be given an formula by one of many non playable characters called alchemists some alchemists make their home in out of way areas and will dispense rare formulas if player manages to seek them out unlike some role playing games there are no magic points needed to cast spells alchemy formulas require pairs of ingredients to be used some are available throughout game and others are only native to certain environments in primitive realms ingredients appear such as wax limestone clay and ash in advanced realms however ingredients become more complex for example ethanol and dry ice a secondary function of dog is to sniff out ingredients by putting his nose to ground and smelling for items player can command dog to search ground at any time including in huts and cities if all goes well dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on map where player can uncover unseen ingredients with repeated use alchemy formulas will increase in level enhancing their curative offensive or support effectiveness although there are dozens of formulas available to be found within game only nine can be equipped at a time to overcome this there are several alchemists scattered throughout game who offer to manage boy s current alchemy list

development of secret of evermore began at squaresoft redmond washington office of japanese parent company square concept of a boy traveling with his dog through a world based on cheesy b movies was dictated from overseas square soft began work on detailed storyline this led to popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly american for a mainstream console rpg game s associate producer and writer george sinfield decided they would be familiar to american players game s working title was vex and producer alan weiss s original concept had a group of magic users who could tell dream stories and transport listeners into experience virtually during a storytelling session vex is trapped and starts to corrupt dreams game was to have player find vex and defeat him sinfield asked for its name to be changed studio had a naming competition which resulted in secret of evermore composer jeremy soule claims to have been team member who submitted name evermore many elements of secret of evermore were copied from secret of mana because they had proven to be effective size of game was an early issue it was decided that it would be single player to preserve memory it was originally planned to be only 12 megabits however game doubled to 24 megabits near end of development daniel designed various pieces of concept art using computer software including sgi indy ii and alias workstations game s artwork and design were mapped out by three animators four background artists and a 3d rendering artist it was put together using company s sage square s amazing graphical editor program led by programmer brian fehdrau rather than having to hand off their work to programmers artists and designers were able to test their ideas directly using sage program using another company program sigil square interpreted game intelligence language secret of evermore final product was produced one of worlds that was cut was called where everything is all flowers and sweet stuff excessively so it was pink and purple there is a persistent misconception that game is or was released in lieu of a follow up to secret of mana other square titles such as final fantasy vi and chrono trigger were being localized simultaneously with production of secret of evermore fehdrau explained in an interview that secret of evermore was not created in place of trials of mana and that team that developed secret of evermore was assembled from newly hired staff and would otherwise never have been assembled several of team members later joined humongous entertainment which spawned entertainment while rest of team spread to other seattle area game studios like electronic arts boss game studios microsoft game studios and gas powered games among others secret of evermore was released on october 1 1995 in north america in 1996 it was translated into german french and spanish for non english speaking market in some pal territories including australia and new zealand some pal versions were packaged in a large box and included a strategy guide music jeremy soule composed and produced score for secret of evermore his first video game project in high school soule was a big fan of video games but he felt most of their scores lacked drama and intensity after completing high school soule created an experimental demo showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like soule was hired by square soft after they had reviewed demo to score secret of evermore soule describes it as a mix of ambient sounds and low key music soundtrack was released on a cd containing 29 tracks first eight of which are arranged versions of original sound disc was published by square and was only available initially to those who pre ordered secret of evermore reception secret of evermore received positive reviews from most media outlets they praised its graphics scary larry of gamepro however found spell animations weak compared to those of other square games and said bosses are large but strangely unimpressive a highlight for some critics was gameplay particularly unique alchemy system and aspects also found in secret of mana such as ring menu however others found mechanics needlessly hard to get used to nintendo power praised game for its graphics sound play control story and variety but criticized it for its awkward battle system and simple a i although quality of musical compositions and sound effects were praised scary larry complained of player character s dog barking constantly super play and gamepro both felt game was not up to standards of other square games victor lucas of electric playground praised game saying that while it did not reach heights of chrono trigger or final fantasy vi it was still a highly enjoyable experience mega fun argued it was on par with those games with graphics that were nearly as good others argued that secret of evermore was a decent first attempt by american team game players anticipated another game from same development team and a critic for next generation said that while game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes as a debut title for a new team of designers it points to a rosy future video games praised squaresoft usa s very first title noting that while menu and control schemes were taken from previous square games its mood story and setting were enough to set it apart from earlier titles in a retrospective review allgame editor scott alan marriott described game as a good solid rpg but those expecting memorable characters or a dramatic involving story will most likely be disappointed three reviewers from gamefan praised game two were skeptical that an american made role playing game could match square s internally produced titles such as final fantasy but they were impressed with game one reviewer however noted that he missed japanese style art found in other square games and although art in secret of evermore was good it was aimed at an american audience
