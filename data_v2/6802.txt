strasbourg was second and final member of of fast battleships built for french navy in 1930s she and her sister ship were designed to defeat german of heavy cruisers that had been laid down beginning in late 1920s and as such were equipped with a battery of eight guns to counter six guns of deutschlands strasbourg was laid down in november 1934 was launched in december 1936 and was commissioned in september 1938 as international situation in europe was steadily deteriorating due to nazi germany s increasingly aggressive behavior strasbourg was assigned to atlantic fleet upon entering service her only significant peacetime activities consisted of visits to portugal in may 1939 and a tour of great britain in may and june that year she spent next two months training with other units of fleet and in september france and britain declared war on germany over its invasion of poland starting world war ii two dunkerque class ships formed core of force de raid raiding force tasked with protecting allied merchant shipping in central atlantic unit was quickly divided into two groups with strasbourg and other units being detached as force x based in dakar with an increasingly belligerent italy threatening to enter war in april 1940 force x was recalled to mediterranean to act as a deterrent though defeat of french forces in battle of france rendered situation moot armistice specified that strasbourg and rest of french fleet would be demilitarized and she and several other battleships were stationed in mers el kebir at time mistakenly under impression that germans sought to seize ships british force h was sent to either force ships to continue fighting or to destroy them when french refused ultimatum british opened fire but strasbourg evaded british and escaped to toulon there she served as flagship of newly established forces de haute mer until germans attempted to seize fleet during case anton leading to its destruction in scuttling of french fleet in toulon in november 1942 wreck was later seized by italians who raised strasbourg and then started dismantling ship and was later taken by germans vessel was later bombed and sunk a second time by american bombers in august 1944 and was ultimately sold for scrap in 1955 development thumb left line drawing of dunkerque class french navy s design staff spent decade following 1922 washington naval treaty attempting to produce a satisfactory design which would allow several ships to be built within 70 000 ton limit allowed by treaty initially french sought a reply to italian s of 1925 but all proposals were rejected a 17 500 ton cruiser which could have handled trentos was inadequate against old italian battleships however and 37 000 ton battlecruiser concepts were prohibitively expensive and would jeopardize further naval limitation talks these attempts were followed by an intermediate design for a 23 690 ton protected cruiser in 1929 it was armed with guns armored against guns and had a speed of visually it bore a profile strikingly similar to final dunkerque class design german s became new focus for french naval architects in 1929 design had to respect 1930 london naval treaty which limited french to two 23 333 ton ships until 1936 drawing upon previous work french developed a 23 333 ton design armed with 305 mm guns armored against german cruisers guns and with a speed of as with final dunkerque class design main artillery was concentrated entirely forward design was rejected by french parliament in july 1931 and sent back for revision final revision grew to 26 500 tons 305 mm guns were replaced by 50 modele 1931 guns armor was slightly improved and speed slightly decreased parliamentary approval was granted for first member of class in early 1932 and strasbourg was ordered on 16 july 1934 characteristics thumb left inboard profile of dunkerque class strasbourg displaced standard and fully loaded with an overall length of a beam of and a maximum draft of she was powered by four parsons geared steam turbines and six oil fired indret boilers which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of her crew numbered between 1 381 and 1 431 officers and men ship carried a pair of spotter aircraft on fantail and aircraft facilities consisted of a steam catapult and a crane to handle floatplanes she was armed with eight 50 modele 1931 guns arranged in two quadruple gun turrets both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of superstructure her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 45 dual purpose guns these were mounted in three quadruple and two twin turrets quadruple turrets were placed on stern with one on centerline on superstructure and other two on either side on upper deck and twin turrets were located amidships just forward of funnel close range antiaircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight guns in twin mounts and thirty two guns in quadruple mounts ship s belt armor was thick amidships and main battery turrets were protected by 330 mm of armor plate on faces main armored deck was thick and conning tower had thick sides service history prewar service strasbourg was ordered on 16 july 1934 in response to italian s keel for ship was laid down in november 1934 in no 1 slipway of civilian ateliers et chantiers de la loire shipyard in saint nazaire after her launching in december 1936 she was moored along fitting out quay where her armament propulsion system and other equipment were installed strasbourg departed saint nazaire on 15 june 1938 bound for brest france while en route she conducted brief speed tests ship arrived on 16 june and departed again on 21 june to begin official acceptance trials modifications were done from 22 to 30 june followed by more sea trials that continued into august gunnery trials were performed on 24 25 august off island of ushant and ship was formally commissioned on 15 september that day she was drydocked so that her propulsion system could be inspected after trials on 15 december strasbourg went to sea to resume working up for active service including more gunnery testing by this time international situation in europe had begun to worsen as nazi germany began making increasingly hostile demands on its neighbors on 24 april 1939 ship was finally ready for active service joining atlantic fleet with her sister ship two ships were designated 1st battle division ships received identification stripes on their funnels one for dunkerque as division leader and two for strasbourg strasbourg joined dunkerque on 1 may for first time for a cruise to lisbon portugal on 1 may arriving there two days later for a celebration of anniversary of pedro alvares cabral s discovery of brazil ships left lisbon on 4 may and arrived in brest three days later there they met a british squadron of warships that were visiting port at time two dunkerque class ships sortied on 23 may in company with 4th cruiser division and three destroyer divisions for maneuvers held off coast of great britain dunkerque and strasbourg then visited a number of british ports including liverpool from 25 to 30 may oban from 31 may to 4 june staffa on 4 june loch ewe from 5 to 7 june scapa flow on 8 june rosyth from 9 to 14 june before stopping in le havre france from 16 to 20 june ships arrived back in brest next day squadron conducted more training off brittany through july and into early august world war ii thumb left profile view of strasbourg from a us navy warship recognition guide in august as tensions with germany were again heightened this time over territorial demands on poland french and british navies discussed coordination in event of war with germany they agreed that french would be responsible for covering allied shipping south from english channel to gulf of guinea in central africa to protect shipping from german commerce raiders french created force de raid raiding force with strasbourg and dunkerque as its core group which was under command of vice amiral d escadre squadron vice admiral marcel bruno gensoul also included three light cruisers and eight large destroyers and was based in brest british observers informed french navy that german pocket battleships of deutschland class had gone to sea in late august bound for atlantic and that contact with vessels had been lost on 2 september day after germany invaded poland but before france and britain declared war force de raid sortied from brest to guard against a possible attack by deutschlands upon learning that german ships had been spotted in north sea gensoul ordered his ships to return to port after they met french passenger liner in azores force de raid escorted liner back to port and arrived in brest on 6 september by this time german raiders had broken out into atlantic so british and french fleets formed hunter groups to track them down force de raid was split with dunkerque and strasbourg operating individually as force l and force x respectively dunkerque aircraft carrier and three cruisers remained in brest while strasbourg and two french heavy cruisers joined british aircraft carrier based in dakar french west africa strasbourg left brest on 7 october in company with destroyer and a division of torpedo boats meeting hermes off sur mer later that day ships then steamed south to met heavy cruisers off casablanca ultimately arriving in dakar on 14 october ships went on a patrol in central atlantic from 23 to 29 october during which they captured german merchant ship santa fe on 25th another sweep followed from 7 to 13 november to west of cape verde ships found four germans aboard a belgian passenger liner and took them prisoner other warships arrived in dakar on 21 november to relieve strasbourg she left that day along with cruiser and an escort of torpedo boats ordered to return to brest it was feared that german aircraft had dropped naval mines in harbor entrance so ships were temporarily diverted to quiberon bay until a search revealed no mines on 29 november faced with increasingly hostile posturing by italy during spring of 1940 force de raid was dispatched to mers el kebir on 2 april strasbourg dunkerque two cruisers and five destroyers left that afternoon and arrived three days later squadron was quickly ordered to return to brest just a few days later in response to german landings in norway on 9 april force de raid left mers el kebir that day and arrived in brest on 12th with intention that ships would cover convoys to reinforce allied forces fighting in norway but threat of italian intervention continued to weigh on french command which reversed ships orders and transferred them back to mers el kebir on 24 april strasbourg and rest of group left that day and arrived on 27 april they conducted training exercises in western mediterranean from 9 to 10 may but saw little activity for next month on 10 june italy declared war on france and britain two days later strasbourg and dunkerque sortied to intercept reported german and italian ships that were incorrectly reported to be in area french had received faulty intelligence that had indicated that germans would attempt to force a group of battleships through strait of gibraltar to strengthen italian fleet after french fleet got underway reconnaissance aircraft reported spotting an enemy fleet steaming toward gibraltar supposing aircraft to have spotted italian battle fleet steaming to join germans french increased speed to intercept them only to realize that aircraft had in fact located french fleet fleet then returned to port marking end of strasbourgs last wartime operation on 22 june france surrendered to germany following battle of france under terms of armistice strasbourg and dunkerque would remain at mers el kebir mers el kebir thumb strasbourg slips her moorings and makes for open water while under fire from british force h only test in battle for strasbourg came in attack on mers el kebir on 3 july british misinterpreting terms of armistice as providing germans with access to french fleet feared that ships would be seized and pressed into service against them despite assurances from francois darlan chief of naval general staff that if germans attempted to take vessels their crews would scuttle them prime minister winston churchill then convinced war cabinet that fleet must be neutralized or forced to re join war on side of britain british force h commanded by admiral james somerville and centered on battlecruiser and battleships and arrived off mers el kebir to coerce french battleship squadron to join british cause or scuttle their ships french navy refused as complying with demand would have violated armistice signed with germany to ensure ships would not fall into axis hands british warships opened fire at 17 55 strasbourg was tied alongside mole with her stern facing sea so she could not return fire immediately after british started shooting gensoul issued order to get underway and return fire strasbourg at that time commanded by capitaine de vaisseau ship of line captain collinet was first large warship to slip her mooring following four destroyers on their way out of harbor debris from near misses showered ship as she made her way through port some of these fragments dented or punched holes in her hull and burning debris scorched her deck a salvo of shells near missed ship at 18 00 as vessels cleared jetty destroyers steamed first ahead of strasbourg to engage british destroyers off harbor entrance and then arrayed themselves to her port side as ships steamed east heavy smoke in harbor from destroyed battleship which had suffered a magazine explosion masked escape of strasbourg and destroyers and somerville was initially unaware that she had evaded his attack somerville had received a report from a patrolling fairey swordfish pilot that a dunkerque class battleship had left harbor but he refused to believe it as he believed that a field of naval mines that had been laid earlier that morning would have prevented any escape upon clearing harbor british destroyer which had been tasked with watching entrance turned to lay a smoke screen to protect force h from what appeared to be a destroyer attack effect was to help to obscure strasbourg which as she increased speed from let out a large cloud of black smoke french ships steered for a gap in defensive minefield to bring themselves under protection of a battery of coastal guns on cape by this time destroyers and had arrayed themselves ahead of ship while and volta covered her to rear at 18 40 two leading destroyers depth charged british submarine forcing her to take evasive action at 19 00 destroyers and and torpedo boat arrived from oran to help cover her withdrawal thumb map of strasbourgs path from mers el kebir by this time somerville had realized that strasbourg had escaped and turned east in pursuit he launched an air strike from aircraft carrier hoping to slow strasbourg while he steamed ahead with hood two light cruisers and several destroyers first wave of aircraft six bombers carrying bombs attacked at 19 45 all of aircraft missed and two were shot down by heavy anti aircraft fire from strasbourg and destroyers strasbourg was still belching thick black smoke result of damage to one of her air intakes from fragments of jetty problem could only be corrected by shutting down boiler room no 2 this would have reduced her speed to which was not an acceptable solution with hood now in pursuit by 20 25 somerville broke off chase but a second flight from ark royal armed with torpedoes attacked at 20 45 as with first strike all of aircraft missed with night having fallen and hood having disengaged boilers could be turned off thirty crewmen in boiler room were found to have succumbed to heat and fumes five of whom died repairs to intake were effected while still underway and within an hour boilers could be used again collinet was still unsure whether somerville was still pursuing him so rather than head directly for toulon he steered for south of sardinia under strict radio silence to prevent somerville from discovering his intentions collinet waited until strasbourg was some from san pietro island off coast of sardinia at 10 00 on 4 july before turning northwest to toulon ship entered harbor there at 21 10 her crew lined deck and she was greeted with crews from several heavy cruisers in harbor who cheered and played la marseillaise french national anthem forces de haute mer thumb left strasbourg as she appeared in 1942 on 6 july french naval command ordered gensoul to return to toulon he arrived and raised his flag aboard strasbourg later that day repairs to damage incurred during attack was quickly repaired and in august command reorganized fleet prewar units were dissolved between 8 and 12 august during this period gensoul left vessel on 10th strasbourg was assigned to 3rd squadron and on 14 august she was taken into shipyard in toulon to have screens installed to protect anti aircraft gun crews she emerged from yard on 11 september and two weeks later naval command created forces de haute mer high seas forces with strasbourg serving as its flagship under amiral jean de laborde at time fleet also included heavy cruisers algerie and and light cruisers and on 5 november strasbourg and all of cruisers except algerie sortied to receive old battleship which had been damaged during attack on mers el kebir and then repaired provence was escorted by a group of five destroyers and two units met off balearic islands and arrived back in toulon on 8 november next two years passed uneventfully in large part due to restrictions on french naval activities under armistice with germany training operations were limited to two per month and cruisers and destroyers had to alternate between periods of active service and reserve status with skeleton crews strasbourg went into drydock from 15 april to 3 may 1941 for periodic maintenance and in december she steamed to visit marseille for four days ship was drydocked again on 31 january 1942 for a major refit that included installation of radar her anti aircraft battery was also modified work was completed on 25 april and she returned to service on 27th she had to be drydocked for repairs that lasted for five days to her rudder motors in mid july sinking at toulon thumb strasbourg after having been bombed by us army air force bombers on august 18 1944 capsized cruiser is believed to be la following operation torch allied invasion of french north africa on 8 november germany launched case anton in retaliation moving to seize all of so called zone libre part of vichy france that had up to that point remained unoccupied early on 27 november elements of german 7th panzer division approached city with intention of seizing ships of forces de haute mer at 05 30 de laborde issued orders to his ships crews to scuttle their vessels sabotage teams had already been preparing to destroy their ships including stuffing gun barrels with explosives and once order was given teams passed through each ship with sledgehammers smashing equipment that might be salvaged by germans and italians including rangefinders radios and other valuable equipment boiler room personnel lit boilers and shut off water feeds to cause them to overheat and explode germans reached port at 05 50 and issued orders to de laborde to hand over his ships he informed them that they were already sunk strasbourg appeared to be undamaged leading to confusion among german officers but ship s seacocks had been opened and she was in process of sinking to harbor bottom at 06 20 de laborde ordered sabotage team aboard strasbourg to detonate scuttling charges that would destroy ship and prevent her from being simply sealed and re floated italy received control of most of wrecks and they decided to repair as many ships as possible for service with italian fleet but to scrap those that were too badly damaged to quickly return to service italians deemed strasbourg to be a total loss after she was re floated on 17 july they accordingly began to dismantle vessel in port armistice between italy and allies in september 1943 stopped these activities and ship was then seized by germans on 1 april 1944 they handed her back to vichy french authorities her wreck was then towed to bay of where she was placed in a state of conservation she was heavily bombed and sunk by us forces including battleship on 18 august three days after operation dragoon allied invasion of southern france she was raised for second time on 1 october 1944 but found to be beyond repair and used as a testbed for underwater explosions until condemned and renamed on 22 march 1955 to be sold for scrapping on 27 may that year footnotes notes citations references external links maritimequest strasbourg
