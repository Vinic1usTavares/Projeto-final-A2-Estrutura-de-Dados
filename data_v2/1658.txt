landowner and preston member of parliament mp sir peter hesketh fleetwood as a major port and a link for passengers travelling from london to scotland to achieve these ideals a rail link was needed and new town soon heralded arrival of railway to area a line connecting fleetwood with preston was completed in 1840 with poulton as one of stops although fleetwood immediately superseded poulton as a port customs house was quickly moved to fleetwood poulton initially benefited commercially from rail link importation of irish and scottish cattle through fleetwood enabled a fortnightly cattle market to be held in poulton at same time blackpool was developing as a resort and for a few years visitors travelled by rail to poulton and then on to blackpool by horse drawn charabancs or omnibuses a line between poulton and blackpool was completed in 1846 as fleetwood and blackpool s own commercial capabilities developed and kirkham s prominence in linen industry continued to grow poulton s importance
