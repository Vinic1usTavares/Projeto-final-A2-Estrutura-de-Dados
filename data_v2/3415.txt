thumb birds project logo birds 1 is first iteration of a multinational program called joint global multi nation birds satellite project or birds project to help countries build their first satellite japanese kyushu institute of technology kit supported design and fabrication of satellites constellation was launched by a falcon 9 rocket to international space station on june 3 2017 as part of crs 11 where it was released from kibo module into space ghana mongolia nigeria and bangladesh participated in birds 1 program all building identical satellites for constellation background kyushu institute of technology kit in japan supports non spacefaring countries to build their first satellite through a program called joint global multi nation birds satellite project birds five countries participated in first bird program ghana mongolia nigeria and bangladesh birds project logo was designed by ghanaian student ernest matey nigerian government has a background with satellites but had never built one prior to birds 1 sometimes mongolsat 1 is referred to as mongolia s first satellite but it was launched by bermuda based company abs and built by u s company boeing it was co branded as mongolsat 1 after launch birds 1 successfully launched first satellite for bangladesh ghana mongolia and nigeria development and design five countries built identical satellites bangladesh brac onnesha japan toki mongolia mazaalai ghana ghanasat 1 and nigeria nigeria edusat 1 each satellite cost about to manufacture and launch satellites are cubes in 1u cubesat class weighing around each power is generated from solar cells and stored in batteries it carries 0 3 megapixel and 5 megapixel cameras to image earth constellation can also transmit music and other sounds back to earth satellites also contain provisions to measure effects of solar radiation on commercial microprocessors and can measure air density mission launch thumb upright spacex launch of crs 11 with birds 1 onboard alt a white falcon 9 rocket cuts through blue sky with its nine engines producing a bright yellow flame spacex launched constellation on its crs 11 mission to international space station on june 3 2017 birds 1 was carried in a dragon spacecraft on a falcon 9 rocket launched from nasa s kennedy space center pad 39a 100th launch from that pad this was first time spacex had reused one of its dragon capsules satellites were ejected from kibo module of international space station on july 7 on ejection astronaut jack fischer said on twitter another great example of international cooperation today on space station launched 5 micro satellites from 5 countries off jaxa arm constellation orbits earth at an altitude of and at an inclination of 51 61 degrees satellites travel around earth every 91 minutes at a velocity of operations satellites communicate with seven ground stations one in each of countries participating in birds 1 program and one each in thailand and taiwan same radio frequency is used for all of satellites constellation can have music uploaded via a digi singer it is processed on satellite then transmitted to earth with an ultra high frequency uhf antenna as voice fm data ghana intends to use data to help monitor illegal mining and map coastline brac onnesha is imaging vegetation water resources and urbanization purpose of nigeria edusat 1 was more educational in nature it was planned to be a technology demonstrator and to familiarize nigerians with spacecraft design mazaalai intended use was to conduct independent space studies and help mitigate natural disasters future work japan s work with non spacefaring countries continued with birds 2 in 2018 with philippines bhutan and malaysia mongolia plans to launch a second satellite in 2019 ghana plans to build ghanasat 2 and ghanasat 3 with ghanasat 2 focusing on water pollution illegal mining and deforestation references external links official website category space program of japan category jaxa category spacecraft launched in 2017 category category spacecraft launched by falcon rockets category satellites deployed from international space station
