mules had been carrying freshly cut grass to feed mexican horses trapped in bexar this prize gave battle its name although engagement which historian j r edmondson termed a ludicrous affair did not yield valuable plunder it did serve to unite texian army days before army had been bitterly divided and unwilling to risk a prolonged siege or assault with their success at grass fight however texian soldiers began to believe that although outnumbered they could prevail over bexar garrison texians believed that cos must have been desperate to send troops outside of safety of bexar several days
