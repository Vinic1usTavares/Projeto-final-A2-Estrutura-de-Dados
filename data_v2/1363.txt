gnome web called epiphany until 2012 is a free and open source web browser based on webkitgtk developed by gnome for unix like systems it is default web browser of gnome forked from galeon in 2002 it has since been developed as part of gnome core applications gnome web as a component of gnome core applications provide full integration with gnome settings and components like gnome keyring to securely store passwords following gnome human interface guidelines and gnome stack to providing first class support for all new adopted edge technologies such as wayland and latest major gtk versions multimedia support using and small package size 2mb due to using shared components other features include reader mode mouse gestures smart bookmarks web application integration built in ad blocking and google safe browsing naming web was originally named epiphany but was rebranded in 2012 as part of gnome 3 4 name epiphany is still used internally for development such as for bug tracking and in source code package remains epiphany browser in debian based distros to avoid a name collision with a video game that is also called epiphany and epiphany in fedora based distros development history galeon fork marco gritti initiator of galeon originally developed epiphany in 2002 as a fork of galeon fork occurred because of disagreement between gritti and rest of galeon developers about new features while gritti regarded galeon s monolithic design and number of user configurable features as factors limiting galeon s maintainability and usability rest of galeon developers wanted to add more features around same time gnome project adopted a set of human interface guidelines which promoted simplification of user interfaces as galeon was oriented towards power users most developers as a result gritti created a new browser based on galeon with most of non critical features removed he intended epiphany to comply with gnome as such epiphany used global gnome theme and other settings from inception gritti explained his motivations galeon continued after fork but lost momentum due to remaining developers failure to keep up with changes in mozilla platform galeon development stalled and developers decided to work on extensions to bring galeon s advanced features to epiphany epiphany s early philosophy included a commitment to creating a web browser specifically for gnome gritti ended his work on epiphany and a gnome team led by xan lopez christian and jean francois rameau now direct project gritti died of cancer on may 23 2015 gecko based first version of epiphany was released on december 24 2002 epiphany initially used gecko layout engine from mozilla project to display web pages it provided a gnome graphical user interface for gecko instead of mozilla s cross platform interface development of epiphany was mainly focused on usability improvements compared to major browsers at time most notable was new text entry widget which was introduced in version 1 8 new widget supported icons inside text area and reduced screen space needed to present information while improving gnome integration next major milestone was version 2 14 which was first to follow gnome s version numbering it also featured network awareness using networkmanager smart bookmarks improvements and option to build with xulrunner latter was critical previously epiphany could only use an installed mozilla web browser as a web engine provider xulrunner support made it possible to install epiphany as only web browser on system webkit based development process suffered from major problems related to gecko backend to address these issues in july 2007 epiphany team added support for webkit as an alternative rendering engine on team announced that it would remove ability to build it using gecko and proceed using only webkit size of team and complexity of porting browser to webkit caused version 2 22 to be re released with bugfixes alongside gnome 2 24 so releases stagnated until when it was announced that 2 26 would be final gecko based version in september 2009 transition to webkit was completed as part of gnome 2 28 release history release history version date changes

folder based bookmark system web uses categorized bookmarks where a single bookmark such as web can exist in multiple categories such as web browsers gnome and computer software a special category includes bookmarks that have not yet been categorized another innovative concept supported by web though originally from galeon is smart bookmarks these take a single argument specified from address

specific browser single instance of web limited to one domain with off site links opening in a normal browser launcher created this way is accessible from desktop and is not limited to gnome shell for instance it may be used with unity used on ubuntu this feature facilitates integration of desktop and world wide web which is a goal of web s developers similar features can be found in windows version of google chrome for same purpose mozilla foundation previously developed a standalone application mozilla prism which was superseded by project web applications are managed within browser s main instance applications can be deleted from page accessible with a special uri about applications this approach was supposed to be a temporary while a centralized gnome web application management was to be implemented in gnome 3 4 but this never happened firefox sync since gnome 3 26 web has support for firefox sync which allows users to sync their bookmarks history passwords and open tabs with firefox sync which can then be shared between any copy of firefox or web that user signs into firefox sync with extensions web once supported extensions and a package was maintained containing official ones this was later removed due to problems with stability and maintainability some popular extensions such as ad blocking were moved to core application while native helper apps such as

right epiphany 2 26 1 left showing its larger user interface chrome area than in 3 2 0 right in reviewing webkit powered epiphany 2 28 in september 2009 ryan paul of ars technica said epiphany is quite snappy in gnome 2 28 and scores 100 100 on test using webkit will help differentiate epiphany from firefox which is shipped as default browser by most of major linux distributors in reviewing epiphany 2 30 in july 2010 jack wallen described it as efficient but different and noted its problem with crashes when i first started working with epiphany it crashed on most sites i visited after doing a little research and then a little debugging i realized issue was with javascript epiphany in its current release for some strange reason doesn t like javascript only way around this was to disable javascript yes this means a lot of features won t work on a lot of sites but this also means those same sites will load faster and won t be so prone to having issues like crashing my browser wallen concluded positively about browser although epiphany hasn t fully replaced chrome and firefox as my one stop shop browser i now use it much more than i would have previously it has a small footprint fast startup and clean interface in march 2011 veronica henry reviewed epiphany 2 32 saying to be fair this would be a hard sell as a primary desktop browser for most users in fact there isn t even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser but for those instance where you need to fire up a lighting fast browser for quick surfing epiphany will do trick she further noted though i still use firefox as my primary browser lately it seems to run at a snail s pace so one of first things i noticed about epiphany is how quickly it launches and subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast henry criticized epiphany for its short list of extensions singling out lack of firebug as a deficiency web instead supports web inspector offered by webkit engine which has similar functionality in april 2012 ryan paul of ars technica used web as an example to his criticism of gnome 3 4 design decisions aside from poor initial discoverability of panel menu this model works reasonably well for simple applications unfortunately it doesn t scale well in complex applications best example of where this approach can pose difficulties is in gnome s default web browser having application s functionality split across two completely separate menus does not constitute a usability improvement this was addressed in later versions with a single unified menu in an october 2016 review bertel king jr noted on makeuseof later versions offer best integration you will find with gnome shell it lacks add ons found in mainstream browsers but some users will like minimalism speed and tab isolation that prevents one misbehaving site from crashing entire browser in an april 2019 review bertel king jr wrote another article on makeuseof this time reviewing gnome web for its web applications mode he stated when you check your email you re using a web app if you open youtube netflix or spotify in a browser again you re using a web app these days you can replace most of your desktop apps with web apps gnome web provides tools to better integrate web apps with rest of your desktop so you can open them via your app launcher and view them in your dock or taskbar this way they feel more like apps and less like sites he also praised security provided by walling off web applications from rest of browser and each other like mozilla s container feature this helps prevent sites such as facebook from seeing what user is doing in main browser it also allows user to create multiple apps for same site to easily switch between different accounts see also midori
