marsh shrew sorex bendirii also known as pacific water shrew bendire s water shrew bendire s shrew and jesus shrew is largest north american member of genus sorex long tailed shrews primarily covered in dark brown fur it is found near aquatic habitats along pacific coast from southern british columbia to northern california with air trapped in its fur for buoyancy marsh shrews can run for three to five seconds on top of water it measures about in length including a long tail and weighs an average of marsh shrew s diet consists mainly of invertebrates which it hunts on land and in water they are rare their populations are thought to be in decline and they are considered endangered in parts of their range description thumb 180px left marsh shrew skull side view marsh shrew is largest member of genus sorex in north america and mammalogist david described it as an attractive mammal its fur is primarily dark brown and it has a long tail although marsh shrew s fur is usually uniformly dark on its back and abdomen abdominal fur of populations s b albiventer on olympic peninsula may be white marsh shrew is about in length including a long tail and weighs about its hind feet slightly fringed with coarse hairs on toes measure about although in some areas marsh shrew is sympatric with other members of genus sorex no other large velvety gray black shrew shares this geographic range its size distinguishes it from all but american water shrew sorex palustris although marsh shrew and american water shrew two largest shrews in north america share some features american water shrew has more dark grey to black fur on its back a silver grey belly and a bi colored tail and marsh shrew s fringed hairs are more distinct american water shrew has a smaller skull without marsh shrew s characteristic curvature and its upper incisors have less distinct medial tines marsh shrew typically has a longer snout than that of american water shrew which is more streamlined when viewed from side marsh shrew s skull is relatively large and its condylobasal skull length is usually greater than there is a distinctive downward sloping curve along snout rostrum its dental formula is incisors 1 1 unicuspids 5 1 premolars 1 1 molars 3 3 of five upper unicuspids third is distinctly smaller than fourth and they have a pigmented ridge extending to cingulum there is a large medial tine on large upper incisor in anterior pigmented region reddish pigmentation of enamel result of iron deposits is thought to be an adaptation strengthening enamel there are no known fossil remains marsh shrew s karyotype somatic number is 2n 54 and its fundamental number 70 taxonomy and naming it was first described in scientific literature in 1884 by clinton hart merriam with its original name atophyrax bendirii a monotypic taxon at time first specimen was obtained southeast of fort klamath in klamath county oregon at a location from williamson river merriam obtained specimen from charles bendire an ornithologist and army captain stationed at fort klamath shrew was caught in late july or early august by one of dogs in camp and a soldier gave it to bendire merriam named it bendire s shrew atophyrax bendirii in appreciation of bendire s contribution merriam reported that animal represented a new genus atophyrax deriving from greek and meaning anomalous sorex marsh shrew was later reclassified in genus sorex thumb palmer marsh shrew s b palmeri type specimen skull depiction from merriam 1895 marsh shrew and american water shrew sorex share many physical characteristics former is found in a narrower area from northwest coast to lower slopes of inland mountains american water shrew is more widely distributed across western mountains and through subarctic regions of canada and eastern u s species ranges are primarily allopatric although they may overlap sympatry in coastal regions of pacific northwest differences in elevation tend to separate them early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera merriam assigned marsh shrew to atophyrax and jackson 1928 assigned pacific water shrew to a closer dentition based relationship was assigned by findley 1955 with both species assigned to subgenus otisorex findley hypothesized that in early pleistocene ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews sorex cinereus and sorex vagrans respectively diverged during yarmouth interglacial american water shrew and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant shrew ancestors three other sorex species evolved during sangamonian stage dwarf shrew s nanus southeastern shrew sorex and ornate shrew sorex ornatus findley s assignment of marsh shrew and american water shrew to otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies in 2005 findings were published based on mitochondrial dna analysis which better defined nature of relationships between marsh shrews pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies variations in sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial dna were assessed and results of 2005 phylogeny for marsh shrew are shown below in detail subspecies marsh shrew has three subspecies s bendirii albiventer merriam 1895 s bendirii bendirii merriam 1884 s bendirii palmeri merriam 1895 s b albiventer is found on olympic peninsula of washington s b bendirii in cascades and southwestern british columbia and s b palmeri in coastal oregon these specifications have historically been based on fur markings skull shape and dental details of unclear significance and their validity is uncertain distribution and habitat thumb left alt bright green plant with yellow flowers growing from forest floor marsh shrews often live near marshes with western skunk cabbage geographic range of marsh shrew extends from southwest british columbia along western regions of u s states of washington and oregon and through northwestern california to area north of san francisco subspecies s b albiventer is found on olympic peninsula s b palmeri is found from western oregon south of columbia river to extrema northwestern california s b bendirii is found from northern parts of range except for olympic peninsula south along eastern range to remaining range in california in british columbia eastern limits are chilliwack river and agassiz and northern limits are low elevations on north shore of burrard inlet marsh shrews typically live in wetlands such as marshes and their habitat includes extensive forest canopy and ground cover from shrubs logs and debris they may also be found in riparian environments during cold rainy seasons they may travel as much as a kilometer from wet areas to more sheltered habitats these generally include mixed deciduous or coniferous forest with downed logs and surface cover marsh shrews have been collected from near sea level to as high as in cascades they may inhabit forests of red alder bigleaf maple western hemlock or redcedar often near marshes with western skunk cabbage in british columbia marsh shrew is generally found below but it has been collected at in mount seymour provincial park environmental officials in british columbia believe that marsh shrews are one of rarest small mammals in province in 1992 carlos galindo leal and gustavo zuleta trapped 1 000 small mammals at 55 locations in a large area of southwestern british columbia only three were pacific water shrews during spring and summer 1983 biologists in western oregon studied small mammal distribution including marsh shrews near streams and along riparian fringes of coniferous forests riparian fringe was defined as at least 15 20 m from a stream north american deermouse was caught in greater numbers than any other mammal representing around 80 of all captures sixteen species were trapped with marsh shrew representing less than two percent of mammals captured in this study all marsh shrews were trapped at streamside and were found in all three ages of coniferous forests old growth mature and young growth behavior and ecology marsh shrew eats invertebrates including spiders earthworms sowbugs centipedes termites and other terrestrial and aquatic arthropods it was observed in captivity pursuing and killing a goldfish but not eating it in contrast american water shrew has been observed killing and eating fish a study of gastric contents of marsh shrews in oregon indicated that at least 25 of their diet is aquatic including insect larvae slugs and snails mayfly naiads and other unidentified invertebrates other researchers have reported that their diet may also include aquatic insects water beetles and stonefly nymphs ground beetles spiders harvestmen centipedes earthworms slugs and small terrestrial snails marsh shrew swims making short dives in search of food its mobile snout whiskers and lips are used to find and capture underwater prey before eating it returns to land air trapped in its fur provides buoyancy and marsh shrews can run for as long as 3 to 5 seconds along top of water according to mammalogist donald pattie they can scull on surface like whirligig beetles air trapped in its fur gives it a silvery sheen on land its foreleg and opposite hind leg move at same time thumb alt drawings of a slender rodent with a long nose and tail marsh shrew from c hart merriam s original 1884 description it is active throughout year primarily at night gestation is about three weeks and female has a litter of three or four young nests in wild built from shredded bark are in a tunnel or under a log marsh shrews typically live about 18 months and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer since their lifespan is short they apparently breed for only one season although no breeding data exist for british columbia breeding season elsewhere is from late january to late august most young are born in march number of litters a female rears is unknown strong odor associated with marsh shrews in common with other long tailed shrews may be a means of communication similar to other shrews they have poor eyesight if a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment such as along an edge of a raised surface it will run off edge and continue to run after landing on surface below landing in water it dives beneath surface marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans possibly due to their inability to see where edges of surfaces drop in captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food such as a worm although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache or hoard food in wild in captivity they set aside in a corner of cage for later consumption no other food items were set aside in this fashion acarine parasites include and soricis laelapidae androlaelaps fahrenholzi echinonyssus haemogamasus occidentalis and haemogamasus mexicanus amorphacarus amorphacarus soricis protomyobia and protomyobia and pygmephorus horridus and pygmephorus probable predators include owls fish and pacific giant salamander human interaction thumb left upright alt balding middle aged man with beard and a long mustache charles bendire after whom marsh shrew was named before donald pattie s research during late 1960s when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity little was known about their behavior before then most information about marsh shrew was from notes about mammal s habitat and information about trapping it its descriptions in literature were largely derived from examination of museum specimens conservation status marsh shrews are listed as endangered by committee on status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic their habitat in british columbia limited to lower fraser valley their available habitat continues to degrade as a result of economic activity in area with little chance of trend reversing they are rare in that part of canada cosewic designated marsh shrew as threatened from april 1994 until may 2000 updating its status in april 2006 to endangered according to iucn marsh shrews are of least concern in terms of conservation although shrew is considered a rare mammal and its numbers are thought to be in decline no population estimates are currently provided and its rate of decline is not considered fast enough to warrant placing it in a more threatened category suitable wetland habitat is declining due primarily to urbanization and conversion of habitat to agriculture and areas of protected habitat are expected to be provided in shrew s broad geographic
