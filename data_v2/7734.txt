fungus used to make red yeast rice when cultured under carefully controlled conditions chemical analysis soon showed that lovastatin and monacolin k are identical chemical compounds two isolations documentations and patent applications occurred months apart lovastatin became patented prescription drug mevacor red yeast rice went on to become a non prescription dietary supplement in united

lovastatin u s regulatory restrictions us food and drug administration fda position is that red yeast rice products that contain monacolin k are identical to a prescription drug and thus subject to regulation as a drug in 1998 fda initiated action to ban a product containing red yeast rice extract u s district court in utah ruled in favor of allowing product to be sold without restriction this decision was reversed on appeal to u s court of appeals in 2001 in 2007 fda sent warning letters to two dietary supplement companies one was making a monacolin content claim about its ryr product and other was not but fda noted that both products contained monacolins both products were withdrawn in a press release fda is warning consumers to not buy or eat red yeast rice products may contain an unauthorized drug that could be harmful to health rationale for harmful to health was that consumers might not understand that dangers of monacolin containing red yeast rice are same as those of prescription statin drugs a products analysis report from 2010 tested 12 products commercially available in u s and reported that per 600 mg capsule total monacolins content ranged from 0 31 to 11 15 mg a 2017 study tested 28 brands of red yeast rice supplements purchased from u s retailers stating quantity of monacolin k varied from none to prescription strength many of these avoid fda regulation by not having any appreciable monacolin content their labels and websites say no more than fermented according to traditional asian methods or similar to that used in culinary applications labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol lowering if products do not contain lovastatin do not claim to contain lovastatin and do not make a claim to lower cholesterol they are not subject to fda action two reviews confirm that monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range with some containing negligible monacolins clinical evidence amount typically used in clinical trials is 1200 2400 mg day of red yeast rice containing approximately 10 mg total monacolins of which half are monacolin k a meta analysis reported ldl cholesterol lowered by 1 02 mmol l 39 4 mg dl compared to placebo incidence of reported adverse effects ranged from 0 to 5 and was not different from controls a second meta analysis incorporating more recent clinical trials also reported significant lowering of total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol within first review largest and longest duration trial was conducted in china close to 5 000 post heart attack patients were enrolled for an average of 4 5 years to receive either a placebo or a ryr product named xuezhikang xie zhi kang test product was an ethanol extract of red yeast rice with a monacolin k content of 11 6 mg day key results in treated group risk of subsequent heart attacks was reduced by 45 cardio deaths by 31 and all cause deaths by 33 these heart attack and cardiovascular death outcomes appear to be better than what has been reported for prescription statin drugs a 2008 review pointed out that effects of statins in japanese populations occur at lower doses than are needed in western populations and theorized that low amount of monacolins found in xuezhikang product might have been more effectively protective than expected in chinese population for same reason safety safety of red yeast rice products has not been established some commercial supplements have been found to contain high levels of toxin as commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins and rarely declare this content on label defining risk is difficult ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of spiking red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin as evidence one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin k which would occur if drug lovastatin was illegally added rather than expected composition of many monacolin compounds there are reports in literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage from a review potential safety signals of and liver injury raise hypothesis that safety profile of ryr is similar to that of statins continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions european food safety authority efsa panel on food additives and nutrient sources added to food concluded that when red yeast rice preparations contained monacolins panel was unable to identify an intake that it could consider as safe reason given was case study reports of severe adverse reactions to products containing monacolins at amounts as low as 3 mg day red yeast rice is not recommended
