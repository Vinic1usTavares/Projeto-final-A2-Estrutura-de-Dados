to finance creation of alberta government telephones abandoning its usual pay as you go approach boyle predicted that alberta first to undertake a provincial government telephone system will become a model for every province in dominion thomas 53 he also sided with government in its rejection of conservative demands that it build and operate railways as he felt that doing so would not be viable as long as trunk lines were in private hands thomas 60 61 he enthusiastically backed private construction of railways however and greeted announcement of alberta and great waterways railway which was to run northward from edmonton to lac la biche and later fort mcmurray with what historian l g thomas describes as an extravagant eulogy speaking of lac la biche as another lake louise of pullmans running from new orleans to arctic circle and of northern alberta as a second cobalt region thomas 61 alberta and great waterways railway scandal rutherford government was comfortably re elected in 1909 election thomas 69 boyle himself was acclaimed in sturgeon shortly after elections rumours began to spread that all was not well with alberta and great waterways railway a gwr to which government had given loan guarantees and on whose behalf it had sold bonds in london bond market when new legislature convened in february 1910 boyle tabled a list of eleven questions for government about a gwr rutherford minister of railways as well as premier duly answered them in writing thomas 70 71 boyle found these answers unsatisfactory and on february 21 gave notice of a motion to expropriate a gwr s bond money he held that government had raised more money for a gwr than was needed for construction he also alleged that s b woods deputy to attorney general charles wilson cross had removed key components from government s files on a gwr in advance of their having been inspected by boyle and conservative leader r b bennett thomas 72 boyle s resolution rapidly divided liberal members between insurgents led by boyle and william henry cushing who resigned his position as minister of public works over a gwr issue and loyalists led by rutherford and his remaining cabinet ministers especially cross in ensuing debate several charges were levelled against boyle himself agriculture minister duncan marshall accused him of being motivated by his rejection for position of a gwr solicitor boyle admitted applying for position but denied that it had anything to do with his attacks on government thomas 79 80 edmonton bulletin accused him of approaching two liberal members who were also hotel keepers lucien boudreau and robert l shaw and offering them immunity from prosecution for liquor offenses if they helped bring down rutherford s government and replace it with one led by cushing in which boyle would be attorney general thomas 84 though rutherford survived a motion of non confidence moved by ezra riley and seconded by boyle by three votes he was successfully pressured to resign by lieutenant governor of alberta george bulyea it had been expected that cushing would replace rutherford if latter was defeated but bulyea and other prominent liberals did not have confidence in him and instead selected arthur sifton alberta s chief justice thomas 89 minister of crown sifton left all major figures of a gwr affair including boyle out of his first cabinet and instead appointed fellow judge charles r mitchell attorney general thomas 90 91 however in 1912 he decided that enough time had passed for old wounds to heal and re appointed cross as attorney general at same time he brought boyle into his cabinet as minister of education thomas 125 law required that members newly admitted to cabinet resign their seats in legislature and immediately contest a by election boyle was re elected in sturgeon by a safe margin thomas 127 boyle s time as education minister was tumultuous many teachers enlisted to fight in world war i and many others left profession for more lucrative opportunities elsewhere in its members handbook alberta teachers association describes boyle s efforts to remedy this situation as heroic citing in particular his convincing legislature to set a minimum teachers salary of 840 per year another of boyle s tactics to alleviate teacher shortage was to make it easier for teachers qualified in quebec to teach in alberta mahe however this liberalization was subject to applicants english proficiency boyle insisted that all instruction in alberta schools be delivered in english aunger 2005 116 117 a quebecois teacher who passed an english language proficiency exam would be granted a temporary teaching license which could be upgraded to a full alberta teaching certificate with five months study at a normal school boyle s insistence that alberta was english offended not only province s french canadian minority but also its ukrainian speaking population an editorial in a ukrainian newspaper maintained angrily that minister of education lies when he says that alberta is an english province alberta is a canadian province where everyone has equal rights including ukrainians 286 during a by election in whitford boyle accused conservatives of promising ukrainian language schools to court immigrant vote aunger 2004 474 in 1918 new premier charles stewart who had succeeded sifton when latter entered federal politics in 1917 fired cross and appointed boyle attorney general thomas 185 following year boyle introduced legislation formally making english alberta s only official language at time he boasted that in past election my majority came from english electors in contrast to a conservative who supported russian schools for russian people aunger 2004 479 480 as attorney general he also supported unsuccessful legislation to allow imperial oil to construct a pipeline in alberta in response to bipartisan opposition calling for pipelines to be common carriers he said that to adopt such a course would be to tell oil companies that they were free to spend vast sums in exploration work but if oil were found they were not to pipe it out breen 36 one of boyle s chief responsibilities as attorney general was to enforce alberta s recently enacted prohibition this proved difficult as law was widely disparaged not least by judges who reputedly presided over liquor trials while hungover in 1921 boyle estimated that bootleggers were profiting from prohibition to tune of c 7 million he was denounced by supporters of prohibition for his ineffectiveness at enforcing it and by its opponents for to himself powers of a czar thomas 192 193 in 1921 election boyle both sought re election in sturgeon and election in new multi member constituency of edmonton he was defeated in former but victorious in latter making him one of two members from 1st alberta legislative assembly to be elected to 5th other was cross boyle s predecessor as attorney general and rival from alberta and great waterways affair provincially liberals were soundly defeated by united farmers of alberta ufa which contesting their first election won 39 seats to liberals 14 thomas 204 leader of alberta liberals late in stewart s term as premier there had been speculation that he would resign due to ill health and boyle was among candidates mentioned as possible successors thomas 194 when stewart did resign immediately following 1921 election boyle was selected to replace him in assessment of lakeland college historian franklin foster boyle showed vigour in legislature where he presented a strong opposition to new ufa government of herbert greenfield foster 74 even so he showed some private courtesy when john edward brownlee greenfield s attorney general and his strongman in legislature missed a session due to illness boyle assured him that liberals would not attack government too vigorously in his absence foster 107 thumb right boyle in 1935 with his daughter helen and grandson ian as leader of alberta liberals boyle corresponded extensively with liberal party of canada leader and prime minister of canada william lyon mackenzie king according to foster boyle s letters to king were a mixture of useless information and pleas to be rescued by an appointment to bench it is possible that one of his letters had some impact on history however in 1924 while greenfield was attempting to negotiate control of alberta s natural resources from king s federal government boyle sent king a letter warning him that ufa was doomed in next election unless something extraordinary happens that extraordinary thing which greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you natural resources at once foster 114 king drew out negotiations until greenfield returned to alberta empty handed soon after greenfield was forced from office by his own backbenchers and replaced by brownlee foster 116 judicial career and later life in 1924 boyle was appointed to supreme court of alberta and resigned from legislature he was succeeded as liberal leader by another former attorney general charles r mitchell as judge boyle once refused to issue an injunction to end a coal miners strike that had turned violent because he believed that alberta provincial police could contain violence if properly instructed another judge later issued injunction fudge tucker 85 it was also before boyle that statement of claim was filed in macmillan v brownlee case that forced brownlee to resign as premier foster 222 boyle was a member of presbyterian church masonic order and independent order of odd fellows he was still sitting as a judge when he died february 15 1936 on his way to jamaica edmonton neighbourhood of boyle street and village of boyle are named in his honour perhaps ironically latter lies on what
