scheme was introduced in 1984 and was a significant modification of traditional westminster system of government since ruling people s action party had won all parliamentary seats in four general elections since independence prime minister lee kuan yew argued that ncmp scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in parliament according to him this would be beneficial to singapore

were allowed in parliament constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine ncmps in parliament since its inception scheme has been widely criticised it has been considered undemocratic as it allows candidates who do not have mandate of people to air their views in parliament furthermore members of opposition have criticized scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling ruling people s action party pap to argue that electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in parliament despite this critique several opposition politicians have accepted ncmp seats including lee siew choh j b jeyaretnam steve chia and sylvia lim ncmps have raised notable points in parliament

pagar grc and senior advisor to government of singapore investment corporation defended ncmp scheme as important for singapore s development during second reading of ncmp bill prime minister lee kuan yew presented to parliament three main justifications for ncmp scheme first he said that having a minimum number of opposition members in parliament through ncmp scheme would provide younger people s action party pap mps with sparring partners to sharpen their debating skills secondly presence of opposition members in parliament would educate younger generation of voters about role of a constitutional opposition and limits of what it can do he said this was especially important because younger generation who had not lived and witnessed conflicts within parliament in 1950s and 1960s harbour ed myths about role of an opposition and had no idea how destructive an opposition could be thirdly presence of non pap mps in parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety according to lee some non pap mps will ensure that every suspicion every rumour of misconduct will be reported to non pap mps readiness of non pap members to bring forth any allegation of misfeasance or corruption or nepotism would dispel suspicions of cover ups of alleged wrongdoings more importantly ncmp scheme was introduced to ensure representation in parliament of a minimum number of members from a political party or parties not forming government lee speech during second reading of constitution of republic of singapore amendment bill singapore parliamentary

parliamentary debates in april 2010 on increasing number of ncmps from six to nine several mps expressed dissatisfaction with lack of legitimacy and anti democratic nature of ncmp concept for instance pap mp alvin yeo expressed doubts as to whether ncmp scheme had served to raise level of debate in parliament while nmp calvin cheng said see also opposition has from introduction of ncmp scheme decried it as a sham and a toothless office opposition member j b jeyaratnam questioned whether it was a trick or a ploy by ruling party to maintain its dominance in parliament it has been argued that system has placed opposition at a disadvantage at general elections for a number of reasons for one there are restrictions on ncmps as to what they can or cannot vote on in parliament thus it has been suggested that presence of ncmps in parliament does not seem to extend beyond decorative and provision of debating foils for younger pap generation unexposed to gladiatorial quality of parliamentary debate moreover effectiveness of ncmp scheme is limited by perception that ncmp is obliged to be adversarial by virtue of being party to opposition this is so even if privately member can apprehend benefits of a government proposal tey tsun hang p 615 finally ncmp scheme has been criticized as a ploy to discourage voters from voting in opposition mps because of guarantee of at least a number of ncmp seats this inhibits natural growth of an elected opposition voice in parliament as electorate s motivation to vote in an opposition member into parliament is conceivably diluted by assurance that a default mechanism exists for best losers thio post colonial constitutional evolution of singapore legislature p 98 opposition mp low thia khiang has cited an ncmp s lack of muscle and real s grounding as a reason for his refusal to take up an ncmp seat ncmps do not represent any constituency and are thus denied of opportunities to expand their influence during 2010 debates sylvia lim then sole ncmp in parliament commented that having ncmps make s a bad situation better but increasing ncmps is not solution towards a more robust political system see also she identified an ncmp s lack of any official capacity to represent people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of scheme moreover an ncmp has no physical base to organize activities or dialogues with people in her view it would be better for politics in singapore if ncmp scheme was regarded merely as a stop gap measure to deal with lack of alternative voices in parliament as a result of ruling party s alleged abuse of grc system and gerrymandering in 2011 during a live television forum prime minister lee hsien loong refuted claims that ncmps were not a real opposition by stating that pap had introduced and expanded scheme because it acknowledged both desire among singaporeans for alternative voices and need for an opposition to represent diverse views in society he noted that ncmps were free to debate issues in parliament and that scheme provided opposition politicians with an opportunity to establish themselves and strengthen their positions in subsequent general elections list of ncmps taking up seats in

ncmp scheme was introduced as opposition mps j b jeyaretnam of wp and chiam see tong of singapore democratic party were elected to parliament single ncmp seat available was allocated to wp s m d p nair however wp decided that its defeated candidates should not take up ncmp seats jeyaretnam wp s secretary general said that real object behind scheme was to persuade electorate to return pap to all seats in parliament which was antithesis of what parliament is ncmp seat was then allocated to tan chee kien of singapore united front but his party also decided to reject seat this was regarded as a resignation and ncmp seat was thus not filled first ncmp to take up a seat in parliament dr lee siew choh of wp did so following 1988 general election at which chiam see tong was only opposition mp elected wp s lee and francis seow were declared elected as ncmps on 16 december 1988 however on 9 january 1989 speaker of parliament tan soo khoon announced that seow had lost his seat with effect from 17 december 1988 under article 45 of constitution after he was convicted and fined for tax evasion in general election that followed in 1991 a special provision was made for four instead of three ncmp seats but none were offered because four opposition members were successful in their respective electoral divisions in 1997 general election one ncmp seat was offered to and accepted by j b jeyaratnam he was declared elected with effect from 14 january 1997 subsequently with effect from 23 july 2001 jeyaretnam fell into bankruptcy due to an unpaid debt and thus lost his seat in

chia supported a motion by minister for education stating that this house 1 supports new jc junior college curriculum which will better develop thinking communication and other process skills and engage students in greater breadth of learning and 2 endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in jc upper secondary education to cater to different strengths and interests of students he suggested that there should be a focus on creative spontaneity expressing view that education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers managers and instruction takers given that singapore had reached standards of a first world economy singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students to encourage students to ask questions he placed most emphasis on importance of ensuring that focus of education should be character building stating it will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be quitters of our society or that they lack compassion for weak and down or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers or that elites only care about their own self interests chia junior college upper secondary education singapore parliamentary debates official report 27 november 2002 col 1840 in 2003 chia mooted idea that singaporeans should be able to borrow from their own central provident fund cpf savings to tide over periods of financial difficulty his rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own cpf accounts to buy depreciating property and money losing stocks there was no reason why they should not be allowed to do so to pay for bills dr ong hong mp for aljunied grc opposed view stating that it was important and for good of singapore that singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume risks and successes of their investments and be self sufficient with advent of integrated resorts which are casino based vacation resorts in 2005 chia expressed concern in parliament over whether government had systems and institutions in place to lessen their negative impact such as problem gambling and spectre of people gambling away family assets sylvia lim thumb upright workers party member sylvia lim at a rally for

primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond 30 by 2015 that government was planning she noted that in organisation for economic co operation and development countries in 2006 about 37 of each age cohort received a degree level education and that a sizeable number of singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas she also suggested giving fares to disabled individuals who make up 2 of adult population under 60 years lim expressed concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in april enacted as that would allow magistrates to hear what are called first mentions through video conferencing a first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person s arrest singapore constitution art 9 4 now states where a person is arrested and not released he shall without unreasonable delay and in any case within 48 hours excluding time of any necessary journey be produced before a magistrate in person or by way of video conferencing link or other similar technology in accordance with law and shall not be further detained in custody without magistrate s authority prior to 26 april 2010 reference to video conferencing was not present in provision see also s 68 1 no police officer shall detain in custody a person who has been arrested without a warrant for a longer period than under all circumstances of case is reasonable 2 such period shall not exceed 48 hours exclusive of time necessary for journey from place of arrest to magistrate s court she felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that they were allowed to complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by authorities in response deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs wong kan seng assured mps that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly for example during a video conference an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer and will be able to see what is happening in entire courtroom secondly screen that will be used by judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether accused is under duress finally accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to police or to judge when they are later present in court following month during parliamentary debates on major revisions to criminal procedure code enacted as now lim suggested there was a need to improve pre trial disclosure procedures and to ensure that victims of crimes received redress further she expressed concerns over leniency of community based sentencing bill eventually incorporated several of her suggestions in 2011 lim noted that compulsory education act ensures that all children have opportunity to receive an education however she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome furthermore education for children with special needs was not subject to same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had she thus brought to house s attention fact that special needs
